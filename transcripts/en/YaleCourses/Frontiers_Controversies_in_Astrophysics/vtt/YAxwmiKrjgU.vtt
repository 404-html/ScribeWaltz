1
00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.270
Just in time for our last class,

2
00:00:03.271 --> 00:00:07.710
we get this in yesterday's New York Times and all over the rest of the media.

3
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.510
A new planet,

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.320
uh,

5
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:10.901
could be earth.

6
00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:11.250
Like,

7
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:11.491
you know,

8
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:12.810
every time they get a new planet,

9
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:13.650
it's always earth like,

10
00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:15.150
but this one might really be true.

11
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.313
Um,

12
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.371
it's,

13
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:17.730
uh,

14
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.120
found it was found by the standard doppler shift method,

15
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.520
which you guys all remember and,

16
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:23.820
uh,

17
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.280
uh,

18
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.860
turns out to be the lowest mass planet that's been discovered in that particular

19
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:29.520
way.

20
00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.020
And so as a kind of final farewell calculation,

21
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.000
I thought we'd check the New York Times,

22
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.170
his numbers on this,

23
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.810
go back and read the article for yourself.

24
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.430
Uh,

25
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.260
the information given there is that the orbital period is about 13 days.

26
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.413
Uh,

27
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.560
the distance between the planet and its star,

28
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.680
that's a,

29
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.630
the semi major axis is given as 7 million miles.

30
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.161
These are of course,

31
00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:01.990
not the world's best set of unit.

32
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.410
Uh,

33
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.860
the distance to the system is 20 light years.

34
00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:07.000
That's really close.

35
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.300
Somebody quoted in the article is saying,

36
00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:10.511
you know,

37
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:11.440
we could go there.

38
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.130
Uh,

39
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.963
not so much.

40
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.903
Uh,

41
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.033
uh,

42
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.821
and the,

43
00:01:15.821 --> 00:01:16.511
I looked up,

44
00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:20.530
the apparent magnitude of this starch turns out to be about 10.5.

45
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.773
Um,

46
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.950
and so what can we do with,

47
00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.560
with information of this kind?

48
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.020
Uh,

49
00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.320
well let's first put this into some kind of same set of units here.

50
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.890
Uh,

51
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.890
13 days is something,

52
00:01:32.891 --> 00:01:33.311
let's see.

53
00:01:33.311 --> 00:01:38.311
Three days is a three and a half days would be a 1% of a year.

54
00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:42.730
So this is like three times 10 to the minus two of a year,

55
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.013
uh,

56
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.270
7 million miles.

57
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.471
Uh,

58
00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:53.471
that's something like 10 million kilometers and to the seven kilometers,

59
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.740
which is 10 to the 10 meters.

60
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.780
So that's something like seven times 10 to the minus two astronomical units.

61
00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:03.020
And,

62
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.320
and,

63
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.180
and you know right away what to do with that,

64
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.970
or at least you will if you go back in your notes for a few months.

65
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.371
Uh,

66
00:02:08.371 --> 00:02:11.290
this is in good units to use a cube depots,

67
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.960
p squared.

68
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.290
M m then shows up in solar masses.

69
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.420
So let's figure out the mass of this star.

70
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.600
Let's see,

71
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.920
uh,

72
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.920
seven times 10 to the minus two cubed divided by three times 10 to the minus two

73
00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.003
squared.

74
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.350
That'll be the mass and solar masses.

75
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.340
Uh,

76
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.340
seven times seven is 50 times seven is 350 a times 10 to the minus six over 10

77
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:41.120
times 10 to the minus four.

78
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.840
That's 35 times 10 to the minus 2.35,

79
00:02:47.391 --> 00:02:48.350
which is a third.

80
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:50.510
<v 1>Okay?</v>

81
00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.990
<v 0>Okay.</v>

82
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.900
So this star is a third of the mass of the sun,

83
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.300
perfectly respectable mass for a start to be.

84
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.523
Uh,

85
00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.060
and then,

86
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.363
uh,

87
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.001
let's see.

88
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:01.960
Let's do something else.

89
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.153
Uh,

90
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.800
it's 20 light years away.

91
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.663
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

92
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.680
<v 0>20 light years.</v>

93
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.400
Uh,

94
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.680
that's,

95
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.741
uh,

96
00:03:12.741 --> 00:03:14.800
something like six parsecs.

97
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.690
So it's really nearby.

98
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:17.201
Uh,

99
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:18.250
as these things go,

100
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:20.170
not that you would want to take a space ship and,

101
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:20.341
and,

102
00:03:20.341 --> 00:03:21.460
and go there or anything,

103
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:23.350
but it is one of the closer stars.

104
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.790
And then we can do this thing.

105
00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.480
Uh,

106
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.480
we can figure out the absolute magnitude of this star I had written down the

107
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:32.590
apparent magnitude.

108
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.540
So that's dad equation.

109
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.560
Uh,

110
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.071
let's see,

111
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:40.150
five times the log of six tenths.

112
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.510
Let's call that two times three times 10 to the minus one.

113
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.721
Yeah,

114
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:47.920
that's six tenths,

115
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.533
uh,

116
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.220
five.

117
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.090
And then you know,

118
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:52.990
this thing about logs,

119
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:54.850
if you multiply them inside the bracket,

120
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:56.590
you can add them outside the bracket.

121
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.160
So this is log of two plus log of three,

122
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.150
uh,

123
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.840
plus log of 10 to the minus one,

124
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.190
log of 10 to the minus one is minus one and the other two I happened to know the

125
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:10.720
log of two is 0.3.

126
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.020
The log of three is 0.5 minus one.

127
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.120
That's five times minus 0.2 is minus one.

128
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.350
Uh,

129
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.350
and so 10.5 minus the absolute magnitude minus one.

130
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.651
Let's see,

131
00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:27.490
how's this going to work?

132
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.750
This has to go over there.

133
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:29.860
That has to come over here.

134
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.210
Uh,

135
00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.170
absolute magnitude.

136
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.850
11.5.

137
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.800
Now you may remember that the son,

138
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.840
uh,

139
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.020
has a magnitude and absolute magnitude of around five.

140
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:42.610
So this is much,

141
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.320
much fainter than the sun.

142
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.790
That's good because it's less massive than the sun and low mass stars get faint

143
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:49.653
really quickly.

144
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.540
How much fainter when we know how to do that.

145
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:53.320
Right?

146
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.153
Um,

147
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.521
let's see.

148
00:04:57.521 --> 00:04:59.860
That looks in the easiest format.

149
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:00.910
It looks like this,

150
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.280
uh,

151
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.280
m star minus M son is equal to B star over be son.

152
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.553
Uh,

153
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.750
guess a minus sign out in front here.

154
00:05:13.751 --> 00:05:14.584
Yes.

155
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.311
Uh,

156
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:18.340
so that 10 to the minus two fifths,

157
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.880
a 11.5 minus five a which is equal to 10 to the minus two fifths of 6.5.

158
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.211
All right,

159
00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:32.260
what are we gonna do about that?

160
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.430
6.5 over 65 over five is 13.

161
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.220
So this is uh,

162
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.970
10 to the minus a 1.3 times to 2.6.

163
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:48.910
You could work it out,

164
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.661
uh,

165
00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:54.661
and that in turn is equal to remember this is B star over B Sun,

166
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.051
brightness of the star,

167
00:05:59.051 --> 00:06:04.051
of the brightness of the sun that tend to the 0.4 times 10 to the minus three,

168
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.490
three plus minus three plus 0.4 minus 2.6.

169
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.541
Uh,

170
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:12.201
and that's all,

171
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:12.930
I don't know what,

172
00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:13.610
um,

173
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.870
2.5 had a guest a times 10 to the minus three,

174
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.140
a tiny fraction of the brightness of the sun.

175
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.810
Less than 1% as bright as the sun.

176
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.430
And this is the importance of the discovery because it's in a 13 day orbit.

177
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:30.530
It's really quite close to,

178
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.580
uh,

179
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.170
to the star.

180
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.630
We figured out how close it's 7%.

181
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:36.464
The distance,

182
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:37.400
uh,

183
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.590
of the earth to the,

184
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.920
uh,

185
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.710
of the earth to the sun is this planet from its star,

186
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.910
but the stars much,

187
00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.080
much fainter too.

188
00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.120
And so if you do the little calculation,

189
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:49.400
which is quite straight forward to do,

190
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:54.401
we won't do it here of how much energy this planet receives from its star

191
00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:00.220
compared to the amount of energy that the earth receives from the Sun.

192
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.600
You get almost exactly the same answer.

193
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.550
So here is a planet,

194
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.510
uh,

195
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.860
whose surface temperature is likely to be quite similar to that of earth.

196
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.950
Here is a planet where liquid water could exist.

197
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:17.360
Now we don't actually know that much about this planet except for it's math.

198
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:18.980
It's five times the mass of the sun.

199
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.280
Oh,

200
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.611
sorry,

201
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:20.900
five times the mass of the earth.

202
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.620
That could be either a big earth or a small Neptune.

203
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:25.101
Uh,

204
00:07:25.101 --> 00:07:27.740
and those are quite different objects and we don't really know,

205
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:28.520
uh,

206
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.620
what category from that point of view it's in,

207
00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:34.970
it seems unlikely that it would be a big earth because this is a low mass star.

208
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:35.661
It's also,

209
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:36.351
as it turns out,

210
00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:37.820
a low medalists city star,

211
00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.490
so it's got only a third of the stuff of the sun,

212
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:41.030
uh,

213
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:46.030
and it's got less than half the frequency of heavy materials as the sun.

214
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.331
Uh,

215
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:48.164
and so,

216
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.561
uh,

217
00:07:48.561 --> 00:07:52.250
it's hard to imagine it could build up a rocky planet five times bigger than the

218
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:52.670
earth,

219
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.100
but you never know stranger things then that have happened.

220
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.730
Uh,

221
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.301
and,

222
00:07:56.301 --> 00:07:56.960
uh,

223
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.291
uh,

224
00:07:57.291 --> 00:07:59.120
will probably happen again in astronomy.

225
00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:01.430
So you don't know what will happen with this one?

226
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.020
There's rumors going around.

227
00:08:03.021 --> 00:08:06.950
I should say that there are even more entertaining.

228
00:08:06.951 --> 00:08:09.530
Planet's going to be announced in the next few weeks.

229
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:11.990
So keep your eye on the newspapers.

230
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.471
Uh,

231
00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:14.960
there may in fact be more to come.

232
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:15.890
Okay.

233
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:16.671
So that's,

234
00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:17.060
uh,

235
00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.290
the last calculation here and you're just never know when these things will show

236
00:08:21.291 --> 00:08:22.460
up in the newspaper.

237
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:23.270
Okay.

238
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:25.310
What we're going to do on Monday and Tuesday.

239
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.980
We're going to do this a double strength section.

240
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.383
Sorry,

241
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:30.350
Monday and Wednesday.

242
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:30.800
Thank you.

243
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.750
[inaudible] we decided not to do the Tuesday one.

244
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:33.171
Uh,

245
00:08:33.171 --> 00:08:34.940
we've got you guys all sectioned.

246
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:38.150
I think there was an email yesterday which told you what section you're in.

247
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.740
If you're having any problems with that,

248
00:08:39.741 --> 00:08:39.951
you know,

249
00:08:39.951 --> 00:08:41.600
make sure we know about it in advance.

250
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.351
Uh,

251
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:42.950
and uh,

252
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:43.550
later,

253
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.940
uh,

254
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.430
well probably Saturday or so,

255
00:08:46.431 --> 00:08:49.790
I will post a three pages of instructions.

256
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.430
You don't have to read them particularly carefully,

257
00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:56.280
but I would like you to download them and print them and to bring them with you,

258
00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:56.790
uh,

259
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:57.623
to the class.

260
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.320
Uh,

261
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.960
let me take you through the first page of this.

262
00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:02.083
Uh,

263
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.240
here we go.

264
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.590
Cosmology the game.

265
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:05.723
Uh,

266
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.600
and uh,

267
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.780
let me just take you through the sequence of place so you know approximately

268
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:10.614
what will happen.

269
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.340
Uh,

270
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.420
so at the start of the game,

271
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:13.650
everybody gets a role.

272
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.011
Uh,

273
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:19.011
you can be a junior or senior scientist at one of several competing scientific

274
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:23.580
institutions or a member of the Review Committee that decides which projects to

275
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:24.210
do.

276
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.680
Each of the competing institution then proposes a project and a funding request.

277
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:29.130
Uh,

278
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.530
the senior scientist has to present the case.

279
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.041
Uh,

280
00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:34.380
the review committee fan gets to decide.

281
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.510
And so you can't do all of them.

282
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:37.920
You can only do some of them.

283
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:38.371
Uh,

284
00:09:38.371 --> 00:09:41.310
so the review committee decides what projects to approve and they,

285
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:43.560
and they give either partial or full funding,

286
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.610
uh,

287
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.000
and then they report why they have made the decisions.

288
00:09:48.001 --> 00:09:49.380
They make a,

289
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:53.670
and then we tell you what the results of that scientific,

290
00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.060
uh,

291
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.200
exploration is.

292
00:09:55.201 --> 00:09:55.740
So,

293
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:56.011
you know,

294
00:09:56.011 --> 00:10:00.120
you go out and you try and find more supernovae and we tell you that I don't

295
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:01.710
know what happens magically.

296
00:10:01.711 --> 00:10:04.080
All the supernovae have disappeared or they're all way,

297
00:10:04.081 --> 00:10:04.291
way,

298
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:08.670
way too bright or whatever it is that the answer turns out to be a,

299
00:10:08.671 --> 00:10:09.031
and then,

300
00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:09.331
you know,

301
00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:11.760
a little bit more about the universe at that point.

302
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.930
The Review Committee,

303
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:16.410
which is made up of aging pundits all die off.

304
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.100
Uh,

305
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:20.430
the senior scientist are promoted to the room review committee.

306
00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:24.780
The junior scientist are promoted to a senior scientists and the review

307
00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:27.840
committee are reborn as junior scientist or something like that.

308
00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:31.410
And so we sort of cycle through all the roles and you keep going through these

309
00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:34.650
cycles until you figure out what the dark matter and what the dark energy is.

310
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.371
A.

311
00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:36.660
And then at the end,

312
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.780
uh,

313
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:38.311
we will,

314
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:38.670
uh,

315
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:42.270
sort of debrief and decide what the key moment of discovery was.

316
00:10:42.271 --> 00:10:43.140
An award,

317
00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.960
a suitable simulation of the Nobel prize.

318
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.033
Uh,

319
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:49.020
it was m and m's last year.

320
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.480
Uh,

321
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.313
we'll see.

322
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:51.601
Uh,

323
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:53.910
so that's approximately what's going to happen.

324
00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:57.000
And the key thing is what kind of projects can you propose?

325
00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.680
And the other two pages of this handout are going to be a list of potential

326
00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:03.210
projects that you can propose.

327
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:08.010
You can also propose anything else you can think of and we will invent results

328
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:08.844
on the spot,

329
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:09.301
uh,

330
00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:12.240
for any other kinds of projects that get approved as well.

331
00:11:12.241 --> 00:11:16.020
But I figured it would be a good idea for you to have at least a range of

332
00:11:16.021 --> 00:11:19.650
possibilities of things you might consider proposing and why.

333
00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:23.010
So that will be posted on Saturday.

334
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:23.580
Uh,

335
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.870
my experiences that in a,

336
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.640
in a just under two hours,

337
00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:29.480
you can figure out all the secrets of the universe in this particular well,

338
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:29.990
well,

339
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.530
the universe that I designed,

340
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:32.131
which is a,

341
00:11:32.131 --> 00:11:32.760
you know,

342
00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:37.650
not as sophisticated perhaps as the real universe will turn out to be a okay

343
00:11:37.651 --> 00:11:40.140
procedural questions on any of that.

344
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:42.503
<v 2>Yes.</v>

345
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:48.600
<v 0>Who knows,</v>

346
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.470
since I don't know what the actual universities,

347
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.620
it would be a little hard to give you the actual university as an exercise.

348
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:54.340
Uh,

349
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.780
what I have done is I have invented a universe which is consistent with

350
00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:00.190
everything we know now,

351
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.000
uh,

352
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.760
and has many more answers than we know now.

353
00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:04.780
Uh,

354
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:04.991
I,

355
00:12:04.991 --> 00:12:05.620
it would,

356
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.460
I would be very,

357
00:12:06.461 --> 00:12:09.760
very fortunate indeed if that turned out to have anything to do with the real

358
00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:10.271
universe.

359
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:10.860
So,

360
00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.500
uh,

361
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.720
I wish it were true that I have those kinds of powers.

362
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:14.883
<v 3>Uh Huh.</v>

363
00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.660
<v 0>But it's possible.</v>

364
00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.793
That's the key.

365
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:20.643
<v 3>Um,</v>

366
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.180
other questions?

367
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:24.080
<v 0>Okay.</v>

368
00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.560
So,

369
00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:24.830
uh,

370
00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.590
last time we ended on kind of an optimistic note.

371
00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:28.683
Uh,

372
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.920
I had written down this plot,

373
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:36.550
which was a plot of Omega lambed up versus Omega matter going from zero to one

374
00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:39.524
and beyond.

375
00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:41.210
And uh,

376
00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:42.530
I put down,

377
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:43.090
uh,

378
00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:46.130
I showed you the plot of three lines on this plot,

379
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:51.370
which is the lines indicated by different kinds of cosmological observations.

380
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.850
So the supernovae,

381
00:12:52.851 --> 00:12:54.200
which we've talked about a lot,

382
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:55.303
um,

383
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.400
force you to be on a line,

384
00:12:58.401 --> 00:13:00.110
something like that in the plot.

385
00:13:00.111 --> 00:13:02.510
So this is where the supernovae observation,

386
00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.440
uh,

387
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.360
kind of forces you to be.

388
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:06.860
And then the,

389
00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:07.723
um,

390
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:08.571
uh,

391
00:13:08.571 --> 00:13:11.100
observations of the cosmic microwave background force,

392
00:13:11.101 --> 00:13:13.310
the sum of these two quantities to be one.

393
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:17.600
And so you end up with something that looks like that from the cosmic microwave

394
00:13:17.601 --> 00:13:18.434
background.

395
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:23.480
And then by comparing simulations of the growth of cloud,

396
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:23.960
of,

397
00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.510
of clustering to the actual,

398
00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:26.930
uh,

399
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:30.110
clusters of galaxies that we observe in the universe,

400
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:30.530
uh,

401
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.550
there turns out to be a third line and it looks like this.

402
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.020
So this comes from,

403
00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:37.513
<v 3>uh,</v>

404
00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.420
clustering that legible.

405
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:42.300
Yeah,

406
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.133
close enough.

407
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:44.103
Um,

408
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:45.830
<v 0>okay.</v>

409
00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:49.790
And so the great thing about this was if you will recall that there were three

410
00:13:49.791 --> 00:13:54.170
different lines on a two dimensional graph and they all clock cross at the same

411
00:13:54.171 --> 00:13:54.800
point.

412
00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:58.700
And this constitute to test of the theory because it is not necessarily true

413
00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:02.180
that if you put down three lines at random in a two dimensional space that they

414
00:14:02.181 --> 00:14:03.710
will all cross at the same point.

415
00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:08.750
And so the fact that they do makes you think that something about how we

416
00:14:08.751 --> 00:14:12.440
understand what's going on is going pretty much right because,

417
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.310
uh,

418
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:14.760
there's no reason for these things to,

419
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:18.300
to cross it a point we predict that they do because you know,

420
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.020
they're all measuring the same universe but in different ways.

421
00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.650
And so the fact that they do a lend some credence to this whole,

422
00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:25.360
uh,

423
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:27.170
a wonderful set of stories.

424
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.830
But there's another way of looking at this plot,

425
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.770
which is to look at what these axes are.

426
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:36.410
What are we actually plotted on this plot?

427
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:41.590
This Omega that shows up is the ratio of the density of something to the

428
00:14:42.831 --> 00:14:44.540
critical density of the universe.

429
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:45.830
So this is,

430
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.330
this access is effectively the density of the dark matter.

431
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:54.650
And this axis here is the density of the dark energy.

432
00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.790
So what we are plotting in this wonderful plot where everything works out so

433
00:14:58.791 --> 00:15:03.380
nicely is the density of something we don't know anything about versus the

434
00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:06.170
density of some other thing that we don't know anything about.

435
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:06.771
Uh,

436
00:15:06.771 --> 00:15:08.510
and so in a certain sense,

437
00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:10.310
the fact that we're working,

438
00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.380
regardless of where the lines are,

439
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:16.580
the fact that we've got these two axes means we don't have any idea what's going

440
00:15:16.581 --> 00:15:17.390
on.

441
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:17.631
Uh,

442
00:15:17.631 --> 00:15:18.464
so that,

443
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:18.950
uh,

444
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:21.590
perhaps the more pessimistic view,

445
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.753
uh,

446
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:23.840
and uh,

447
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:25.370
uh,

448
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.203
you know,

449
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.890
thinking about this,

450
00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.700
you get a kind of faint odor of epicycles.

451
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:37.150
Remember epicycles epicycles I talked about in the very first class if very

452
00:15:37.311 --> 00:15:38.660
first lecture of this class,

453
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.920
this was this business,

454
00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:40.310
uh,

455
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.820
back in the Middle Ages where they thought the earth was still the center of the

456
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.080
universe and they were trying to figure out what was going on with the orbits of

457
00:15:48.081 --> 00:15:48.914
the planets.

458
00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:49.550
Uh,

459
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:54.550
and they discovered that a single circle for each planet didn't do the job.

460
00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:56.780
It didn't Conchord with what,

461
00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.141
uh,

462
00:15:57.141 --> 00:15:58.400
what the observations were.

463
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:58.971
So they said,

464
00:15:58.971 --> 00:15:59.331
all right,

465
00:15:59.331 --> 00:15:59.571
well,

466
00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:00.000
you know,

467
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.520
you know,

468
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.240
the center of the universe and we know everything has to be circle.

469
00:16:03.241 --> 00:16:05.270
So we'll put circles on top of circles.

470
00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:08.210
And then they were able to match the observations,

471
00:16:08.211 --> 00:16:12.140
but then the observations got better and they had to have ever more complicated,

472
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:12.770
uh,

473
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:14.750
circles on top of circles.

474
00:16:14.751 --> 00:16:15.380
So,

475
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.213
uh,

476
00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:18.830
let me,

477
00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.280
so that was the story of epicycles back in the Middle Ages.

478
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.550
And then of course what it turned out is that the idea that the earth was the

479
00:16:25.551 --> 00:16:28.310
center of the universe in the idea that everything goes in circles of just

480
00:16:28.311 --> 00:16:29.060
wrong.

481
00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.960
And as soon as you abandoned those two ideas and have the idea that the planet

482
00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.930
to go in ellipses around the sun,

483
00:16:36.050 --> 00:16:37.970
all of a sudden everything gets much simpler.

484
00:16:37.971 --> 00:16:40.790
And it's all explained well.

485
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:42.920
So what's happening in cosmology now?

486
00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:47.960
We're observing the motions of galaxies and objects within galaxies like

487
00:16:47.961 --> 00:16:49.340
supernovae that we can see.

488
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:53.360
The first thing we found out is that the rotation of galaxies and other

489
00:16:53.361 --> 00:16:55.280
indicators of matter don't,

490
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:55.600
are,

491
00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.050
aren't in accord with what we expect.

492
00:16:57.051 --> 00:17:02.051
So we invent dark matter to explain the internal motions of galaxies and galaxy

493
00:17:02.481 --> 00:17:03.260
clusters.

494
00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:05.460
We then discover that the external motion,

495
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.520
the motion of these things through the universe,

496
00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:07.880
uh,

497
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.360
also doesn't accord with what we would have expected.

498
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.390
So we invent dark energy in order to explain that.

499
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.910
So we've now in the past 25 years,

500
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:21.770
invented to complete two different but completely imaginary,

501
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:22.720
uh,

502
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.160
um,

503
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:23.420
uh,

504
00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.410
as far as we know,

505
00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:25.640
uh,

506
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.990
concepts to fill,

507
00:17:26.991 --> 00:17:29.060
96% of the universe with,

508
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.170
to uh,

509
00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:30.980
figure out,

510
00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:31.281
uh,

511
00:17:31.281 --> 00:17:33.980
what's going on with the fact that the motions we observe her,

512
00:17:33.981 --> 00:17:35.450
not the emotions we expect.

513
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.270
How many more,

514
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.350
you know,

515
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.090
let's go out and measure some more things,

516
00:17:41.091 --> 00:17:42.350
then maybe we'll need dark,

517
00:17:42.351 --> 00:17:43.190
something else,

518
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:43.701
uh,

519
00:17:43.701 --> 00:17:44.211
and dark,

520
00:17:44.211 --> 00:17:45.650
something else after that.

521
00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:46.040
Uh,

522
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:51.040
and maybe it needs to change with time and maybe it needs to magically appear

523
00:17:51.181 --> 00:17:53.850
halfway through the history of the universe or something like that.

524
00:17:53.851 --> 00:17:54.684
Who knows?

525
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:55.140
You know,

526
00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.790
if you keep infant tick these things,

527
00:17:56.791 --> 00:17:59.810
of course you can explain anything you like Justin,

528
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.110
exactly the same way that if you have enough epicycles you can have a model with

529
00:18:04.111 --> 00:18:06.990
the earth at the center of the universe that explains all the motions of the

530
00:18:06.991 --> 00:18:07.410
planets.

531
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:07.980
You see.

532
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:08.191
You know,

533
00:18:08.191 --> 00:18:11.220
if you get to just keep inventing words here,

534
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:11.580
uh,

535
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.370
of course you can explain the universe and you know,

536
00:18:14.371 --> 00:18:17.160
what would have happened if this line didn't come across.

537
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.780
Supposing that line had been out there,

538
00:18:18.781 --> 00:18:19.710
what would you have done,

539
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:20.910
what you would have said as well.

540
00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:22.650
Of course we don't understand dark energy.

541
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:27.651
So we've just proved that dark energy varies with time or varies spatially or

542
00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:29.693
uh,

543
00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:34.080
becomes opaque at large distances or some other quantity quality.

544
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:38.790
And then we would have rewritten this graph so that they do cross a,

545
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.410
that's not very compelling.

546
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:41.610
Um,

547
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.480
and indeed,

548
00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:42.930
uh,

549
00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:47.910
it has gotten sufficiently embarrassing that there is now just beginning to be a

550
00:18:47.911 --> 00:18:51.840
feeling that maybe what's going on is we need new laws of physics.

551
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.360
Maybe we're at a moment,

552
00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:59.250
like the end of the 16th century or the end of the 19th century where the

553
00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:01.940
current basic ideas that we base our,

554
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.360
our,

555
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:04.050
our theories of the universe are,

556
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.440
are about to be a radically transformed.

557
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:08.370
That's possible.

558
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.980
It's also possible,

559
00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:10.351
you know,

560
00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:13.410
that we'll wake up three years from now and seeing the newspaper that someone

561
00:19:13.411 --> 00:19:17.070
has discovered what the dark matter is and that three years after that we will

562
00:19:17.071 --> 00:19:18.690
wake up and read in the newspaper.

563
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.260
Uh,

564
00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:23.220
that some scientists have developed a good string theory that entirely predict

565
00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:25.200
exactly how the dark energy is going to behave.

566
00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.360
I think in general,

567
00:19:27.361 --> 00:19:31.650
it's always a good idea to bet on standard physics,

568
00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:32.191
uh,

569
00:19:32.191 --> 00:19:34.560
rather than revolutionary new ideas.

570
00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.580
But if you keep at it for a quarter of a century as we have in looking for the

571
00:19:38.581 --> 00:19:40.710
dark matter and keep finding nothing,

572
00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:41.160
uh,

573
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.690
you got to start to wonder.

574
00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.261
Uh,

575
00:19:43.261 --> 00:19:44.550
and indeed there was,

576
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:44.830
uh,

577
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:45.290
a,

578
00:19:45.290 --> 00:19:50.290
a radical theory proposed a few years back about the dark matter in particular

579
00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:52.170
that there is no dark matter.

580
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:54.330
It's just we don't understand the laws of gravity.

581
00:19:54.331 --> 00:19:54.840
And so,

582
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.021
you know,

583
00:19:55.021 --> 00:19:59.190
we had to modify the laws of gravity for very high gravitational fields that

584
00:19:59.191 --> 00:20:00.420
turned out to be relativity.

585
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:04.440
And they suggested that you also need to modify the laws of gravity for very low

586
00:20:04.441 --> 00:20:05.580
gravitational fields,

587
00:20:05.581 --> 00:20:08.610
the kinds of things you feel at the edge of the galaxy from the galaxy.

588
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:09.151
Uh,

589
00:20:09.151 --> 00:20:13.320
and they figured out how you would have to do that in order to explain,

590
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:14.460
uh,

591
00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.460
the orbits of galaxies without using any dark matter.

592
00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:21.960
This was called Mond for a modified Newtonian dynamics.

593
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.770
Uh,

594
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:24.200
and I don't think that party,

595
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:27.300
it's become clear that that particular theory probably isn't going to go

596
00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:28.770
anywhere for various reasons.

597
00:20:28.771 --> 00:20:30.390
It doesn't seem to be self consistent.

598
00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.910
But nevertheless,

599
00:20:32.911 --> 00:20:34.230
this was seriously proposed.

600
00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:34.921
It was also,

601
00:20:34.921 --> 00:20:38.160
I have to say a little philosophically dubious because if you want a new theory

602
00:20:38.161 --> 00:20:38.611
of gravity,

603
00:20:38.611 --> 00:20:41.610
you don't want to go back to Newton and start over again.

604
00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.550
You probably want to start with relativity and move on.

605
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:45.031
Uh,

606
00:20:45.031 --> 00:20:47.250
but they made it consistent with relativity.

607
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.280
They worked out all the,

608
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:49.031
uh,

609
00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:50.890
all the stuff and it seemed to work okay.

610
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:53.530
Except it turns out it disagrees with observations also.

611
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:54.520
Um,

612
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.100
but it was a real attempt to,

613
00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:57.700
uh,

614
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.180
imagine that these things might really turn out to be epicycles.

615
00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:01.810
And if,

616
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:05.170
if there isn't progress in finding out what's going on,

617
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.880
I think we're gonna see more of that,

618
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:07.510
uh,

619
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:08.980
as time goes on.

620
00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:09.730
Uh,

621
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:10.690
and uh,

622
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.390
it may be than in 50 years.

623
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:17.080
These things will look like a,

624
00:21:17.081 --> 00:21:21.370
what we think about people who thought that the earth was the center of the

625
00:21:21.371 --> 00:21:22.204
universe.

626
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.823
So we'll see.

627
00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:29.610
Now there is one additional thing that we know about the universe.

628
00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:30.550
Uh,

629
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:31.460
in addition to,

630
00:21:31.461 --> 00:21:31.751
you know,

631
00:21:31.751 --> 00:21:32.890
these three lines,

632
00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:35.160
which are kind of the basic information that we,

633
00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:37.420
we currently have.

634
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.020
Uh,

635
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:38.980
and that is,

636
00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.860
so here's another fact about the universe.

637
00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.881
Uh,

638
00:21:43.881 --> 00:21:45.330
kind of an obvious one.

639
00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:45.841
Uh,

640
00:21:45.841 --> 00:21:47.460
the fact is that we exist,

641
00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:51.640
otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation.

642
00:21:51.641 --> 00:21:52.390
Right?

643
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.080
Uh,

644
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:53.770
and,

645
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:53.981
uh,

646
00:21:53.981 --> 00:21:55.670
what does that tell you about the universe?

647
00:21:55.671 --> 00:21:56.530
It tells you,

648
00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:56.870
uh,

649
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:58.480
the fact that life exists,

650
00:21:58.481 --> 00:21:59.440
and in particular,

651
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.070
uh,

652
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:04.630
what we grandiosely refer to as intelligent life exist.

653
00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:05.770
Um,

654
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:06.730
let's see.

655
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:07.563
Uh,

656
00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.051
what does,

657
00:22:08.051 --> 00:22:12.550
what do you require the universe to have if life is going to exist?

658
00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:14.290
It needs a couple of things even,

659
00:22:14.291 --> 00:22:14.591
you know,

660
00:22:14.591 --> 00:22:17.950
and we can get into a whole argument about life as we know it and whether you

661
00:22:17.951 --> 00:22:20.710
can make it out of silicon instead of out of carbon or whether you're going to

662
00:22:20.711 --> 00:22:24.550
have life made entirely out of neutrons on the surface of a neutron star or

663
00:22:24.551 --> 00:22:25.384
something like that.

664
00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:26.350
Uh,

665
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:27.190
but uh,

666
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:29.620
no matter how you slice it,

667
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:32.020
it's got to have some complexity to it.

668
00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:33.460
Uh,

669
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.010
you've got to have a lot of moving parts.

670
00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.300
One way or another.

671
00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.120
You have to have information flowing back and forth.

672
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.560
You can't make a,

673
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:45.640
a living creature out of nothing but helium atoms.

674
00:22:45.641 --> 00:22:46.900
Helium you may remember from,

675
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.753
from chemistry,

676
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:48.370
isn't,

677
00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:49.540
is a noble gas.

678
00:22:49.541 --> 00:22:50.500
It doesn't interact.

679
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.180
It can't form structures.

680
00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:53.110
Uh,

681
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:54.720
and if you had nothing but helium,

682
00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:58.500
there would certainly be no life because they're just be a bunch of helium atoms

683
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:59.830
that don't interact with each other.

684
00:22:59.831 --> 00:23:02.770
If you made the universe entirely out of Wimps,

685
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.580
weakly interacting massive particles that just kind of fly past each other and

686
00:23:06.581 --> 00:23:07.990
don't pay any attention to each other,

687
00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:09.790
you're not gonna have anything,

688
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:10.210
uh,

689
00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.950
like life because there's no complexity.

690
00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:16.690
It probably also need some time to evolve.

691
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:18.550
Uh,

692
00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.110
it took a while,

693
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:20.441
a,

694
00:23:20.441 --> 00:23:21.071
if you start,

695
00:23:21.071 --> 00:23:21.251
you know,

696
00:23:21.251 --> 00:23:25.030
there's this wonderful experiment where you take a whole bunch of stuff that was

697
00:23:25.031 --> 00:23:27.760
supposed to be in the oceans of the early Earth,

698
00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.361
uh,

699
00:23:28.361 --> 00:23:31.660
and you put it in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide and you keep sending

700
00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:35.020
electricity through a m simulating lightning strikes.

701
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.090
If you keep at that for long enough,

702
00:23:37.091 --> 00:23:37.924
you can make,

703
00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.250
you can make things that,

704
00:23:39.251 --> 00:23:39.461
uh,

705
00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:41.770
that seemed like some of the simpler amino acids.

706
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:42.160
Uh,

707
00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.350
so you just keep flashing lightening at the,

708
00:23:44.351 --> 00:23:48.140
at the ocean and you hope that you eventually you build up life of life.

709
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:48.921
Maybe yes,

710
00:23:48.921 --> 00:23:49.401
maybe no,

711
00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:51.560
but certainly it takes a long time.

712
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.190
And once you have somehow magically out of this process,

713
00:23:55.191 --> 00:23:57.860
self replicating viruses or something like that,

714
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.060
then you got to stick around for a few billion years while evolution takes hold.

715
00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.910
And makes bigger and bigger and more and more complex structures.

716
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.280
So you have to have a certain amount of time to,

717
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.110
to allow this process to go forward.

718
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:11.180
Uh,

719
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:11.900
so,

720
00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:12.733
uh,

721
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:15.020
for example,

722
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:18.950
supposing it were true that Omega Lambda,

723
00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.930
that's the density of the dark matter of the dark energy was great.

724
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.240
Instead of being around 0.7 was greater than a hundred.

725
00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:30.290
So the whole universe is being pushed apart by this stuff and there's hundreds

726
00:24:30.291 --> 00:24:32.660
of times more of it than there is in the current universe.

727
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.820
You're not going to form any structure.

728
00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.340
We looked at the formation of structure last time.

729
00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.520
You just push the universe apart really fast and you never get galaxies or stars

730
00:24:45.801 --> 00:24:49.670
or anything like that because there's too much dark energy to let them congeal.

731
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:50.990
Uh,

732
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:52.340
so push universal part,

733
00:24:52.341 --> 00:24:53.300
no structure.

734
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:58.070
So that would be a university that's very unlikely to have any kind of

735
00:24:58.071 --> 00:25:01.430
complexity or in any kind of life because you just take all these individual

736
00:25:01.431 --> 00:25:03.410
particles and push them far away from each other.

737
00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:04.610
Uh,

738
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:09.610
supposing it were true that the density of matter is significantly less than 10

739
00:25:10.551 --> 00:25:11.510
to the minus two.

740
00:25:11.511 --> 00:25:13.370
So instead of having a third,

741
00:25:13.371 --> 00:25:14.480
the critical density,

742
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.330
it has less than 1% of the critical density,

743
00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.060
then you've got nothing to form the structures with.

744
00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.931
Uh,

745
00:25:20.931 --> 00:25:25.931
and so the same thing happens also no structure.

746
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:28.753
Uh,

747
00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.500
on the other hand,

748
00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:31.250
if the,

749
00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:31.480
uh,

750
00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:32.180
uh,

751
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:32.780
if the,

752
00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.340
if the matter density is,

753
00:25:34.341 --> 00:25:38.750
is way up about in the thousands or the millions in this kind of scale,

754
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.600
then everything collapses right away back into a black hole.

755
00:25:41.601 --> 00:25:42.051
And again,

756
00:25:42.051 --> 00:25:44.120
there isn't a lot of structure in a black hole.

757
00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.290
It's one single point in the,

758
00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:47.561
in,

759
00:25:47.561 --> 00:25:49.160
in the center of the event horizon.

760
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.060
So,

761
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:50.450
uh,

762
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.240
we have no way of knowing what these numbers should be.

763
00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:58.130
But what we do know is that we are fortunate that they adapted to be in the a

764
00:25:58.131 --> 00:26:00.620
relatively narrow range because if they weren't,

765
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:01.760
we wouldn't exist.

766
00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:03.110
Uh,

767
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:07.040
this turns out to be true of most of the constants of nature.

768
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:08.360
Uh,

769
00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.193
for example,

770
00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.820
here's another example.

771
00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:12.140
The Schwartz Shield radius.

772
00:26:12.141 --> 00:26:15.470
Remember the Schwartz showed radius the event horizon of black hole,

773
00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:15.981
uh,

774
00:26:15.981 --> 00:26:18.500
given by two g m oversee square.

775
00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:24.380
Now supposing you lived in a universe in which Ge,

776
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:28.940
the constant of gravity was substantially bigger than it is in our universe.

777
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:33.590
If Ge were bigger and supposing you in that same universe,

778
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:34.970
see the speed of light,

779
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.110
we're a good deal smaller than it is in our universe.

780
00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:39.500
Uh,

781
00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.251
just some other,

782
00:26:40.251 --> 00:26:43.070
pick some other values out of a hat such that this is true.

783
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:48.380
Then the Schwartz showed radius associated with any given mass would be bigger

784
00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.890
because both g is bigger,

785
00:26:51.891 --> 00:26:52.760
C is bigger.

786
00:26:52.761 --> 00:26:53.990
And then for the same amount of mass,

787
00:26:53.991 --> 00:26:55.730
you get a big swatch of radius.

788
00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.770
So now think about what happens if the Schwartz Shield radius is bigger than the

789
00:27:00.771 --> 00:27:02.570
radius of a white dwarf.

790
00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.710
Then you never get white dwarfs are neutron stars.

791
00:27:08.711 --> 00:27:12.070
You'd go see all stars evolve when they run out of nuclear fuel.

792
00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.750
Straight into black holes,

793
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:16.360
then all stars.

794
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.370
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

795
00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.740
<v 0>and as black holes.</v>

796
00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:26.130
And the consequence of that is that the carbon that is made in stars is never

797
00:27:26.131 --> 00:27:30.820
just into the universe and you never end up with planets because the next

798
00:27:30.821 --> 00:27:33.910
generation of stars is still made out of pure hydrogen.

799
00:27:33.911 --> 00:27:34.630
And helium,

800
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:36.940
just like the first generation of stars was.

801
00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:41.050
And you never end up with enough heavy element with any heavy elements.

802
00:27:41.051 --> 00:27:43.000
And so you can't form planet,

803
00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:48.240
so no carbon or anything other than hydrogen and helium,

804
00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:55.000
uh,

805
00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.980
and you're not going to make life out of,

806
00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:58.750
out of hydrogen gas and helium.

807
00:27:59.200 --> 00:27:59.531
Uh,

808
00:27:59.531 --> 00:28:00.070
now,

809
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.251
uh,

810
00:28:00.251 --> 00:28:00.671
carbon,

811
00:28:00.671 --> 00:28:02.620
of course with this fabulous substance,

812
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.100
uh,

813
00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.380
does all this wonderful chemistry at forms,

814
00:28:05.381 --> 00:28:06.214
rings,

815
00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:07.600
does all this great stuff.

816
00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.730
That's why organic chemistry,

817
00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.840
which is the chemistry of carbon is more complicated than the whole rest of all

818
00:28:13.841 --> 00:28:14.860
the other elements,

819
00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:17.230
chemistry of all the other elements put together.

820
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:18.250
Uh,

821
00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:21.310
and so the properties of carbon are very,

822
00:28:21.311 --> 00:28:24.460
very important for allowing complex structures to exist.

823
00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:25.330
Uh,

824
00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:26.860
so properties of carbon.

825
00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:30.370
And it turns out that if you very,

826
00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:31.991
uh,

827
00:28:31.991 --> 00:28:32.824
would,

828
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:34.063
uh,

829
00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:39.150
disappear or not be able to support these complex chains and,

830
00:28:39.241 --> 00:28:41.920
and complex carbon chemistry with disappear,

831
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:42.670
if,

832
00:28:42.670 --> 00:28:43.260
uh,

833
00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:43.570
uh,

834
00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:47.230
the constants of nature and in particular something called the fine structure

835
00:28:47.231 --> 00:28:48.064
constant,

836
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:51.010
uh,

837
00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:52.870
was even slightly different.

838
00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:59.050
It also turns out you couldn't make the carbon in the first place because

839
00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:00.400
there's a property of,

840
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:01.330
uh,

841
00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:05.110
the way the energy levels work in an atom that allows,

842
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.590
uh,

843
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:10.590
the reaction of three helium atoms to fuse into a carbon atom atom to occur fast

844
00:29:11.201 --> 00:29:12.310
enough for the act that,

845
00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:12.881
uh,

846
00:29:12.881 --> 00:29:15.900
that reaction to actually take place in by substantial amounts.

847
00:29:15.901 --> 00:29:19.480
So it wouldn't take much messing around with,

848
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:20.500
uh,

849
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.870
with the constants of nature to make,

850
00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:23.853
um,

851
00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:28.450
to make carbon either not exist or have different kinds of properties.

852
00:29:28.451 --> 00:29:28.930
You know,

853
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.510
if carbon turns out to be just like iron,

854
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.910
uh,

855
00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.460
and it just kind of sits there,

856
00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:33.790
uh,

857
00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:37.300
you're again going to have some trouble creating any kind of complex life.

858
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:39.070
Uh,

859
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:44.070
so we have this odd situation in which it appears that drastic,

860
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.700
really quite drastic fine tuning,

861
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.133
<v 3>uh,</v>

862
00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:53.580
<v 0>of natural Constance</v>

863
00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.640
is a prerequisite for life.

864
00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.210
So not any set of constants will do.

865
00:30:05.211 --> 00:30:05.870
In fact,

866
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:08.990
if you picked a random bunch of numbers for all these constant,

867
00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:12.980
almost certainly that would be a universe with no complexity in it at all.

868
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:19.550
And this gives rise to a set of ideas called a general leaving anthropic

869
00:30:19.551 --> 00:30:20.384
principle,

870
00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:27.630
which is kind of the idea that,

871
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:28.560
uh,

872
00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:33.060
the fact that life exists and people in particular

873
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.320
is important

874
00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.160
for understanding physics,

875
00:30:40.161 --> 00:30:41.930
for understanding basic physics.

876
00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:54.170
And the way I've just stated that,

877
00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:54.501
you know,

878
00:30:54.501 --> 00:30:55.730
that seems kind of obvious,

879
00:30:55.731 --> 00:30:56.260
right?

880
00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:56.501
Uh,

881
00:30:56.501 --> 00:31:00.350
of course it has to be true that the universe is such that we can exist because

882
00:31:00.351 --> 00:31:03.170
we know we exist and we're the ones who were studying the universe.

883
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:03.681
Uh,

884
00:31:03.681 --> 00:31:04.380
and so,

885
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:04.910
uh,

886
00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:05.900
just in that form,

887
00:31:05.901 --> 00:31:07.580
it's not very interesting,

888
00:31:07.581 --> 00:31:10.130
but the implications of it lead you,

889
00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.640
uh,

890
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:14.660
in a wide variety of different philosophical,

891
00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.170
uh,

892
00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:15.841
direction.

893
00:31:15.841 --> 00:31:16.490
So,

894
00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.323
uh,

895
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:19.310
the question is why

896
00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:25.360
do all these constants GVC lambda,

897
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:26.263
what have you,

898
00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:26.871
uh,

899
00:31:26.871 --> 00:31:28.310
have the values they do?

900
00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:34.760
Okay.

901
00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.380
So,

902
00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:35.800
uh,

903
00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.520
as I said,

904
00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:41.360
there are a wide variety of different kinds of categories of answers to this.

905
00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:44.330
One is that it's just a big accident,

906
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.590
you know,

907
00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:47.071
uh,

908
00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:49.140
whatever it was that set these numbers,

909
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:49.561
uh,

910
00:31:49.561 --> 00:31:52.980
happened to pick a set of numbers that allows life to exist.

911
00:31:52.981 --> 00:31:55.560
And there's nothing to talk about because it's just a complete accident.

912
00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.131
Uh,

913
00:31:56.131 --> 00:31:58.860
and it could just have easily have picked out some other numbers.

914
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.530
And,

915
00:31:59.530 --> 00:31:59.850
uh,

916
00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:00.240
uh,

917
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.950
even though most sets of numbers don't allow for the existence of life,

918
00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:07.770
the one that is the set of numbers that were somehow determined,

919
00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:08.760
uh,

920
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.450
by whatever mechanism determined them just kind of by accident,

921
00:32:12.451 --> 00:32:15.240
produced a set of numbers that allows complexity to exist,

922
00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:17.400
not very satisfying,

923
00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:18.061
uh,

924
00:32:18.061 --> 00:32:18.830
approach,

925
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.990
uh,

926
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.070
because among other things,

927
00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:21.480
if that's true,

928
00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.820
you're thinking stops dead right at that point.

929
00:32:23.821 --> 00:32:25.650
If you can attribute everything to accident,

930
00:32:25.651 --> 00:32:26.160
you know,

931
00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.330
you just go on with your life.

932
00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:28.493
Um,

933
00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:33.870
another sort of the opposite of this is to say it happened on purpose,

934
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:35.323
<v 3>uh,</v>

935
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:41.630
<v 0>life created if you want to use that or the constants of nature that allow life</v>

936
00:32:41.631 --> 00:32:44.360
to exist are created on purpose.

937
00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:45.980
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

938
00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.551
<v 0>And there's,</v>

939
00:32:46.551 --> 00:32:46.941
you know,

940
00:32:46.941 --> 00:32:47.810
an obvious,

941
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:48.290
uh,

942
00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:49.250
religious,

943
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.790
uh,

944
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:54.790
sub category here where you say that there is a creator,

945
00:32:55.101 --> 00:32:57.320
a god of some kind who did this on purpose.

946
00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:57.880
Uh,

947
00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.880
so this leads,

948
00:32:59.080 --> 00:32:59.760
uh,

949
00:32:59.760 --> 00:33:00.390
uh,

950
00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:02.390
to various kinds of religious explanations.

951
00:33:02.391 --> 00:33:02.900
But,

952
00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:03.320
uh,

953
00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:03.740
in,

954
00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.480
in more general terms,

955
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:06.550
uh,

956
00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:08.120
it doesn't have to be religious.

957
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:11.450
This is what's called the strong anthropic principle,

958
00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.790
which says that for some reason,

959
00:33:19.791 --> 00:33:22.400
be it be it religion or anything else,

960
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:23.570
uh,

961
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:24.403
that,

962
00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:25.191
uh,

963
00:33:25.191 --> 00:33:27.620
the universe must

964
00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:28.993
<v 1>yeah.</v>

965
00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:31.760
<v 0>Have life or have the set of,</v>

966
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.870
uh,

967
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:35.210
of constants that allows life to exist.

968
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:36.320
Um,

969
00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:36.770
you know,

970
00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:40.550
one of the things that the physicists are trying to do is to figure out where,

971
00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.800
why these numbers have the values they do.

972
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:44.900
Maybe it turns out that,

973
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:45.530
uh,

974
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:48.830
if you finally work out the final theory of physics and everything,

975
00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:49.160
uh,

976
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.380
that will tell you what these numbers have to be.

977
00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:55.490
And there's only one choice that you can't choose randomly from these numbers.

978
00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:57.290
That there's some theory that underlies it,

979
00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.470
that requires you to pick certain numbers and that those numbers,

980
00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:01.070
uh,

981
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.900
in turn,

982
00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:02.400
uh,

983
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.070
require the existence of life.

984
00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:04.870
Uh,

985
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:05.703
uh,

986
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.480
that's,

987
00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:06.840
uh,

988
00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.310
uh,

989
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:12.310
and whether or not you attribute that a to religious causes it,

990
00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.540
it doesn't make a difference to the,

991
00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:19.130
to the sort of a structure of this kind of argument that there's only one way

992
00:34:19.131 --> 00:34:21.440
you could have made the universe somebody phrase this,

993
00:34:21.441 --> 00:34:22.340
it might've been Einstein,

994
00:34:22.341 --> 00:34:23.174
I don't remember.

995
00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:23.450
Praise.

996
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:26.060
It is the question is did God have a choice?

997
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:27.080
Uh,

998
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:31.490
could you have made a self consistent universe with some other set of numbers?

999
00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:32.383
Maybe not.

1000
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.950
Uh,

1001
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:34.401
but the,

1002
00:34:34.401 --> 00:34:34.670
uh,

1003
00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:35.240
virgin,

1004
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:35.690
the,

1005
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:36.110
the,

1006
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:36.943
uh,

1007
00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:37.341
uh,

1008
00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:38.180
approach to this,

1009
00:34:38.181 --> 00:34:40.550
which is getting the most attention at the moment,

1010
00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:41.150
uh,

1011
00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:44.090
by the kinds of people who think about these things is the concept of the

1012
00:34:44.091 --> 00:34:45.050
multiverse

1013
00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:50.970
universe is one universe.

1014
00:34:50.971 --> 00:34:52.200
Multiverse is many.

1015
00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.470
So the idea is that there are many universes,

1016
00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:57.150
uh,

1017
00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:58.890
with different,

1018
00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:00.660
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1019
00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:01.141
<v 0>Uh,</v>

1020
00:35:01.141 --> 00:35:02.460
sets of constants,

1021
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:04.350
sets of numbers,

1022
00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.210
numbers and laws.

1023
00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:08.591
Well,

1024
00:35:08.591 --> 00:35:09.700
if that's true,

1025
00:35:09.701 --> 00:35:12.100
then things are pretty straightforward.

1026
00:35:12.130 --> 00:35:17.130
If you've got a a hundred Gillian universes of out there and each one has a

1027
00:35:17.291 --> 00:35:20.470
different set of laws at different manifestation of,

1028
00:35:20.530 --> 00:35:20.950
uh,

1029
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:21.191
uh,

1030
00:35:21.191 --> 00:35:22.420
of the laws of nature,

1031
00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:26.980
then it's not surprising that the one we live in happens to be conducive for our

1032
00:35:26.981 --> 00:35:28.180
existence because,

1033
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.730
uh,

1034
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:29.020
uh,

1035
00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.210
there's a whole bunch of other ones out there that,

1036
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.470
uh,

1037
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:32.110
uh,

1038
00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:33.940
that there are no people in.

1039
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.410
Uh,

1040
00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:35.190
and uh,

1041
00:35:35.190 --> 00:35:38.790
naturally we exist in one case where,

1042
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:39.151
uh,

1043
00:35:39.151 --> 00:35:39.984
where we can,

1044
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:40.530
uh,

1045
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:41.060
you know,

1046
00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:41.280
uh,

1047
00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:41.821
how this works.

1048
00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:44.760
It's like going out into a parking lot and you see a license plate out in the

1049
00:35:44.761 --> 00:35:46.050
parking lot and,

1050
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:46.380
uh,

1051
00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.070
the license plate is three Oh eight BJ six or something like that.

1052
00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:50.820
And you say,

1053
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:51.570
Gosh,

1054
00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:52.770
what a coincidence.

1055
00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:55.890
Out of all the license plates in the universe,

1056
00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:58.950
that one happens to be sitting right in front of my office.

1057
00:35:59.070 --> 00:35:59.370
But if,

1058
00:35:59.370 --> 00:35:59.761
of course,

1059
00:35:59.761 --> 00:36:01.070
if it was any other license plate,

1060
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.190
he would have said the same thing.

1061
00:36:02.191 --> 00:36:04.020
And so that's actually not surprising.

1062
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:04.680
Uh,

1063
00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.640
so similarly,

1064
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:10.730
if you have a whole lot of cards in of universe in the world,

1065
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:12.201
if you have,

1066
00:36:12.201 --> 00:36:13.830
there are a whole lot of cars in the world,

1067
00:36:13.831 --> 00:36:14.280
right?

1068
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.900
There's billions of cars in the world.

1069
00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:18.600
What are the odds that you get into the one you own?

1070
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.160
Uh,

1071
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:20.431
well,

1072
00:36:20.431 --> 00:36:21.121
pretty high,

1073
00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:21.471
right?

1074
00:36:21.471 --> 00:36:22.304
But yes,

1075
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:23.790
you're doing it on purpose.

1076
00:36:23.791 --> 00:36:24.271
Similarly,

1077
00:36:24.271 --> 00:36:26.820
if there's lots and lots of different universes,

1078
00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:28.560
each one with a different set of physics,

1079
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:32.730
what are the odds that we exist in one that allows us to exist,

1080
00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:33.540
uh,

1081
00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.470
pretty high.

1082
00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:35.603
Um,

1083
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.350
but the question is where'd,

1084
00:36:37.351 --> 00:36:39.060
while these universes come from?

1085
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.290
Uh,

1086
00:36:40.290 --> 00:36:42.180
and so how do you generate,

1087
00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:43.643
uh,

1088
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:46.440
many different universes?

1089
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:49.860
Why wouldn't you be satisfied with just having the one you've got?

1090
00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:50.850
Um,

1091
00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:51.750
and so again,

1092
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.910
there are a number of different sub categories here.

1093
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:59.310
There's the one in which you look beyond the cosmic horizon.

1094
00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:00.821
Now,

1095
00:37:00.821 --> 00:37:02.080
the cosmic horizon,

1096
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:02.411
you know,

1097
00:37:02.411 --> 00:37:05.080
if the universe is 13.7 billion years old,

1098
00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:08.620
we can't see anything more than 13.7 billion light years away.

1099
00:37:08.770 --> 00:37:09.430
And in fact,

1100
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:10.450
the further away we look,

1101
00:37:10.451 --> 00:37:11.530
we look back in time.

1102
00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.740
So we certainly don't know anything about what something 13.

1103
00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:18.190
What about something 15 big light years away is do we now?

1104
00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:22.510
And so you could imagine that there are kind of slow changes in the constants

1105
00:37:22.511 --> 00:37:26.110
and laws of nature and that by the time you're a hundred billion light years

1106
00:37:26.111 --> 00:37:26.930
away from us,

1107
00:37:26.930 --> 00:37:27.140
it,

1108
00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:27.520
it,

1109
00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.000
that part of the universe which is causally disconnected from our own,

1110
00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.550
has some other kind of physics that is going on.

1111
00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:38.710
And so you postulate an infinite universe of which we can only detect ever in

1112
00:37:38.711 --> 00:37:39.460
principle,

1113
00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:40.510
a tiny fraction.

1114
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:44.110
And over there somewhere there's another set of constants going on.

1115
00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:44.591
Uh,

1116
00:37:44.591 --> 00:37:45.424
and so,

1117
00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:45.641
uh,

1118
00:37:45.641 --> 00:37:46.570
there's another,

1119
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.931
uh,

1120
00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:50.170
another set of physics far away that we know nothing about.

1121
00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:52.720
So that's one option.

1122
00:37:52.721 --> 00:37:55.420
Another option is other dimensions.

1123
00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:01.650
Those of you who have read any of the popular accounts of string theory may be

1124
00:38:01.651 --> 00:38:04.590
aware that one of the problems or perhaps advantages,

1125
00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:05.180
well,

1126
00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:05.490
uh,

1127
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:07.530
the computer scientists call these features,

1128
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:08.080
uh,

1129
00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:13.080
of string theory is that you require either nine or 10 or 11 or perhaps 26

1130
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:16.350
spatial dimensions in order to make it work out.

1131
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:18.000
Then they do this clever thing where they say,

1132
00:38:18.001 --> 00:38:20.130
of course we live in a three dimensional unit in university,

1133
00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.640
but it's really a 10 dimensional universe with seven dimensions rolled up so

1134
00:38:23.641 --> 00:38:23.941
tight.

1135
00:38:23.941 --> 00:38:24.774
You can't see them,

1136
00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:25.680
uh,

1137
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.210
kind of a dubious proposition,

1138
00:38:27.211 --> 00:38:27.960
but it works out.

1139
00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.000
It actually works out quite well mathematically.

1140
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.360
Uh,

1141
00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.380
but you could imagine,

1142
00:38:31.381 --> 00:38:34.920
imagine that you're in a two dimensional universe and here's your universe,

1143
00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:38.440
but it's embedded inside some additional spacial dimension.

1144
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.220
There could be another two dimensional universe down here and you would have no

1145
00:38:42.221 --> 00:38:43.510
way of interacting with it.

1146
00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:47.620
And so you could imagine that these extra dimensions that are being postulated

1147
00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:51.820
allow the existence of many different three dimensional universes.

1148
00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:53.350
It's kind of next to each other,

1149
00:38:53.351 --> 00:38:55.480
spread out in these higher dimensions.

1150
00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:56.290
Uh,

1151
00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:59.380
and perhaps they don't all have to be three dimensional universes.

1152
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:00.250
They can be other kinds of,

1153
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:00.581
I mean,

1154
00:39:00.581 --> 00:39:02.080
that's another crucial number,

1155
00:39:02.081 --> 00:39:02.381
right,

1156
00:39:02.381 --> 00:39:04.990
is how many spatial dimensions your universe has.

1157
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:05.980
Um,

1158
00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.230
and so one could imagine that a,

1159
00:39:08.231 --> 00:39:12.080
these kinds of extra dimensions talked about quite seriously by the string

1160
00:39:12.081 --> 00:39:12.914
theorist.

1161
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:13.923
Um,

1162
00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.130
allow the existence of many different universes with different physical laws to

1163
00:39:18.131 --> 00:39:18.964
choose from.

1164
00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:23.080
There's also a kind of evolutionary argument.

1165
00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:24.003
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1166
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:26.181
<v 0>Uh,</v>

1167
00:39:26.181 --> 00:39:29.780
this is presented in a popular book by a guy named Lee Smolin,

1168
00:39:29.781 --> 00:39:30.800
which is wonderful book.

1169
00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:31.510
Uh,

1170
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:32.343
why don't you read it?

1171
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.780
Uh,

1172
00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:33.001
he,

1173
00:39:33.001 --> 00:39:35.090
his thought is that each time,

1174
00:39:35.091 --> 00:39:35.261
and,

1175
00:39:35.261 --> 00:39:36.350
and this came up,

1176
00:39:36.351 --> 00:39:37.250
I think earlier in the,

1177
00:39:37.251 --> 00:39:37.681
in,

1178
00:39:37.681 --> 00:39:38.390
in the class,

1179
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:42.440
each time you make a black hole inside the event horizon,

1180
00:39:42.441 --> 00:39:44.150
a new universe forms.

1181
00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:45.140
Uh,

1182
00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.300
so that's one way of doing this.

1183
00:39:47.301 --> 00:39:49.610
So new universes,

1184
00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:51.450
uh,

1185
00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:53.940
form from old ones,

1186
00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.230
from black holes or whatever.

1187
00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:01.240
Uh,

1188
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:06.240
and supposing you postulate that each daughter universe has slightly different

1189
00:40:07.361 --> 00:40:07.991
parameters,

1190
00:40:07.991 --> 00:40:12.991
but only slightly different from its parent in the way that each of us has a

1191
00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:18.340
genetic material that closely related but not identical to that of each of our

1192
00:40:18.341 --> 00:40:19.000
parents.

1193
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:19.570
Well,

1194
00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:19.840
uh,

1195
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:24.840
what happened you then favor in the idea that you make them out of black holes.

1196
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:30.330
You favor universes that produce lots of black holes.

1197
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:37.030
Uh,

1198
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.870
and so there's a,

1199
00:40:37.871 --> 00:40:38.920
there's a kind of,

1200
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:39.670
uh,

1201
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:40.270
uh,

1202
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.750
uh,

1203
00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:42.010
survival of the fittest,

1204
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.270
not just for organisms,

1205
00:40:43.271 --> 00:40:44.530
but for whole universes.

1206
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.590
If you're the kind of universe that produces lots of black holes,

1207
00:40:47.591 --> 00:40:48.880
you're going to have lots of children.

1208
00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:49.930
Then after,

1209
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.790
after this goes on for a long time,

1210
00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.490
most of the universes in the multiverse,

1211
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.821
uh,

1212
00:40:54.821 --> 00:40:57.790
will be the kinds of universes that produce lots of black holes.

1213
00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.200
How do you make black holes?

1214
00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:02.980
You make the most black holes by producing lots and lots and lots of stars.

1215
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:04.930
Stars are complex objects.

1216
00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:08.230
This is the kind of universe that you're likely to end up with life in.

1217
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:09.051
And so small,

1218
00:41:09.051 --> 00:41:09.990
it's argument is,

1219
00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:10.570
uh,

1220
00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:11.010
that,

1221
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:11.230
uh,

1222
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:15.400
because of this survival of the fittest for universities as a whole,

1223
00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:15.850
uh,

1224
00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:19.630
you're almost guaranteed in any particular university you pick out as the kind

1225
00:41:19.631 --> 00:41:22.720
of universe that will produce lots of black holes and therefore lots of

1226
00:41:22.721 --> 00:41:25.330
complexity and therefore we'll support life.

1227
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:26.380
Uh,

1228
00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:26.880
and there,

1229
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:29.290
there are various other versions of this same kind of thing.

1230
00:41:29.291 --> 00:41:33.800
And this is an attempt to kind of use the biological arguments for how you get

1231
00:41:33.801 --> 00:41:34.634
complexity.

1232
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:35.150
Uh,

1233
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.750
on,

1234
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:36.250
uh,

1235
00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:38.720
a cosmological scale.

1236
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.981
There's a difference.

1237
00:41:39.981 --> 00:41:42.020
Of course in the case of biology,

1238
00:41:42.021 --> 00:41:46.280
we get to go back and look at the fossil record and we also understand genetics

1239
00:41:46.281 --> 00:41:49.130
so that we know how the small modifications are created.

1240
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.050
I mean you need a set of physical laws here that tell you how different one

1241
00:41:54.051 --> 00:41:55.760
universe is from its parents.

1242
00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:59.900
And of course that is not something we have any understanding of or knowledge of

1243
00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:00.831
a,

1244
00:42:00.831 --> 00:42:01.664
and

1245
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:03.111
yes,

1246
00:42:03.111 --> 00:42:07.040
whole multiverse concept is now getting a lot of attention from the people who

1247
00:42:07.041 --> 00:42:09.590
worry about the philosophy of physics.

1248
00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:10.401
Uh,

1249
00:42:10.401 --> 00:42:15.401
and one of the arguments that people get into over this kind of thing,

1250
00:42:15.771 --> 00:42:17.060
which is kind of uh,

1251
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:17.600
uh,

1252
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.350
an interesting one people spend a lot of time that people worry about this,

1253
00:42:21.351 --> 00:42:26.351
spend a lot of time worrying about is this science a small and by the way thinks

1254
00:42:26.601 --> 00:42:27.170
it is,

1255
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:31.820
he thinks that his idea of the these black holes makes a testable prediction,

1256
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:37.120
namely that the current universe should be one that produces the most number of

1257
00:42:37.461 --> 00:42:39.770
black holes of any possible universe.

1258
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.190
So that if you imagine changing the constants of nature and doing a big

1259
00:42:43.191 --> 00:42:47.330
simulation of what the universe would look like with that than any other set of

1260
00:42:47.331 --> 00:42:47.810
competent,

1261
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:48.111
uh,

1262
00:42:48.111 --> 00:42:48.680
of,

1263
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.040
of,

1264
00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:49.581
of,

1265
00:42:49.581 --> 00:42:50.000
um,

1266
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.030
constants of nature would produce fewer black holes,

1267
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:54.650
then this universe does.

1268
00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:55.700
Uh,

1269
00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:59.270
I think that's actually problematic because most stars in our universe don't

1270
00:42:59.271 --> 00:43:00.230
produce black holes.

1271
00:43:00.231 --> 00:43:00.711
So you can think,

1272
00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:00.891
well,

1273
00:43:00.891 --> 00:43:02.900
tweak it up so that they all make black holes.

1274
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:08.050
He then argues that that same tweak changes star formation in such a way that

1275
00:43:08.151 --> 00:43:10.640
you actually get fewer starts to work within the first place.

1276
00:43:11.330 --> 00:43:11.631
Maybe.

1277
00:43:11.631 --> 00:43:12.464
So,

1278
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:13.040
uh,

1279
00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.370
other people argue that this is totally not science because as soon as you are

1280
00:43:16.371 --> 00:43:19.610
invoking universes other than our own,

1281
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:24.350
you've left the realm of science by definition because what is the definition of

1282
00:43:24.351 --> 00:43:24.651
science?

1283
00:43:24.651 --> 00:43:27.050
It's studying our own university ways,

1284
00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:27.560
uh,

1285
00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:28.970
that you can actually test.

1286
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:30.110
And by definition,

1287
00:43:30.111 --> 00:43:31.790
if you're talking about another universe,

1288
00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:32.960
it cannot be tested.

1289
00:43:32.961 --> 00:43:33.950
So this isn't science.

1290
00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.061
Other people say,

1291
00:43:35.061 --> 00:43:35.600
well look,

1292
00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.420
supposing you have some kind of a theory,

1293
00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:39.830
uh,

1294
00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:42.710
which predict things in our own universe,

1295
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:44.030
which you can observe.

1296
00:43:44.031 --> 00:43:48.170
And also the same theory predicts things about the multiverse,

1297
00:43:48.171 --> 00:43:49.100
which you can't observe.

1298
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:53.990
If you observe the things in our universe that you can predict correctly,

1299
00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.440
then that gives you some confidence that the rest of the theory might also be

1300
00:43:57.441 --> 00:43:57.920
right.

1301
00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:02.390
And so this is a sort of intermediate case where it's mostly science perhaps.

1302
00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.320
Um,

1303
00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:03.921
I have to say,

1304
00:44:03.921 --> 00:44:08.921
I personally think it's the wrong question because both sides of this argument

1305
00:44:08.961 --> 00:44:13.961
presuppose the idea that if it's science that's good and that if it isn't

1306
00:44:15.021 --> 00:44:15.471
science,

1307
00:44:15.471 --> 00:44:17.060
you shouldn't be talking about it.

1308
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.140
Right?

1309
00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:18.471
Uh,

1310
00:44:18.471 --> 00:44:19.910
I think that's a problematic,

1311
00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:20.610
uh,

1312
00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:21.830
point of view just between you,

1313
00:44:21.831 --> 00:44:23.510
me and the video camera back there.

1314
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:24.330
Uh,

1315
00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:24.860
there's,

1316
00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:25.100
uh,

1317
00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:28.970
it's just not true that things that aren't science aren't worth thinking about.

1318
00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:29.660
Uh,

1319
00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.330
there's plenty of figs that are thinking about that aren't science in my own

1320
00:44:33.331 --> 00:44:35.610
personal view of this argument is that this is one of them.

1321
00:44:35.611 --> 00:44:36.930
But this really isn't science.

1322
00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:40.230
But I don't care if it's science or not because it's still pretty interesting.

1323
00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:41.573
Um,

1324
00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:46.850
and I think we should also keep in mind that the border of what science is and

1325
00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:47.971
isn't,

1326
00:44:47.971 --> 00:44:51.610
has evolved rather quickly over the past hundred years.

1327
00:44:51.611 --> 00:44:55.140
And you know this off to be a parrot from what we've talked about in this course

1328
00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:56.490
20 years ago,

1329
00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.060
talking about planets around other stars was complete science fiction.

1330
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:03.060
They did an on star trek but not in the scientific journals.

1331
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:06.600
And this has now as we saw from the example this morning change really very

1332
00:45:06.601 --> 00:45:07.434
dramatically,

1333
00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:07.950
uh,

1334
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:08.910
40 years ago,

1335
00:45:08.911 --> 00:45:13.020
the idea that you would have black holes to actually look at that you could pour

1336
00:45:13.021 --> 00:45:13.880
gas into the missy.

1337
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:15.810
What happens was equally,

1338
00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:16.763
uh,

1339
00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.160
equally unscientific a hundred years ago.

1340
00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:23.850
The idea that you could say anything scientific about the universe as a whole

1341
00:45:23.851 --> 00:45:25.200
was completely preposterous.

1342
00:45:25.201 --> 00:45:26.400
That was part of philosophy,

1343
00:45:26.401 --> 00:45:27.330
not part of science.

1344
00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:29.130
And yet over time,

1345
00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.090
uh,

1346
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:34.530
all of these things have been kind of a assimilated into science.

1347
00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:36.060
And there's no reason to think,

1348
00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:36.510
uh,

1349
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:41.510
that the kinds of philosophical musings of about the multiverse might not also

1350
00:45:41.761 --> 00:45:44.370
in some way that we can't currently understand,

1351
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:45.870
be pulled into science.

1352
00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:46.531
Uh,

1353
00:45:46.531 --> 00:45:49.350
and so this whole argument over whether this is a science or not might be

1354
00:45:49.351 --> 00:45:52.290
overtaken by events and events are after all,

1355
00:45:52.291 --> 00:45:54.090
moving pretty rapidly these days.

1356
00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:58.080
This is a golden age of astrophysics because of the instruments we have,

1357
00:45:58.081 --> 00:45:59.220
the techniques we've developed,

1358
00:45:59.221 --> 00:46:00.150
the theories we have,

1359
00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:00.960
uh,

1360
00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:01.290
uh,

1361
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:02.123
you know,

1362
00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:04.890
historians of science a thousand years from now,

1363
00:46:04.891 --> 00:46:07.290
we'll say the beginning of the 21st century,

1364
00:46:07.291 --> 00:46:08.610
that's when it was all discovered.

1365
00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:09.330
And so,

1366
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:09.511
uh,

1367
00:46:09.511 --> 00:46:14.511
it's kind of a privilege for me to play some small role in this and to have the

1368
00:46:14.521 --> 00:46:16.840
opportunity to talk to you guys about it.

1369
00:46:16.841 --> 00:46:17.760
And so I would say,

1370
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.073
uh,

1371
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:23.430
whether or not you've learned anything interesting about astrophysics and

1372
00:46:23.431 --> 00:46:28.380
whether or not you've learned anything useful about the way science works,

1373
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:29.070
uh,

1374
00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:29.903
if you've,

1375
00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:30.730
uh,

1376
00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:34.980
acquired even a fraction of the enthusiasm that I feel for this enterprise,

1377
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:35.380
uh,

1378
00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:38.310
then I think our time together has been more or less worthwhile.

1379
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:38.821
Uh,

1380
00:46:38.821 --> 00:46:40.230
and so that's all I have to say.

1381
00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.430
Thank you for your attention.

1382
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:42.443
And we will

1383
00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:45.310
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
