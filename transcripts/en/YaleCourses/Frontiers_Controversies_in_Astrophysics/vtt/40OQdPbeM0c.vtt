1
00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.990
Welcome to pre frosh.

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:02.391
Uh,

3
00:00:02.391 --> 00:00:04.870
I'm talking about black holes at seven o'clock this evening.

4
00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:06.070
Come listened to that too.

5
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:06.791
Uh,

6
00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:09.790
and in the meantime we'll talk about the future of the universe.

7
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.900
Okay.

8
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.733
Um,

9
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.810
logistical questions,

10
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:15.663
anything?

11
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:16.803
All right,

12
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.963
where were we?

13
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.300
We were here.

14
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.500
Uh,

15
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.500
this is the data that demonstrate that the universe is filled with dark energy,

16
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:35.670
are kind of anti gravity that is pushing the universe apart.

17
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:36.840
And what this is,

18
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.410
this is the same data,

19
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.600
both of these plot,

20
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.141
uh,

21
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:42.600
just plotted slightly differently on the top plot.

22
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:47.601
What they've done is they've plotted the apparent magnitude of these supernovae

23
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.900
versus their red shift and so apparent magnitude because the,

24
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.020
the absolute magnitude is always the same.

25
00:00:55.021 --> 00:00:56.340
These are standard candles.

26
00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.170
So from the apparent magnitude,

27
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.630
you can figure out what the distance modulates is.

28
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:02.070
That gives you a measure of the distance.

29
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:04.320
So this is just distance versus velocity.

30
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.040
Now we've plotted distance versus velocity a bunch of times.

31
00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:09.150
That's the Hubble diagram.

32
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.900
Uh,

33
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.400
most of the times we've plotted it.

34
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:12.900
It's come out on a straight line.

35
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.560
Uh,

36
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.350
do you understand why this plot isn't on a straight line?

37
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:17.820
The top one I'm talking about now,

38
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:19.140
why those lines are curved.

39
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.161
What's the,

40
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:23.450
what's The y axis?

41
00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:24.620
The y axis is,

42
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.483
yes,

43
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.900
it's logarithmic.

44
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:27.800
Thank you very much.

45
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.730
Uh,

46
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.061
yes,

47
00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:30.020
it's magnitude.

48
00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:32.090
Magnitude are upside down in Logarithmic,

49
00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:32.650
right?

50
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.810
Uh,

51
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:33.643
that's why,

52
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:34.010
uh,

53
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.110
faint stars have high numbers,

54
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.700
uh,

55
00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.380
up at the top and uh,

56
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.750
uh,

57
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.630
and because one axis is logarithmic and the other axis is,

58
00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:42.650
and of course at curves,

59
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.490
you could,

60
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.211
the way you,

61
00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:45.500
if you want a nice straight line,

62
00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:47.570
you'd just make this access logarithmic as well.

63
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.060
What we've done down on the bottom is just subtracted off,

64
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.661
uh,

65
00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:55.070
the empty universe,

66
00:01:55.071 --> 00:01:58.310
a universe with no dark matte with no matter and no energy in it.

67
00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.880
Uh,

68
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.260
so that you can see more clearly the way these three lines diverged.

69
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.830
And these three lines are three different models of the universe.

70
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.580
This is a,

71
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.490
and there,

72
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.650
uh,

73
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.290
do you noted by these Omega factors,

74
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:13.190
Alma Mater,

75
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.750
that that's the density of matter divided by the critical density Omega Lambda.

76
00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.110
That's the energy density of the dark,

77
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.330
uh,

78
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.650
of the dark energy divided by that same critical density.

79
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:25.161
Uh,

80
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:26.690
and down here is,

81
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.050
uh,

82
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.490
an Omega matter of one that's the dividing line between a universe that we

83
00:02:31.491 --> 00:02:33.860
collapses and a university expanse forever.

84
00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:35.600
So if the universe were,

85
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.270
if the points that we studied were down here,

86
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:39.530
the universe would read collapsed.

87
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.840
If they're up here at Winn,

88
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.610
this dotted line here is a quarter and zero a quarter,

89
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.300
uh,

90
00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.990
in,

91
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.201
uh,

92
00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:50.330
Omeka matter is the amount of,

93
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.900
uh,

94
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.830
is the amount of matter that we actually observe in dark matter in galaxies.

95
00:02:54.831 --> 00:02:57.370
If you go out and count up all the dark matter in the galaxies,

96
00:02:57.371 --> 00:02:58.204
add it all up,

97
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.610
you get to about quarter of the critical density.

98
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.210
Uh,

99
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:06.210
so what people were kind of expecting to see was something between here and

100
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:06.970
here.

101
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.880
And of course that wasn't what happened as we discussed last time.

102
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.880
Turns out all the points are too high and therefore you end up the current best

103
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:16.511
fit,

104
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:17.080
the best.

105
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.441
Yes,

106
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:20.530
for way the way the universe is this solid line here.

107
00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.950
Uh,

108
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.100
this is called the standard model or the concordance model,

109
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.940
uh,

110
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.520
where you've got a quarter of,

111
00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:28.060
uh,

112
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.920
the Omega matter is a quarter,

113
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.110
but there's a whole bunch of dark energy,

114
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.860
uh,

115
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.130
three quarters of the universes in this mysterious form of dark energy,

116
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:37.980
which tends to push things apart rather than,

117
00:03:37.981 --> 00:03:38.980
than pull them together.

118
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.820
That's why these points are above the zero line instead of below it.

119
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.080
And that's the current best idea for what the universe is.

120
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.230
So by virtue of the fact that these points lie on the solid line,

121
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.950
rather than on somewhere between these two dotted lines,

122
00:03:56.951 --> 00:03:58.210
or perhaps even below,

123
00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.840
uh,

124
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.160
we make this remarkable conclusion that the universe is three quarters full of

125
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:05.920
something we absolutely don't understand called dark energy,

126
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.980
which has the effect of an anti gravity.

127
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.880
And that it turns out that Einstein's biggest mistake is right after all,

128
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.230
pretty hefty conclusion to lay on the basis of two dozen point with let it be

129
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:21.200
said,

130
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.030
a pretty sizable error bars on any one of those points.

131
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.570
And so I thought,

132
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.070
uh,

133
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.150
at the start of today,

134
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:30.490
I would talk about what these points are,

135
00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:32.020
how they are measured,

136
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.780
and what could go wrong with this kind of measurement.

137
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.860
Because you know,

138
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.430
we're Bay,

139
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.430
we've transformed what we think about the universe based on this.

140
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.660
And so it behooves one to actually try and understand what's going on.

141
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.650
I'll come back to that in a minute.

142
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.830
So what are these points?

143
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:54.910
What are we measuring?

144
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.600
Uh,

145
00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.433
and why did we,

146
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.090
why,

147
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.750
why do we think it might even work?

148
00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.973
Um,

149
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.670
what we are measuring is type one a supernova.

150
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.300
So this is typical astronomical nomenclature,

151
00:05:11.301 --> 00:05:11.790
right?

152
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.050
Uh,

153
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.681
we go out,

154
00:05:12.681 --> 00:05:14.000
we find a bunch of things.

155
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.710
We divide them into categories.

156
00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:17.210
We call them type one,

157
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.140
type two.

158
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.930
It then turns out that the,

159
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.360
uh,

160
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.500
that each of those categories has subcategories.

161
00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:23.730
Type one a,

162
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.800
uh,

163
00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.633
the joke is,

164
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.970
uh,

165
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.100
when astronomers find three objects,

166
00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:30.200
that's two categories and an exception.

167
00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.161
Uh,

168
00:05:31.161 --> 00:05:32.750
and so a type one,

169
00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:36.560
a supernova though are by now a fairly well defined a category.

170
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.990
And here's what we think they are.

171
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.510
Think back to the middle part of the class.

172
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.380
To the black hole section of the class where we were talking about x Ray

173
00:05:45.381 --> 00:05:46.214
Binary's,

174
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.240
x ray binary,

175
00:05:47.241 --> 00:05:49.040
you'll recall is a black hole.

176
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.840
You in orbit around something,

177
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.760
some other kind of star in it pulls material from that other star onto itself.

178
00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.870
So this is the type one come from a very similar category of object.

179
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.460
Here's a normal star,

180
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.530
except it's pulled out of shape a little bit and it's in a double star system.

181
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.390
Here's something else.

182
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:09.590
This is a white dwarf.

183
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.590
In this case you'll remember,

184
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:15.470
white dwarfs are these very compact stars.

185
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:17.810
Not Compact enough to be black holes,

186
00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:18.770
but fairly compact,

187
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.490
uh,

188
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.660
that are created a at the end of the lifetime of stars like the Sun.

189
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:26.390
So fairly dense object and just as in the x,

190
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:26.561
right?

191
00:06:26.561 --> 00:06:31.561
Binary stuff is being pulled off of the normal star onto the white dwarf.

192
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.920
So then what happens to this stuff?

193
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:34.490
First of all,

194
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.720
what the White Dwarf,

195
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.010
uh,

196
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.400
has had all its hydrogen and helium fuse together.

197
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:42.110
So there's no hydrogen or helium left.

198
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.540
So this white dwarf is composed of elements like carbon and oxygen and nitrogen

199
00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:49.550
and neon and,

200
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:50.630
and salon up the line,

201
00:06:50.631 --> 00:06:52.040
but no hydrogen and helium.

202
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.510
So the material that comes from the normal stars full of hydrogen and helium,

203
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:58.400
it's pretty much all hydrogen and helium.

204
00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:00.050
So the created material,

205
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:01.490
what does it do?

206
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.120
A land on the white dwarf.

207
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.880
And uh,

208
00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.790
as it went,

209
00:07:11.791 --> 00:07:12.451
it heats up,

210
00:07:12.451 --> 00:07:14.430
it falls down and he up gets very hot,

211
00:07:14.431 --> 00:07:15.300
gets very dense.

212
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.310
And so,

213
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:16.620
uh,

214
00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.620
it undergoes nuclear fusion just like the material in the middle of the sun or

215
00:07:23.131 --> 00:07:23.620
in the middle,

216
00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.440
presumably of this normal star as well.

217
00:07:25.441 --> 00:07:26.910
So there's all this fusion going on.

218
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:32.090
One of the features of the way this works on a white dwarf is it is usually

219
00:07:32.371 --> 00:07:33.180
true,

220
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.570
uh,

221
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:34.410
that the,

222
00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:35.101
uh,

223
00:07:35.101 --> 00:07:38.970
that what happens is hydrogen and helium piles up for awhile and then it has a

224
00:07:38.971 --> 00:07:39.810
big explosion.

225
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.540
It doesn't usually burn steadily.

226
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:43.703
And so,

227
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:44.610
uh,

228
00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.000
uh,

229
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.390
what,

230
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.350
what this actually,

231
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:49.020
what actually happens is you have occasional,

232
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.433
uh,

233
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.530
thermo nuclear explosions

234
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:58.230
of the accreted material.

235
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.000
Yeah.

236
00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.740
And so,

237
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:02.901
uh,

238
00:08:02.901 --> 00:08:07.070
you pile up all this hydrogen and you wait some amount of time,

239
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:07.880
uh,

240
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.390
somewhere between 10 days and 10 to the five years,

241
00:08:11.391 --> 00:08:12.590
depending on the object.

242
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.720
You pile up all this hydrogen and helium,

243
00:08:14.721 --> 00:08:18.950
and finally it gets dance on hot enough to explode and then it explodes all at

244
00:08:18.951 --> 00:08:19.290
once.

245
00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.920
Huge hydrogen bomb on the surface of this white dwarf.

246
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:22.880
Uh,

247
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.830
and that makes the system much,

248
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:27.320
much brighter because there's all this stuff exploding.

249
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:28.340
These are,

250
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.390
this is the,

251
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.420
a phenomenon we call a Nova because it looked to the ancients as if a new star

252
00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:37.130
had appeared because the thing had gotten so much brighter.

253
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.650
Okay.

254
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.483
So,

255
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:41.480
uh,

256
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.410
stuff piles up,

257
00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.400
no fee occur,

258
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:44.570
more stuff piles up,

259
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.010
more Novia occur.

260
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:46.551
Uh,

261
00:08:46.551 --> 00:08:49.790
and one of the things that's happening while this is going on while this is

262
00:08:49.791 --> 00:08:53.360
going on is that the white dwarf is gradually getting more massive

263
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.570
cause it's piling up all this extra material.

264
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.170
Oh.

265
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.250
The consequence of the Nova is that all the hydrogen and helium gets fused into

266
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:03.000
carbon,

267
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.833
oxygen,

268
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:04.861
nitrogen,

269
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:05.281
neon,

270
00:09:05.281 --> 00:09:06.114
and so forth.

271
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.290
So then it looks just like the rest of the white dwarf get to assimilate it into

272
00:09:10.291 --> 00:09:11.124
the whiteboard,

273
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.750
except the white dwarf is bigger now.

274
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.330
So the white dwarf gets more massive,

275
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:16.530
uh,

276
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.330
and uh,

277
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.940
gradually more and more and more massive.

278
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.050
But you may recall there's a limit to how long this could go on.

279
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:25.680
Uh,

280
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.720
the reason there's a limit to how local,

281
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.290
how long this can go on is because of something we've talked about before.

282
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:32.640
The Chandra Sekhar limit,

283
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:40.440
which says that white dwarfs cannot be more massive than 1.4 times the mass of

284
00:09:41.411 --> 00:09:42.244
the sun.

285
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.960
So what happens when this white dwarf,

286
00:09:47.961 --> 00:09:52.220
which starts out at some perfectly respectable mass 0.6 of the sun or one,

287
00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:55.550
one solar mass and it's piling up all this material from it,

288
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.210
uh,

289
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.043
from its friend,

290
00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:57.591
uh,

291
00:09:57.591 --> 00:09:59.810
and it gradually getting more and more massive.

292
00:09:59.811 --> 00:10:01.220
And then it reaches this limit,

293
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.450
this Chandra state card limits.

294
00:10:02.451 --> 00:10:03.440
So then what happens?

295
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:04.431
What happens?

296
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:05.560
Remember what the chanter sake.

297
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.400
Our limit is if you're,

298
00:10:07.401 --> 00:10:09.620
if you've got a white dwarf that's bigger than the Chandra,

299
00:10:09.621 --> 00:10:10.454
say card limit,

300
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:11.690
then uh,

301
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.870
the white dwarf cannot hold itself up against gravity.

302
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.990
And so the whole thing collapses all at once.

303
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.590
And as is generally the case,

304
00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:25.460
when it collapses,

305
00:10:25.461 --> 00:10:26.240
it gets hot,

306
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.290
it gets dance.

307
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.960
That's what generally happens in a collapse.

308
00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:30.890
Uh,

309
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.650
and so the carbon in particular,

310
00:10:33.651 --> 00:10:35.290
but all the other elements as well,

311
00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.733
<v 1>uh,</v>

312
00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:41.380
<v 0>so carbon and other elements in the white dwarf</v>

313
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.440
fuse and that generates energy.

314
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:49.740
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

315
00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.520
<v 0>And,</v>

316
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.150
uh,

317
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:55.980
they fuse together to form heavy elements such as iron and heavier than that,

318
00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:58.903
<v 1>that</v>

319
00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.150
<v 0>all at once.</v>

320
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.680
So what happens is every time this occurs,

321
00:11:06.681 --> 00:11:09.920
you have exactly the same amount of stuff.

322
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:14.330
This always happens when you have 1.4 solar mass white dwarfs,

323
00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:15.950
because that's the limit.

324
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:17.810
You've gradually built up to that limit.

325
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:22.400
And so you have what you might refer to as a standard bomb.

326
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.980
We've talked about standard candles.

327
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.990
This is a standard bomb.

328
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.220
Uh,

329
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.053
all,

330
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:30.050
uh,

331
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:31.220
you always have

332
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:33.873
<v 1>have</v>

333
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.730
<v 0>the same amount of material</v>

334
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.900
and it all explodes at once.

335
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:46.681
Well,

336
00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:50.160
actually it takes about 100 milliseconds,

337
00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:50.821
something like that,

338
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:51.990
but basically all at once.

339
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.203
Um,

340
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.890
so you blow up 1.4 solar masses of carbon all at once.

341
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.700
Now the advantage of standard things is if you have a standard bomb with the

342
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:01.720
same amount of fuel,

343
00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:05.770
every one of them should be exactly as bright as every other one.

344
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:09.250
And that's what we need to make these distance measurements remember?

345
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:11.350
So if you look at these things,

346
00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:13.930
you see that they're always

347
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:16.503
the same

348
00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:19.053
brightness.

349
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.420
So they're terrific standard candles.

350
00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:25.450
And so one of the things that happens is,

351
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.260
uh,

352
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.610
that you look at these things and you can tell from how bright they look exactly

353
00:12:30.611 --> 00:12:31.720
how far away they are.

354
00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:33.760
You also measure their red shift when they,

355
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.290
when they blow up in this way.

356
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.250
Uh,

357
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.150
and uh,

358
00:12:37.151 --> 00:12:42.151
you get to put a point on that red shift versus distance plot now and there are

359
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:46.540
stupendously bright.

360
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:50.890
These things are having an absolute magnitude of minus 19 and a half.

361
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.480
They out shine whole galaxies for about a week or two until they go away.

362
00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.760
And so you can see them at enormous distances.

363
00:12:57.761 --> 00:13:01.750
So they're just about the perfect thing for exploring cosmology.

364
00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:03.070
Uh,

365
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:05.590
but we were only really able to do this in the,

366
00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:06.581
in the starting,

367
00:13:06.581 --> 00:13:11.140
in the early 1990s because there were two key advances that were made at that

368
00:13:11.141 --> 00:13:11.974
time.

369
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:13.210
One is,

370
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.193
uh,

371
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.120
that the Hubble Space Telescope,

372
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:17.350
uh,

373
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:18.183
measured,

374
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:19.420
uh,

375
00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.870
things like Cepheids and other kinds of stars,

376
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.670
other kinds of distance measurement,

377
00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:25.480
uh,

378
00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.430
in galaxies,

379
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.170
uh,

380
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:34.170
that had historically had type one a supernova.

381
00:13:34.871 --> 00:13:36.640
These things don't occur very often,

382
00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:37.330
uh,

383
00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.390
once every couple of hundred years per galaxy.

384
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:40.781
Uh,

385
00:13:40.781 --> 00:13:44.440
there hasn't been one in our own galaxy since before they invented the

386
00:13:44.441 --> 00:13:45.270
telescope.

387
00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:45.400
Uh,

388
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.230
we're kind of overdue actually.

389
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:47.920
Uh,

390
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.090
one of the worrying things,

391
00:13:49.091 --> 00:13:49.421
you know,

392
00:13:49.421 --> 00:13:52.270
it would be great to have one of these supernova in our own galaxy.

393
00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:53.650
We could study it enormously,

394
00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:54.280
carefully.

395
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.710
The problem is all the telescopes are too big.

396
00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:57.690
Uh,

397
00:13:57.690 --> 00:13:58.120
and,

398
00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:58.420
uh,

399
00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.330
because it would burn out all the instruments you put one of these big research

400
00:14:01.331 --> 00:14:02.350
telescopes pointing to it.

401
00:14:02.351 --> 00:14:03.220
So one of the things,

402
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:03.940
uh,

403
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.540
that we have a Justin Case sorta for emergencies,

404
00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:07.911
uh,

405
00:14:07.911 --> 00:14:12.040
in the telescopes I work with in Chile is we have a big thing you can put over

406
00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:16.060
the front of the telescope and stop it down to about a couple of inches across a

407
00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.470
just in case there's a type one,

408
00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:20.170
a soup or any kind of Supernova in our own galaxy.

409
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:24.100
But when these things that we do have supernova in the historical record,

410
00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:24.760
uh,

411
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.440
Kepler and Tyco saw one a and then back in the 11th century,

412
00:14:29.441 --> 00:14:32.720
there was a famous one observed by the Chinese scenario astronomers.

413
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.070
Uh,

414
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.800
the Europeans were of course in barbarity at the time.

415
00:14:35.801 --> 00:14:36.790
It didn't even notice,

416
00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:37.840
uh,

417
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.560
and uh,

418
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.870
which now we see the crab Nebula,

419
00:14:40.871 --> 00:14:43.090
which is a big outward going explosion.

420
00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:43.470
Uh,

421
00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:45.910
and these things become the brightest object in the sky.

422
00:14:45.911 --> 00:14:47.130
You can see him in the daytime,

423
00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:47.590
uh,

424
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:48.423
pretty amazing.

425
00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:48.640
Uh,

426
00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.380
but it hasn't happened for 400 years,

427
00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:51.890
at least in our own galaxy.

428
00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:54.813
They last,

429
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:55.610
well,

430
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:57.860
I'll show you in a minute what the light curve looks like.

431
00:14:57.861 --> 00:15:01.940
They take a couple weeks to rise to their maximum brightness and then they decay

432
00:15:01.941 --> 00:15:03.470
over over a few months.

433
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:04.000
Uh,

434
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.660
so you can see him for a little while.

435
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.690
Uh,

436
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:09.950
so HSD measured,

437
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:11.120
measured Cepheids.

438
00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.370
This meant that we could calibrate them,

439
00:15:13.371 --> 00:15:14.780
remember the distance ladder,

440
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.110
so you could calibrate these things,

441
00:15:17.111 --> 00:15:17.944
right.

442
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.030
Calibration and this in particular meant,

443
00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:22.810
uh,

444
00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:25.870
that we know the absolute magnitude,

445
00:15:25.871 --> 00:15:28.300
which is crucial for determining these distances.

446
00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.560
What then came out of that and other things,

447
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:33.080
uh,

448
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.880
mostly actually done with ground based telescopes.

449
00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:38.860
So ground based telescopes.

450
00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:40.430
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

451
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:41.263
<v 0>Uh,</v>

452
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:42.560
compared,

453
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.071
uh,

454
00:15:44.071 --> 00:15:47.790
discovered and compared many of these things,

455
00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:50.910
many of these,

456
00:15:50.911 --> 00:15:51.480
uh,

457
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.900
type one A's and discovered that,

458
00:15:54.901 --> 00:15:55.410
you know,

459
00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:59.340
it isn't actually quite true that they all look to be the same brightness,

460
00:15:59.480 --> 00:15:59.790
uh,

461
00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:04.790
because it would be true if you could measure all of the energy that came out of

462
00:16:05.851 --> 00:16:06.630
these things,

463
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.610
but that isn't actually what you measure.

464
00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:13.820
What you measure is all of the photons in a certain range depending on your

465
00:16:14.281 --> 00:16:16.410
detector and how you set your telescope up,

466
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:17.250
all of your,

467
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:22.250
all photons within a certain range of wavelengths at a certain time.

468
00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:23.161
Uh,

469
00:16:23.161 --> 00:16:27.390
and that is not the same thing as measuring all the energy that the thing gives

470
00:16:27.391 --> 00:16:28.060
out.

471
00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:28.370
Uh,

472
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:29.910
and so it turns out that,

473
00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:30.803
uh,

474
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:32.850
if you measure

475
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:40.120
all photons in some wavelength region at some time,

476
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.360
that actually varies from one object to another.

477
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:51.470
Uh,

478
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.020
this can vary by oh,

479
00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:54.531
I don't know,

480
00:16:54.531 --> 00:16:56.030
15 to 20%.

481
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:56.870
Uh,

482
00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:00.860
but that's enough to cause you some real trouble in making these measurements.

483
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.160
But what they discovered was that you can correct for this.

484
00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:08.460
Uh,

485
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.480
if you measure

486
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:14.760
the color and the decay rate,

487
00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.580
that is to say how fast it gets fainter.

488
00:17:17.581 --> 00:17:19.710
So your question turns out to be very important.

489
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:20.820
Uh,

490
00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:24.750
these things behave differently depending on how fast they go away.

491
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:25.470
Uh,

492
00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.630
if you measure the color and the decay rate,

493
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:32.900
you can correct for some of these deviations and turn it back into a good

494
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.493
<v 1>standard</v>

495
00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.173
sandal.

496
00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.190
<v 0>And I'll show you how this is done in just a second.</v>

497
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.033
<v 1>Okay.</v>

498
00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:46.053
How are we doing?

499
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.063
Okay,

500
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.540
<v 0>let me turn this off for a second</v>

501
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.420
and go back to here.

502
00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:57.623
All right.

503
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:03.410
This is the key thing that was found out in the early 1990s.

504
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.820
What up on the top,

505
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.930
you have a whole observations from a whole bunch of supernovae.

506
00:18:09.931 --> 00:18:10.890
This is time.

507
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:12.450
So this is zero,

508
00:18:12.451 --> 00:18:13.201
20 days,

509
00:18:13.201 --> 00:18:13.861
40 days,

510
00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:14.551
60 days.

511
00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:17.370
So this is time counting from the peak brightness.

512
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.520
And most of the time you can observe these things before they get to peak

513
00:18:20.521 --> 00:18:20.971
brightness.

514
00:18:20.971 --> 00:18:23.160
You watched them get brighter and then you watch them get fainter.

515
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:25.620
In the top plot there were plotting,

516
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:26.670
uh,

517
00:18:26.670 --> 00:18:28.410
more or less absolute magnitude.

518
00:18:28.411 --> 00:18:28.831
Think of it,

519
00:18:28.831 --> 00:18:30.150
it's a complicated thing,

520
00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:31.800
but think of it as absolute magnitude.

521
00:18:31.801 --> 00:18:33.450
So minus 19 and a half,

522
00:18:33.451 --> 00:18:33.991
as I said,

523
00:18:33.991 --> 00:18:34.824
is a typical,

524
00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:35.250
uh,

525
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.083
magnitude,

526
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.290
absolute magnitude.

527
00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:39.510
And each color is a different supernova.

528
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.340
So they've made repeated observations of a large number of supernovae and then

529
00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:46.590
the line is just connecting the dots,

530
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:46.950
connect,

531
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:48.270
connecting the observations.

532
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:53.270
And you can see from that top pla that it is not true that every supernova has

533
00:18:53.611 --> 00:18:54.660
the same brightness,

534
00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:55.141
uh,

535
00:18:55.141 --> 00:18:56.910
at peak or at any other time.

536
00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:57.781
Uh,

537
00:18:57.781 --> 00:19:02.781
and so the green supernova on the bottom there gets up to about minus 18.8,

538
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:07.110
whereas the orange one on the top gets up to about minus 20.

539
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:09.560
That's almost a factor of three in,

540
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.460
in different of peak brightness.

541
00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:12.060
Uh,

542
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:14.310
but then you can make this correction.

543
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.750
They measure the color of the thing,

544
00:19:15.751 --> 00:19:17.850
which is not apparent on this particular plot.

545
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.720
They measured the rate of decay and that is apparent.

546
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.050
You can tell the green ones,

547
00:19:22.051 --> 00:19:25.770
the ones at the bottom tend to fall off faster than the ones at the top.

548
00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:26.431
Uh,

549
00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:30.630
and they came up with a correction formula that allows,

550
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.230
uh,

551
00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.990
the absolute magnitudes of these things to be corrected.

552
00:19:33.991 --> 00:19:35.730
And that's what they plot here.

553
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:39.200
These are the same exact data points as they have on the,

554
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.080
on the top line except corrected for these,

555
00:19:43.130 --> 00:19:43.360
uh,

556
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:44.010
uh,

557
00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.490
for the differences in observed color and observe decay rate.

558
00:19:47.491 --> 00:19:52.491
And you can see now you've got a very beautiful combined light curve where

559
00:19:52.531 --> 00:19:56.010
everything does exactly the same thing as all the others.

560
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:57.330
And in particular,

561
00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:02.070
the maximum brightness of these things is always the same at around minus 19 and

562
00:20:02.071 --> 00:20:02.670
a half.

563
00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:07.020
So you have to make this correction in order to be able to use these things

564
00:20:07.021 --> 00:20:07.890
effectively,

565
00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.340
uh,

566
00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:09.720
as standard candles.

567
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:11.370
Uh,

568
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:15.300
and so when that was done and we had calibrated this and they thought,

569
00:20:15.301 --> 00:20:15.930
well,

570
00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:18.990
now we know every time we see one of these things,

571
00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.760
we'll just follow it up,

572
00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:21.840
follow it down,

573
00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.310
make this correction.

574
00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.440
And then we have a,

575
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:28.050
we know what the absolute magnitude is.

576
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.730
We measured the apparent magnitude.

577
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:30.960
We determine the distance.

578
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.530
Uh,

579
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:35.160
we get a spectrum along the way so that we can get a red shift and then we can

580
00:20:35.161 --> 00:20:36.180
make these plots,

581
00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:36.900
uh,

582
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.340
for distant objects.

583
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:42.420
These guys aren't particularly distant because you want to be able to get really

584
00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:43.830
accurate measurements of them.

585
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:44.850
And so it,

586
00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:45.690
this set,

587
00:20:45.691 --> 00:20:46.680
we're the ones,

588
00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:47.200
uh,

589
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.540
that were observed so close to us at,

590
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.990
at such low red shifts that you can't tell the different cosmological models

591
00:20:52.991 --> 00:20:53.824
apart.

592
00:20:53.860 --> 00:20:56.590
So then people got very fired up that said,

593
00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:57.130
Aha,

594
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.860
we're going to figure out everything that is happening in the universe by

595
00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:04.861
looking at these supernovae and they started up big observational projects to

596
00:21:05.261 --> 00:21:07.870
find many high red shifts.

597
00:21:07.871 --> 00:21:11.200
Supernovae so these things are going to be quite faint.

598
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.590
Uh,

599
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:12.430
they're going to be,

600
00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:12.820
uh,

601
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:15.700
they have distance modulates as of close to 45.

602
00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:16.181
Uh,

603
00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:17.470
and so they'll have an,

604
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:17.850
uh,

605
00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:18.790
an absolute,

606
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.230
uh,

607
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.610
apparent magnitudes as low as 25,

608
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:23.080
which is really very hard to see.

609
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:24.363
Um,

610
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.660
so here's what they do.

611
00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:26.560
First of all,

612
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.131
let me just,

613
00:21:27.131 --> 00:21:27.910
whoops,

614
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.140
let me just show you this picture.

615
00:21:29.141 --> 00:21:30.010
This is just fun.

616
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:31.203
Uh,

617
00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.450
<v 2>let's see here.</v>

618
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:34.860
If I do this,

619
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.560
that will be good,

620
00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:39.990
except I think I want this.

621
00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:43.333
<v 0>There we go.</v>

622
00:21:43.550 --> 00:21:44.090
All right.

623
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:48.680
This is a photograph from the Hubble Space Telescope of empty space.

624
00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:49.430
Uh,

625
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:52.610
they picked a part of the sky in which there was nothing,

626
00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:53.630
uh,

627
00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:54.500
actually that's not true.

628
00:21:54.501 --> 00:21:55.760
There was one star,

629
00:21:55.761 --> 00:21:59.300
one faint star that they knew about a and nothing else.

630
00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:03.080
And they took this space telescope and they looked at it for about three weeks

631
00:22:03.081 --> 00:22:03.914
in a row.

632
00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:04.251
Uh,

633
00:22:04.251 --> 00:22:05.720
and this is the picture they got.

634
00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:06.861
Every,

635
00:22:06.861 --> 00:22:10.130
you can see two or three stars in this picture.

636
00:22:10.131 --> 00:22:11.000
This is one.

637
00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:14.000
And there are a couple of others scattered around.

638
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.361
Uh,

639
00:22:14.361 --> 00:22:17.840
you can tell they're stars because they have this sort of spike pattern from the

640
00:22:17.841 --> 00:22:19.010
optics of the telescope.

641
00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.420
Everything else that you see in this picture is a galaxy.

642
00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.580
There's a whole galaxy.

643
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:26.730
Each one of them would,

644
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:30.500
billions of stars there are there I think a 13,000 of them.

645
00:22:30.501 --> 00:22:31.101
8,000.

646
00:22:31.101 --> 00:22:32.450
How many in the ultra deep field?

647
00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:33.643
I don't remember.

648
00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.270
Uh Huh.

649
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.300
A couple of them are lengths,

650
00:22:38.301 --> 00:22:39.760
but most of them not a,

651
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:42.360
so most of them are just straight up images of it,

652
00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:43.940
straight up images of galaxies.

653
00:22:43.941 --> 00:22:45.770
You can see cc in the bigger ones,

654
00:22:45.771 --> 00:22:47.000
some nice spirals,

655
00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:47.570
uh,

656
00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.910
and all the usual kinds of galaxies,

657
00:22:49.911 --> 00:22:50.570
shapes.

658
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:52.940
This is a really small piece of the sky.

659
00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:54.560
This is a piece of the sky,

660
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:57.380
about 1% of the area of the,

661
00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:58.340
of the full moon.

662
00:22:58.670 --> 00:22:59.290
So,

663
00:22:59.290 --> 00:22:59.780
uh,

664
00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:01.180
if you looked at the f,

665
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:04.640
the whole area covered by the full moon picture of the full moon or up in the

666
00:23:04.641 --> 00:23:06.680
sky and you did this kind of picture,

667
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:09.800
you would discover literally millions of different galaxies.

668
00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:13.490
So this means that you can discover supernovae.

669
00:23:13.491 --> 00:23:15.440
And so there are thousands of supernovae.

670
00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.210
It's thousands of galaxies here.

671
00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.290
If a,

672
00:23:18.291 --> 00:23:22.760
and if a supernovae occur once per every hundred years per galaxy,

673
00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.360
there ought to be about 10 or 20 supernovae going off in this tiny piece of

674
00:23:26.361 --> 00:23:27.800
space right now,

675
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:28.963
uh,

676
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.090
or any other such tiny piece of space.

677
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.030
And so if you're looking for high redshift,

678
00:23:35.031 --> 00:23:35.660
Supernova,

679
00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.750
you don't care where you point there everywhere.

680
00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:42.230
And so you just put pick out some nice blank piece of space,

681
00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:46.460
take really deep pictures of them and wait for the did start showing up.

682
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.300
Uh,

683
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.550
and this is what people people have done.

684
00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.103
Uh,

685
00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.710
so here's here,

686
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:55.260
here's a,

687
00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:55.570
uh,

688
00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:56.110
uh,

689
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:59.390
a little bit of data from the Supernova cosmology project,

690
00:23:59.391 --> 00:24:03.230
which is one of the groups that was attempting to do this in the late 1990s.

691
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:08.060
So in the background here is just a huge field of stars that they happened to be

692
00:24:08.061 --> 00:24:08.894
looking at.

693
00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:14.170
And then they've taken this tiny piece of the sky and blown it up.

694
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.030
So here's their first image of it.

695
00:24:17.031 --> 00:24:17.391
By the way,

696
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:19.010
this and this and this,

697
00:24:19.011 --> 00:24:20.240
these are all galaxies,

698
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:23.360
but they're taken from the ground instead of with the space telescope.

699
00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.830
And so they looked like blobby things.

700
00:24:24.831 --> 00:24:26.480
You can't see any of the structure.

701
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:27.081
Uh,

702
00:24:27.081 --> 00:24:27.914
and then,

703
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.400
uh,

704
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.780
three weeks later they take another picture and it turns out there's a little

705
00:24:32.781 --> 00:24:35.450
extra light on the side of one of the galaxies.

706
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:40.720
Now imagine taking something maybe a hundred times bigger than this whole

707
00:24:41.241 --> 00:24:44.180
background picture and looking for that distance.

708
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:45.343
Uh,

709
00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:49.430
you would make your graduate students completely cross side doing this.

710
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:49.851
Uh,

711
00:24:49.851 --> 00:24:51.350
and so they do it digitally.

712
00:24:51.351 --> 00:24:52.190
They do it differently.

713
00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:54.170
What you do is you take this picture,

714
00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:56.060
each one of these pixels,

715
00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:56.760
you know,

716
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:56.991
uh,

717
00:24:56.991 --> 00:24:59.540
tells you exactly how many photons hit it.

718
00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:00.740
So it's all digitized.

719
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:05.150
And each one of these is a number and you're just take this number and subtract

720
00:25:05.151 --> 00:25:08.210
this number and you take the number from each pixel,

721
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:11.780
subtract the number that you got in the previous,

722
00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:12.290
uh,

723
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:17.030
thing and get a subtracted image of how much light there is minus the light.

724
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:18.770
There was the last time you looked at it.

725
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:20.630
Here's the subtracted picture.

726
00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.250
Now this even a blind old professor can see,

727
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:27.470
has something interesting going on.

728
00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:32.270
There's a new object that has appeared between the first picture in the second

729
00:25:32.271 --> 00:25:33.080
picture.

730
00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.830
Now up at the top in the upper right hand corner there,

731
00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:40.640
that's a Hubble space telescope picture taken of the same field while the

732
00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:42.110
Supernova was in outbursts.

733
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:43.220
And you can see,

734
00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:43.760
uh,

735
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.710
this galaxy here,

736
00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:46.970
that's the galaxy,

737
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.301
you know,

738
00:25:47.301 --> 00:25:49.040
below the Arrow there.

739
00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.000
And then,

740
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:50.331
uh,

741
00:25:50.331 --> 00:25:51.740
those two arrows,

742
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:52.340
uh,

743
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.530
are placed in exactly the same position,

744
00:25:54.531 --> 00:25:55.610
relative position in the,

745
00:25:55.611 --> 00:25:56.660
in these two pictures.

746
00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:57.950
And so in that,

747
00:25:57.951 --> 00:25:59.570
in the Hubble Space Telescope picture,

748
00:25:59.571 --> 00:26:04.040
you can see that the additional light comes from a particular point in the

749
00:26:04.041 --> 00:26:05.450
outskirts of a galaxy,

750
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:09.680
but it wasn't discovered with the Hubble space telescope because the HST doesn't

751
00:26:09.681 --> 00:26:11.540
cover enough of the sky at once.

752
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.510
So you try and discover these things from the ground,

753
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:15.500
uh,

754
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:17.390
because you can cover so much more of the sky.

755
00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.100
So this is a discovery image.

756
00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.050
And then if you want more,

757
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.320
uh,

758
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.670
more precise imaging,

759
00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:27.110
then you have to tell Hubble or I go and look at this particular place anyway.

760
00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:27.650
Uh,

761
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.060
what they do is they keep at it,

762
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:31.300
they keep making you keep at it every three days.

763
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:32.480
They make one of these pictures,

764
00:26:32.481 --> 00:26:36.110
they make these different pictures and they get these nice light curves and out

765
00:26:36.111 --> 00:26:36.980
of those light curves,

766
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:39.140
they can then do the correction factor.

767
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:39.741
Uh,

768
00:26:39.741 --> 00:26:40.590
and uh,

769
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.473
then,

770
00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:42.523
uh,

771
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:43.411
once you've done that,

772
00:26:43.411 --> 00:26:46.110
you also take a spectrum along the way for two purposes.

773
00:26:46.111 --> 00:26:46.591
First of all,

774
00:26:46.591 --> 00:26:47.440
to get the red shift.

775
00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:48.061
Second of all,

776
00:26:48.061 --> 00:26:52.500
to make sure that it's a type one a supernova rather than any of the other five

777
00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:53.520
are six subtypes.

778
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.713
Um,

779
00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.060
and then you put them on this plot,

780
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:58.620
uh,

781
00:26:58.620 --> 00:26:59.460
and uh,

782
00:26:59.461 --> 00:27:00.530
you plot their,

783
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:01.290
uh,

784
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:01.651
uh,

785
00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:06.630
apparent magnitude corrected by these various factors against the red shift.

786
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.380
And that's how you come up with these kinds of data.

787
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:13.890
So that's where,

788
00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:15.390
uh,

789
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:17.100
this information comes from.

790
00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.113
<v 1>MMM.</v>

791
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:26.960
<v 0>And there is,</v>

792
00:27:26.961 --> 00:27:27.681
as you see,

793
00:27:27.681 --> 00:27:29.310
a kind of theoretical reason,

794
00:27:29.311 --> 00:27:34.311
both a theoretical reason ant an observational reason to trust these results.

795
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:35.840
Uh,

796
00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:39.320
so there is a theoretical basis

797
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.570
for thinking these things are standard candles,

798
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:52.960
namely that it's the same amount of fuel each time.

799
00:27:52.961 --> 00:27:54.310
One of these things goes off.

800
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:56.920
And there's also an empirical basis,

801
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.320
which is that,

802
00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:01.680
uh,

803
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:03.300
after some corrections,

804
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:08.360
uh,

805
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.690
the nearby ones line up beautiful.

806
00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:13.340
The nearby ones for which you know,

807
00:28:13.341 --> 00:28:15.350
the answer and advanced by other means,

808
00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:15.921
uh,

809
00:28:15.921 --> 00:28:20.360
the nearby ones line up well and whereby,

810
00:28:20.361 --> 00:28:20.811
well,

811
00:28:20.811 --> 00:28:24.170
I mean less than 5% difference between them.

812
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:25.940
Uh,

813
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.190
and uh,

814
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:28.580
there still is about,

815
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:28.801
uh,

816
00:28:28.801 --> 00:28:30.740
a few percent difference.

817
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.220
Uh,

818
00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:32.780
but if we observe enough of them,

819
00:28:32.781 --> 00:28:36.080
we can average over that and we think we're going to be okay.

820
00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:40.460
So if you want to come up with some kind of explanation for this that does not

821
00:28:40.461 --> 00:28:41.810
involve dark energy,

822
00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:42.620
uh,

823
00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:46.130
you've got to get around both of these points,

824
00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:47.293
namely,

825
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:47.870
uh,

826
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:51.740
the fact that we expect them to look like each other and the fact that they do

827
00:28:51.741 --> 00:28:52.700
look like each other.

828
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:55.430
Now it's possible to do that.

829
00:28:55.431 --> 00:28:56.030
And in fact,

830
00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:58.880
one of the problems on the problem set addresses just this issue.

831
00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.610
If you can invent some way,

832
00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:02.360
the,

833
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:06.770
all of the supernovae at a red shift of 0.8,

834
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.390
high red shifts like that,

835
00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:08.870
uh,

836
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:10.640
are all systematic.

837
00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:15.640
We fainter then otherwise identical looking supernovae in the nearby universe,

838
00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:17.750
then you can get around this problem.

839
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.890
But they have to be identical looking in the sense that they have the same color

840
00:29:21.891 --> 00:29:23.840
and decay rate but are fainter.

841
00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.000
We don't see that in the local,

842
00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.050
in the local universe.

843
00:29:27.051 --> 00:29:32.030
We don't see a category of things which have the same color and decay rate,

844
00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:34.130
but one is fainter than the other.

845
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:35.480
But,

846
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:35.780
uh,

847
00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:36.500
who knows?

848
00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:36.770
Uh,

849
00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:37.581
the universe was,

850
00:29:37.581 --> 00:29:37.970
you know,

851
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:39.380
half its size back then.

852
00:29:39.381 --> 00:29:40.520
All sorts of things were different.

853
00:29:40.521 --> 00:29:45.521
Maybe there's some way that supernovae then we're systematically different from

854
00:29:46.331 --> 00:29:47.470
how they are now,

855
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:52.060
except that they don't show it in these particular ways.

856
00:29:52.061 --> 00:29:54.190
They only show it in the overall brightness.

857
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.353
That's tough.

858
00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:55.991
That's tough.

859
00:29:55.991 --> 00:29:57.970
Theoretically it's tough empirically.

860
00:29:58.330 --> 00:29:58.781
Uh,

861
00:29:58.781 --> 00:29:59.051
you know,

862
00:29:59.051 --> 00:29:59.890
you would expect that.

863
00:29:59.891 --> 00:30:00.491
If that were true,

864
00:30:00.491 --> 00:30:03.760
then there will be intermediate cases that we could see and we don't see them.

865
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.510
Uh,

866
00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:05.440
but you know,

867
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.960
shortly after this and the result was announced,

868
00:30:07.961 --> 00:30:08.710
I used to,

869
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.150
when I was at conferences and stuff,

870
00:30:10.151 --> 00:30:13.660
I would try and take the supernovae people off in a corner and give them beer.

871
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:15.100
And stuff until they would,

872
00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:15.491
you know,

873
00:30:15.491 --> 00:30:15.761
tell.

874
00:30:15.761 --> 00:30:17.440
And then after you give them four beers,

875
00:30:17.441 --> 00:30:18.310
you asked the question,

876
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.900
what could be going wrong?

877
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:20.770
Is it,

878
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.290
do you really believe in dark energy?

879
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.820
And then they start mumbling stuff about all the different weirdnesses that

880
00:30:27.821 --> 00:30:29.170
supernovae have.

881
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:29.980
And of course,

882
00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:33.010
these are people who have devoted their life to studying the weirdness of

883
00:30:33.011 --> 00:30:33.850
supernovae.

884
00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:36.220
And so they have many things that they,

885
00:30:36.221 --> 00:30:36.640
uh,

886
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:36.851
uh,

887
00:30:36.851 --> 00:30:39.370
we'll tell you a under cover of darkness,

888
00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:40.400
uh,

889
00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:40.750
uh,

890
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:41.140
which,

891
00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.590
which of course then everybody went out to try and check.

892
00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:49.740
And none of these things have turned out to be able to provide a satisfactory

893
00:30:50.201 --> 00:30:54.280
explanation for the data except the idea that there's something very significant

894
00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:55.930
cosmologically going up.

895
00:30:57.250 --> 00:30:58.083
Okay.

896
00:30:58.330 --> 00:30:59.163
Uh,

897
00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:04.660
so from that point of view,

898
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.380
uh,

899
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.930
it's kind of hard to avoid believing this,

900
00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.780
which disturbed a lot of people.

901
00:31:10.781 --> 00:31:11.614
And in fact,

902
00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:11.980
uh,

903
00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:13.660
one of the reasons people,

904
00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:14.580
uh,

905
00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:14.950
uh,

906
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:19.950
belief this as quickly as they did was that in the Leighton in 1998 when this

907
00:31:20.351 --> 00:31:21.370
was first announced,

908
00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:22.060
uh,

909
00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:23.890
it was not announced by one group.

910
00:31:23.891 --> 00:31:26.170
It was announced by two different groups.

911
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.920
There were two groups trying to do the same thing,

912
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.790
<v 3>uh,</v>

913
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:32.950
doing the same thing.

914
00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:34.391
And,

915
00:31:34.391 --> 00:31:35.224
uh,

916
00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:38.280
<v 0>they said they were sort of spying on each other cause this was an important</v>

917
00:31:38.281 --> 00:31:38.820
result.

918
00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:43.290
And they both found out at a certain point that the other guys had been spending

919
00:31:43.291 --> 00:31:44.124
a year,

920
00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.073
uh,

921
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:45.480
uh,

922
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.150
driving themselves crazy because they didn't believe their results.

923
00:31:48.151 --> 00:31:48.540
They're saying,

924
00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:48.991
look at this.

925
00:31:48.991 --> 00:31:50.280
These things are getting these,

926
00:31:50.281 --> 00:31:52.200
these things are going totally in the wrong direction.

927
00:31:52.201 --> 00:31:53.640
We must be wrong somehow.

928
00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:57.060
And it turned out that both of these groups had been spending the past year

929
00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:58.470
trying to figure out why they are,

930
00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.270
why their results were so screwed up.

931
00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.300
But then they spied on each other and they found out that the other guys were

932
00:32:03.301 --> 00:32:05.700
having the exact same problem having done,

933
00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:08.880
taking their data and dealt with it and in quite a different way.

934
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:09.690
Uh,

935
00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:10.290
and,

936
00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:10.501
uh,

937
00:32:10.501 --> 00:32:11.334
so then,

938
00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:11.760
uh,

939
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.080
miraculously enough,

940
00:32:13.081 --> 00:32:16.470
they kind of submitted their papers within 24 hours of each other,

941
00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:16.970
uh,

942
00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:18.240
until they both got credit.

943
00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.201
Uh,

944
00:32:19.201 --> 00:32:21.300
and so the two groups doing the same thing,

945
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.801
thanks things,

946
00:32:22.801 --> 00:32:24.450
but doing them differently,

947
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:27.270
different approaches in some ways.

948
00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:29.503
<v 3>Uh,</v>

949
00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.910
got the same result,

950
00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:37.280
<v 0>particular one group where a bunch of particle physicists led by Saul Perlmutter</v>

951
00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:41.000
who had gotten depressed by the fact that the super collider was canceled in the

952
00:32:41.001 --> 00:32:42.190
early 1990s and,

953
00:32:42.191 --> 00:32:42.241
uh,

954
00:32:42.241 --> 00:32:43.020
decided,

955
00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:43.430
uh,

956
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:46.760
that somebody described this as adult onset cosmology,

957
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:47.570
uh,

958
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:50.930
where you used to be interested in particle physics but then they didn't build

959
00:32:50.931 --> 00:32:51.501
your machine,

960
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:53.390
so now you're interested in astrophysics.

961
00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:54.493
Uh,

962
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:55.071
and,

963
00:32:55.071 --> 00:32:55.520
uh,

964
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.390
those guys,

965
00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:57.620
uh,

966
00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.380
those guys took a very particle physics approach to it.

967
00:33:00.381 --> 00:33:02.250
They had a big team with,

968
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.880
with a team leader in a whole hierarchy.

969
00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.580
The other guys were a bunch of Supernova.

970
00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:08.180
Uh,

971
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:08.391
so,

972
00:33:08.391 --> 00:33:12.800
and they were very expert in the cosmology side of things and in the dark energy

973
00:33:12.801 --> 00:33:14.330
explanations and stuff like that.

974
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:16.220
The supernova experts,

975
00:33:16.221 --> 00:33:20.060
the sort of guys who knew all the weirdness is about supernovae formed another

976
00:33:20.061 --> 00:33:20.301
group,

977
00:33:20.301 --> 00:33:21.890
but it was totally differently organized.

978
00:33:21.891 --> 00:33:26.270
It was kind of a loose confederation of small research groups here and there.

979
00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:28.640
They had done this interesting work,

980
00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:29.240
uh,

981
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.790
with the correction factors on supernovae,

982
00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:32.540
uh,

983
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:33.650
some years before.

984
00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:34.400
And,

985
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:34.910
uh,

986
00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:36.170
they approached it as,

987
00:33:36.171 --> 00:33:36.660
you know,

988
00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:36.920
uh,

989
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:37.461
my group,

990
00:33:37.461 --> 00:33:38.450
we'll do this little piece,

991
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:38.931
my group,

992
00:33:38.931 --> 00:33:40.070
we'll do this other little piece,

993
00:33:40.071 --> 00:33:42.890
we'll get together over lunch and we'll figure out what's going on kind of

994
00:33:42.891 --> 00:33:43.340
thing.

995
00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.740
And they both got the same kinds of answers.

996
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.900
They both basically got the same answers.

997
00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.510
Uh,

998
00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:50.000
and so the,

999
00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.500
this is one of the fables.

1000
00:33:51.501 --> 00:33:52.370
So fable,

1001
00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:53.960
uh,

1002
00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.640
discovery of dark energy.

1003
00:33:58.030 --> 00:33:58.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1004
00:33:59.300 --> 00:33:59.770
<v 0>Eh,</v>

1005
00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:04.750
and I would say that the moral here is that replicating

1006
00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:09.280
important results is important.

1007
00:34:09.281 --> 00:34:10.114
Results,

1008
00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:12.183
uh,

1009
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:15.550
is one of the things that leads people to actually believe what you're saying

1010
00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:19.960
leads to a greater acceptance.

1011
00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:22.320
And it was protected.

1012
00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.260
Gillooly nice in this particular case because,

1013
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.860
uh,

1014
00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:27.690
neither of them were replicating the others.

1015
00:34:27.691 --> 00:34:32.691
They both made the discovery independently at the same time using a very

1016
00:34:32.851 --> 00:34:37.851
different kind of organizational structure and a very different approach to

1017
00:34:37.891 --> 00:34:38.431
their data.

1018
00:34:38.431 --> 00:34:40.950
So this was a kind of compelling,

1019
00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:42.473
okay,

1020
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.393
so

1021
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.353
here we are,

1022
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:51.020
Delta m minus M versus redshift.

1023
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:55.040
Here's Omeka matter equals zero.

1024
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:57.710
Omega Lambda Equals Zero.

1025
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:58.280
Uh,

1026
00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.920
except that in fact the data,

1027
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.691
you know,

1028
00:35:02.691 --> 00:35:03.950
they kind of look like this.

1029
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:07.730
So this is Omega matter equals a quarter.

1030
00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.610
And Omega Lambda equals the reports.

1031
00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:15.030
And as you will recall,

1032
00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:21.890
the explanation for this or the first explanation that was offered was the fact

1033
00:35:21.931 --> 00:35:25.650
that Einstein had this figured out 80 years before except he decided he was

1034
00:35:25.651 --> 00:35:26.340
wrong.

1035
00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.560
And so the first explanation of this,

1036
00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:33.360
it was Einstein's cosmological constant.

1037
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:41.060
That's this symbol lambda that I keep writing down.

1038
00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:42.861
And uh,

1039
00:35:42.861 --> 00:35:44.090
so what do people believe?

1040
00:35:44.091 --> 00:35:44.870
This result,

1041
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:49.190
you have to start worrying about what the heck this actually is in real life.

1042
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.300
Uh,

1043
00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:55.300
and it has some very peculiar properties in particular.

1044
00:35:55.510 --> 00:36:00.410
There is the issue of what is constant about Einstein's cosmological constant.

1045
00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.130
So let me first tell you what it is and then I'll tell you why it's so bizarre.

1046
00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:05.240
Uh,

1047
00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.460
it is the energy density.

1048
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:10.250
Remember that's the crucial quantity,

1049
00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:12.253
<v 3>uh,</v>

1050
00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:15.590
of lambda is constant,

1051
00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:17.630
<v 0>uh,</v>

1052
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:18.950
as the universe

1053
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.040
<v 3>expands.</v>

1054
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:25.770
<v 0>So if you take one cubic meter of space and you say,</v>

1055
00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:30.450
how much dark energy is there in this cubic meter of space where you take an

1056
00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:31.250
average cubic meter of space,

1057
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:31.710
uh,

1058
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:32.090
you can,

1059
00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:35.280
you figure that out by how fast the universe is being pushed apart.

1060
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:35.701
Uh,

1061
00:36:35.701 --> 00:36:36.350
and then,

1062
00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:36.820
you know,

1063
00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.900
wait 10 billion years or something like that until the universe is very much

1064
00:36:39.901 --> 00:36:40.610
bigger.

1065
00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:40.980
Uh,

1066
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:43.110
and then you take a cubic meter of space,

1067
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:43.560
uh,

1068
00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:46.110
and you ask yourself how much energy,

1069
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.760
dark energy is in this cubic meter?

1070
00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.510
And you get the same answer 10 billion years later and you've got the same

1071
00:36:51.511 --> 00:36:52.051
answer now,

1072
00:36:52.051 --> 00:36:54.690
and you would have gotten the same answer 10 billion years ago.

1073
00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.210
Very peculiar.

1074
00:36:58.350 --> 00:36:59.183
Right?

1075
00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:00.210
Do you see why,

1076
00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:02.130
think about matter?

1077
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.671
You know,

1078
00:37:02.671 --> 00:37:04.590
the universal also has a bunch of matter in it.

1079
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.193
All right?

1080
00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:06.600
Uh,

1081
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:11.310
so I measured the average density of the universe and the way we've discussed,

1082
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.780
and you get some answer.

1083
00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.270
So for matter,

1084
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:22.820
you can get some density that your universe now and then supposing you imagined

1085
00:37:23.671 --> 00:37:24.091
in your mind,

1086
00:37:24.091 --> 00:37:25.260
you go back in time.

1087
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:26.623
Uh,

1088
00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.820
and to the time when the scale factor of the universe,

1089
00:37:29.821 --> 00:37:33.840
when a was half its present,

1090
00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:36.550
uh,

1091
00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:37.600
uh,

1092
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.261
size,

1093
00:37:38.261 --> 00:37:39.220
it's present of Mount.

1094
00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:40.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1095
00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:41.080
<v 0>Uh,</v>

1096
00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.360
but of course you have the same amount of matter in the universe.

1097
00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:44.020
Matter doesn't,

1098
00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:44.410
you know,

1099
00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:47.380
in general it doesn't get created or at least you have the same amount of matter

1100
00:37:47.381 --> 00:37:48.214
plus energy.

1101
00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:49.030
Uh,

1102
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:51.580
so you go back to when you have the same amount of matter,

1103
00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.900
but it's in half the size,

1104
00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.600
by which I mean a one eighth,

1105
00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.400
the volume right?

1106
00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:00.170
A half squared,

1107
00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:01.590
half cube does innate.

1108
00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:02.450
Uh,

1109
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:06.470
and so if I reduce the linear scale of the universe by a factor of two,

1110
00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:07.640
I have one eighth,

1111
00:38:07.641 --> 00:38:08.474
the volume,

1112
00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:09.500
uh,

1113
00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.240
but same amount of matter.

1114
00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.060
So row then,

1115
00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:18.780
<v 1>okay.</v>

1116
00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:19.590
<v 0>Was,</v>

1117
00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:20.340
uh,

1118
00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:22.620
which is equal to mass,

1119
00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.510
which doesn't change because there's the same amount of mass in the universe,

1120
00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:28.450
which doesn't

1121
00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:29.283
<v 1>change</v>

1122
00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:31.570
<v 0>divided by volume,</v>

1123
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.040
which does change.

1124
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:35.621
<v 3>Uh,</v>

1125
00:38:35.621 --> 00:38:36.160
so it has

1126
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.740
<v 0>to equal eight times the density.</v>

1127
00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:42.430
Now we've talked about this before,

1128
00:38:42.431 --> 00:38:42.731
right?

1129
00:38:42.731 --> 00:38:46.360
The whole deal with the big bang is that if you go back into the past,

1130
00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:48.070
things were dancer than they were today.

1131
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:48.760
Ah,

1132
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.600
also harder,

1133
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:50.340
which is uh,

1134
00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.090
uh,

1135
00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:51.760
a,

1136
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.280
a byproduct.

1137
00:38:53.281 --> 00:38:54.070
If the density,

1138
00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:56.110
you take a big balloon full of stuff,

1139
00:38:56.111 --> 00:38:57.100
you make it smaller.

1140
00:38:57.101 --> 00:38:58.750
The same amount of stuff is in there.

1141
00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:00.790
It's gotta be denser inside the balloon.

1142
00:39:00.791 --> 00:39:02.050
After your squashed it down,

1143
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:04.180
you take a balloon and you stretch it out.

1144
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:06.460
If you don't let stuff come in or out,

1145
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.990
then it has to be less dense af the stuff inside after you've stretched it out.

1146
00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:14.500
And then you get into all these nice little thermodynamics problems where you

1147
00:39:14.501 --> 00:39:18.790
have pressure is equal to density times temperature and things like that.

1148
00:39:18.791 --> 00:39:21.160
So I'll fill all of familiar,

1149
00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:21.730
uh,

1150
00:39:21.730 --> 00:39:23.590
gas physics comes into play.

1151
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:29.400
And so you expect that the density of the universe is constantly getting smaller

1152
00:39:29.831 --> 00:39:33.670
because the universe is getting bigger and in fact there's extremely good

1153
00:39:33.850 --> 00:39:37.900
empirical evidence of that because you look back in time by looking at distant

1154
00:39:37.901 --> 00:39:38.500
things.

1155
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.310
Sure enough,

1156
00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:40.450
it's denser back then,

1157
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:44.110
but not the dark energy.

1158
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.140
Dark energy density,

1159
00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:49.060
at least in Einstein's conception,

1160
00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:53.480
is constant.

1161
00:39:55.350 --> 00:40:00.350
So a cubic meter of the universe has the same amount of dark energy in it.

1162
00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:02.723
Now,

1163
00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:07.590
as a cubic meter of the universe did when the universe was only a cubic meter

1164
00:40:07.591 --> 00:40:08.424
across,

1165
00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:13.020
right where the whole of the observable universe was packed down into a cubic

1166
00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:13.170
meter,

1167
00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:15.360
that cubic meter had only as much dark,

1168
00:40:15.361 --> 00:40:17.070
yet dark energy in it as,

1169
00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:17.550
uh,

1170
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.821
you know,

1171
00:40:17.821 --> 00:40:21.480
at this part of the universe does now very odd behavior.

1172
00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:22.800
Uh,

1173
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.060
but this is what,

1174
00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:24.420
uh,

1175
00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.790
Einstein's equations predict.

1176
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.793
Now

1177
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:31.103
the thing is,

1178
00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.170
we don't know is that Einstein really was right.

1179
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.741
Uh,

1180
00:40:34.741 --> 00:40:37.740
we don't because we don't have a clue what the dark energy actually is.

1181
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:39.270
So let me,

1182
00:40:40.110 --> 00:40:40.471
uh,

1183
00:40:40.471 --> 00:40:45.471
so lambda the cosmological constant suggests that a dark energy has constant

1184
00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.593
density,

1185
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:57.990
but since we don't know what the heck this stuff is,

1186
00:40:57.991 --> 00:40:58.890
maybe that's wrong,

1187
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.233
uh,

1188
00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:02.370
or maybe not

1189
00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:04.453
<v 1>okay.</v>

1190
00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:05.201
<v 0>If it's not,</v>

1191
00:41:05.201 --> 00:41:06.910
we don't call it lambda anymore.

1192
00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:07.983
Uh,

1193
00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:13.270
but if you allow for changes in the density,

1194
00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:18.030
you can get very interesting potential effect.

1195
00:41:18.031 --> 00:41:18.700
And let me,

1196
00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.200
we'll talk about this more next time,

1197
00:41:20.201 --> 00:41:23.830
but let me just describe one at the very strange things that could happen.

1198
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:29.100
Suppose it is true and this is not ruled out by the data we have so far.

1199
00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.680
Suppose that dark energy density

1200
00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.730
increases

1201
00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:41.220
as the universe gets bigger.

1202
00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.990
And since we don't have any idea what this stuff is,

1203
00:41:46.991 --> 00:41:50.830
it might do that and we can't rule it out by observations just yet.

1204
00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:51.371
Uh,

1205
00:41:51.371 --> 00:41:53.650
and so the universe gets bigger and bigger.

1206
00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:56.950
The density of the matter is going down because you have the same amount of

1207
00:41:56.951 --> 00:41:57.560
matter,

1208
00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:57.900
uh,

1209
00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:58.240
in,

1210
00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.350
in a bigger space.

1211
00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:03.670
But supposing we invent some kind of dark energy where the density actually gets

1212
00:42:03.671 --> 00:42:04.180
bigger,

1213
00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.980
as the universe increases in size,

1214
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:07.543
<v 3>then</v>

1215
00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:09.060
<v 0>uh,</v>

1216
00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:12.330
a cubic meter of volume

1217
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:15.530
<v 3>has increasing</v>

1218
00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.360
<v 0>dark energy as time goes along.</v>

1219
00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:20.620
That of course,

1220
00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:22.930
pushes the universe out faster.

1221
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:30.980
So the acceleration increases that makes the size increase.

1222
00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1223
00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.460
<v 0>And you get a feedback</v>

1224
00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:42.560
as the universe exponentially expands,

1225
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:49.740
you're getting exponential expansion.

1226
00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:52.710
And as that exponential expansion,

1227
00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:54.493
<v 3>sorry,</v>

1228
00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:55.613
expansion.

1229
00:42:56.090 --> 00:42:56.510
Yeah.

1230
00:42:56.510 --> 00:43:01.510
<v 0>Has that exponential expansion increases the amount of dark energy in any</v>

1231
00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:02.120
particular cubic meter?

1232
00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.140
Get Speaker too.

1233
00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:05.570
And so what happens after a while,

1234
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:10.580
the dark energy in any cubic galaxy has become so much that it blows the galaxy

1235
00:43:10.581 --> 00:43:11.414
apart.

1236
00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:11.810
Uh,

1237
00:43:11.810 --> 00:43:13.910
gap gravity can't hold the galaxy together.

1238
00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.950
And then the expansion continues.

1239
00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:16.970
And then,

1240
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:17.141
uh,

1241
00:43:17.141 --> 00:43:18.050
after a while,

1242
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.350
the amount of dark energy in one cubic star,

1243
00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:21.890
uh,

1244
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:22.970
if I can use that term,

1245
00:43:23.210 --> 00:43:23.650
uh,

1246
00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:27.090
in one star becomes so great that it overcomes the gravity of the star,

1247
00:43:27.091 --> 00:43:28.250
blows the star apart.

1248
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:30.740
And then the expansion continues even faster.

1249
00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:32.000
And after a while,

1250
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.020
the amount of,

1251
00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:34.123
uh,

1252
00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:37.520
dark energy in a cubic meter that would be a human being,

1253
00:43:37.521 --> 00:43:37.911
remember,

1254
00:43:37.911 --> 00:43:39.380
he'd been human beings have exact,

1255
00:43:39.381 --> 00:43:42.740
are exactly a cubic meter and exactly 100 kilograms in mass,

1256
00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:43.903
uh,

1257
00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:44.750
uh,

1258
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.900
the,

1259
00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:45.260
the,

1260
00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:45.501
uh,

1261
00:43:45.501 --> 00:43:49.790
amount of dark energy and a human being overcomes the chemical bonds that hold

1262
00:43:49.791 --> 00:43:52.070
your body together and human beings get blown apart.

1263
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:56.450
And eventually you have so much dark matter that whole Adams that Adam's get

1264
00:43:56.451 --> 00:43:57.050
blown to bits.

1265
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:59.570
And even the subatomic particles that are,

1266
00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:00.081
uh,

1267
00:44:00.081 --> 00:44:00.521
are we,

1268
00:44:00.521 --> 00:44:03.410
they of them eventually get blown to bits and you'd get,

1269
00:44:03.411 --> 00:44:04.070
and so,

1270
00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:04.370
uh,

1271
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:06.050
dark energy conquers all.

1272
00:44:06.170 --> 00:44:07.003
This is,

1273
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.940
uh,

1274
00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:09.710
described as the big rip.

1275
00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:11.003
Uh,

1276
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:13.400
and it is kind of an alternative,

1277
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:17.900
a hypothesis of what might happen to the universe.

1278
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:18.530
Uh,

1279
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:23.450
that stems from an alternative hypothesis of what the dark energy is,

1280
00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:24.050
uh,

1281
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.210
that there's no particular reason to believe,

1282
00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:27.980
but that hasn't been disproved.

1283
00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:30.890
And since there's no particular reason to believe anything else,

1284
00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.420
you can amuse your students by talking about it.

1285
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:34.140
Uh,

1286
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:34.850
so,

1287
00:44:34.850 --> 00:44:35.340
uh,

1288
00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:40.340
to summarize this here is it's all a question of the scale factor versus time.

1289
00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:42.660
Here's now,

1290
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:43.950
here's one.

1291
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:46.380
Here's an empty universe.

1292
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:47.100
Uh,

1293
00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:50.610
we thought that what would happen is that it would look like this and then

1294
00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:52.230
either collapse or not.

1295
00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:52.830
Uh,

1296
00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:55.500
what actually happened is it turns out,

1297
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:56.833
uh,

1298
00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.150
it turns out things look like this.

1299
00:45:00.151 --> 00:45:02.010
We only really observe it in the past.

1300
00:45:02.011 --> 00:45:04.860
So there's a whole bunch of supernovae proving that that's true.

1301
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:09.240
And you can extrapolate a kind of gentle expansion that looks like this.

1302
00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.820
This is the standard model

1303
00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:14.723
with,

1304
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:15.500
uh,

1305
00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:15.870
uh,

1306
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:17.730
a cosmological constant.

1307
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.150
But if you assume that things get even bigger,

1308
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:21.720
uh,

1309
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.281
that the,

1310
00:45:22.281 --> 00:45:22.410
uh,

1311
00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:25.500
dark energy increases per volume with time,

1312
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.270
then you ask them tonic,

1313
00:45:27.271 --> 00:45:31.500
we go to infinity at some time in the future and you blow everything apart,

1314
00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:33.540
not ruled out.

1315
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.591
Uh,

1316
00:45:34.591 --> 00:45:39.591
and so people are anxious to discover whether that or some other set of crazy

1317
00:45:39.691 --> 00:45:41.160
ideas might be true.

1318
00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:45.600
And we'll talk about how people are going about trying to nail this down next

1319
00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:46.230
time.

1320
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.470
Thanks.
