1
00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.950
Okay,
let's,
uh,
let's start,
let's see.

2
00:00:03.951 --> 00:00:08.840
We started talking about black holes last time and there's now going to be a

3
00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:13.660
problem set that is going to be available later today,
uh,
due next week.
Uh,

4
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.670
and I should also point out that,
uh,
uh,

5
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.310
I've put together this website on black holes,

6
00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:23.930
actually some of the help sheets already,
uh,
uh,
sent you to that,

7
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.280
to that website.
Uh,
and I'll put a link on the classes server as a whole,
but,

8
00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:31.460
but here it is,
uh,
as an actual URL,

9
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:37.030
www.cmigotyale.edu/b h for black holes.

10
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.970
And that website kind of serves as a sort of online textbook for this part of

11
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:47.030
the course.
Uh,
and uh,
uh,
so you have something,

12
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.580
uh,
uh,
something written down to look at for this whole section of the course.

13
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:53.630
And as you'll see,

14
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.500
many of the things we'll be talking about are actually,
uh,

15
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.840
discussed on that website as well,
so you can find out more information there.

16
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.810
Uh,
okay.

17
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.940
Uh,
so I,
last time I defined a black hole.
This is simply something,

18
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.473
uh,

19
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.620
simply something where the escape velocity is faster than the speed of light or

20
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.190
alternatively,
and this is a match to the exact same thing,

21
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.230
the radius of the object is less than the Schwab trilled radius,

22
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.720
which is defined for an object of any given mass.
Uh,

23
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.610
and this isn't particularly extraordinary or interesting,

24
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.703
uh,

25
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.370
as long as the speed of light isn't particularly extraordinary or interesting.

26
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.930
And one of the things that happens when you start talking about relativity is

27
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:55.370
that it turns out the speed of light is a very important quantity.
So,

28
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.080
uh,
this,
these are interesting

29
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.060
because the speed of light is an interesting

30
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.653
<v 1>okay.</v>

31
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.600
<v 0>And,
uh,
we'll talk in a minute about how all this arises.</v>

32
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:15.660
But one of the interesting things about the speed of light is that you can't go

33
00:02:15.661 --> 00:02:19.590
any faster.
It's the,
it's the speed limit and uh,

34
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.110
no physical process can make you go faster than the speed of light.

35
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.330
So C is fastest a velocity possible.

36
00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.150
And the consequence of that is supposing you have one of these black hole thing.

37
00:02:37.151 --> 00:02:40.980
So here's some object and it's got some radius.
Uh,

38
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.210
and its radius and its mass are such that the escape velocity here is greater

39
00:02:46.331 --> 00:02:47.690
than the speed of life.
Uh,

40
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.830
you can imagine that around it is a kind of imaginary sphere.

41
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.700
Let's put it in
and dot.

42
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.980
And this is the,

43
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.670
a sphere where the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light.

44
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.080
Uh,

45
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.080
and you remember what the formula for the escape Velocity v escape is equal to

46
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.500
two.
Gene m over,
uh,
are the square root of,

47
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.200
of,
uh,
to GM over r.
And so if,
uh,
uh,

48
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.880
if on the surface of this object,

49
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.890
the escape velocity is greater than life than that of light,

50
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.850
if you keep moving out are we'll keep getting bigger.

51
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.150
And so eventually you'll come to a point in space,
uh,

52
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:37.840
where the escape velocity is equal to the speed of light.
And,
uh,

53
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.990
this is called a,
the event horizon.

54
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.420
And the reason it's called that is because if nothing can go faster than the

55
00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:49.254
speed of light,

56
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.350
what it means is that any event that takes place inside this imaginary sphere,

57
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.160
uh,

58
00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.930
can't radiate any information about what's going on to the outside.
Because,

59
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.770
uh,
this,
the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light.

60
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:05.910
Light can't escape.

61
00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.630
And because nothing else can go faster than the speed of light,

62
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.340
nothing else can escape.

63
00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.360
And so no information of any kind,

64
00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.200
uh,
can come,
uh,

65
00:04:19.201 --> 00:04:24.201
comes from inside the event horizon to the outside.

66
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:32.683
<v 1>Okay.</v>

67
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.180
<v 0>And so in a certain philosophical sense,
uh,</v>

68
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.210
this event horizon sort of constitutes an edge of the universe because nothing

69
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:46.791
that happens inside can affect what happens outside in any way you can't see in,

70
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.610
you can't detect anything that goes on inside,

71
00:04:50.611 --> 00:04:55.080
no event inside this event horizon,
uh,
uh,
can,

72
00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.330
uh,
tell us,
uh,
about itself or a,
and we,

73
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.690
there's no in principle,

74
00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:05.430
no way we can find out anything about what happens inside an event horizon.
Uh,

75
00:05:05.431 --> 00:05:10.050
it turns out that this rather grandiose statement that the event horizon

76
00:05:10.051 --> 00:05:14.790
constitutes an edge of the universe has a mathematical meaning as well.

77
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.620
The great physicist,
Stephen Hawking,
you may have heard about him.

78
00:05:19.621 --> 00:05:24.600
He's the guy in the wheelchair.
Uh,
his,
uh,
uh,
shorthand,
uh,

79
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.831
his,
uh,
his,

80
00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:29.460
one of his great discoveries was to demonstrate that the mathematics of the

81
00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:33.480
event horizon is actually very similar to the mathematics of another edge of the

82
00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:37.230
universe,
namely the Big Bang,
which is the start of the universe in time.

83
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.800
And so it turns out that this statement that this constitutes an edge of the

84
00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:45.180
universe is not just a philosophical statement having to do with defining the

85
00:05:45.181 --> 00:05:47.610
universe as something we might eventually,

86
00:05:47.611 --> 00:05:50.520
possibly know something about or be influenced by,

87
00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.280
but also has a mathematical meaning as well.

88
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:57.090
And so the way you have to think about the universe is as a kind of Swiss cheese

89
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.360
are holes in it,
there are holes in it which aren't part,
uh,
of,

90
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.630
of our universe where these little event horizons cut,
uh,

91
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.680
cut pieces out.
And,
uh,

92
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.790
it's this kind of thing that gives black holes the kind of extraordinary aura of

93
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:17.630
mystery that they sort of have in,
uh,
in everyday life.
Uh,

94
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.040
various strange things happen inside the event horizon.

95
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.270
And now I better pause cause I just contradicted myself,
right.

96
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.460
Because I said a minute ago that you can't find out anything about what happens

97
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:32.480
in the event horizon.

98
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.070
And now I'm about to tell you what happens inside an event horizon.
Okay?
So,
uh,

99
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.160
it were a 10 or eight minutes into class and already,
uh,
I'm,

100
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.680
I'm contradicting myself.
And so let me explain exactly what I mean by this.

101
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:49.850
Here's what you do.
If you want to make statements about what's going on,

102
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:52.580
on the inside of a,
of one of these things,

103
00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.730
what you do is you take the equations that apply outside the event horizon.

104
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:03.280
You assume that the same equations are going to apply inside the event horizon.

105
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:05.870
Turns out the mathematics of these things.

106
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:08.260
And I'll show you an example of this next week.
Uh,

107
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.890
the mathematics of these things do very bizarre things at the event horizon.
But,

108
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.850
uh,
mathematicians are smart people.
One can cope with these kinds of problems.

109
00:07:16.851 --> 00:07:20.450
At tents,
you tend to have problems like everything gets divided by zero,

110
00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:23.720
right at the event horizon.
Uh,
but as you may recall,

111
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:26.780
if you've done a good pre calculus course,

112
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:31.010
there are ways you can get past those kinds of infinities.
Uh,

113
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:32.760
but everything goes haywire.
A,

114
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:37.520
but if you make the assumption that the same set of equations apply inside the

115
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:41.960
event horizon as outside,
you can then manipulate those equations,

116
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.380
interpret the results as if the symbols mean the same thing inside as they do

117
00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:52.970
outside.
And then make statements about what happens inside the event horizon.

118
00:07:52.971 --> 00:07:55.700
And this looks a lot like physics,
right?

119
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.920
Because you've got a bunch of equations and you know,

120
00:07:57.921 --> 00:08:01.580
some of them Stanford time and some of them stand for space and the energy and

121
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:03.710
all this good stuff.
And,
uh,

122
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.700
you can do manipulations of those equations and then you can make statements

123
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:11.540
about what happens.
Uh,
but it looks like physics.

124
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:15.680
You can make an argument that it isn't actually physics because you're making an

125
00:08:15.681 --> 00:08:18.290
assumption that those equations apply inside there.

126
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:23.290
And that's an assumption that is untestable not even in principle untestable

127
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.770
because,
uh,

128
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.920
you can't ever get any information about what's going on in there to see if

129
00:08:30.921 --> 00:08:35.830
those really are the right equations.
Uh,
and so,
uh,
uh,

130
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.570
here's something where it looks like physics,

131
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:42.470
but depending on what you define the limits of physics to be,

132
00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:46.070
and this is kind of a deep philosophical question that we won't go too far into.

133
00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:46.850
Uh,

134
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.850
it might actually be something that while interesting is really something else.

135
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:56.180
So,
uh,
just a couple of examples of the kinds of things,
uh,

136
00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.310
that you can deduce from the mathematics about what goes on inside a event.

137
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:04.620
Horizons one,
here's something,
um,

138
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.050
all matter,
uh,

139
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:13.320
with are less than the swatch showed radius.
Oh,

140
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.790
this distance here will always be the Schwartz Shield radius by definition,

141
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:22.470
because that's the radius away from an object where the escape velocity is equal

142
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:27.270
to the speed of light.
So all matter inside the truck showed radius collapses

143
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.170
to a single point,
uh,

144
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.650
in a finite amount of time.
So it doesn't take forever to do this.

145
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:38.970
<v 1>Okay.</v>

146
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.600
<v 0>And that point,
since it's got a lot of matter,
but no volume,</v>

147
00:09:42.601 --> 00:09:45.390
that's what a point is.
That's a point of infinite density,

148
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:50.633
<v 1>okay?</v>

149
00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.910
<v 0>Uh,
and this is sometimes called the singularity</v>

150
00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:00.790
and you could see some of the problems with doing mathematics inside,
uh,

151
00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.290
inside event horizons.

152
00:10:02.291 --> 00:10:05.860
If you're trying to calculate the density for this density is mass over volume.

153
00:10:05.861 --> 00:10:09.520
If you've got a bunch of,
of mass in a single point,

154
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:13.210
the volume is zero and you've just divided by zero and you're in all kinds of

155
00:10:13.211 --> 00:10:17.290
trouble.
Um,
so,
uh,
it,

156
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.220
everything collapses down to a,
a point of infinite density.

157
00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:24.460
There's no force strong enough to stop this from happening.

158
00:10:24.461 --> 00:10:28.420
You can't set up a rocket system to keep yourself in or burger.

159
00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.310
Keep yourself from falling down.
Uh,

160
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:34.780
partly that one way of understanding that is that the energy you would exert in,

161
00:10:34.781 --> 00:10:37.690
tried to hold yourself up has a mass equivalent.

162
00:10:37.691 --> 00:10:41.890
You'll recall that e equals MC squared.
So for a given amount of energy,

163
00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:45.490
there's a mass equivalent.
The extra mass just pulls you down more.
Uh,

164
00:10:45.491 --> 00:10:50.050
so you can't bike stent expanding energy.
You can't hold yourself up,

165
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.640
uh,
inside a singularity.
So everything collapses.
It's also true.
This is a,

166
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:58.800
the kind of thing you see in popular accounts of black holes.
Uh,

167
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.700
the statement is sometimes made the properties of space and time are reversed.

168
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:11.640
That's a weird thing to say.
Uh,
what could this possibly mean?
Uh,

169
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.500
well,
let's see.
Uh,
it's related actually to what,

170
00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.880
uh,
what I just said that everything falls down to a singularity in ordinary,

171
00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:24.390
in an ordinary situation,
uh,
we can move around in space.

172
00:11:24.391 --> 00:11:29.100
I can expand energy and move all around,
uh,
in space.
I can move back and forth.

173
00:11:29.101 --> 00:11:32.100
That could jump up and down.
See,
uh,

174
00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:36.020
but you don't have a lot of choice of where you go in time.
Uh,

175
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:40.590
you move forward in time at the rate of one day per day,
right?
Uh,

176
00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:44.660
and you can expand a lot of energy trying to avoid that.
Uh,

177
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.080
and it won't actually do you any good.
So inside an event horizon,

178
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:53.890
you fall down to a singularity.
And as I said,
you could expand a lot of energy,

179
00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:58.210
but it doesn't change your trajectory in space.
So what happens when you,

180
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.270
when you fire off your rocket,
uh,
well in principle,
uh,

181
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.450
providing you believe in all of these equations,

182
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:07.510
you could in principle move around in time.
Uh,

183
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.980
and this is why the science fiction writers like black holes so much because

184
00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.470
it's a kind of scientifically certified time machine.

185
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.120
You're going to the event horizon,

186
00:12:16.121 --> 00:12:18.640
you turn on your energy packed and move all around in time.

187
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.590
And then what they forget to tell you is that you're inside an event horizon.

188
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:28.300
So it does you no good because you can't come out again.
Uh,

189
00:12:28.301 --> 00:12:30.080
and so then,
uh,

190
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.710
the effort is to try and figure out a way that you could have this nice effect

191
00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:38.440
of,
of the time machine without having an event horizon.
And,
uh,
uh,
uh,

192
00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:41.440
in particular there's some interest in whether one can have what's been

193
00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:43.720
described as a naked singularity,

194
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:48.550
a naked singularity as a singularity with no event horizon around it so that you

195
00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:52.330
could get in down to where all the weird physics happens and then come back out

196
00:12:52.331 --> 00:12:53.440
again.
Uh,

197
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.520
caulking proposed what he called the cosmic censorship theorem.
Uh,

198
00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:03.160
that is the statement that naked singularities are not allowed.
Uh,

199
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.600
and uh,
so hence Santra ship,
uh,
can't have naked singularities.

200
00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:08.840
And there is,
uh,

201
00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.720
to this day some dispute over whether that will turn out to be true in general

202
00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:18.190
or not.
Um,
and you can go on in this vein,
you can talk,

203
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.290
uh,
uh,
you can talk on and on about the,
the extraordinary physical,

204
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.273
uh,
uh,

205
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:28.540
events and properties that these things might actually have a,

206
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.400
and what you have to keep in mind as you're doing this is that there's a limit

207
00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.980
to,
uh,

208
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:39.880
how much this could ever even in principle be realized in real life.

209
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:40.301
You know,

210
00:13:40.301 --> 00:13:43.360
you fall into one of these wormholes that they like to have on the science

211
00:13:43.361 --> 00:13:47.680
fiction,
uh,
uh,
in the science fiction stories.
Uh,

212
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.540
and you better have some fairy tricky physics if you're going to be able to come

213
00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:54.310
back out again.
Uh,

214
00:13:54.311 --> 00:13:59.140
and that's not something that the science fiction world typically dwells on,

215
00:13:59.141 --> 00:14:03.490
although it is interesting.
Uh,
you know,
you know the movie contact.

216
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.720
So this is a US based on Carl Sagan is novel of the same name.

217
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:10.840
And one of the things that happens late in this is,
uh,

218
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:14.620
this was the first use I think in science fiction of the concept of a warm hall

219
00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:16.610
where you fall into a,
a,

220
00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:20.470
a black hole and you fall out again somewhere totally different in space and

221
00:14:20.471 --> 00:14:23.890
time.
And there's an interesting story about this,

222
00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.060
that what happened is supposedly was that Sagan,
when he was writing his novel,

223
00:14:28.061 --> 00:14:32.680
got to the point in the novel and he needed something to happen for plot

224
00:14:32.681 --> 00:14:37.600
reasons,
uh,
in order to,
uh,
move the plot forward.
And He,
uh,

225
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:40.720
he saved himself was,
was not an expert in relativity.

226
00:14:40.721 --> 00:14:43.510
So he called up one of his friends who was a guy named Kip Thorne,

227
00:14:43.511 --> 00:14:45.970
one of the most famous general relativity people.
He said,
look,

228
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.560
here's what has to happen in my novel.
Give me some science jargon so that,

229
00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.780
that make this work.
And Thorn,

230
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.650
who was very smart guy thought about this for a while,

231
00:14:54.651 --> 00:14:58.160
came up with this concept of the Wormhole,
uh,
that,
uh,
you know,

232
00:14:58.161 --> 00:15:02.120
you fall into a black hole here and you fall out of it again on the other side.

233
00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.910
Then thorn went away and thought about this for awhile.

234
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.770
At least this is what he claims in his book and said,
you know,
this might work.

235
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:14.480
Uh,
and a whole series of scientific papers flowed from that.

236
00:15:14.481 --> 00:15:19.481
So here is a place where art pushed science art in the form of science fiction.

237
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:22.440
If you consider that art,
uh,

238
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.930
pushes science pushes science forward rather than the other way round,

239
00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:30.980
quite unusual,
uh,
uh,
in that case.
All right.
Um,

240
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.670
so all of this is great,

241
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:38.950
but I want to focus a little bit on,
uh,

242
00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.150
what does it actually mean?

243
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.900
These grand statements that what makes about you can't go faster than the speed

244
00:15:44.901 --> 00:15:47.480
of light space and time are reversed and so forth.
Uh,

245
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:52.690
what actually underlies those statements and to what extent are these sort of

246
00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:56.080
spectacular kinds of phenomena,

247
00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:58.910
actually a realized in the real world.

248
00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:02.780
So I'm an observational astronomer.
Uh,
what right?

249
00:16:02.781 --> 00:16:05.330
Do I even have to talk about black holes?

250
00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:10.310
The number one characteristic of which is that you can't see them at all.
Uh,
so,

251
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:15.200
uh,
that's where we're going to go in a minute.
And to do that,

252
00:16:15.201 --> 00:16:20.000
we have to talk about a relativity special relativity and general relativity,
uh,

253
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:24.920
because those are the theories that underlie all of this.
So,

254
00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.700
uh,
before we go plunging into that,
let me,
uh,
uh,

255
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.610
pause for questions at this point.

256
00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.103
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

257
00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:38.443
<v 0>Yes.</v>

258
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

259
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.600
<v 0>Yes,
you should be,
uh,
uh,
yeah.</v>

260
00:16:43.601 --> 00:16:47.520
So the quote a little confused about why space and time are reversed.
Uh,

261
00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.310
let me not answer that now because there's,

262
00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:54.150
there's math next week which will make that a little bit clearer.

263
00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:58.160
I think it is a legitimate question,
not just to ask,
uh,

264
00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:03.130
why are space and time reverse?
But what that even could mean.
Uh,
and,

265
00:17:03.131 --> 00:17:05.070
and we'll get back to that in a little while.

266
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.810
Yes,
go ahead.
Singularity.

267
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.620
It doesn't stay in den Steven Neutral,
right?
And doesn't do,

268
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:17.390
so supposing you have,
for example,

269
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:21.740
a neutron star that's a little bit smaller than it's,
uh,
uh,
uh,

270
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:23.660
then it's event horizon.

271
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:27.260
Why wouldn't it just stay there inside it to vent horizon rather than collapsing

272
00:17:27.261 --> 00:17:28.700
down?
Uh,
and again,

273
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.690
this is a calculation that I don't think I can demonstrate for you,
but it,

274
00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.060
it comes about because the,
the energy,

275
00:17:35.061 --> 00:17:39.200
the pressure forces that would have to hold it up actually also contribute to

276
00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:43.190
the mass of the thing.
And if you then compute the,
uh,
the balance,

277
00:17:43.191 --> 00:17:47.360
the hydrostatic equilibrium that we were talking about last time,
it never works.

278
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:51.780
It can't work because the amount energy required to hold it up is so great that

279
00:17:51.781 --> 00:17:56.310
the mass equivalent is going to generate a additional gravitational forces.

280
00:17:56.311 --> 00:17:59.370
And if this were a different kind of course,
I do the calculation,
but,

281
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:01.590
but let's not go there.
Uh,

282
00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:08.590
<v 2>yes.
Yeah,</v>

283
00:18:08.591 --> 00:18:11.530
I would say no,
no,
that's fine.
Yeah.

284
00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:17.560
<v 0>Well,
the thing is,
uh,
in,
in our normal situation,</v>

285
00:18:17.561 --> 00:18:22.180
we have no choice about where we go in time and the statement that I made,

286
00:18:22.181 --> 00:18:25.290
which I didn't back up in any way to,
uh,

287
00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:28.420
that a rational person would really want to believe me.

288
00:18:28.421 --> 00:18:32.800
But let me make this statement again.
Inside the event horizon,
uh,
you can,

289
00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:36.940
you can move around in time.
You don't necessarily have to go have to go forward.

290
00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.860
Uh,
and,
uh,

291
00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:43.750
that is the thing that is the piece of the picture that the science fiction

292
00:18:43.751 --> 00:18:48.250
writers tend to tend to hone in on.
Um,
and so,
uh,

293
00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.810
you know,
the statement is made about John,
about relativity and I'll,

294
00:18:52.811 --> 00:18:56.050
and I'll make this explicit and then a little while,
uh,

295
00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:01.150
time is the fourth dimension.
Uh,
you know,
there are three space dimensions,

296
00:19:01.151 --> 00:19:06.130
one time dimension,
a new a,
and you can do all sorts of calculations that way,

297
00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.750
but it's perfectly clear just from everyday life that the time dimension is not

298
00:19:10.751 --> 00:19:14.740
the same as the space dimensions because we don't have the opportunity to move

299
00:19:14.741 --> 00:19:19.240
around it.
So it must be true then are in a certain sense time.

300
00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:24.100
Uh,
the time dimension,
if you want to call it that,
of the space time continuum,

301
00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.390
uh,
must somehow behave differently from the spatial components.
And they do.

302
00:19:28.391 --> 00:19:31.270
And I'll show you why in a little while.
Uh,

303
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.590
and that behavior,
uh,

304
00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.700
is reversed between space and time inside,
uh,
inside the event horizon.

305
00:19:39.701 --> 00:19:43.300
Things that are positive terms in the equation become negative and vice versa.

306
00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.780
And as I say,
we'll actually,
I'll actually write some of this down.

307
00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.420
<v 2>Yeah.
Since you can escape it,</v>

308
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.980
the black hole is one of the possible scenarios for the end of the university,

309
00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:57.430
like at all matter of being in the form of law.

310
00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:01.550
<v 0>Okay.
So since nothing can escape from,
uh,
from a black hole,</v>

311
00:20:01.551 --> 00:20:04.430
is that a possible end of the universe?
Yes.
Uh,

312
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.460
one of the potential ways the universe could evolve,

313
00:20:07.461 --> 00:20:10.070
the universe is expanding right now.
Again,

314
00:20:10.071 --> 00:20:12.500
this is now in the third part of the course.
We'll talk about this.

315
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.410
The universe is expanding,
but it's got a lot of matter in it.

316
00:20:15.411 --> 00:20:18.260
So in principle it could stop expanding and collapsing.
Uh,

317
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.400
you could ask the question,

318
00:20:19.401 --> 00:20:22.940
does the universe expand faster than its own escape velocity or not?

319
00:20:22.941 --> 00:20:25.620
And this is a question that can not only be asked but answer,

320
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.960
it could expand slow down,
stop,
fall,
back together again.

321
00:20:29.961 --> 00:20:32.600
And if that happens at a certain point when it fell together,

322
00:20:32.601 --> 00:20:34.940
the whole universe would be incited to vent horizon.

323
00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:40.430
Now how that would affect those of us who are inside a is a,

324
00:20:40.431 --> 00:20:44.660
is a little less clear.
Eventually you'd get crushed.
Right.
But,
uh,
uh,

325
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:46.990
because nothing would be able to stop the,
uh,

326
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:51.100
inexorable collapse down to a singularity.
Yeah.
At that point.
But yeah,

327
00:20:51.101 --> 00:20:54.790
that is a potential end of the universe is we all end up inside a big event

328
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:57.880
horizon.
We all collapse down to a singularity in the middle.
Uh,

329
00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.490
it turns out that isn't what's going to happen,

330
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.440
at least not from current observations.

331
00:21:02.441 --> 00:21:06.190
The current observations is that the universe is expanding faster than its own

332
00:21:06.191 --> 00:21:07.001
escape velocity.

333
00:21:07.001 --> 00:21:09.850
So you have the opposite Andy Point where it just keeps getting bigger and

334
00:21:09.851 --> 00:21:13.890
bigger and more and more diffuse and sparse and cold and boring.
Uh,

335
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:17.230
and the universe ends that way.
But again,
that's part three of the course.

336
00:21:17.231 --> 00:21:18.760
We'll get there.
Yes.

337
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.840
Where does all the Masco when it collapses,
the mass is still there.

338
00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:28.900
The mass is still there.
And this is actually a very important,

339
00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.060
important point because,
uh,

340
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:35.320
things can still be in orbit around a black hole and not fall in.

341
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:39.280
Because when you're far enough away,
when you're outside the event horizon,

342
00:21:39.281 --> 00:21:43.390
it just behaves like any other mass.
Black holes can move through space.

343
00:21:43.391 --> 00:21:45.010
They can orbit around other things.

344
00:21:45.011 --> 00:21:49.420
Things can orbit around then if the sun turned into a black hole right now,

345
00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.460
uh,
well we would freeze.
But,
uh,
aside from that,
uh,
the orbit of the earth,

346
00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.730
if the sun turned into a black hole of the same mass as the earth,
uh,

347
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:03.750
the orbit of the Earth wouldn't change because we're far enough away that it

348
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:06.460
just seems like any other mass down there.

349
00:22:06.461 --> 00:22:10.500
So a solar mass black hole could have a planet in exactly the same more,

350
00:22:10.501 --> 00:22:12.280
but as the earth is around the sun,

351
00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:16.960
this is one of the differences between how black holes actually behave and the

352
00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:20.260
metaphorical use of black holes.
But,
uh,
you know,

353
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.790
this is one of those words that gets used in common culture for various things

354
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.380
and it usually carries a connotation of a kind of great sucking thing that pulls

355
00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:34.300
everything in a inexorably.
That's true inside the event horizon,

356
00:22:34.301 --> 00:22:37.910
which is where this idea arises from.
But if you're outside the event horizon,

357
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:41.110
you could just keep going around in circles around it and exactly the same way

358
00:22:41.111 --> 00:22:43.480
that you can be in orbit around any other kinds of mass.

359
00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:50.450
Why is there no volume?
Ah,
okay.
So why is there no volume?
Uh,

360
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.180
w with this stuff at this center,

361
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.020
if there's nothing to think and think about what we were talking about,

362
00:22:56.021 --> 00:22:57.790
hydrostatic equilibrium the other day,

363
00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:02.530
if there's nothing to stop the collapse every,

364
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:06.070
if there's no energy or pressure force sufficient to stop the collapse,

365
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.860
everything has to end up in the same place.

366
00:23:08.861 --> 00:23:12.580
It all falls to the center and you can calculate how long that will take.

367
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.060
And after that happens,
all the mass is down at the center.
Uh,

368
00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:22.060
and what does it mean to be the center?
It's the central point.
Now,
in fact,

369
00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.860
there's gotta be this,
this is how it works in relativity.

370
00:23:26.861 --> 00:23:29.890
Relativity does not incorporate quantum mechanics.

371
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.220
Quantum mechanics does funny things when things get small.

372
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:37.900
And so it is likely that there are physical effects that we don't understand at

373
00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:41.890
the quantum level before you get to precisely the same point.

374
00:23:41.891 --> 00:23:44.650
But we don't know what they are because that would require a theory that

375
00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:48.680
encompasses special,
a general relativity and quantum mechanics at the same time.

376
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:52.190
And until the strength he has finished their work,
we don't have such a theory.

377
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:57.020
Uh,
so probably something happens to prevent a pure point,

378
00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.200
but we don't know what it is.
And so from the point of view on the outside,

379
00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:03.710
you just imagine everything falling down toward his central point and kind of

380
00:24:03.711 --> 00:24:07.700
landing there in some way.
But it is a mystery.
Uh,
yes.

381
00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:12.503
<v 2>Okay.</v>

382
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.540
<v 0>Uh,
the unit is the universe finite.
Yes.
Uh,</v>

383
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.420
it's got it.
In fact,
you know,

384
00:24:20.421 --> 00:24:25.220
it has to be finite because the sky is dark at night.
Uh,
let me explain that.

385
00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:30.460
If the universe were infinite and had stars distributed at random throughout the

386
00:24:30.771 --> 00:24:35.450
universe,
then any direction you looked at,
you'd eventually,
uh,

387
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:37.340
see the surface of a star.

388
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:41.630
You could do this in a calculus kind of way by integrating over the total light

389
00:24:41.631 --> 00:24:43.010
of the universe.
Uh,

390
00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:48.070
and so it can't be infinite in extent and filled with stars the same,

391
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.780
uh,
as,
uh,
as stars like the sun or,

392
00:24:51.781 --> 00:24:54.950
or any kind of star really that is distributed evenly.

393
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:58.250
So one of several things must be the case,

394
00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.590
either the universities in homogeneous.

395
00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:04.150
That is to say we live in a very special place where there are stars after a

396
00:25:04.151 --> 00:25:08.990
while,
there are no stars anymore or it has to be finite in extent.

397
00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:14.140
It only goes out a certain distance and stops or it has to be finite in time.

398
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:19.690
That is to say it began a certain number of years ago and a and didn't exist

399
00:25:20.211 --> 00:25:23.270
before that that helps you because then you only if it's,

400
00:25:23.271 --> 00:25:25.370
if the universe is 13 billion years old,

401
00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:29.480
you only see things that are within 13 billion light years because the light

402
00:25:29.481 --> 00:25:33.620
hasn't had a chance to travel.
Uh,
it turns out that it's pro,
uh,

403
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:36.440
the easiest way to understand this is it's the ladder.
Uh,

404
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:40.940
the universe had a beginning and this is the whole idea of the big bang that it

405
00:25:40.941 --> 00:25:45.941
started as some kind of very small object and then expanded at some finite and

406
00:25:47.391 --> 00:25:50.930
indeed calculable time ago.
The Universe is now thought to be,

407
00:25:50.931 --> 00:25:55.310
I think it's 13.7 plus or minus point 4 billion years old.
Uh,

408
00:25:55.311 --> 00:25:59.270
and so the finiteness of the universe at the moment is,

409
00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:04.070
uh,
the primary reason it's finite is that it's finite in time.

410
00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:07.010
Not so much that it's finite in space,
but it has to be,

411
00:26:07.011 --> 00:26:10.340
it has to be limited in some way or you'd see an infinite amount of starlight.

412
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:17.143
<v 2>Okay.</v>

413
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.620
<v 0>Excellent.
With the universe is finite.
What's outside the universe?</v>

414
00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:26.590
That is exactly the right question.
Uh,
I can't answer that because,
uh,

415
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.260
although I will try and section three of the course,
we'll,

416
00:26:29.261 --> 00:26:32.750
we'll learn much more about this stuff.
I can't answer that because you know,

417
00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:37.550
what is the universe?
The Universe is what we can study scientifically.
And,

418
00:26:37.790 --> 00:26:42.350
uh,
so the very first question that is sets up a person has about,
you know,

419
00:26:42.351 --> 00:26:45.120
the Big Bang of the finite universe is what's outside it.

420
00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:50.450
And that's actually not a science question because it intrinsically unanswerable

421
00:26:51.481 --> 00:26:53.100
by scientific means.

422
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:57.120
Now there are things you can say about it just as you could.

423
00:26:57.121 --> 00:27:00.360
There are things you can say about the inside of an event horizon and you can

424
00:27:00.361 --> 00:27:03.570
base them on scientific ideas and scientific thinking.

425
00:27:03.571 --> 00:27:07.230
And you can say these nice things about space and time and one can say similar

426
00:27:07.231 --> 00:27:11.810
things about,
uh,
uh,
what's outside the universe and,
uh,
you know,

427
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.620
how it might've come to be and so forth.

428
00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:18.890
But you've done a little epistemological shift when you start talking about

429
00:27:19.711 --> 00:27:23.310
those kinds of things cause you're no longer talking about things that even in

430
00:27:23.311 --> 00:27:26.640
principle can be verified by observation or experiment.
Uh,

431
00:27:26.641 --> 00:27:28.710
so I do have some things to say about that.

432
00:27:28.711 --> 00:27:32.310
I'll say it in the third part of the course when we talk about the universe.
Uh,

433
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:33.450
but,
uh,

434
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:37.530
you should think about what I have to say about that in a different way.

435
00:27:37.531 --> 00:27:38.364
From what you,

436
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.210
from what you think about what I have to say about how planets orbit around the

437
00:27:42.211 --> 00:27:46.050
Sun.
Uh,
we'll,
we'll,
we'll come back to this later.
Yes,
go ahead.

438
00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:50.223
<v 2>How did they,</v>

439
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.120
<v 0>how do they find that?
That's the next three weeks of the course,</v>

440
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:58.270
that person and in fact,
that is the subject of my research.
Uh,

441
00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:01.140
this is what I do for a living.
I find black holes and I'll tell you how,

442
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:02.580
I'll tell you how it's done.
We can,

443
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:07.170
we can see if we can find another one over the next few weeks or so.
Yes,

444
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.593
<v 2>no.</v>

445
00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:21.370
<v 0>Ah,
is it possible that we are inside an event horizon and we don't know it?
Uh,</v>

446
00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:25.150
yes.
In that,
um,
uh,
again,

447
00:28:25.151 --> 00:28:27.250
this relates to the question that was asked over here.

448
00:28:27.251 --> 00:28:30.430
Could it be that the universe is going to ultimately collapse and be inside a

449
00:28:30.431 --> 00:28:34.110
black hole supposing that happen?
Supposing,
uh,

450
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.170
we were in the collapsing phase of universe gradually over many billions of

451
00:28:38.171 --> 00:28:41.860
years falling down to some singularity.
We would not necessarily know that.

452
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:47.070
Now if you approach a black hole that is of the size of a star or even the size

453
00:28:47.711 --> 00:28:51.550
of a galaxy,
uh,
when you got close,
you'd feel it.

454
00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:55.390
And the way you'd feel it is if you're falling in your feet would be closer to

455
00:28:55.391 --> 00:28:56.230
the center,
then your,

456
00:28:56.260 --> 00:29:00.580
then your head and the gravitational force on your feet would be SIF stronger

457
00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:03.520
than that on your head and you'd stretch.
Uh,

458
00:29:03.521 --> 00:29:08.521
and so if we were really near to a black hole of a size,

459
00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.250
uh,
of objects,
we understand,

460
00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:16.450
then we'd know that because the tidal forces on our bodies would,
uh,

461
00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.340
would mean that we couldn't keep ourselves together.

462
00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:22.660
But you can imagine a sufficiently big black hole kind of encompassing the whole

463
00:29:22.661 --> 00:29:26.710
universe that wouldn't affect us in that way.
Uh,
so it's not inconceivable.

464
00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:33.030
<v 2>Yeah.
First implies like two direction.</v>

465
00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:37.210
<v 0>Yeah.
Oh
yeah.
So the,</v>

466
00:29:37.211 --> 00:29:41.090
the word reverse in this reverse space and time.
Uh,

467
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:46.540
how about this?
Uh,
I agree that,
that,
that wording might not be,

468
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.420
I've seen this wording used,
which is why I used it,
but I,

469
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:52.900
I agree that it might not be the best wording one could use.

470
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:57.160
How about the properties of space and the properties of time are interchanged

471
00:29:57.161 --> 00:30:01.720
with each other.
That's a den.
It doesn't have this kind of directional thing.

472
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:05.710
It's about how these,
uh,
uh,
how these things behave.

473
00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:10.693
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

474
00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.400
<v 3>Is the earth get me?
He's from other stars?</v>

475
00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.830
<v 0>Yes.
Well,
of course we do a,
if you look out in the sun in the sky,</v>

476
00:30:17.831 --> 00:30:20.800
you see starch when we see the radiation from those stars.

477
00:30:20.801 --> 00:30:24.880
And so of course there's a radiation in all forms.
He and otherwise,

478
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:29.890
the fraction of the radiation that we get from sources other than the sun is

479
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:31.270
extremely small.

480
00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.450
<v 3>The vegetable at all,
like at night.
Would it be cold?
No.</v>

481
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.990
<v 0>No,
because,
uh,
and,
and here's why.</v>

482
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:43.110
Because the second most prominent source of heat that we have is actually

483
00:30:43.751 --> 00:30:45.700
geothermal heat from the center of the earth.

484
00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:50.980
And that's vastly more than the sum of all contributions by stars.

485
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:55.660
And it's vastly less than what we get from the,
from our own son.
Uh,
and so,

486
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:59.260
you know,
radioactivity and the,
and the latent heat and the core of the earth.

487
00:30:59.261 --> 00:31:02.590
That's,
that's by far more than anything that comes to us from the start.

488
00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:07.180
But we certainly do get energy radiation from the stars if we didn't,

489
00:31:07.181 --> 00:31:09.700
astronomers would be out of business.
Cause this is how we,
uh,

490
00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:12.790
this is how we study them by looking at the radiation.
Yeah.

491
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.620
<v 3>Okay.
So let's,
let's say that you're inside the event horizon a black hole.
And,</v>

492
00:31:16.621 --> 00:31:17.990
um,
as I remembered,

493
00:31:17.991 --> 00:31:21.810
this circular velocity of any object is less than the escape velocity.

494
00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:25.140
So couldn't you theoretically orbit the black hole inside the event horizon?

495
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.180
<v 0>Excellent question.
Could you orbit it?</v>

496
00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:32.310
Could you get yourself into a stable orbit,
uh,
inside,
uh,

497
00:31:32.311 --> 00:31:35.700
an event horizon?
If everything were in work?

498
00:31:35.701 --> 00:31:39.120
The way Newtonian mechanics says it works,
you could,
uh,

499
00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:41.190
but it turns out they're relativistic.
Correction.

500
00:31:41.191 --> 00:31:44.400
There is something called the smallest circular,

501
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.580
smallest state inner most circular stable orbit.

502
00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:52.200
I C A.
I.
S.
C.
O.
N,

503
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:55.530
most stable circular orbit.
That's important,
uh,

504
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.230
because that actually can be observed in various ways.

505
00:31:58.231 --> 00:32:00.170
And we'll talk about this in two weeks time.
Uh,

506
00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:03.930
the inner most staple circular orbit turns out to be outside the event horizon.

507
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.070
Uh,
but you're right,
if you were only using Newtonian calculations,

508
00:32:08.071 --> 00:32:10.740
there would be that square root of two when you could imagine being in a

509
00:32:10.741 --> 00:32:14.540
circular orbit inside the event horizon.
But that's one of the things that,
uh,

510
00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:17.340
is different about the relativistic calculation.

511
00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:21.150
It turns out that for non rotating black holes,

512
00:32:21.151 --> 00:32:24.350
the inner most stable circular orbit is three times the,
uh,

513
00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:25.350
Schwab chilled radius.

514
00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:28.203
<v 2>Yes.</v>

515
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.620
It seems like there'd be a very real possibility.

516
00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:39.380
<v 0>Ah,
yes.
Uh,</v>

517
00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:44.410
so is there a potential for a black hole to accumulate an infinite amount of

518
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:49.820
mass,
which is the sort of vacuum cleaners scenario?
Um,
first of all,

519
00:32:49.821 --> 00:32:53.390
there isn't an infinite amount of mass in the universe necessarily.
Universities,

520
00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:57.740
finite,
uh,
second of all,
uh,

521
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:58.940
even if there was,

522
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:04.100
if there was a huge black hole here and something else outside the event horizon

523
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:08.390
that's moving faster than the escape velocity of this thing,
at that point,

524
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:09.650
then it doesn't fall in.

525
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:15.250
So it's not necessarily true that it will pile up an infinite amount of mass.

526
00:33:15.441 --> 00:33:20.090
In fact,
black holes,
typic black holes ought not to have infinite mass.

527
00:33:20.091 --> 00:33:24.840
They ought to have a particular amount of mass.
They'll gain more,
uh,

528
00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.200
as stuff falls in.
But if stuff doesn't fall in,

529
00:33:27.201 --> 00:33:30.240
if it's moving faster than the escape velocity,
then they won't accumulate it.

530
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.613
<v 2>You haven't observed?</v>

531
00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:36.670
<v 0>Well,
it depends what you have.
We observed extremely massive black holes.</v>

532
00:33:36.671 --> 00:33:40.240
It depends what you mean by extremely massive.
The massive,

533
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:42.490
most massive black holes that we know anything about,

534
00:33:42.491 --> 00:33:46.450
or about 3 billion times the mass of the sun.
Uh,
so that's pretty massive,

535
00:33:46.451 --> 00:33:50.140
but it's about the same as an ordinary galaxy.
Uh,
and we,

536
00:33:50.141 --> 00:33:54.460
what we don't have evidence for is,
uh,

537
00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:59.490
black holes that are substantially more massive than a whole galaxies of stars.

538
00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.790
We don't,
there's no evidence for that.
So they're basically,
just to jump ahead,

539
00:34:03.791 --> 00:34:07.420
there are basically two kinds of black holes that we have empirical evidence
for.

540
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:11.410
One are black holes,
the uh,
about 10 times the mass of the sun,

541
00:34:11.411 --> 00:34:13.330
so masses of individual stars.

542
00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.790
And then there are the so called supermassive black holes,

543
00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:18.070
which are the masters of whole galaxies.

544
00:34:18.071 --> 00:34:21.100
And those are the kinds of black holes for which we have direct evidence at the

545
00:34:21.101 --> 00:34:22.180
moment.
Yes.

546
00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:25.533
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

547
00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:31.240
<v 0>Okay.</v>

548
00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:35.710
So is it possible to detect the presence of a black hole by looking at things

549
00:34:35.711 --> 00:34:39.900
around it?
Yes,
that's exactly what is done.
And we'll just,

550
00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.880
I'll describe this in the next couple of weeks.
Uh,

551
00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.610
but it doesn't happen the way you suggest.

552
00:34:45.611 --> 00:34:47.770
It's not like something suddenly disappears.

553
00:34:47.771 --> 00:34:50.680
So we know it fell into the event horizon.

554
00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:55.300
What you do is you see these things in stable orbits around that are perfectly

555
00:34:55.301 --> 00:34:59.290
happy going around in circles around the black hole.
Uh,
for example,

556
00:34:59.291 --> 00:35:00.700
you can see binary stars,

557
00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:04.150
double stars in which there's a black hole in something else and these things

558
00:35:04.151 --> 00:35:05.350
are in nice stable orbits.

559
00:35:05.351 --> 00:35:10.351
And you infer the properties of one object by looking at the motion of the other

560
00:35:10.421 --> 00:35:14.100
object.
That's exactly what we did for the planets.
Uh,

561
00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:15.900
and so you can do that again for blocks

562
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:19.023
<v 2>disappeared,</v>

563
00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:25.290
<v 0>uh,
if,
if you actually saw something disappearing.
Um,</v>

564
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.710
yeah.
Uh,
and in fact there is,
uh,

565
00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:33.570
there is indirect evidence that there's material falling through that in some

566
00:35:33.571 --> 00:35:36.690
systems there is material currently falling through,
uh,

567
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:41.080
the horizon of black holes.
And in fact,
that's one of the things that is a,

568
00:35:41.081 --> 00:35:44.830
a current topic of active research is can you demonstrate that,
uh,

569
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.850
if there were a black hole in our own solar system anywhere near us,

570
00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:51.510
we'd know it.
Uh,
and the reason we'd know it is that's a lot of mass.

571
00:35:51.511 --> 00:35:55.860
It would disrupt the orbits of the planet.
And as long as the planets are,

572
00:35:55.861 --> 00:35:57.730
and so we have a kind of early warning system,

573
00:35:57.731 --> 00:36:02.250
but for black hole cruises by Pluto's orbit gets disturbed first.

574
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:06.140
And so all of those nice objects out there in the Kuiper belt,
uh,

575
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:10.320
their orbits would go all haywire if something as ma as massive as a stellar

576
00:36:10.321 --> 00:36:13.100
mass black hole were accidentally to come,
uh,

577
00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:16.860
come nearby in exactly the same way there would be as if an ordinary star of the

578
00:36:16.861 --> 00:36:19.680
same mass where to,
where to come by.
You wouldn't be able to see it,

579
00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:23.560
but the orbits of everything would be changed rather drastically.
So,
uh,

580
00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:27.870
the odds of us actually falling into a black hole are extremely small.

581
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:32.820
And if it were to happen,
we'd get of great deal of advanced notice.
So,

582
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:36.600
and not to worry,
uh,
there are astronomical things you may be,

583
00:36:36.601 --> 00:36:40.230
should worry about asteroids crashing into the earth.
This isn't one of them.

584
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.470
Actually.
Uh,

585
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:47.520
Bethany Cobb and I were on a TV show that explored this particular possibility.

586
00:36:47.521 --> 00:36:49.950
This was a wonderful thing happened last summer,
uh,

587
00:36:49.951 --> 00:36:53.610
where ABC news decided to have a two hour special on all the different ways the

588
00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:57.810
earth could be destroyed.
And they called us up and we went out to New York.

589
00:36:57.811 --> 00:37:00.570
It was very entertaining and tie.
And I,
I,
you know,

590
00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.540
but I was too much of a scientist.
I kept saying,
it isn't going to happen.

591
00:37:03.541 --> 00:37:05.070
You shouldn't worry about it.
You know,

592
00:37:05.071 --> 00:37:07.800
you should worry about the asteroids and global warming and all this kind of

593
00:37:07.801 --> 00:37:12.000
stuff.
Don't be worrying about black holes coming,
rolling in.
And of course,

594
00:37:12.001 --> 00:37:15.900
the consequence of that is that I didn't get a lot of screen time,
uh,
and the,

595
00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:19.380
and the guys from the American Museum of natural history who are better at

596
00:37:19.381 --> 00:37:23.340
popularizing science than I am,
uh,
got all the screen time.
So,
you know,

597
00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:25.290
I know better now.
We'll,
we'll,
uh,

598
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:30.100
we'll speak in better sound bites next time round.
Uh,
yeah,
that was fun.
Uh,

599
00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.590
we should screen it,
or at least the first part,

600
00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:41.850
other questions all will become clear in due time.

601
00:37:41.851 --> 00:37:46.830
Actually that's not true,
but some things will become clear in realtime.
Gosh,

602
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:50.730
this was great.
Excellent.
All sorts of questions.
Um,

603
00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:55.810
so now,
uh,
let me at least start,
uh,

604
00:37:56.010 --> 00:38:00.690
talking about special relativity.
Uh,
there are two kinds of relativity.

605
00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:05.490
There's special relativity and special relativity,

606
00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:09.420
which was devised in,
uh,

607
00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.560
uh,
in 1905 by,
uh,
by Einstein.

608
00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:16.410
This is essentially a set of laws of motion.

609
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:21.680
So it's the same thing as Newton's laws of motion only.

610
00:38:22.891 --> 00:38:27.360
It's a more elaborate version of it.
So it's substitutes,
if you will,

611
00:38:27.450 --> 00:38:31.710
for Newton's laws of motion and in fact incorporates Newton's laws of motion.

612
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.600
Then there's general relativity,
uh,

613
00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:39.550
discovered about 10 years later again by Einstein.

614
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:45.060
Uh,
and this is the equivalent of a law of gravity.

615
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:47.400
You'll remember that the way,

616
00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:48.550
<v 1>yeah.</v>

617
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.850
<v 0>Uh,</v>

618
00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:53.850
one has to calculate orbits in the Newtonian theory is you take Newton's law of

619
00:38:53.921 --> 00:38:57.560
gravity and you plug it into Newton's laws of motion.
Uh,

620
00:38:57.640 --> 00:39:02.290
so this is a change or an enhancement in the laws of motion.

621
00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:07.500
This is a change or an enhancement in the law of gravity in both of these cases,

622
00:39:07.961 --> 00:39:09.290
and this is important to,

623
00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:13.720
to realize it doesn't overturn what Newton did.

624
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:17.320
This is a misconception about how scientific revolutions work.

625
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:22.000
This is as revolutionary a set of ideas as you could possibly imagine.

626
00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:25.960
And yet Newton's laws are still still whole.

627
00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.580
They don't overturn them.

628
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:31.930
What they do is they say Newton's laws are not general laws,

629
00:39:31.931 --> 00:39:36.190
but laws that only operate in certain specific situations.

630
00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:41.440
These are thou the general laws that operate always and new moons.

631
00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:41.980
Uh,

632
00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:46.870
calculations are a subset of these things that only work under certain

633
00:39:46.871 --> 00:39:51.310
conditions.
Uh,
and uh,
just to jump ahead a little bit,

634
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:54.820
the condition is there's a,
there's a,
a quantity.
Uh,

635
00:39:54.821 --> 00:39:58.140
so now I'm going to talk first about special relativity.
Uh,

636
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:02.890
we'll leave gravity to later.
Uh,
but now let's just talk about how things move.

637
00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:08.130
And this is important because this gives rise to the limit on,

638
00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.010
uh,
to the limit on,
on velocity.

639
00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:17.700
All velocities must be left less than or equal to the speed of light.

640
00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:23.680
You can't go faster than the speed of light.
Uh,
and just to jump ahead,

641
00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:28.770
the way Newton's laws of motion relate to special relativity is through a

642
00:40:30.131 --> 00:40:33.340
parameter,
a quantity called gamma.

643
00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:39.120
And this is equal to this quantity one minus v squared,

644
00:40:40.541 --> 00:40:44.170
oversee squared,
square root of that in the denominator,
okay,

645
00:40:44.171 --> 00:40:48.010
one over the square root of one minus p squared overseas squared.

646
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:52.870
And when v is much,
much less than the speed of light,

647
00:40:52.871 --> 00:40:54.610
then gamma is equal to one.

648
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:58.450
You can see if this v as much less than the speed of light.

649
00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:00.430
This quantity is more or less zero.

650
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:03.790
You got one divided by one GAM as equal to one.

651
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:08.200
Newtonian physics assumes that gamma is equal to one.

652
00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:12.250
So this leads directly to all of Newtonian physics

653
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.420
as velocity start to get higher.

654
00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:24.540
Gamma starts to be different from what and if as v approaches the speed of

655
00:41:25.181 --> 00:41:27.300
light,
what's going to happen?
This is going to,

656
00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:30.400
if he is the speed of Light v squared,
oversee squared is one.

657
00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:33.040
You've got one minus one in the denominator.

658
00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:36.770
So you've got zero in the denominator.
So as v approaches,

659
00:41:36.771 --> 00:41:39.410
the speed of light gamma approaches infinity.

660
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.820
<v 2>Okay.</v>

661
00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:46.080
<v 0>And then you get,
so you start to get these relativistic effects.</v>

662
00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.033
<v 2>MMM.</v>

663
00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:53.960
<v 0>So it turns out,
for example,
in relativistic,
uh,</v>

664
00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:59.130
in relativistic physics that mass isn't exactly what Newton thought mass was.

665
00:42:00.531 --> 00:42:05.510
Mass is,
uh,
what's called the rest mass.
This is the Newtonian bass

666
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:09.690
times gamma.

667
00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:15.300
So if everything's moving slowly and uh,
gamma is equal to one,

668
00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:19.140
then the mass is exactly what Newton thought it was going to be.
A,
it's a,

669
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.980
it's a property of objects.
It's constant.
It doesn't change.

670
00:42:22.981 --> 00:42:27.150
Mass is conserved and you can do all the wonderful calculations that you can do

671
00:42:27.151 --> 00:42:30.180
in Newtonian,
uh,
in Newtonian gravity.

672
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:35.580
Now the properties of gamma,
our sex,
remember this goes to infinity,

673
00:42:35.581 --> 00:42:38.490
that therefore as the velocity goes to the speed of light,

674
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000
the mass approaches infinity because gamma and approaches infinity and you're

675
00:42:45.091 --> 00:42:49.050
multiplying the Newtonian mass by some number that's getting larger and larger

676
00:42:49.051 --> 00:42:54.051
and larger and larger as you get a closer to,

677
00:42:54.570 --> 00:42:58.470
uh,
as you get closer to the speed of light.

678
00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:02.640
Now what does this mean?
Remember Newton's laws of motion.

679
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:04.110
Let's go all the way back to Newton.

680
00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:09.380
This is a force is equal to mass times acceleration.

681
00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.370
<v 2>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Go ahead.</v>

682
00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:22.030
<v 0>Gamma is a,
is a parameter that tells you how relativistic you are.</v>

683
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:24.910
It is defined by

684
00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:30.410
this.
So it's,
it's,
it's,

685
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.050
it's a function of your velocity.
Yeah.

686
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:37.130
And weather and,
and how diff,

687
00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:41.960
how much bigger than what it is tells you how far away from the Newtonian theory

688
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:46.580
relativity is.
And the faster you go,
the closer you get to,

689
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:50.020
to the speed of light,
uh,
the,

690
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:53.540
the more relativistic you become and the less Tony and you are.

691
00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:57.500
So it's a parameter that tells you how,
how close you are to Newton.

692
00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.180
Other questions?
Yes.

693
00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:08.320
How was gamma derived it?
I'll talk about the history of this next time.
Uh,

694
00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:10.030
but basically,
uh,

695
00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:15.060
it was Einstein revise the laws of motion in response to some experiments which

696
00:44:16.181 --> 00:44:18.490
weren't giving the right Newtonian answer.

697
00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:21.310
That's the short version of the we'll do the long version next time.

698
00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:26.170
And it was the genius of Einstein that he recognized,
uh,
how it,

699
00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.470
how the laws of motion should be modified NDD debt.

700
00:44:29.471 --> 00:44:30.910
They should be modified at all,

701
00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:34.800
which was not most other people's initial reaction to these experiments.

702
00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:37.870
Okay.
So now,
uh,

703
00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:42.660
what happens if you're mass becomes infinite,

704
00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.990
right?
That meets four,
eight that remember,

705
00:44:45.991 --> 00:44:49.830
this is acceleration and this is force.

706
00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.530
If you're mass becomes infinite,

707
00:44:52.531 --> 00:44:57.531
then f over m which is equal to the acceleration goes to zero,

708
00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:02.370
which means you cannot have any acceleration,

709
00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:07.490
no matter how much force you apply.

710
00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:12.740
And that's why you can't go faster than the speed of light,
right?

711
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:16.500
Because as you get closer and closer to the speed of light,

712
00:45:16.501 --> 00:45:21.200
this gamma factor becomes larger and larger that makes your mass larger and

713
00:45:21.201 --> 00:45:25.370
larger.
And then to get a given amount of acceleration,
since this is huge,

714
00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:27.800
you have to have an increasing amount of force.

715
00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:32.720
By the time you get to the speed of light.
Uh,
the mass is,
uh,
sorry it,

716
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:36.020
it's this whole thing that's zero,
not the mass.
Uh,

717
00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:38.750
by the time you get to the speed of light,
uh,

718
00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:42.590
you need an infinite amount of force to accelerate yourself.

719
00:45:42.591 --> 00:45:47.510
So you need an infinite amount of force in order to go faster.
And so,

720
00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.270
uh,
by the time you get out to the speed of light,

721
00:45:50.271 --> 00:45:54.260
you can't go faster because it would take an infinite amount of force to do so.

722
00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:56.070
Yes,
yes.

723
00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:57.940
<v 2>Does that mean that when you were traveling at the speed of light,</v>

724
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:59.380
and not only can you not speed up,

725
00:45:59.381 --> 00:46:01.720
but you also can't slow down take for us to slow you down.

726
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:03.090
<v 0>Uh,
that's right.</v>

727
00:46:03.091 --> 00:46:07.620
And what it really means though is that nothing with a non zero mass can

728
00:46:07.621 --> 00:46:12.310
actually ever get to the speed of light.
Uh,
and therefore what about like,
uh,

729
00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:17.130
light has zero mass.
It has to,
otherwise it can't go at the speed of light.

730
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:20.550
So,
uh,
if m zero is zero,

731
00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:24.140
then this whole thing applies in a very different way.
Uh,

732
00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:28.380
and so anything that goes at the speed of light has to be massless for just this

733
00:46:28.381 --> 00:46:29.214
kind of reason.

734
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:32.930
<v 2>Yeah.
Energy.
Then</v>

735
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:37.980
<v 0>it has a mass equivalent,
but it's rest mass is zero.</v>

736
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:43.130
So the reason it has energy is because you've got zero times infinity.

737
00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:50.160
And so if you slow light down,
then it disappears all together,
right?
Because,

738
00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:52.830
uh,
if you saw a light in a vacuum down,

739
00:46:52.831 --> 00:46:54.930
I should specify it disappears all together.

740
00:46:54.931 --> 00:46:58.290
Because if this isn't infinite and this is zero,

741
00:46:58.291 --> 00:47:00.150
then you've got no mass energy at all.

742
00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:04.420
<v 2>Yes.
You can't accelerate or decelerate.</v>

743
00:47:04.421 --> 00:47:07.130
How'd you get sort of intrinsic velocity?

744
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:09.770
<v 0>Well,
uh,
what is an intrinsic philosophy?</v>

745
00:47:09.771 --> 00:47:11.990
This is where relativity becomes relative.

746
00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:17.240
It depends on how fast the person who's observing you is going.
Uh,

747
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:18.770
but,
uh,
uh,

748
00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.730
remember this only applies if you're already moving at the speed of light.

749
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:26.390
If you're not moving at the speed of light,
then this isn't infinite.

750
00:47:26.391 --> 00:47:30.040
You have some finite mass and you can change your velocity.
Remember,

751
00:47:30.041 --> 00:47:34.060
acceleration is a change in velocity,
uh,
by applying force.

752
00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:37.720
And as long as the mass isn't infinite,
it just,
you know,

753
00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:41.170
you can calculate how much force it takes and that's how much it takes to change

754
00:47:41.171 --> 00:47:45.820
your velocity.
Other questions?

755
00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:51.730
Excellent questions.
Uh,
all around.

756
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:55.390
This is not at all straightforward.
Uh,

757
00:47:55.391 --> 00:47:57.730
and we will continue next time.
