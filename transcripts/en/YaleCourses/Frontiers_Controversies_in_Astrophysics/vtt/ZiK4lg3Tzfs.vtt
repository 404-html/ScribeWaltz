1
00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.620
Welcome back to more of astronomy,
one 60,
uh,

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.590
the syllabus if you,
if you haven't got it yet,
is on the classes server.
Uh,

3
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.870
we have extra copies,
but I have to say I don't know where they are.
Uh,

4
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:13.681
and in any case,

5
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:16.890
everything that you need to know is on the classes server and there's actually

6
00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:20.130
more than is on the printed syllabus there anywhere.
Uh,

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.180
let me say a couple things.
We're going to stick to the rule,
uh,

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.320
that there should be no science majors taking this class.
Uh,
and uh,

9
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.270
from the looks of the enrollment there's going to be no problem for juniors and

10
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:33.871
seniors.

11
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:38.130
I think we've got plenty of sections to accommodate everyone in here provided

12
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:39.150
you're not assigned to major,

13
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:42.300
but the way it's gonna work in terms of signing up for the class,

14
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:45.210
I think as I understand it,
is as follows,
a,

15
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.000
you need a section sections are mandatory for this course.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.560
So you have to go through the online section signup process that'll start on

17
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:56.420
Monday,
but it will only start for freshmen and sophomores on Monday.
Uh,

18
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.090
juniors and seniors will be able to sign up for the course and sign up for

19
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:04.890
sections,
uh,
on Tuesday.
Uh,
and so please do that sections.

20
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:07.200
We'll start,
uh,
sections are going to be on Monday,

21
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:10.920
so they obviously won't start next week.
They'll start the following week.
Uh,

22
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.770
and uh,
but I have no doubt looking around the room that,
that,
uh,
uh,

23
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.900
we're going to be able to accommodate juniors and seniors if they want to take

24
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:21.390
the class.
All right.
Uh,
other things?
Yes.

25
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:25.100
The first problem set is a assigned as of today.
Uh,

26
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.670
when I get back to my office,
I'll stick that on the classes server as well.
Uh,

27
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:33.960
and you can pick it up from there.
It's do one week from today.
Uh,

28
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.981
and,
uh,

29
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:39.120
the way I like to do this as I like to have problem sets due at the start of

30
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:42.480
class because it bugs me to look out and watch people copying each other's

31
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:46.860
problem set.
Uh,
and so you have to hand it in at the beginning of class,

32
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:49.530
otherwise it's late.
Uh,
on the classes server,

33
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:53.520
there's a whole little thing about lateness policy,
which you ought to read.
Uh,

34
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:55.980
and uh,
uh,
also something,
uh,

35
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.400
let me make a couple of general remarks about problem sets.

36
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.950
The purpose of problem set is different from the purpose of a take home test.

37
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.220
This is not something where the major purpose is to evaluate how much,

38
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:11.280
you know,

39
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.690
the point of problem set is to get you to actually do those particular problems

40
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:18.980
cause that's how one learns stuff in this kind of,
uh,

41
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.870
in this kind of subject matter.
It's kind of like doing the reading.

42
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:24.990
If you don't do it,
you're just going to have trouble.
Uh,

43
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:28.050
and so the reason it's a substantial fraction of your grade,

44
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:31.410
it's just to make sure that you do it.
Um,
okay.

45
00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.730
So this has implications for working in groups.

46
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.800
Working in groups is strongly encouraged.
Please do that.
Uh,

47
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.190
it's a very good thing.
Make friends with the other people in the class,

48
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:48.870
work together,
talk to each other,
start early,
uh,
and uh,
you know,

49
00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.200
may make use of each other's intelligence.
However,
at the same time,
uh,

50
00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.740
we want to make sure that you actually do things.

51
00:02:55.741 --> 00:03:00.580
So we want the work you hand in to be your own.
This sound contradictory.

52
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:02.800
On the one hand,
I'm telling you to work in groups.
On the other hand,

53
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:06.370
I'm telling you,
you have to hand in your own work.
What does that mean?
Uh,
and so,

54
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.660
uh,
as I,
as is written down on the classes server,
the way we,
uh,
try and work,

55
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:15.490
this is when you are actually writing down the thing,
you're going to hand in,

56
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.270
do that alone.
So if you work in a group,
figure out what you're doing,

57
00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:23.300
get everything all set up,
then split up and write down the answer.
Uh,

58
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.730
because the process of actually writing the thing down yourself,

59
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.570
we'll make sure that you've actually understood what you,
what you were doing a,

60
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:33.610
and we'll check on this,
we'll look for it.
You know,

61
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:37.600
identical wording are identical multiplication mistakes and so forth.
Uh,

62
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:39.460
and so we'll keep a little bit of an eye on it,

63
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.810
but I do encourage you to work in groups.
Uh,
there's other ways of getting help.

64
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:47.530
If you need it.
Uh,
the primary source of help are the sections,

65
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:50.350
but of course those won't be meeting this week.
So not before.

66
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:53.140
The first problem set is due a office hours.

67
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.680
I'll be in Starbucks Monday from nine 30 to 11.
Please come,
uh,

68
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.080
and uh,
say hello and ask any questions you might have.

69
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.520
The teaching fellows are going to have a office hours on Wednesdays,

70
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.470
conveniently located the day before the problem sets are due.
You'll notice,
um,

71
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.110
and Oh,
let me strongly recommend,

72
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.540
don't send us email with questions about it,
uh,

73
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.570
since things into the forum on the classes server that way.
Uh,

74
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:26.050
and look first on the forum to see if somebody else has sent your questions.
Uh,

75
00:04:26.051 --> 00:04:29.520
this works really well.
We'll keep an eye on that all the time.
Uh,

76
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.360
we'll be answering it.
Oh,
not all the time.

77
00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:34.510
Not probably after around eight o'clock at night on Wednesday.

78
00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.020
If you have a question at two in the morning,
the day before something is due,

79
00:04:38.021 --> 00:04:39.670
you're kind of on your own.
Yes.

80
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.530
Oh,
excellent question.
Thank you so much.
Uh,
morning,
I'm afraid.
Sorry.
Ah,

81
00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.050
yeah.
I'm not as young as I used to be.

82
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.310
Um,
and Oh,
but let me say if,
uh,

83
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.060
if you do want to meet at some ghastly hour of the evening or something,

84
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:03.790
San be email,
uh,
we can,
we can find a time.

85
00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:07.600
Same with the teaching assistants a sense stuff into the class of server at all

86
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:07.961
times.

87
00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:11.240
We just don't guarantee you to look at it after eight o'clock the night before

88
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.640
to do start the problem sets early.
That way if you have a question,

89
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:20.260
you can answer it.
Not only that,
if you even just look at the problem set,

90
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.780
uh,
you know,
your brain will work on it in your,

91
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.100
in your subconscious and you won't freak out quite so much when you get past

92
00:05:27.101 --> 00:05:31.060
midnight the night before it's due.
Um,
let's see.

93
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.300
Uh,
Oh yes.
In general,

94
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:37.810
I'm going to try and make it so that everything you need to know to do a

95
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:41.960
particular problem set has been covered in class by,
uh,

96
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.720
the day the problem set is handed out.

97
00:05:43.721 --> 00:05:47.530
That would be today for this one in the very first week.
This week,

98
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:50.170
I'm not quite gonna make it.
And so there's one problem.

99
00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.970
It's noted on the problem set.
It's,

100
00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.820
there's one problem that you'll need stuff that I'll talk about on Tuesday.

101
00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.050
There are going to be a bunch of help for various topics that are going to also

102
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:04.820
be linked to the class as surfers.
So,
uh,
by all means,

103
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:09.050
take a look at the,
uh,
at the problem set and start thinking about it,
uh,

104
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.080
as soon as you can.
Okay.
Uh,

105
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.710
let me remind you what we had started to talk about.

106
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:25.790
The class is organized into three,
a fairly specific topics,

107
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.070
the first of which is extra solar planets,
planets around stars other than,

108
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.760
than the sun exoplanets.
So called,
uh,
that's our topic.

109
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:39.290
And one of the things that I pointed out last time is that surprisingly enough,

110
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.010
very,
uh,
until 10 years ago,
none of these were known.
Uh,

111
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.970
and it's only a very recent development that there's any actual evidence that

112
00:06:46.971 --> 00:06:50.150
these things exist.
Uh,
and so one question you might ask is,

113
00:06:50.151 --> 00:06:52.550
why are these things so hard to find?
Uh,

114
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:55.070
the science fiction folks seem to have no trouble.

115
00:06:55.071 --> 00:06:58.040
They just sort of go around in their space ships and find these things all over

116
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:02.150
the place.
Uh,
and uh,
to consider that question,

117
00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:05.840
let me show you a picture.
Here's a picture of a star.

118
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.970
Uh,
this is the star Sirius.
It's the brightest.

119
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.740
It'll blow up obviously of a photograph plus a little photo shopped arrow.

120
00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.260
That's not a celestial object.
Uh,
uh,

121
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.540
uh,
yeah,
so this is a blowup of a photograph of,
of the star.

122
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.650
Serious Sirius is the brightest star in the sky,
uh,

123
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.980
to then easily visible with the naked eye.
In fact,
as I say,
the brightest star,

124
00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.200
uh,
it's one of the closest stars.

125
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:36.620
It's a little bit brighter than the sun intrinsically,
but you know,

126
00:07:36.621 --> 00:07:39.290
it's 10 light years away or so.
Uh,

127
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.620
and let me comment on a couple of features of this picture.
First of all,

128
00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:46.970
you can see the star covers a fair amount of area on this,

129
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.960
on this blown up picture,

130
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:52.370
but that has nothing to do with the actual size or shape of the star itself.

131
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:56.540
It's not like it's a big round ball with spikes coming off it.

132
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.820
That's not what's happening.
In fact,

133
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:02.990
if you had perfect optics and perfect vision,
uh,

134
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.970
this star would be a point,
uh,
and uh,

135
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.040
basically so small you couldn't resolve it right in the middle here.

136
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:15.040
That's the physical extent of the star at this scale is something like this and

137
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:16.700
you wouldn't be able to see you.
It all,

138
00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:19.820
the reason it's extended is for two reasons.
First of all,

139
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:23.120
the atmosphere distorts a,
this was a ground based picture.

140
00:08:23.121 --> 00:08:25.550
The atmosphere distorts how,
uh,

141
00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:28.730
you see the star and in particular to like looking up from the bottom of a

142
00:08:28.731 --> 00:08:30.010
swimming pool,
uh,

143
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:34.280
there's a distortion in the atmosphere and it makes the star seem to jump
around.

144
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.210
And so if you take an x,
a long photographic exposure of something,

145
00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.810
the star has been jumping around during the exposure and,

146
00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:42.770
and it smears out the image.
Uh,

147
00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.780
plus also the optics of the telescope aren't perfect and these spiky things

148
00:08:47.781 --> 00:08:52.500
here,
uh,
are due to the optics of the telescope is sort of a,

149
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:52.990
there,

150
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.820
there are all these spikes and that has to do with how one of the mirrors of the

151
00:08:56.821 --> 00:08:58.650
telescope has held up.
Uh,

152
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:03.060
and so the combination of optics and atmosphere sort of spreads out the light by

153
00:09:03.061 --> 00:09:05.750
a whole bunch.
This is always the case,
uh,

154
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:10.740
even when you're doing observations from space.
Now the,

155
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:14.700
uh,
the little Arrow here is pointing at a little bump,

156
00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:16.350
a often the side,

157
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:21.351
but you might not have thought anything more of than you did about these spikes,

158
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.750
but in fact,
that's not a property of optics.

159
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:29.730
There's actually something there that's an object in orbit around serious.

160
00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.470
And you might think that this is the way you would go about finding planets

161
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:38.010
orbiting other stars.
It would look kind of like this.
Here's a great big star.

162
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:42.330
There is a planet and if you watch this thing over a course of many years,

163
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:45.300
you actually see the position of this point move around.

164
00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:50.220
It's because it's in orbit.
It's in about a 40 year orbit.
But here's the thing.

165
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:56.100
This isn't a planet.
It's another star.
This is a another star,

166
00:09:56.101 --> 00:09:57.120
somewhat fainter than this.

167
00:09:57.121 --> 00:10:01.020
A planet would be 10,000 times fainter than this thing,

168
00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.890
but probably in about the same relative position to this.
Now,

169
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:06.780
picture all this light,

170
00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:11.810
all this mess from this star and trying to find something right here that's

171
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:16.290
10,000 times fainter than this.
That's the problem.

172
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.770
The problem is that the,

173
00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:23.970
the planets are relatively faint things that in itself isn't catastrophic.

174
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:28.140
We have big telescopes.
We can see pretty faint thing.
It's just their faith.

175
00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:31.140
Things that are really near to things that are bright.

176
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:36.120
And so basically the problem with finding planets around other stars is the same

177
00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:40.090
as trying to find a stars in the sky during the day time.
You,

178
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.450
why can't you see the stars during the daytime?

179
00:10:42.451 --> 00:10:46.290
Because the background of the sky is much,
much brighter than the stars are.

180
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.810
Similarly,
uh,
if you had a little planet here,
uh,

181
00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.990
you wouldn't be able to distinguish it from the atmospheric distortions and the

182
00:10:54.991 --> 00:10:58.920
optical distortions caused by the telescope that takes this picture.

183
00:10:58.921 --> 00:11:03.921
So the problem is you've got stuff that's fate near things that are bright and

184
00:11:04.141 --> 00:11:07.230
the bright things have all kinds of distortions on them anyway.

185
00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:11.670
And so you wouldn't be able to just to figure out what actually is a planet.

186
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.840
So,
uh,
just to summarize this,
the problem

187
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.490
is not that the planet to too faint,
although they are quick fade.

188
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:24.420
The problem is that the planets are too close.

189
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:25.420
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

190
00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:26.920
<v 0>To The star.</v>

191
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.740
Uh,
okay.
And that prompts,
we've got to quantify this statement I think.

192
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.210
Uh,
and so the question arises,
well,
how close is it?

193
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.823
<v 1>Uh,</v>

194
00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.780
<v 0>and that leads into a discussion which we already started last time of planetary</v>

195
00:11:46.781 --> 00:11:47.614
orbits.

196
00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:55.050
If you want to answer that question in any quantitative sort of wag a,

197
00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.470
and you will recall that law,
uh,

198
00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:02.200
in last class I wrote down an important equation of uh,
uh,

199
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.250
regarding planetary orbits that looks like this.

200
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.050
A cubed is equal to p squared.

201
00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:13.110
M where this is the mass of the objects in orbit around each other in units of

202
00:12:14.891 --> 00:12:16.060
solar masses.

203
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.900
This is the orbital period,

204
00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:22.940
<v 1>right</v>

205
00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.550
<v 0>in units of years.
And this is,
uh,
uh,</v>

206
00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.380
orbit.
You will recall our ellipses.
Uh,

207
00:12:30.381 --> 00:12:33.110
and this is the so called Sammy major access.

208
00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:34.500
<v 1>Okay.</v>

209
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.333
<v 0>Uh,</v>

210
00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:39.660
of the lips in units called astronomical units,

211
00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:44.900
which is the distance from the earth to the sun or the semi major axis of the

212
00:12:47.161 --> 00:12:48.840
earth.
Sun Orbit more properly.

213
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:56.120
So that's in a particular set of units.
Um,
okay.

214
00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:00.440
Before going on,
let me make a couple of general remarks about equations.

215
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.810
First thing to say about equations is,
you know,

216
00:13:02.811 --> 00:13:06.050
there's this idea that equation's mathematics is some terribly different

217
00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:10.460
language.
Not at all.
Uh,
this is an English sentence.

218
00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:11.420
Okay.

219
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:16.420
The sentence read a cube is equal to p squared times an period.

220
00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:19.790
And if you wrote this down in a textbook,
you'd actually see,

221
00:13:19.791 --> 00:13:24.410
they put the period in there.
Uh,
it's got a verb is equal to,

222
00:13:24.411 --> 00:13:28.550
it's got a subject,
it's got an object.
Uh,
all this is,

223
00:13:28.551 --> 00:13:32.930
is a different way of writing stuff down.
Uh,
so it's not a different language.

224
00:13:32.931 --> 00:13:36.200
It's just a different writing system.
That's all.
So don't freak out.

225
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.710
That's the first thing.
It's,
it's just ordinary English.
Um,

226
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:44.990
the second thing to say is that this is a physics equation and not a math

227
00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:48.140
equation.
And that's actually a subtler point.

228
00:13:48.141 --> 00:13:50.870
You will recall back in eighth grade Algebra when they,
you know,

229
00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:54.800
they started writing down x is equal to sump,
whatever x was equal to.

230
00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:55.920
And they said,
you know,

231
00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:00.680
the amazingly cool thing about Algebra is that x could be anything,
right?

232
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:02.270
That's why it's so powerful.

233
00:14:02.271 --> 00:14:06.050
And so you can solve whole classes of problems all at once just by letting x

234
00:14:06.051 --> 00:14:10.940
equals something unknown.
Uh,
that's math,
physics.
It isn't true.

235
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.440
It is not the case that this equation is true regardless of what a is or

236
00:14:15.441 --> 00:14:16.940
regardless of what is,

237
00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:22.100
this is only true for very specific meanings of those quantities.

238
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:23.900
And,
uh,
uh,

239
00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:28.960
the amazing thing about the universe is it turns out that math equations apply

240
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:34.760
in very specific physical situations.
This didn't have to be true either.

241
00:14:34.761 --> 00:14:39.761
That you could express physical things in mathematical equations and the math

242
00:14:40.401 --> 00:14:42.700
and physics would have anything to do with each other.
Uh,

243
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.720
and it is different to have a physics equation then to have a math equation.

244
00:14:46.721 --> 00:14:48.920
It's because it has to be so specific.

245
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:53.330
If you substitute something that isn't semi major axis in for a,

246
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.590
then that equation isn't true anymore,
it seems kind of obvious.
I know,
but,

247
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.100
but yeah,
it worth keeping in mind.
Uh,

248
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:05.270
the other thing is that physics equations tend to have units associated with

249
00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:08.720
them,
not always,
but most of the time.
And so that's why it's so important to say,

250
00:15:08.721 --> 00:15:12.800
well,
this is true not only if m stands for mass,

251
00:15:12.801 --> 00:15:16.970
but also if the mass is expressed in a particular set of units,
uh,

252
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.840
in this case solar masses.
Uh,

253
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.250
you'll recall from last time that this is actually a specific version of a

254
00:15:22.251 --> 00:15:25.460
slightly more general equation,
which looks like this.

255
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.560
Hey cubed equals p squared,

256
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:32.180
g m over four Pi Square where Ge is a constant,

257
00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:36.500
uh,
that depends on what units you're using.

258
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.680
And,
uh,
last time I derived this equation from that.
Uh,

259
00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:46.100
but another way of saying it is,
uh,
if you choose your units,

260
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.520
uh,
to be a solar masses,

261
00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.980
uh,
years and astronomical units,
uh,

262
00:15:56.370 --> 00:16:00.510
then,
uh,
g is equal to four Pi squared.

263
00:16:00.511 --> 00:16:03.570
And so it cancels out.
That's another way of,
uh,

264
00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.130
of thinking about why this specific version of the equation works out.

265
00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:13.560
All right.
Uh,
so once you've got your physics equation,

266
00:16:13.561 --> 00:16:16.920
what are you supposed to do with it?
Uh,
well,
the first thing you should do is,
is,

267
00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:21.060
is take a careful look at it and figure out what kinds of problems you can
solve.

268
00:16:21.061 --> 00:16:24.610
This again is,
is,
is fairly straightforward,
obvious stuff.
Uh,

269
00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.290
if you've got a cubed equals p squared m,

270
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:32.010
there are obviously three different problems you can solve.

271
00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:36.830
If you know a and,
m,
you can compute P,
right?
Eh,

272
00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.310
if you know a and p,
you can compute m.
And if you know p and m,

273
00:16:41.311 --> 00:16:43.500
you can compute a,
so,
you know,
two of these things,

274
00:16:43.501 --> 00:16:46.760
you find out the third this problem aversion.
Oh,

275
00:16:46.761 --> 00:16:51.240
an example of this problem we did last time,
we had,
uh,
we solve for the,

276
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.140
for the orbital period of Jupiter by knowing how far away from the sun it is and

277
00:16:55.141 --> 00:16:58.920
what the mass of the sun is.
So like Jupiter last time.

278
00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.120
<v 1>Okay.</v>

279
00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.610
<v 0>Uh,
so let's do another one of these examples.</v>

280
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:05.240
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

281
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.540
<v 0>Just quickly here.
Uh,
what is the mass of the sun</v>

282
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:12.430
of the sun?
Uh,

283
00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:16.700
so that's obviously this version of the problem.
Uh,

284
00:17:16.701 --> 00:17:20.420
and so what we're gonna do is we're going to take a and p from the Earth's
orbit,

285
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:25.100
use Earth's orbit to determine the mass of the sun.

286
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:30.450
And this is in fact how one goes about determining the mass of the sun.
So,
uh,

287
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:31.790
let's use this in the unit.

288
00:17:31.791 --> 00:17:35.900
We have a is equal to one astronomical unit for the earth.

289
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.780
P is equal to one year for the son.

290
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:42.440
One cube does equal to one squared times m.

291
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:46.190
So M is equal to one in units of solar masses.

292
00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:48.083
<v 1>Okay.</v>

293
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:53.380
<v 0>Not Surprising,
right?
And,</v>

294
00:17:53.381 --> 00:17:57.180
and not particularly illuminated,
right?
Uh,
that,

295
00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:00.480
that the mat at the mass comes out to the mass of the sun,

296
00:18:00.481 --> 00:18:03.170
comes out to be one in units of solar masses.
Uh,

297
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.990
if we use a different set of units,
this is a more interesting calculation.

298
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.170
So let's use a more standard set of units.

299
00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:15.020
This so called Mk ass units.
Uh,
this is,
uh,

300
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:15.990
meters,

301
00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:22.350
kilograms for mass and seconds for time.

302
00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.210
All right,
so now,
um,

303
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:30.980
turns out and astronomical unit is expressed in meters is a 150 billion meters

304
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:37.980
approximately and looks something like this.
Uh,

305
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.430
and what's a year expressed in seconds?
Well,
let's see.

306
00:18:41.431 --> 00:18:46.431
A year is 365.24 days a day is 24 hours.

307
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:51.010
A an hour is 60 minutes and uh,

308
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:55.170
a minute is 60 seconds.
So that's a year expressed in seconds.

309
00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:00.730
Uh,
and at this point we better pause and,
and,
and get our,
uh,

310
00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:05.250
large numbers straight.
Uh,
you are all probably familiar.

311
00:19:05.251 --> 00:19:09.450
I imagine with scientific notation,
this becomes very important.
Otherwise,

312
00:19:09.451 --> 00:19:14.370
the Nem numbers as you can clearly see,
get,
get completely out of hand.
Uh,
and,

313
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:18.870
uh,
because it's so important.
I'm going to a tire you,
uh,

314
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.590
by uh,
writing down some fact about scientific notation.

315
00:19:22.591 --> 00:19:26.010
There's a help sheet on this if you have any trouble.
Uh,
but uh,

316
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.600
recall how this works.
Uh,

317
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.420
you're supposed to express numbers as in the following form,
uh,

318
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:34.270
and times 10 to the Em,
this is,
uh,

319
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.940
a decimal with one digit out in front of the dot.

320
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:42.840
This is supposed to be an Integer,
a whole number,

321
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:47.220
either positive or negative.
Uh,
and uh,

322
00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.410
the reason that this is easy to deal with is because of one of the great

323
00:19:52.411 --> 00:19:54.990
limitations of the human brain.
Uh,

324
00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:59.970
we only deal well with really small numbers,
basically one digit numbers.

325
00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:03.960
If I take a a few coins here and I sort of throw him up,

326
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.800
you immediately know that there are four of them.
You don't have to count one,

327
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:08.880
two,
three,

328
00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:12.780
four to satisfy yourself that therefore coins on the table because we have a

329
00:20:12.781 --> 00:20:15.300
concept of foreignness all of us in our mind,

330
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.810
and it clear that this pattern satisfies that concept.

331
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.730
If I threw a two coins or six coins or seven coins,
you'll probably be okay.

332
00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:26.610
If I through 13,
you'd start to have real trouble.

333
00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.270
If there were 271 of them,
uh,

334
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:32.910
there's no way you could guess just by looking at them how many there were.

335
00:20:32.911 --> 00:20:34.470
You'd have to count them one by one.

336
00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.970
So the human brain really only deals well with one digit numbers.

337
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.810
And you can tell this because of the names we give to numbers.

338
00:20:42.811 --> 00:20:45.900
When you start getting big numbers,
we call the millions or,

339
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:50.050
or a billions or trillions and they all sound alike.

340
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.050
That's because we can't tell the difference between a million and a trillion.

341
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.330
It's just big.
Uh,

342
00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:58.900
and so anytime you get up into big numbers,

343
00:20:58.901 --> 00:21:02.590
we stop and we start to completely lose our grip on what these numbers mean.

344
00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:05.950
And you have to have elaborate metaphors.
You know,
a trillion is,
um,
uh,

345
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.660
is a million million.
And if you fill up the moon with ping pong balls there,

346
00:21:10.661 --> 00:21:11.590
I don't know,
you know,

347
00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:14.860
that you have to do that kind of mental exercise to get a grip on it.

348
00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:20.220
The nice thing about scientific notation is that it turns big numbers into small

349
00:21:21.041 --> 00:21:22.180
numbers,
right?

350
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.240
And is a number between one and 9:00 AM is an integer.

351
00:21:27.731 --> 00:21:30.100
It's one of those numbers,
four,
five,
six,

352
00:21:30.101 --> 00:21:33.100
that we can get our minds wrapped around.
Recall what this means,
right?
Uh,

353
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:37.900
tend to,
theM is one with m zeros after it.

354
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.120
Uh,
and so that's the point of scientific notation.

355
00:21:43.121 --> 00:21:45.940
It's to take big numbers and allow us to,
to deal with them.

356
00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:49.990
I think this is a really valuable thing and I kind of wish that budget

357
00:21:49.991 --> 00:21:53.530
discussions in Poland in the political context would take place in scientific

358
00:21:53.531 --> 00:21:57.490
notation because people are always making mischief from the fact that all big

359
00:21:57.491 --> 00:22:01.150
numbers,
how delight you have a congress critters saying things like,
oh,

360
00:22:01.151 --> 00:22:05.410
terrible disaster.
There's $1 million of waste in the Pentagon budget.

361
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.810
Okay,
the Pentagon budget is $500 billion.
Okay,

362
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:11.710
$1 million of waste.

363
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:16.300
That's me dropping a nickel behind the couch on my budget.
Uh,

364
00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:20.650
and so that's act and nobody would accuse me of being wastefulness if I didn't

365
00:22:20.651 --> 00:22:23.920
move the couch and get that nickel out.
All right.
Uh,

366
00:22:23.921 --> 00:22:28.570
and it's because a million sounds big and so does 500 billion.

367
00:22:28.571 --> 00:22:30.910
And we have no real sense of what,

368
00:22:30.911 --> 00:22:33.460
of how big these things are relative to each other.

369
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:37.930
But we do have a sense of the difference between six and 11,

370
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:43.170
which is the difference in scientific notation between $1 million and a hundred

371
00:22:43.841 --> 00:22:47.590
billion dollars.
So,
uh,
that's how this works.
Uh,
so yes,

372
00:22:47.591 --> 00:22:52.540
so arithmetic rules,
uh,
again,
there's a help sheet on this if,
if you're rusty,
uh,

373
00:22:52.541 --> 00:22:57.541
if you have in times 10 to the m and you multiply it by another scientific

374
00:22:58.391 --> 00:23:02.090
notation number a times 10 to the B,
uh,

375
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:04.300
that is equal to a times.
And,

376
00:23:04.301 --> 00:23:08.590
and the other nice thing about scientific notation is it turns multiplication

377
00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:13.620
into a ditch addition because the exponent add a times and two times 10 to the m

378
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.010
plus B.
Similarly,

379
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:23.190
if you take end times 10 to the m and raise it to the case power that's into the

380
00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:29.380
k,
uh,
times 10 to the m times k.

381
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:32.890
So it turns exponentiation into multiple,
multiple occasions.

382
00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:35.320
So the nice thing about dealing with exponent is,
uh,

383
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:38.710
it makes it one kind of arithmetic easier.
Uh,

384
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.880
and so a specific example of this might be an times 10 to the em,

385
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:47.120
the square root of that which is raising to the one half power.

386
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:52.510
This is equal to n to the one half times 10 to the m over to that works if

387
00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:58.040
Amazon even number.
But if m is an odd number,

388
00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:02.270
you get a crazy exponent.
This really has to be an integer over here.

389
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:07.390
So what do you do then you say and times 10 to the m to the one half is equal to

390
00:24:09.141 --> 00:24:14.141
10 times and times and too the m minus one to them,

391
00:24:14.411 --> 00:24:15.470
one half power.

392
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:20.590
So I've just moved a 10 from here over to here and then that is equal to 10 and

393
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:26.980
two the one half times 10 to the m minus one over two.

394
00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.110
And that's how you recover,
uh,
when you,

395
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.680
when you take a square root or something like that,
that's how you recover a,

396
00:24:33.681 --> 00:24:38.210
an integer on this side.
We'll have lots of practice in this kind of thing.
Uh,

397
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.050
okay.
So going back to the problem,
one,

398
00:24:42.051 --> 00:24:46.940
a u is equal to 1.5 times 10 to the 11 meters.

399
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:47.530
Uh,

400
00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:52.530
one year is equal to a 2.4 times 10 to the one that's 21 times six times 10 to

401
00:24:55.851 --> 00:25:00.080
the one times six times 10 to the one times 3.6,

402
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:04.340
five two,
four times 10 to the two seconds.

403
00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:07.910
All right,
so let's do that.
One,
two,
three,

404
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:12.950
five a 2.4 times six times six times 3.6 blah,

405
00:25:14.061 --> 00:25:16.310
blah,
blah,
times 10 to the five,

406
00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:19.670
two and a half times six is around 15,

407
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:23.120
15 times six is around 90.

408
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:27.650
90 is a little less than a hundred.
3.6,
a little more than six.

409
00:25:27.651 --> 00:25:31.490
Those two things multiplied together as around 300.

410
00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.213
Uh,

411
00:25:33.290 --> 00:25:38.120
and 300 times 10 to the five is equal to three times 10 to the seven.

412
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:42.710
So there are around three times 10 to the seven seconds in one year.

413
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.940
That's a good number to remember.
Oh,

414
00:25:46.941 --> 00:25:51.770
and in mks unit
and mks units,

415
00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:56.570
gee,
this magical constant is something like seven times 10 to the minus 11.

416
00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:01.100
Uh,
that's an approximation.
It's actually 6.6 something,
something,

417
00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:03.410
something times 10 to the lunch slam,
but we'll call it seven.

418
00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.010
So now we're in a position to calculate the,

419
00:26:06.011 --> 00:26:10.250
see what the solar mass is in kilograms 1.4.

420
00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:15.280
So remember a cubed equal to g m P squared over four Pi squared.

421
00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:21.550
So let's say a 1.5 times 10 to the 11 that uh,

422
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.600
an astronomical unit cubed,
uh,
p squared,
three times 10 to the seven,

423
00:26:26.601 --> 00:26:30.500
that's one year squared.
Seven Times 10 to the minus 11,

424
00:26:30.501 --> 00:26:34.580
that g over em over four Pi Square.
All right,

425
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.470
I'm going to do the arithmetic really fast.
Uh,

426
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.450
I would like you to learn how to do that yourself rather than relying on

427
00:26:41.451 --> 00:26:45.960
calculators.
So this is an example.
Let me blaze through this at warp speed.

428
00:26:45.961 --> 00:26:49.470
Then we'll stop and consider what's happened.
All right,
uh,

429
00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:52.320
on the right hand side,
let's see.
Um,

430
00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:58.160
three squared is that's three squared times 10 to the,
uh,

431
00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.150
seven times it's time to,

432
00:27:00.151 --> 00:27:05.151
to is 14 times seven times 10 to the minus 11:00 AM uh,

433
00:27:05.191 --> 00:27:09.840
over four times Pi Times Pi.
Uh,

434
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.280
three squared is 10,

435
00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:15.600
10 times 10 to the 14 is 10 to the 15.
Uh,

436
00:27:15.601 --> 00:27:20.601
and so on the top we've got 10 to the 15 times seven times 10 to the minus 1150

437
00:27:22.181 --> 00:27:25.810
minus 11 is for,
so that's seven times 10 to the four on top.
Uh,

438
00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:29.880
Pi Times Pi is 10.
That's 44 times 10 to the one on the bottom.

439
00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:32.550
Seven divided by four is two.

440
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:36.680
And so that's two times 10 to the three times am all right.
Good ahead.

441
00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:39.780
Lefthand side.
Uh,
all right,
one,

442
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.910
1.5 times 1.5 times 1.5.
That's 1.5.

443
00:27:44.911 --> 00:27:49.740
Two Times 10 to the 33.
Why 33?
That's 11 times three.

444
00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:53.970
Okay.
1.5 times 1.5.
That's a little bit more than two.

445
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.880
If you multiply something that's a little bit more than to buy something that's

446
00:27:56.881 --> 00:27:59.190
a little bit less than two,
that's four.
Uh,

447
00:27:59.191 --> 00:28:01.890
and so this is four times 10 to the 33,

448
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:06.390
and now we want em,
right?
So we got to divide both sides by two times.

449
00:28:06.391 --> 00:28:11.391
10 to the three M is equal to four halves times 10 to the 33,

450
00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:15.990
uh,
over 10 to the three.
That's 10 to the 33 minus three.

451
00:28:15.991 --> 00:28:20.280
That's two times 10 to the 30 telegrams.

452
00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:22.830
Got to put the units in.
Okay.

453
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:27.890
How are we doing questions,
comments,
use.
Yes sir.

454
00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.050
How accurate is that number?
It's accurate to about one digit.
Uh,

455
00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:37.400
which is why I only wrote down one digit of accuracy out front.
This is a pro.

456
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:39.920
Excellent question.
Thank you very much.
Uh,

457
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:45.500
this is appropriate because remember I'm using seven times 10 to the minus 11,

458
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:48.020
four g where to actually 6.6.

459
00:28:48.021 --> 00:28:51.770
So I'm already a about 10% off from there.

460
00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:56.120
I did my little calculation to come up with one year equals three times 10 to

461
00:28:56.121 --> 00:29:00.500
the seven seconds.
That's about accurate to one digit or so.
Uh,

462
00:29:00.501 --> 00:29:03.230
and Silva whole thing is done to one digit accuracy.

463
00:29:03.231 --> 00:29:05.210
If you're dealing with one digit accuracy,

464
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.240
it is true that seven divided by four is two.

465
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:12.530
It really is true because if you,
if that wasn't true,

466
00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.790
then you would have to have more digits on your unit for GE or something like

467
00:29:16.791 --> 00:29:19.220
that.
Uh,
and in particular,

468
00:29:19.221 --> 00:29:22.070
let me make an official rule for this course.

469
00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.390
Three equals Pi equals the square root of 10.

470
00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:27.993
All right?

471
00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:33.100
That will solve an enormous amount of arithmetic problems and it will not get

472
00:29:33.201 --> 00:29:37.970
you into any serious trouble.
So we don't have to worry about the 0.14,
one,
five,

473
00:29:37.971 --> 00:29:42.700
nine,
and however many more digits you all memorized to.
Uh,

474
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.940
uh,
and when you multiply it together,
you get 10.
Yes,

475
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.800
yes.
So the question was,

476
00:29:50.801 --> 00:29:54.040
am I expecting this kind of calculation for problem sets?
The answer is yes.

477
00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:58.180
Here's the rule about calculators.
Let me put it this way.
Uh,

478
00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:01.930
you can only use calculators if I can't tell that you've done it.

479
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.680
Uh,
so you know that that means you can,
you know,

480
00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:07.780
check your work to make sure you've done it right or something.

481
00:30:07.781 --> 00:30:12.220
But if you start coming up with numbers,
like 7.15,
one six,
three,
nine,

482
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.610
seven a,
that's eight digits of accuracy.

483
00:30:15.611 --> 00:30:20.080
And I'm pretty sure you haven't worked it out yourself.
Uh,
so you know,

484
00:30:20.081 --> 00:30:24.730
and Oh,
uh,
important.
No calculators on the tests.
Okay.

485
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:29.230
So get some practice doing this kind of thing.
Uh,
and this will,

486
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:32.640
this I promise you will be useful,
useful to you in,

487
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:37.630
in everyday life because this is how you catch the politicians doing screwy

488
00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:38.860
things with big numbers.

489
00:30:38.861 --> 00:30:43.720
You do it in your head and in scientific notation and you figure out,
uh,
uh,

490
00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:46.570
whether the answer is meaningful or not.
Um,

491
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.090
this whole business of significant digits I think is,

492
00:30:50.091 --> 00:30:53.920
is badly distorted by the way it's taught in high school.
Uh,
in high school.

493
00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.770
You and also I should say in,
in laboratory courses,

494
00:30:56.771 --> 00:31:00.940
sometimes it's at the college level.
You often get situations where people say,

495
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:05.100
uh,
give you a whole sheet of rules on how to figure out how,

496
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:08.110
how many significant digits you have.
This is nonsense.

497
00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.520
All you have to do is behave like a human being.
We say to each other,
you know,

498
00:31:12.521 --> 00:31:14.500
I'll meet you in the dining hall in 10 minutes.

499
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:17.470
That doesn't mean that means something different from,

500
00:31:17.471 --> 00:31:20.890
I'll meet you in the dining hall in 11 minutes and 26 seconds.

501
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:25.870
Even if the person happens to show up in the dining hall in exactly 11 minutes

502
00:31:25.871 --> 00:31:29.170
and 26 seconds,
10 minutes means I'll meet you there in 10 minutes.

503
00:31:29.171 --> 00:31:30.130
We all know what that means.

504
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.150
I'll meet you there at 11 minutes and 26 seconds means you're a character in a

505
00:31:34.151 --> 00:31:38.650
bad spy novel who's just synchronized as watch.
Uh,
so,
uh,

506
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:40.600
this shows up.
It's science fiction to,

507
00:31:40.601 --> 00:31:44.290
I don't know how many of you are star trek fans.
Uh,
I certainly am.
Uh,

508
00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:48.550
and in all the different and all the different star trek movie a snack you,
uh,

509
00:31:48.551 --> 00:31:52.720
in all the difference a friend,
uh,
and all the different star trek movies,

510
00:31:52.721 --> 00:31:56.380
there's always a second in command who isn't a human being,
right?

511
00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:00.430
A volcan aren't android or,
or,
or some damn thing or another.

512
00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:03.940
And to emphasize the non humanness of these characters,

513
00:32:03.941 --> 00:32:08.140
what they do is they make them use too many significant digit.
Uh,

514
00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.980
and so that makes them human.
And so I tell the captain will say,

515
00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:16.360
when are we landing on omicron m and the second in command will say,
well,

516
00:32:16.361 --> 00:32:20.850
we should assume Sant standard orbit in 2.6,
three,
nine,
five minutes,
uh,

517
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:23.710
emphasizing somehow superior brain power or something.

518
00:32:23.711 --> 00:32:28.711
But it's nonsense because it takes the guy 10 seconds to say that sentence.

519
00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.090
So what is this time,
you know,
calculated to a hundredth of a second.

520
00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.500
Does it start from when he begins the sentence from when he ends the sentence?

521
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.260
Well,
what's the other end of that time interval?
Can you say,

522
00:32:42.261 --> 00:32:47.000
you assume standard orbit,
uh,
to the 100th of a second.

523
00:32:47.001 --> 00:32:50.480
What does that even mean?
Uh,
when you start beaming down,

524
00:32:50.481 --> 00:32:53.690
when you end beaming down,
uh,
and also keep in mind,

525
00:32:53.691 --> 00:32:57.740
it takes more than a hundredth of a second for the sound to travel from his lips

526
00:32:57.741 --> 00:33:02.660
to the captain's years.
Saw the whole thing is just nonsense.
Uh,
and so,

527
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:07.220
uh,
you know,
you don't need any special rules,
just behave like a human being.

528
00:33:07.221 --> 00:33:11.780
Don't behave like an android.
Uh,
and so no androids.

529
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:15.050
Uh,
and that's the only rule I'm going to give you,

530
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:19.310
that these two are the only rules I'm going to give you about a significant

531
00:33:19.311 --> 00:33:23.690
digits.
Just do the right thing.
Okay.
Um,
all right.

532
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:28.700
Uh,
okay.
So,
uh,
this is all,
this is all lovely,

533
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:32.360
but we haven't actually started to answer the question we started the class
with,

534
00:33:32.361 --> 00:33:36.080
let me remind you where we began this disquisition on numbers.
Uh,

535
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:41.110
the question was supposed to be how far away from stars are planets?

536
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.750
Uh,
so haven't answered.

537
00:33:44.751 --> 00:33:49.751
We haven't answered the question when the question was how close are planets,

538
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.910
uh,
two stars.

539
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.630
This notation will confuse the people who didn't make it to class today.

540
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:58.520
That's probably just as well too.
All right.

541
00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.130
How close to planets are planets to stars?

542
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:05.090
And now we have a problem because closeness,

543
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:09.850
we usually think of this as being measured with distances.
And,
uh,

544
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.950
distances are a serious problem in astronomy.
Supposing you,
uh,

545
00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.120
distanced by the way is more or less the same thing as size,
right?

546
00:34:17.121 --> 00:34:21.500
Size is the distance from one side of something to another side of something.
So,

547
00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:25.490
uh,
so size and distance of the same.
So supposing you ask the question,

548
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:28.610
how big is the moon?
What is the size of the move?

549
00:34:28.611 --> 00:34:31.160
What is the distance from one side of the moon to the other?

550
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:36.490
You go out one night and you look up at the moon and you do this one on each

551
00:34:36.531 --> 00:34:39.680
side of the moon.
You say,
well,
it's about an inch and a half.
Okay.

552
00:34:39.681 --> 00:34:42.920
Now obviously that's meaningless because if you had done it here,

553
00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:47.330
it would have been about a half edge.
Uh,
and we all know that that isn't,

554
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:49.880
that somehow it is not the right answer.
Uh,

555
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.240
if you look at the screen over here,
for example,

556
00:34:53.390 --> 00:34:57.350
and you hold out your hands about eight inches from your a closed one,

557
00:34:57.351 --> 00:35:00.110
I hold out.
You can try this.
Hold out your hands about here.

558
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:03.200
You'll find that that screen,
the,
uh,
uh,

559
00:35:03.201 --> 00:35:05.960
the lit part of the screens about four or five inches across.

560
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:09.950
But if you go closer to your eye,
it's only about an inch across.

561
00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:14.090
If you're at arms length,
it's maybe six,
eight inches where I'm standing here.

562
00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:14.930
And if you tried it,

563
00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:17.480
the back of the classroom get a different answer from what I just got.

564
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:22.220
So distance is a problematical thing.
Uh,
and so,

565
00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.450
but on the other hand,

566
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:28.340
obviously the size of the screen hasn't changed depending on where my arms were

567
00:35:28.341 --> 00:35:30.830
or whether I'm standing at the back of the room or the front of the room.

568
00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:33.230
So something has to be measurable there,

569
00:35:33.231 --> 00:35:37.190
but it isn't distance when what it is is angle.

570
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:40.290
What you can measure in astronomy are angles.

571
00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.320
So here's what you really want to know.
Here's a star,

572
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:47.880
here's a planet going around the star.
And here is you.

573
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:50.760
This is the international symbol for an observer.

574
00:35:50.761 --> 00:35:54.960
It's supposed to be a little stylized eyeball.
Uh,
and okay,

575
00:35:54.961 --> 00:35:59.961
so this observer is looking at this star planet system and looks at the Star and

576
00:36:00.991 --> 00:36:05.190
looks at the planet.
And what you can measure is the angle,

577
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:07.080
which I'm going to call Alpha here.

578
00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:12.120
And if you simulate the angle by putting your hands up close to your eye,

579
00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:14.880
you'll get a small distance.
If you do it further away,

580
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:16.020
you'll get a bigger distance.

581
00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:21.120
But what you're measuring is the angle a and what you would like is a way of

582
00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:24.300
being able to convert from that angle into a distant.

583
00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:29.900
And now the ugly specter of trigonometry rears its head because that's what

584
00:36:29.941 --> 00:36:33.990
trigonometry is.
It's a way of turning angles into distances and vice versa.

585
00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:37.200
And you may remember constructions that looked vaguely like this,

586
00:36:37.201 --> 00:36:39.930
what's put some labels on it.
Here's distance one.

587
00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:44.770
Here's distance to here's distance three.
Uh,
and uh,

588
00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.590
this is the definition of sign.

589
00:36:46.591 --> 00:36:50.310
The sign of an Alpha is equal to the opposite over the hype pot news.

590
00:36:50.311 --> 00:36:54.570
So that's d two over d three.
Uh,
and now,
uh,

591
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.710
so that's how you do it.
Now,

592
00:36:55.711 --> 00:36:59.670
I promised you on Tuesday that the ad that the sign was going to cancel out.

593
00:36:59.671 --> 00:37:04.410
And so it is a,
here's how,
uh,
if you use small angles,

594
00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:09.210
it turns out that the sign of Alpha is equal to Alpha.

595
00:37:09.211 --> 00:37:11.360
If Alpha is expressed in Radians,

596
00:37:11.361 --> 00:37:15.310
which is a particular kind of measure of angles.
And so,
uh,

597
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:19.130
for small and goals,
first of all,
the High Pot Newson,

598
00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:21.690
the longer side are the same length,
more or less.

599
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:27.470
So you've got a situation like this where [inaudible] over d one is equal to

600
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:32.280
alpha.
That is,
uh,
let's circle that one in red.

601
00:37:32.281 --> 00:37:36.510
It's going to be important.
Uh,
that's called the small angle formula.

602
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:42.630
And once again,
you have to be careful of the unit.
And once again,

603
00:37:42.631 --> 00:37:46.890
there's two sets of units in which you might possibly use this.
Uh,

604
00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.250
uh,
so d two over d one is equal to alpha.

605
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:54.360
If d two and d one are in the same units,

606
00:37:55.590 --> 00:38:00.100
then Alpha has to be in radiant,
uh,

607
00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.300
a radiant dare.
Two Pi Radians inner circle,

608
00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:08.160
two Pi Radians in a circle.
Uh,

609
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:11.040
you'll recall there 360 degrees in a circle.

610
00:38:11.041 --> 00:38:13.970
That's how you convert from degrees to radiant.
Uh,

611
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:18.480
but there's a better set of units.
It turns out also that if you do this,

612
00:38:18.481 --> 00:38:23.481
use this equation [inaudible] Alpha and d two is measured in astronomical units.

613
00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:28.710
Remember those,
that's the earth sun distance and d one is measured in Parsecs,

614
00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:33.150
uh,
which is equal to three times 10 to the 16 meters.

615
00:38:33.151 --> 00:38:37.300
That's about three light years.
For those of you counting at home,
uh,

616
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:41.320
and Alpha is in arc seconds.

617
00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:45.820
Then it also works out.
Let me tell you an arc second.
Let's see.

618
00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:50.230
60 arc seconds is equal to an arc minute.

619
00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:52.990
Just so you know how these units work.

620
00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:57.990
60 are committed is equal to one degree.
So that's a,

621
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.890
a really small angle.

622
00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.510
So it turns out this set of units is particularly useful for these kinds of

623
00:39:04.511 --> 00:39:09.460
planet calculations because distances from planets to stars tend to be a few

624
00:39:09.461 --> 00:39:12.840
astronomical units,
distances from us to the nearest stars.

625
00:39:12.841 --> 00:39:15.070
The nearest stars turned just aside from the sun,

626
00:39:15.071 --> 00:39:16.990
turns out to be about one parsec away.

627
00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.920
So distances to stars are some number of parsecs.
Uh,

628
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.560
and so you'll get a answers that are,
you know,

629
00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:28.180
a few arc seconds and this is yet another way of turning big numbers into small

630
00:39:28.181 --> 00:39:31.810
numbers.
You use the right set of units so that everything's approximately one.

631
00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.970
Uh,
another way of compensating for the weakness of the human brain.
Uh,

632
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:41.020
okay.
So now we can solve a problem

633
00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:47.320
we can actually solve numerically.
The question of how far away,

634
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:51.340
uh,
from a star is,
uh,
our,
uh,
our planet.

635
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:52.660
So here's an example.

636
00:39:52.661 --> 00:39:57.100
Here's a problem of the kind that might show up on a problem set.

637
00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.193
Uh,

638
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:05.050
I told you that that object orbiting Sirius has a about a 40 year period.

639
00:40:05.051 --> 00:40:07.200
So let's take a planet,
uh,

640
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:12.210
with a 40 year period that's kind of between Saturn and Uranus in our own solar

641
00:40:14.231 --> 00:40:15.370
system,
uh,

642
00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:20.620
around a star three parsecs away,

643
00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.120
PC means parsecs,

644
00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:28.530
whatever they may tell you in the humanities classes.
All right?
Uh,
okay.

645
00:40:28.531 --> 00:40:32.310
Around a star three parsecs away.
What is the angular separation?

646
00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:33.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

647
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:37.320
<v 0>Angular separation because that,
uh,</v>

648
00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:41.790
what we can actually measure,
you can't measure the distance,
but we can't add,

649
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.480
measure the angle.
Okay?
So this is a hard problem.

650
00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.713
<v 1>Okay.</v>

651
00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:52.430
<v 0>Why is it hard?
It's hard for two different reasons.
First of all.
Well,</v>

652
00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:56.080
you guys know how to solve problems like this.
You all went to high school.
Uh,

653
00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.810
what you do is you say,
okay,
what do I know?
I have p equals 40,

654
00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:03.050
I have d equals three.
I want alpha.

655
00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:07.430
So I looked for an equation with d p d and Alpha in it.

656
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:12.710
I shove these two things into the substitute the man for p and d,

657
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:14.540
and then I calculate alpha.

658
00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:19.070
And you don't have to actually know anything about anything.
In order to do that,

659
00:41:19.071 --> 00:41:21.950
you just have to have a good set of notes and you go through all the different

660
00:41:21.951 --> 00:41:24.140
equations until you find the equations,

661
00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:28.400
the equations that contains all the variables you have and the one that you're

662
00:41:28.401 --> 00:41:30.340
asked for.
And then you can just plug it in.

663
00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:33.530
You don't have to know anything about anything.
This won't work,
right?

664
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.560
Because if you go through the lecture notes thus far,

665
00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:41.680
you will not find any equation with P and d and alpha in it because it's two

666
00:41:42.771 --> 00:41:46.340
different equations,
uh,
there that you have to put together.

667
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:49.430
And that requires you to actually know what you're doing.
Uh,

668
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:53.060
and that of course is much harder.
Uh,
so plug and Chug won't work

669
00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:58.010
and chug fails.
Uh,

670
00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:02.750
because there's no one equation,

671
00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:05.533
<v 1>okay.</v>

672
00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:09.190
<v 0>Uh,
this is a hard problem for another reason,</v>

673
00:42:09.191 --> 00:42:11.440
which is that I haven't told you something important.

674
00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:15.130
If you try and go through and solve this,
you will discover it,

675
00:42:15.131 --> 00:42:17.980
that you don't have all the information you need.
And in particular,

676
00:42:17.981 --> 00:42:22.270
you need to know the mass,
the total mass of the system,
the mass of the star,

677
00:42:22.271 --> 00:42:27.130
most of the masses in the mass of the star.
So there's missing information.

678
00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:31.780
That's one way to make a problem hard.
The other way to make,
uh,
you know,

679
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:35.350
I don't tell you everything you need to know.
It's a somewhat harder problem.
Uh,

680
00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:38.940
the other way to make a heart problem heart,
this is a classic that,
that,
that,

681
00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.550
you know,
be warned.
Uh,

682
00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.530
I will do this at some point is to give you one extra piece of information that

683
00:42:44.531 --> 00:42:49.480
you don't need this screw students up total.
Uh,
because,

684
00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:54.190
uh,
you go looking for the equation that uses the extra piece of information and

685
00:42:54.191 --> 00:42:56.620
there is no such an equation and you don't need it.
And then you,

686
00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:59.070
then you're cast into doubt.
You know,
I,

687
00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:03.340
I must need this somehow or he wouldn't have given it to me.
Uh,
nonsense.

688
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:04.810
You know,
in real life,

689
00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:09.730
it is not the case that all problems come to you with all the information you

690
00:43:09.731 --> 00:43:12.190
need and only the information that you need.

691
00:43:12.191 --> 00:43:16.720
That's not how things work in real life and it shouldn't be how things work.
Uh,

692
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:20.630
in preparation for real life,
which is I guess what classes,
uh,

693
00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.490
sorta ought to be a,
so missing information,
too much information.

694
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.690
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

695
00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:28.810
<v 0>sometimes,
although not in this case,
uh,</v>

696
00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:33.340
I could have told you the temperature of the star,
for example.
Uh,
oh,

697
00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:35.950
I'll do that.
The temperature,
uh,

698
00:43:35.951 --> 00:43:39.580
of serious is 10,000 degrees surface temperature.

699
00:43:40.450 --> 00:43:44.290
Uh,
so now I've given you both.
Uh,
I've,

700
00:43:44.291 --> 00:43:49.060
I've left out information that told you too much.
All right?
So,
uh,

701
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:53.710
what is the mental process that you need to go through and solving a problem

702
00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:57.220
which has these kinds of difficulties associated with it?

703
00:43:59.140 --> 00:43:59.973
Okay.

704
00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:04.980
So how to think about such problems.

705
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:11.230
Okay.
The first thing to notice is,
uh,

706
00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:14.210
what you would do in the ordinary plug and chug.
What have you got?

707
00:44:14.211 --> 00:44:17.210
What do you need?
You have a value for the orbital period.

708
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:21.650
You have a value for the distance.
And what you want is an angle.

709
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:26.360
<v 1>Uh,
okay.</v>

710
00:44:28.110 --> 00:44:31.080
<v 0>Now then,
and so and so you know this,</v>

711
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.720
this doesn't lead you to where you want to go.

712
00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:37.740
The next thing you've got to do is make an assumption.
This is a star.

713
00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:39.960
All stars are more or less the same.

714
00:44:40.110 --> 00:44:44.070
So let us imagine that this star has a mass,

715
00:44:44.071 --> 00:44:45.720
more or less similar to that of the sun.

716
00:44:45.721 --> 00:44:49.650
So the AMA is approximately equal to a solar mass.
How far wrong could you go?

717
00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:52.980
In fact,
you go wrong by about eight,
about a factor of two.

718
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:56.490
But at a certain point you're going to take the cube root of two.
Uh,

719
00:44:56.491 --> 00:44:59.490
and so it actually isn't so bad.
Uh,

720
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:03.570
so suppose m is equal to the mass of the sun.
Most stars are approximately.

721
00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:08.330
Aha.
Now we're getting somewhere because now we have an NP.

722
00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:13.740
And if you have put that equation and,
and,
uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

723
00:45:13.741 --> 00:45:17.790
Kepler's third law and interpreted it deeply into your brain and it has become

724
00:45:17.791 --> 00:45:20.490
part of your heart and soul and very being,

725
00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:23.940
you will immediately realize that if you have m and p of course you can

726
00:45:23.941 --> 00:45:25.860
calculate,
hey,
and in fact,

727
00:45:25.861 --> 00:45:30.360
you probably realize this first before you make the assumption in step two,

728
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.760
because that's why you're interested in the mass.

729
00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.450
Because you realize that if you happen to have an,

730
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.350
you would be able to determine.

731
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:42.380
A next thing you have to do is interpret what this a is a,

732
00:45:42.541 --> 00:45:47.010
is the semi major axis of the orbit of the planet around the star.
That's,
uh,

733
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.630
something,
uh,
very close to,
uh,
very similar to the distance,

734
00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:55.920
uh,
between the star and the planet

735
00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:00.990
is a,
so a,
is this a,

736
00:46:00.991 --> 00:46:04.680
and this equation is the same as [inaudible] two in the other equation.

737
00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:06.060
All right?

738
00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:11.060
So a is d two and the distance you have up there is the distance from us to that

739
00:46:11.851 --> 00:46:13.940
whole system.
That's d one.

740
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:17.610
And now you can compute

741
00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.033
<v 1>Alpha,</v>

742
00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:26.080
<v 0>right?
That's the thought process.
Uh,</v>

743
00:46:26.081 --> 00:46:31.081
and you may have to go sort of worry a little bit or a little bit around here,

744
00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:35.320
uh,
before you have the Aha moment of how to,
how to get the problem.

745
00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:37.720
This is the moment when you've solved the problem.

746
00:46:39.770 --> 00:46:43.070
And the key to solving this is to,
uh,

747
00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:47.840
have an instinctive reaction to knowing that you've got a period.

748
00:46:47.841 --> 00:46:50.900
Namely,
if I had a mass,
I could figure out the Emmy major axis,

749
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:52.670
or if I had the semi major access,

750
00:46:52.671 --> 00:46:55.430
I could figure out the mass and that has to click.

751
00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:59.840
And the way that clicks is to have this equation,
uh,
really,
uh,

752
00:46:59.841 --> 00:47:03.130
I was joking before,
but a really become,
uh,
uh,

753
00:47:03.170 --> 00:47:07.290
instinctive in a certain way and there won't be many equations in this class,
uh,

754
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:12.020
but it will really help you to assimilate them,
uh,
in,
uh,
that kind of depth.

755
00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:16.370
All right.
Uh,
so now in the few minutes remaining,

756
00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:20.090
let me actually solve this problem numerically.
Um,

757
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:25.610
P is equal to 40 years.
Uh,

758
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:27.800
D is equal to three.

759
00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:32.260
Parsecs here's something not to do 40 times,

760
00:47:32.261 --> 00:47:35.710
three times 10 to the seven,
because that'll give you the answer in seconds.
No,

761
00:47:35.711 --> 00:47:36.820
don't do that.
Uh,

762
00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:41.850
because both of the equations would rather have things in astronomical units at

763
00:47:41.951 --> 00:47:46.240
years and things like that.
So a cubed equals p squared.

764
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:50.370
M A M is one by assumption.
Uh,

765
00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:53.890
P is 40.
Uh,
so this is 1600.

766
00:47:53.891 --> 00:47:56.650
That's 40 squared on this side.
Hey Cube,

767
00:47:56.651 --> 00:47:59.410
that's 1.6 times 10 to the three.

768
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:04.240
Now we're going to take the cube root of both sides.
That's the cube root of one.

769
00:48:04.241 --> 00:48:09.241
Sit in 1.6 times the cube root of 1,003 times a third is equal to one.

770
00:48:10.391 --> 00:48:14.170
Conveniently enough,
uh,
the cube root of 1.6,
oh,
I don't know,

771
00:48:14.171 --> 00:48:18.580
that's 1.2 or something,
but call it one.
Uh,
so that's 10.

772
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:23.410
Uh,
and so it's 10 astronomical units.
Remember the,

773
00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:26.740
where are you doing this in solar masses years?
Astronomical Unit,

774
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:31.150
10 astronomical units.
That's how far away it is.
Now we can do this

775
00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:36.240
where this is an astronomical unit.
Uh,

776
00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.300
and this down here is in parsecs and 10 divided by three is three.

777
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:44.560
So the answer is a is equal to three arc seconds.

778
00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:46.070
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

779
00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:50.930
<v 0>Now this is an important result because the,
uh,</v>

780
00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.760
let me go back to this picture.

781
00:48:56.120 --> 00:49:01.120
The angular scale over which light is kind of thrown around by the atmosphere

782
00:49:01.791 --> 00:49:06.770
and by the optics of the kinds of telescopes we can build is some number of arc

783
00:49:06.771 --> 00:49:11.630
seconds.
Uh,
uh,
about half from good ground based observations,

784
00:49:11.631 --> 00:49:14.330
maybe half the light is inside one arc.
Second,

785
00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:19.370
the rest of the light is scattered all the way out to maybe 10 arc seconds from

786
00:49:19.371 --> 00:49:22.670
space.
It's a little bit better.
But,
uh,

787
00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:26.780
light from,
uh,

788
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.430
observations of stars

789
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:33.100
is scattered

790
00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:36.840
over angular.

791
00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:38.680
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

792
00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:43.110
<v 0>Sizes of some of arc seconds.</v>

793
00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:48.120
So you are guaranteed that there's going to be a bunch of light from the star,

794
00:49:48.121 --> 00:49:51.270
right on top of where you're looking for your planet.
And in fact,

795
00:49:51.271 --> 00:49:55.680
it's going to get worse because one of the things about this equation is d one,

796
00:49:55.890 --> 00:49:58.650
the distance to the star we did this for serious,

797
00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.040
serious is one of the closest stars.
It's three parsecs away.

798
00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:07.080
Most of the center of the Galaxy is 8,000 parsecs away.

799
00:50:07.081 --> 00:50:10.350
So if you take a typical star in our gala,
the galaxy,

800
00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.200
this number isn't going to be three.
It's going to be 8,000.

801
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:17.270
And this number isn't going to be three.
It's going to be,
uh,

802
00:50:17.310 --> 00:50:21.810
something like one,
one,
one,
1000th of an arc second.

803
00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:26.160
And the space telescope scatters light over tenths of seconds.
So you're,

804
00:50:26.310 --> 00:50:28.790
you're factors of a hundred,
uh,

805
00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:33.350
buried inside the light coming from that star.
Uh,
and so,

806
00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:38.510
uh,
that's why you don't care about more than one digit.

807
00:50:38.511 --> 00:50:38.901
In fact,

808
00:50:38.901 --> 00:50:42.320
you probably don't even care about anything other than the exponent of this

809
00:50:42.321 --> 00:50:45.200
answer because why are you doing this problem?

810
00:50:45.201 --> 00:50:49.760
You're doing this problem to figure out whether it's plausible to think that you

811
00:50:49.761 --> 00:50:54.050
might be able to see a planet as a separate dot separate from the star.

812
00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:58.610
And the fact that your answer comes out in arc seconds or fractions of an arc

813
00:50:58.611 --> 00:51:00.830
second tells you everything you need to know.

814
00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:06.020
You don't need any more decimal places to realize that the idea of looking up

815
00:51:06.021 --> 00:51:08.210
and seeing a planet is going to fail.

816
00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:13.460
So that's not the way that we're going to find planets.
Uh,

817
00:51:13.461 --> 00:51:16.280
so we have to come up with some different scheme a,

818
00:51:16.281 --> 00:51:19.210
and that's what we're going to talk about on Tuesday.
Thanks.
