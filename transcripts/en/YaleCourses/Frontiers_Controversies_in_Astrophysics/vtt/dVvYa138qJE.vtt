1
00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.150
So we've been talking about transit.

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.010
And I want to say a couple things more just to round out that discussion.

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.820
Uh,

4
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.201
Yoko,

5
00:00:10.201 --> 00:00:11.440
recall how this works.

6
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.813
Trantis.

7
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.080
Uh,

8
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.160
you get light,

9
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.000
uh,

10
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
blocked light from the star blocked by the planet.

11
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.963
Uh,

12
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.500
and in order for this to occur,

13
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.840
the orbit has to be exactly edge on,

14
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.870
otherwise the planet doesn't actually get in the way between you and the star.

15
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.860
So must be edge on.

16
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.810
And so what you see basically a,

17
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.300
although you're too far away to see it in this kind of detail,

18
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.830
it looks something like this.

19
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:47.880
Here's a star.

20
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.590
It's got this,

21
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.740
uh,

22
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.980
big bright shining desk.

23
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.030
And then,

24
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.390
uh,

25
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.120
crossing that star is a darker desk

26
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.730
from the planet.

27
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.710
So it looks like you have,

28
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.101
you know,

29
00:01:04.101 --> 00:01:04.480
a little,

30
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.290
little spot there and it's clear just from the geometry of this situation,

31
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.990
how much light is obscured.

32
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.620
Uh,

33
00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.280
it's basically the ratio of the cross section of the,

34
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.880
uh,

35
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.930
planet to that,

36
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:18.764
of the star.

37
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.250
So the depth of the transit.

38
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.200
And by that I mean,

39
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.130
uh,

40
00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.371
you know,

41
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:28.410
the fraction of the light that is obscured,

42
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.730
uh,

43
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.050
is equal to,

44
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.100
uh,

45
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.000
that will be,

46
00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.830
uh,

47
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.440
the cross section of the planet

48
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.280
divided by the Cross section of the star.

49
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.010
And the Cross section is just the projected area.

50
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.233
And so,

51
00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.840
uh,

52
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.021
uh,

53
00:01:57.021 --> 00:02:00.920
what that means in practice is here's the radius of the star,

54
00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:02.703
uh,

55
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.390
and there's an equivalent radius of the planet and it's just the ratio of the

56
00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:09.260
projected areas.

57
00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:09.381
Now,

58
00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:13.160
the area of a circle projected area of a sphere is a circle.

59
00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.340
The area of a circle you probably remember from a geometry is Pi r squared.

60
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.680
And so what this is going to be is a Pi are of the planet squared divided by Pi

61
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.450
r of the star squared and the pis cancel.

62
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.590
So it's the ratio of the squares of the radio.

63
00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:34.424
Hi.

64
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.223
Okay.

65
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.520
So,

66
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.820
uh,

67
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.930
to take an example,

68
00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.183
supposing you were,

69
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.580
you were an astronomer in some distant place and you're looking at the,

70
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.150
uh,

71
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.810
uh,

72
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.500
I add our own solar system and you're fortunate enough to be in a place where

73
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.630
you can see our solar system edge.

74
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:51.080
On,

75
00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.730
what would you see when the earth,

76
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.990
it's the sun.

77
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.850
So,

78
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.100
uh,

79
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.933
the earth.

80
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.890
So here's an example.

81
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.560
Uh,

82
00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.000
earth transmitting the sun,

83
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.233
Sun,

84
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.730
the radius of the earth,

85
00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.540
it turns out is something like seven times 10 to the six meters.

86
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.261
Uh,

87
00:03:13.261 --> 00:03:18.060
the radius of the sun is about a hundred times that seven times 10 to the eight

88
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.953
meters.

89
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.770
And so the depth of such a,

90
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:23.663
uh,

91
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.070
of such a transit is,

92
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.820
uh,

93
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.950
the square of the ratios of these,

94
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.853
uh,

95
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.860
of these radio guy,

96
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.430
seven times 10 to the six,

97
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.650
seven times 10 to the eight

98
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.591
squared,

99
00:03:40.591 --> 00:03:45.591
that's 10 to the minus two squared is equal to 10 to the minus four or 0.01%.

100
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.300
So that's a lot less than what you found in,

101
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.960
uh,

102
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.600
in section yesterday for a Jupiter like planets.

103
00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.520
And the key is in this,

104
00:03:59.521 --> 00:03:59.730
uh,

105
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.230
r squared factor until the earth is about a 10th,

106
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.070
uh,

107
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.000
has about a 10th.

108
00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:08.250
The radius is about a 10th the size of Jupiter,

109
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.260
but that 10th gets squared.

110
00:04:10.261 --> 00:04:11.190
So that's a hundred.

111
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.560
And so instead of getting a 1%,

112
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.713
uh,

113
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.480
uh,

114
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.940
dip in the light or approximately 1%,

115
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.850
you get a one 100th of 1%,

116
00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:21.481
one 100,

117
00:04:21.481 --> 00:04:23.190
1% is 10 to the minus two,

118
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.120
one 100th of 10 of 1% is 10 to the minus four.

119
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.580
So as the planet gets smaller,

120
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.150
uh,

121
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.720
you,

122
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.991
uh,

123
00:04:30.991 --> 00:04:33.810
it becomes harder and harder to see these transits.

124
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:37.470
And if you think back on the pictures of these light curve,

125
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.700
the graphs that were made,

126
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.833
uh,

127
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.410
in,

128
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.540
from in the observations from the ground,

129
00:04:42.541 --> 00:04:47.430
you really needed to have about a 1% dip in order to be able to see it from

130
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:47.940
space.

131
00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.990
You can do a lot better.

132
00:04:48.991 --> 00:04:52.770
Things are much more stable and you might well be able to see something like

133
00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:53.220
this,

134
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.860
but only from space and not necessarily from the ground.

135
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.790
Uh,

136
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.540
now,

137
00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.230
uh,

138
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.820
having done this little calculation,

139
00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:00.960
of course in real life,

140
00:05:00.961 --> 00:05:02.070
you do it backwards.

141
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.970
Uh,

142
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.960
what I did here was I assumed that I knew what the radius is and I calculated

143
00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:08.100
what the transit would be.

144
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.250
That isn't how it works with extra solar planets.

145
00:05:11.251 --> 00:05:15.150
Because of course you don't know what the radius is a and instead what happens

146
00:05:15.151 --> 00:05:19.920
is you see the transit and you see the transit and you work backwards to figure

147
00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:20.880
out what the radius is.

148
00:05:20.881 --> 00:05:24.180
You have to make some assumption about what the radius of the star is likely to

149
00:05:24.181 --> 00:05:24.870
be.

150
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:25.410
Uh,

151
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:30.410
and so basically observing a Trenton is a way to get the radius of the star.

152
00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:32.850
So if Trent,

153
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.693
it,

154
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.920
uh,

155
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.570
give you the radius,

156
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:37.231
uh,

157
00:05:37.231 --> 00:05:42.231
and this is nice because the radio velocity met method,

158
00:05:42.271 --> 00:05:43.680
the doppler shift method,

159
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.580
doppler measurement also give you something about,

160
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.180
uh,

161
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.811
the star,

162
00:05:48.811 --> 00:05:49.770
but it's the mass,

163
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.760
not the radius.

164
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.340
And then if you have both of these things,

165
00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.760
then you get to put them together and figure out what the density is.

166
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.110
And that's why observing both of these things,

167
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.470
uh,

168
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.360
in the same system is so useful.

169
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.961
Uh,

170
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:04.280
so let's do this again.

171
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:05.114
For the earth,

172
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.660
the mass of the earth is six times 10 to the 24 kilograms.

173
00:06:12.051 --> 00:06:13.130
The radius of the earth,

174
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.700
we just figured out seven times 10 to the six meters.

175
00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.000
And our hypothetical astronomers out there,

176
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.390
uh,

177
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.250
in the rest of the galaxy somewhere,

178
00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.791
uh,

179
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:26.270
would have been able to determine this if they saw the transit.

180
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.200
So now,

181
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.381
uh,

182
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:31.430
what is the density density is this Greek letter row symbolically,

183
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:32.001
uh,

184
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:35.000
and that is equal to mass over volume,

185
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.620
uh,

186
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.620
which is equal to mass over four thirds.

187
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.290
Pi r cubed pies equal to three,

188
00:06:42.291 --> 00:06:43.310
so that cancels,

189
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:44.144
which is helpful.

190
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:45.343
Uh,

191
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.340
and let's see,

192
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.701
uh,

193
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:51.701
so the mass on top six times 10 to the 24 divided by four times this quantity

194
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:54.134
cubed.

195
00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:57.210
Now what do we do about that?

196
00:06:57.211 --> 00:06:59.190
Seven Times seven is 50,

197
00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.000
right?

198
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.833
Uh,

199
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.480
so this is seven times 50,

200
00:07:03.481 --> 00:07:04.920
which is 350.

201
00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.970
Uh,

202
00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:06.661
so let's see.

203
00:07:06.661 --> 00:07:11.661
This is equal to six times 10 to the 24 over four times 350 times 10 to the six

204
00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:14.731
cubed,

205
00:07:14.731 --> 00:07:16.140
which is 10 to the 18,

206
00:07:16.141 --> 00:07:17.340
six times three is 18.

207
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.350
Uh,

208
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.700
and so what's this?

209
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.301
Oh,

210
00:07:21.301 --> 00:07:22.134
I don't know.

211
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.670
This is 1400.

212
00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.441
Uh,

213
00:07:25.441 --> 00:07:30.441
and so this then in turn is equal to six times 10 to the 24 over 1.4 times 10 to

214
00:07:33.421 --> 00:07:34.530
the 21.

215
00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.490
Uh,

216
00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:36.323
because,

217
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.811
uh,

218
00:07:36.811 --> 00:07:40.710
this is 1.4 times 10 to the three times 10 to the 18,

219
00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.290
six over 1.4 is four.

220
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:47.040
Give or take a times 10 to the three.

221
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.750
And that's the answer.

222
00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:51.120
That's the density in what unit.

223
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:52.200
Let's see.

224
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:52.381
Uh,

225
00:07:52.381 --> 00:07:56.480
this had better be kilograms per meter cube.

226
00:07:56.481 --> 00:07:58.740
Dritan mks calculation.

227
00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.460
Why?

228
00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.780
Because that's what I started with kilograms in meters four times 10 to the

229
00:08:03.781 --> 00:08:05.070
three kilograms per meter cube.

230
00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:05.940
What does that tell you?

231
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.270
<v 1>What does that tell you?</v>

232
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.930
<v 0>Four times more dense than water.</v>

233
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:16.853
Excellent.

234
00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:17.520
Uh,

235
00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.353
so,

236
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.660
uh,

237
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.880
this is four times water.

238
00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.520
Water is defined to be a tented,

239
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:30.530
the three kilograms per meter cubed density of water or rather a kilogram is

240
00:08:31.441 --> 00:08:32.131
defined.

241
00:08:32.131 --> 00:08:34.500
So that water has that particular density.

242
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:35.640
Um,

243
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.860
it's four times water,

244
00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:37.590
uh,

245
00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:41.040
that makes it a rocky planet because,

246
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:41.310
uh,

247
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:46.310
the ices and the gases that make up a atypical,

248
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:47.170
uh,

249
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.410
a typical gas giant planet don't,

250
00:08:49.411 --> 00:08:50.011
don't get,

251
00:08:50.011 --> 00:08:51.570
don't achieve that kind of density.

252
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.770
And so,

253
00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.041
uh,

254
00:08:53.041 --> 00:08:56.970
our hypothetical astronomers observing transit would determine not only that the

255
00:08:56.971 --> 00:08:58.800
earth that the earth is there,

256
00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.710
but also that it's gotta be made out of rocks.

257
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:02.760
And that,

258
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.410
uh,

259
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.630
uh,

260
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.020
is an additional piece of information that's really useful and trying to figure

261
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:09.480
out what's going on in these kinds of systems.

262
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.993
Okay.

263
00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.400
Now it turns out that there are some other methods for identifying planets

264
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:22.230
around other stars.

265
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.740
Uh,

266
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.660
and I want to talk about one of them.

267
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:29.340
And the reason I hadn't talked about this one more is because it hasn't yet

268
00:09:29.341 --> 00:09:31.320
discovered any planets around other stars.

269
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.910
There've been lots of planets discovered by the radio velocity method.

270
00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.160
There've been lots of planets discovered,

271
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:38.850
uh,

272
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.840
now by transits now with the latest Hubble space telescope results.

273
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:43.590
Uh,

274
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:46.190
but that those were not the first methods that were,

275
00:09:46.191 --> 00:09:47.940
were tried for a long time.

276
00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:50.850
People had been trying something else and it hasn't really worked.

277
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:51.811
And this is,

278
00:09:51.811 --> 00:09:52.080
uh,

279
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.670
this is called astrometry.

280
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.560
So here's another method.

281
00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.253
<v 1>Okay.</v>

282
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.640
<v 0>Astrometry means measuring stars in Greek.</v>

283
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:08.803
Uh,

284
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:09.470
and,

285
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.950
uh,

286
00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:11.060
basically what this is,

287
00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:15.320
is it's determining the positions of stars to extremely high accuracy.

288
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.830
Remember the whole game here is that the star moves to,

289
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:23.120
and we've been using doppler shift measurements to measure the velocity of the

290
00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:23.331
star,

291
00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:25.850
the radio velocity of the stars that goes round and round.

292
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:28.430
But you could in principle also try and figure out,

293
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.090
uh,

294
00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:33.080
that the actual position of the stars in space moves a little bit too.

295
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.130
So,

296
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:34.491
uh,

297
00:10:34.491 --> 00:10:39.491
observing a change in position

298
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:42.920
of the star.

299
00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.570
Now that change is quite small a,

300
00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:48.440
and you'll recall that we started out a few weeks ago saying,

301
00:10:48.441 --> 00:10:48.920
you know,

302
00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:53.150
you don't see the star all that accurately because at atmospheric distortion and

303
00:10:53.151 --> 00:10:54.920
prob optical problems in your telescope,

304
00:10:54.921 --> 00:10:56.810
you just see this big blob of light.

305
00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.550
And the key point here is that it is actually not,

306
00:11:01.551 --> 00:11:02.780
if you have enough light,

307
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:03.170
uh,

308
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:06.290
you can determine the center of a big Blob of like,

309
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.890
uh,

310
00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:10.580
really quite accurately determine

311
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.170
the center

312
00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:14.320
<v 1>okay.</v>

313
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.840
<v 0>Of a blob of light</v>

314
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.140
to a much greater accuracy

315
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.600
then the extent of the blob.

316
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.320
So,

317
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:31.711
you know,

318
00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:35.100
I take a picture of a star and I see something that kind of looks like this,

319
00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.610
and that's big and ugly and hard to deal with,

320
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.623
except,

321
00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.140
uh,

322
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:40.411
you know,

323
00:11:40.411 --> 00:11:44.700
the accuracy of the position of that Blob isn't limited by the extent,

324
00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:45.031
you know,

325
00:11:45.031 --> 00:11:47.160
that the centers somewhere around here,

326
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:51.030
and if that blob were to move slightly so that the center,

327
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:51.790
uh,

328
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.150
took a little s went around in circles like this,

329
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:59.560
you'd actually be able to see that as this big blob sort of move slowly around.

330
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:00.723
And that's the,

331
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.040
that's the trick with astrometry.

332
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.300
So you do these repeated measurements of the precise position of the star,

333
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:07.901
uh,

334
00:12:07.901 --> 00:12:10.480
and you want to be able to see it going around in circles.

335
00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:11.710
So,

336
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:12.543
uh,

337
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.690
we have in fact all the equations we need to deal with this already.

338
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.183
Um,

339
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.481
and,

340
00:12:19.481 --> 00:12:19.601
uh,

341
00:12:19.601 --> 00:12:20.410
so let's just,

342
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.610
let's just go straight to a particular exercise,

343
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:25.870
a calculation,

344
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:26.530
uh,

345
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.820
how big a change

346
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.780
in the son's position,

347
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.433
uh,

348
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.380
due to the planet Jupiter,

349
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.410
because that's the most massive and we'll make the most difference.

350
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:44.340
Uh,

351
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:49.340
what'd you see if you're on Alpha Centaury Wood and Alpha Centaury astronomer

352
00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.273
<v 1>observe.</v>

353
00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:56.850
<v 0>So here's the situation.</v>

354
00:12:56.851 --> 00:12:58.320
You're sitting on Alpha Centaury,

355
00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.310
you're looking back,

356
00:12:59.311 --> 00:13:01.230
which is the nearest star you may recall,

357
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:01.640
uh,

358
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.970
you're looking back at the solar system and you're hoping to see the change in

359
00:13:05.971 --> 00:13:07.170
movement of the sun,

360
00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:07.650
uh,

361
00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.540
due to the presence of the planet Jupiter.

362
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.390
So the first thing to say about this is,

363
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:12.840
uh,

364
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.860
what do we mean by change in position?

365
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:21.550
Change in position.

366
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.940
What we're talking about is an angle.

367
00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.850
We talked about this in a different context before.

368
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:29.140
Here's The Observer.

369
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:30.190
Here's,

370
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:30.881
here's the,

371
00:13:30.881 --> 00:13:31.210
uh,

372
00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:31.720
uh,

373
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.760
the star and the star is moving.

374
00:13:33.761 --> 00:13:35.110
It's going to move up to here.

375
00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.620
And what we want is to draw this triangle and we want an angle,

376
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.501
uh,

377
00:13:41.501 --> 00:13:42.320
and then,

378
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:42.600
uh,

379
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.820
[inaudible] over here is the amount by which the star moves.

380
00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.090
Do one over here is the distance to the star.

381
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.840
And we want the angular

382
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:59.100
change in position because that's what we mean when we make a position

383
00:13:59.101 --> 00:13:59.880
measurement,

384
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.221
uh,

385
00:14:00.221 --> 00:14:01.054
in space.

386
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:02.550
Okay?

387
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:06.570
So that's the first thing is to understand what the answer ought ought to look

388
00:14:06.571 --> 00:14:06.781
like.

389
00:14:06.781 --> 00:14:08.340
It's got to be some kind of an angle.

390
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:10.350
And then the second thing is,

391
00:14:10.351 --> 00:14:14.820
I've done my usual trick here of not giving you a whole bunch of information

392
00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:15.930
that you're going to need.

393
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:16.651
Uh,

394
00:14:16.651 --> 00:14:17.484
and so,

395
00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:17.821
uh,

396
00:14:17.821 --> 00:14:18.150
the,

397
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.250
the first thing you have to do in order to,

398
00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.133
uh,

399
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.940
uh,

400
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:22.870
line up,

401
00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.550
uh,

402
00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.880
of the try and set up the answer is you have to figure out some,

403
00:14:26.881 --> 00:14:28.370
some actual answers.

404
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:31.530
So the mass of the sun is obviously equal to the mass of the sun.

405
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:32.393
That's easy.

406
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:32.700
Uh,

407
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:37.700
the mass of Jupiter is equal to a two times 10 to the 27 kilograms that a one

408
00:14:40.711 --> 00:14:43.200
1000th of the mass of the sun.

409
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:44.160
Uh,

410
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:49.160
the distance from Alpha sin to us son from Alpha sent to the sun is about one

411
00:14:51.531 --> 00:14:52.161
parsec.

412
00:14:52.161 --> 00:14:53.720
I think I mentioned that before.

413
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:54.170
Uh,

414
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.740
because it,

415
00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.930
this is the closest star that there is.

416
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.770
Uh,

417
00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.520
and,

418
00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:58.970
uh,

419
00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:03.970
the semi major axis of Jupiter's orbit a is equal to five astronomical units.

420
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:10.100
I wrote that down on the first day of class.

421
00:15:10.101 --> 00:15:12.050
So you're going to need all this information.

422
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:14.150
Now here's the trick.

423
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.810
Here's Jupiter doing it's five astronomical unit thing.

424
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:18.973
Uh,

425
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.350
and then the sun in the middle.

426
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.450
Here's the center of mass,

427
00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:26.980
center of mass,

428
00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.370
<v 1>okay.</v>

429
00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.320
<v 0>And The sun is,</v>

430
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:30.800
uh,

431
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.210
doing a little circuit,

432
00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:33.770
uh,

433
00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:35.090
in the other direction,

434
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.710
always making sure that it's on the other side of the center of mass from the

435
00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:40.160
planet.

436
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.870
That's what a center of mass means,

437
00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:42.560
right?

438
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.190
Uh,

439
00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:43.880
and,

440
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:44.660
uh,

441
00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.040
then we can take

442
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:49.100
at one point,

443
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:49.934
here's the,

444
00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:50.451
let's say,

445
00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:52.370
here's The sun and here's Jupiter.

446
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.730
And we take this little line here.

447
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.780
And,

448
00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:57.080
uh,

449
00:15:57.080 --> 00:16:00.800
the whole of the distance here is a total.

450
00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:05.660
And the distance from the planet to the center of mass is a planet.

451
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:09.140
And this tiny little distance here is a star.

452
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.960
And what we need to look for is a star in this case,

453
00:16:11.961 --> 00:16:14.180
because we're watching the star go round in circles,

454
00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:15.014
not the planet.

455
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:20.170
And then the usual equations apply where m star a star is equal to an planet,

456
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.553
a planet.

457
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.910
We've seen this equation in dealing with velocities.

458
00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:28.520
Uh,

459
00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.860
but it's the same thing in distances because the,

460
00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.200
the time that it takes to go around these circles,

461
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:34.070
uh,

462
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.130
is one orbital period is the same in both cases.

463
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:40.100
So if the velocity is slower than you cover less ground,

464
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.611
uh,

465
00:16:40.611 --> 00:16:41.810
or to put it a different way,

466
00:16:41.811 --> 00:16:43.730
if you're going in a smaller circle,

467
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:45.050
you're not moving as fast.

468
00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.280
So it's the same equation.

469
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:48.410
And so let's do this.

470
00:16:48.411 --> 00:16:53.411
A star is equal to an planet over m star times a of the planet.

471
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.303
That's five.

472
00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.020
Aau in the case of,

473
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.190
in this particular case,

474
00:16:58.191 --> 00:17:00.410
and I've already said that the mass of the planet,

475
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:01.190
uh,

476
00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:04.520
is equal to 10 to the minus three times the mass of the star here.

477
00:17:04.521 --> 00:17:06.050
So this is 10 to the minus three.

478
00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:11.090
So this is five times 10 to the minus three astronomical units.

479
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.300
That's how far the earth,

480
00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:14.841
that's,

481
00:17:14.841 --> 00:17:18.170
that's the radius of the sun's orbit around,

482
00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.470
uh,

483
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.510
around the center of mass with Jupiter.

484
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.980
You want to think of it that way?

485
00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:22.491
Uh,

486
00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:23.840
but that's not the answer we want.

487
00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:24.920
We want an angle,

488
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:29.321
uh,

489
00:17:29.321 --> 00:17:34.321
and this in a u and this here in parsecs will give us an angle in arc seconds.

490
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.940
And this is a particularly easy one.

491
00:17:39.941 --> 00:17:44.350
We already have five times 10 to the minus three in Aau and the distance is one

492
00:17:44.351 --> 00:17:45.184
parsec.

493
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.160
And so this is five times 10 to the minus three arc seconds,

494
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:52.950
five milli arc seconds.

495
00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:53.131
Now,

496
00:17:53.131 --> 00:17:58.131
that's much smaller than the size of the blob of light from Alpha Centauri.

497
00:17:58.771 --> 00:17:59.670
But as I said,

498
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:00.001
uh,

499
00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:04.230
you can see the motion of the center of a Blob of light to fairly high accuracy

500
00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:07.380
and this is a pretty readily observable.

501
00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.273
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

502
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:16.940
<v 0>So folks sitting on Alpha Centaury would know that the,</v>

503
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.390
uh,

504
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:18.620
who have our kind of,

505
00:18:18.621 --> 00:18:23.030
our level of technology would already know that Jupiter exists from this method.

506
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:24.620
Interestingly,

507
00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:25.670
uh,

508
00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:27.380
we can look at Alpha Centuri,

509
00:18:27.381 --> 00:18:28.040
right?

510
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:28.141
Uh,

511
00:18:28.141 --> 00:18:32.360
you can do this backwards and you get exactly the same answer because Alpha

512
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.340
Centaury is a sunlike star has exactly the same mass and we don't observe any

513
00:18:37.341 --> 00:18:39.910
such motion in Alpha Sam.

514
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:52.110
And so there is no Jupiter like planets around Alpha Sam.

515
00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.520
Uh,

516
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.800
we know that because if there had been,

517
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:57.540
we would have seen it through this mess.

518
00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:57.991
It's through,

519
00:18:57.991 --> 00:18:58.920
through this method.

520
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.153
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

521
00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:02.930
<v 0>Uh,</v>

522
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:03.171
no,

523
00:19:03.171 --> 00:19:04.250
you can do the same thing.

524
00:19:04.251 --> 00:19:05.240
Let me do it quickly.

525
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:05.900
Uh,

526
00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:06.920
for the earth.

527
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.290
Supposing you want to detect the earth in this way.

528
00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:10.280
So,

529
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:10.880
uh,

530
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.110
a of the planet,

531
00:19:12.111 --> 00:19:13.340
so this is for earth.

532
00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:14.720
Uh,

533
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.200
a of the planet is now one a u instead of five,

534
00:19:18.201 --> 00:19:23.201
eight use mass of the planet is six times 10 to the 24.

535
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:28.930
So mass of the planet over a mass of the star is six times 10 to the 24,

536
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.750
over two times 10 to the 30,

537
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.140
that three times 10 to the minus six.

538
00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:38.953
And so,

539
00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:40.243
uh,

540
00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:41.780
the,

541
00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:42.613
uh,

542
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:48.320
a of the sun due to the earth now not due to Jupiter is equal to one a you,

543
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:50.843
that's uh,

544
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:51.470
the,

545
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:52.140
the uh,

546
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.680
the size of the planet times the ratio of the masses,

547
00:19:55.681 --> 00:19:57.660
which is three times 10 to the minus six.

548
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:02.840
So it's three times 10 to the minus six a you much less than for Jupiter,

549
00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:06.590
which was five times 10 to the minus three a.

550
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.140
And then Alpha Equals d two over d one,

551
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.470
three times 10 to the minus six over one,

552
00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.590
three micro arc seconds.

553
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:18.000
<v 1>Okay.</v>

554
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.530
<v 0>This is not observable,</v>

555
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:21.480
at least not with current technology.

556
00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.540
So our friends on Alpha Centaury who know that they're stupid or don't yet know

557
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.740
that Earth exists,

558
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:29.190
uh,

559
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:34.190
because this is so much smaller than the effect due to due to Jupiter and its

560
00:20:34.831 --> 00:20:36.600
smaller for two different reasons.

561
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.960
One reason is that the mass of earth is small,

562
00:20:39.961 --> 00:20:41.490
so this ratio is small.

563
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.340
The other is that the Earth's orbit is shorter.

564
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.910
Uh,

565
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.190
so it's one a u instead of five Aau.

566
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.210
So you're multiplying two numbers together.

567
00:20:49.211 --> 00:20:52.090
Instead of multiplying five by 10 to the minus three,

568
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.090
you're multiplying one by 10 to the minus six.

569
00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:59.770
And so both of those numbers are smaller and so the effect is that much smaller.

570
00:20:59.771 --> 00:21:00.910
So we can't yet,

571
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.480
uh,

572
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.630
our friends on Alpha Santori can't tell whether we have earth.

573
00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.050
Uh,

574
00:21:05.050 --> 00:21:06.010
and likewise,

575
00:21:06.011 --> 00:21:07.930
we can't tell whether Alpha Centaury,

576
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.411
uh,

577
00:21:08.411 --> 00:21:09.070
has,

578
00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:09.550
uh,

579
00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.390
has an earth.

580
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:14.260
So one of the interesting things about the astrometry method,

581
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:16.000
and this is why I bring the whole thing up,

582
00:21:16.450 --> 00:21:19.690
is that it favors big orbits.

583
00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:24.600
The bigger the orbit,

584
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.220
the bigger the f the,

585
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.090
the motion of both the star and the planet.

586
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:35.360
This is exactly opposite to what happens with the radio velocity method.

587
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.660
Radio philosophy method favors small orbits because in small orbits,

588
00:21:39.661 --> 00:21:42.060
things go faster and you're looking at the velocity.

589
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.640
So this favors big orbits,

590
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:49.670
and that's the opposite of radial velocity measurement.

591
00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:52.920
Uh,

592
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.090
and it also,

593
00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:54.600
uh,

594
00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.180
favors massive planet.

595
00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.050
The more massive the planet that the better off you'll be,

596
00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:05.550
which is the same as the radio velocity method.

597
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:08.340
<v 1>Okay?</v>

598
00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.390
<v 0>And so this is useful,</v>

599
00:22:09.391 --> 00:22:09.841
one of the,

600
00:22:09.841 --> 00:22:12.420
if you're trying to figure out what kinds of things are out there,

601
00:22:12.421 --> 00:22:17.310
it's helpful to be looking with several different methods which select for

602
00:22:17.311 --> 00:22:20.730
different kinds of objects that you can look for.

603
00:22:20.731 --> 00:22:21.530
And so,

604
00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:22.140
uh,

605
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:22.441
uh,

606
00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:25.200
you can call these selection effects and,

607
00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:25.590
uh,

608
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.921
you know,

609
00:22:25.921 --> 00:22:27.300
if you're looking at radio velocities,

610
00:22:27.301 --> 00:22:28.590
you can miss all the,

611
00:22:28.591 --> 00:22:30.450
all the large orbit stars.

612
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.590
And so it would be nice to also look with astrometry so that you can,

613
00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:35.521
uh,

614
00:22:35.521 --> 00:22:36.354
see,

615
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:37.320
uh,

616
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.970
see other kinds of stars,

617
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:39.900
uh,

618
00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:40.890
other kinds of planets.

619
00:22:40.891 --> 00:22:41.580
Now let's see.

620
00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:44.490
The astrometry method has one other feature that,

621
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.413
uh,

622
00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.080
it need star needs to be,

623
00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:53.100
needs to be nearby.

624
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.050
This is a fee.

625
00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:59.340
This isn't a question that doesn't arise in radio velocity and it's because of

626
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.600
this term.

627
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.530
It's because you're,

628
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:02.880
it's because of this term here.

629
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.110
You're looking for Alpha.

630
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:08.460
So even once you figured out how much the star moves,

631
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:08.730
uh,

632
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.280
you've got to divide by the distance of the star.

633
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.450
So for example,

634
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:16.530
if you're looking at something 10 parsecs away instead of one parsec away,

635
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.140
then you've got only one 10th the effect.

636
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:24.300
And so while people sitting on Alpha Centaury can see the effect of Jupiter

637
00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.430
people 10 times further away,

638
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.020
a on some other star,

639
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:28.561
a,

640
00:23:28.561 --> 00:23:32.430
which is still quite close and galactic terms would not be able to see that

641
00:23:32.431 --> 00:23:33.360
exact same effect.

642
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:34.171
Even though of course,

643
00:23:34.171 --> 00:23:35.700
the sun's moving the same way,

644
00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.200
regardless of who's looking at it.

645
00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.940
The further away you get,

646
00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.860
the smaller the effect becomes.

647
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.130
That's why nobody's largely,

648
00:23:44.131 --> 00:23:44.970
I think that's,

649
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.790
nobody has successfully used the astrometry effect cause it's only works out

650
00:23:49.791 --> 00:23:54.020
well on very nearby stars and there's just a limited number of those to look at.

651
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.100
Uh,

652
00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.340
and so let me summarize all these different methods now.

653
00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.713
Uh,

654
00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:00.853
oh good.

655
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:01.310
Uh,

656
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.850
by,

657
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:02.150
uh,

658
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:05.690
just making a little table of the so called selection effects.

659
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:14.230
These are what kinds of things are easy to see.

660
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.350
Uh,

661
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:18.440
and what kinds of things are not so easy to see for a given method.

662
00:24:18.441 --> 00:24:19.860
And we've got three different methods.

663
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:21.830
So let's make a little table here.

664
00:24:21.831 --> 00:24:22.664
Method.

665
00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:23.030
Uh,

666
00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.130
what kinds of orbits get picked out,

667
00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:30.290
what kind of planets get picked out for a given or a bid and other

668
00:24:30.291 --> 00:24:31.310
considerations.

669
00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:33.021
Uh,

670
00:24:33.021 --> 00:24:33.741
and here we go.

671
00:24:33.741 --> 00:24:37.940
So the first one we talked about was radial velocities.

672
00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:41.810
This is the doppler shift.

673
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:49.100
And this picks out short or small orbits short.

674
00:24:49.101 --> 00:24:51.470
If you're thinking about the period small,

675
00:24:51.471 --> 00:24:53.780
if you're thinking about the semi major axis,

676
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:54.500
uh,

677
00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.191
because the,

678
00:24:55.191 --> 00:24:56.150
the smaller the orbit,

679
00:24:56.151 --> 00:24:58.010
the faster the planet it has to go.

680
00:24:58.160 --> 00:24:58.641
And therefore,

681
00:24:58.641 --> 00:25:00.620
the faster the star has to respond,

682
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.101
uh,

683
00:25:01.101 --> 00:25:05.840
it picks out massive planets because the more massive the planet,

684
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:08.360
the greater the reflex motion of the star.

685
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:10.760
And,

686
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.120
uh,

687
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.200
you'll recall there.

688
00:25:12.201 --> 00:25:14.810
It does make a difference how the thing is oriented.

689
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.800
Uh,

690
00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:16.550
if it's,

691
00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:17.300
if it's,

692
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:18.070
uh,

693
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.260
uh,

694
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.230
less than edge on you see only part of the motion.

695
00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.370
So it's,

696
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.233
uh,

697
00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:23.630
uh,

698
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:28.630
helps a little to be close to edge on.

699
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.790
Now for the next method,

700
00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:35.870
which are transits,

701
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:38.263
uh,

702
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:39.830
where the star gets in.

703
00:25:39.831 --> 00:25:40.400
The way,

704
00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.920
this criteria that you have to be edge on is much,

705
00:25:42.921 --> 00:25:44.690
much more important because,

706
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.051
uh,

707
00:25:45.051 --> 00:25:46.250
in the case of,

708
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:47.030
uh,

709
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.620
in the case of the radio velocity,

710
00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:49.071
you know,

711
00:25:49.071 --> 00:25:50.150
if you're not edge on,

712
00:25:50.151 --> 00:25:53.180
it sort of gradually becomes a smaller and smaller and smaller effect.

713
00:25:53.181 --> 00:25:54.020
But gradually,

714
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:55.070
there's no big,

715
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.970
uh,

716
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.100
moment where you can't see it at all.

717
00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.330
But with transit,

718
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:00.433
uh,

719
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:02.570
if you're not edge on,

720
00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.430
you don't see anything.

721
00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.130
It's not that the effect gets smaller.

722
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:09.440
It's that the effect disappears all together.

723
00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:12.500
If you're not sufficiently edge on so that,

724
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:12.711
uh,

725
00:26:12.711 --> 00:26:13.880
the planet gets away,

726
00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:14.600
uh,

727
00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.520
gets in the way of,

728
00:26:15.521 --> 00:26:17.270
of your line of sight to the star.

729
00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:18.320
Uh,

730
00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:23.150
this also favors short or small orbits.

731
00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:24.950
Uh,

732
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:25.400
but,

733
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:25.640
uh,

734
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.840
and that's because it has to be edge on how close to edge on you have to be

735
00:26:29.841 --> 00:26:31.190
depends on how far,

736
00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:31.990
uh,

737
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.750
uh,

738
00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:33.320
uh,

739
00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.910
the stars from the planet.

740
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:36.463
Here's what I mean.

741
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.000
Here's the star.

742
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.650
Uh,

743
00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:40.460
and here's the,

744
00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.293
here's you,

745
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:44.670
and supposing there's a planet here,

746
00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:48.723
uh,

747
00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:49.210
then,

748
00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:50.110
then that will,

749
00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.000
we'll just get in the way.

750
00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:52.960
Uh,

751
00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.540
but if there's a planet here,

752
00:26:55.541 --> 00:26:57.940
a little further away on that same,

753
00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:58.240
uh,

754
00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.290
in the same kind of orbit,

755
00:26:59.291 --> 00:27:00.041
only more distant,

756
00:27:00.041 --> 00:27:01.240
then it doesn't get in the way.

757
00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.360
And so,

758
00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:02.960
uh,

759
00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:03.280
uh,

760
00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.440
more distant.

761
00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.153
Uh,

762
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:08.860
let me phrase that differently.

763
00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:13.890
Larger sent me major access makes it harder to have a transit you have to closer

764
00:27:18.581 --> 00:27:19.330
to edge on.

765
00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:20.440
If you were out here,

766
00:27:20.441 --> 00:27:24.640
you'd have to see here anything within this,

767
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:25.540
uh,

768
00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.910
this little angle here will cause a transit,

769
00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.350
but if you're out here,

770
00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:30.820
<v 1>yeah,</v>

771
00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:31.181
<v 0>let's see.</v>

772
00:27:31.181 --> 00:27:35.290
It would have to be anything within this smaller angle.

773
00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:40.410
Does that make sense?

774
00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:42.851
Yeah.

775
00:27:42.851 --> 00:27:43.450
It's just,

776
00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:46.600
it's just the further away you hold your thumb from your eye,

777
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:47.380
uh,

778
00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:47.960
the,

779
00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.793
uh,

780
00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.310
the less you have to move your arm,

781
00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.413
uh,

782
00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:52.871
to,

783
00:27:52.871 --> 00:27:53.110
uh,

784
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.400
to cover a given thing.

785
00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:55.450
All right.

786
00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:55.810
Uh,

787
00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.170
and also in this case for transits,

788
00:27:58.210 --> 00:27:58.840
let's see.

789
00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.980
The planet has to be large physically in terms of its size.

790
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.850
Uh,

791
00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:05.620
and so it's not so much the mass,

792
00:28:05.621 --> 00:28:07.420
but the size of the thing that matters.

793
00:28:07.421 --> 00:28:10.300
So if you have a big butt light planet,

794
00:28:10.301 --> 00:28:14.410
a big fluffy thing that'll work well for transits but not to welfare radial

795
00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.333
velocities.

796
00:28:15.850 --> 00:28:16.511
Then finally,

797
00:28:16.511 --> 00:28:18.700
this astrometry method I just described,

798
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.080
uh,

799
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:24.300
favors large orbits in contrast to the other to affect,

800
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:25.300
uh,

801
00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.940
it is irrelevant whether it's add on because,

802
00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:28.420
uh,

803
00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:28.960
if,

804
00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.420
if it's a face on,

805
00:28:30.430 --> 00:28:33.250
then the star goes round in a circle like this and you can see it.

806
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.940
If it's edge on the star goes round in a circle like this and you see it moving

807
00:28:36.941 --> 00:28:38.740
back and forth as if it was in a line.

808
00:28:38.741 --> 00:28:40.120
So you can do it either way.

809
00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:41.110
Uh,

810
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:42.460
so that's irrelevant,

811
00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:44.380
but has to be nearby,

812
00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.300
must be nearby.

813
00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:52.030
And like the radio velocity method,

814
00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:54.250
you favor massive planets.

815
00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:56.140
So these are,

816
00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:56.710
uh,

817
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:58.450
three of the methods,

818
00:28:58.810 --> 00:28:59.940
uh,

819
00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.630
that are commonly being used now.

820
00:29:01.631 --> 00:29:02.110
Yes.

821
00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:02.890
Question.

822
00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:07.060
<v 1>That's the orbit has to be the strong imagery method so that the center of</v>

823
00:29:07.061 --> 00:29:08.350
masses are not far away.

824
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.140
<v 0>Yes.</v>

825
00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:09.741
So the,

826
00:29:09.741 --> 00:29:10.131
yes,

827
00:29:10.131 --> 00:29:10.970
that's exactly right.

828
00:29:10.971 --> 00:29:15.830
The orbit has to be large so that the center of mass has to be sufficiently far

829
00:29:15.831 --> 00:29:17.210
away from the star.

830
00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:20.180
So the travel's a big enough distance to be able to see.

831
00:29:20.181 --> 00:29:21.110
That's exactly right.

832
00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:24.740
Uh,

833
00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:29.570
there's one more method that's commonly in use called a micro lensing,

834
00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.370
which is really cool,

835
00:29:31.371 --> 00:29:32.570
but I'm not going to talk about it,

836
00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:33.260
uh,

837
00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.120
because it's a relativistic method.

838
00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:35.661
Uh,

839
00:29:35.661 --> 00:29:37.790
and so we haven't talked about relativity yet.

840
00:29:37.791 --> 00:29:38.121
We'll,

841
00:29:38.121 --> 00:29:38.330
uh,

842
00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:41.000
we'll cycle back and talk about this later on in the,

843
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:42.041
uh,

844
00:29:42.041 --> 00:29:43.420
and this has actually worked.

845
00:29:43.421 --> 00:29:43.820
And,

846
00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.620
uh,

847
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:45.220
uh,

848
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.810
I will restrain myself from trying to explain it in the remaining 15 minutes of

849
00:29:49.811 --> 00:29:51.490
this particular segment of the course.

850
00:29:51.491 --> 00:29:51.851
We'll come,

851
00:29:51.851 --> 00:29:52.750
we'll come back to it.

852
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.531
Uh,

853
00:29:53.531 --> 00:29:53.860
but,

854
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:54.250
uh,

855
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:59.250
but this sort of set of selection effects is a good thing to know because then

856
00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:03.730
if you do all of these things and you compare them to each other and each method

857
00:30:03.731 --> 00:30:05.260
has a different selection effect,

858
00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:10.360
then you have a fighting chance of figuring out what's actually out there rather

859
00:30:10.361 --> 00:30:14.980
than what you are simply able to see because of the particular method you're

860
00:30:14.981 --> 00:30:15.311
using.

861
00:30:15.311 --> 00:30:19.270
So it's a good idea to be trying to do all of these things at once.

862
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.943
Okay.

863
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:21.430
Uh,

864
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:22.263
let me,

865
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:22.991
uh,

866
00:30:22.991 --> 00:30:27.100
and this segment by talking about some space missions.

867
00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:28.563
Yes.

868
00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:29.481
<v 2>Question.</v>

869
00:30:29.481 --> 00:30:30.314
Yes.

870
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.740
There's similar to people of technology,

871
00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:38.060
somewhat university cap c,

872
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:39.243
uh,

873
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.333
<v 0>we can,</v>

874
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:41.000
yes.

875
00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.720
And so there,

876
00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:44.480
if there's people elsewhere with our technology,

877
00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:45.920
they can't detect the earth.

878
00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:50.540
That is the same as saying we can't detect earths around other stars.

879
00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.640
That is the case right now.

880
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:53.660
Uh,

881
00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:54.111
however,

882
00:30:54.111 --> 00:30:55.490
technology marches on,

883
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:56.180
uh,

884
00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:56.781
and,

885
00:30:56.781 --> 00:30:56.901
uh,

886
00:30:56.901 --> 00:30:57.170
Alice,

887
00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:58.280
I'll show you in 10,

888
00:30:58.281 --> 00:31:00.170
15 years that may no longer be true.

889
00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:05.390
So if the aliens out there are even 15 years further advanced than we are in

890
00:31:05.391 --> 00:31:05.991
technology,

891
00:31:05.991 --> 00:31:07.160
they might know that we're here.

892
00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:08.443
Um,

893
00:31:09.230 --> 00:31:09.921
other questions?

894
00:31:09.921 --> 00:31:10.410
Yes,

895
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:11.243
<v 2>yes.</v>

896
00:31:11.250 --> 00:31:14.160
Even supposing that we could detect the earth around another star,

897
00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.630
would the presence of a more massive planet sort of,

898
00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:18.460
<v 0>ah,</v>

899
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:20.890
would the presence of a more massive planet,

900
00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:21.610
uh,

901
00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:25.030
disrupt our potential detections of,

902
00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.550
uh,

903
00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:26.590
an earth like planet?

904
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.670
Not necessarily.

905
00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:31.660
Remember I showed youth at the radio velocity curve where they had detected

906
00:31:31.661 --> 00:31:33.580
several planets in the same system.

907
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:33.990
Uh,

908
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:36.670
what you do is you take the effect of the massive planet.

909
00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:39.970
You figure out what the mass and orientation of the massive planet is,

910
00:31:39.971 --> 00:31:41.620
and you remove that from your data,

911
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.140
and then you look for the little wiggles leftover.

912
00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:47.020
And you could do that effectively with any of these methods.

913
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.470
The example I showed was the radio velocity thing where they were three

914
00:31:50.471 --> 00:31:52.000
superposed sign curves,

915
00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:53.170
but you could also do it.

916
00:31:53.171 --> 00:31:54.880
There could be three different transit.

917
00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:55.540
Uh,

918
00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.720
and so you'd get a big lump for the big star and then a little lump for the

919
00:31:58.721 --> 00:31:59.291
little star.

920
00:31:59.291 --> 00:32:00.430
And if the little stars closer,

921
00:32:00.431 --> 00:32:01.510
you'd get the more often.

922
00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.250
And similarly in astrometry,

923
00:32:03.251 --> 00:32:05.980
you could get it moving back and forth through to a massive planet.

924
00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.190
And then emotion on top of that due to some other planets.

925
00:32:09.191 --> 00:32:09.690
So,

926
00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:10.340
uh,

927
00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:12.250
for all of these cases,

928
00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.293
uh,

929
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:18.480
the effect of one massive planet could be taken out so that you could see the

930
00:32:18.731 --> 00:32:19.360
result.

931
00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:24.310
Now what's perhaps more importantly is the presence of the massive planet could

932
00:32:24.311 --> 00:32:26.380
screw up the orbit of the,

933
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:26.621
uh,

934
00:32:26.621 --> 00:32:27.820
of the earth like planet,

935
00:32:27.821 --> 00:32:29.170
this whole migration idea,

936
00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.340
this Jupiter comes cruising into the inner solar system and then us earthlings

937
00:32:33.341 --> 00:32:37.450
are in trouble because our orbit gets disrupted and we fall into the sun or

938
00:32:37.451 --> 00:32:38.231
something like that.

939
00:32:38.231 --> 00:32:40.880
So the bigger problem is not detecting it,

940
00:32:40.881 --> 00:32:43.430
but whether it permits the planet to be there at all.

941
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:45.080
Other questions?

942
00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:45.850
Yes.

943
00:32:45.850 --> 00:32:46.683
<v 2>Oh,</v>

944
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:49.010
<v 0>well you get your problem sets black.</v>

945
00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:49.430
Yes.

946
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.470
That's an easy question and of the class.

947
00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:52.790
Other questions?

948
00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:55.053
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

949
00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.140
Will you be posting signs before?

950
00:32:57.890 --> 00:32:59.930
<v 0>We'll post these slides before the test.</v>

951
00:32:59.931 --> 00:33:00.560
Yes.

952
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:00.960
<v 2>Yup.</v>

953
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.310
All right,

954
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.501
good.

955
00:33:01.501 --> 00:33:02.334
Thanks.

956
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:03.493
<v 0>Other things?</v>

957
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:04.370
Yes.

958
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.680
<v 2>Why is it that we kind of like a,</v>

959
00:33:06.681 --> 00:33:07.700
it's not actually,

960
00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.550
this was the bathroom is Junius geometry.

961
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.910
Why is it not to a,

962
00:33:10.911 --> 00:33:14.240
because it's going from one side of the center of mass to the other.

963
00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:15.380
<v 0>Oh,</v>

964
00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.213
uh,

965
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:20.460
a is defined as the semi major access.

966
00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:22.530
It's just a definition thing,

967
00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:24.650
but isn't the star going?

968
00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.110
Yes.

969
00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:28.730
So the star travels a circle with radius egg.

970
00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:29.610
So you're right,

971
00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:30.990
it goes from one side to the other.

972
00:33:30.991 --> 00:33:32.740
So the distance the star goes is,

973
00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:35.130
is actually is actually to a,

974
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.150
and so that's just a definition question of,

975
00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:39.860
<v 2>because you can't,</v>

976
00:33:39.861 --> 00:33:40.770
you exhibits start with one.

977
00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:41.890
<v 0>Yes,</v>

978
00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:42.220
yes.

979
00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:42.760
You're right.

980
00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.120
So that the total angular change is,

981
00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.060
you're right,

982
00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.350
is actually to a,

983
00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:48.890
and uh,

984
00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:49.540
uh,

985
00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:50.320
what I was,

986
00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.190
what I was calculating there is the radius of the little circle that goes

987
00:33:54.191 --> 00:33:54.610
around.

988
00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:55.720
But you're absolutely right.

989
00:33:55.721 --> 00:33:55.991
The,

990
00:33:55.991 --> 00:33:56.061
the,

991
00:33:56.061 --> 00:33:56.940
in fact the distance,

992
00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:57.320
it's,

993
00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.140
it's like for the radio velocity,

994
00:33:59.230 --> 00:33:59.530
uh,

995
00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:00.250
method,

996
00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:02.350
the actual change in radio velocity,

997
00:34:02.351 --> 00:34:04.150
it's from the peak to the trough.

998
00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:07.030
But the number we quote is the amplitude of the sine curve.

999
00:34:07.031 --> 00:34:07.271
So,

1000
00:34:07.271 --> 00:34:08.410
so you're right about them.

1001
00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:10.653
Other questions?

1002
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1003
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.670
<v 0>Okay.</v>

1004
00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:15.770
Let me show you some things in work,

1005
00:34:15.771 --> 00:34:20.200
in progress and in particular space missions that are uh,

1006
00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:20.840
uh,

1007
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.870
being planned to explore this further.

1008
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:26.100
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1009
00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:29.310
<v 0>So the first of these is the so called Kepler mission,</v>

1010
00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.473
uh,

1011
00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:31.710
which is,

1012
00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:32.430
uh,

1013
00:34:32.430 --> 00:34:34.470
going to look for transits.

1014
00:34:34.471 --> 00:34:36.630
I showed you the Hubble Space Telescope,

1015
00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:37.703
um,

1016
00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:39.210
uh,

1017
00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:39.750
uh,

1018
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:40.620
transit curve,

1019
00:34:40.621 --> 00:34:41.281
which is much,

1020
00:34:41.281 --> 00:34:43.290
much better than anything you can do from the ground.

1021
00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.250
So obviously the place to look for transit is in space from space.

1022
00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:49.620
You could see transits the size of earth's,

1023
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.380
uh,

1024
00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:50.591
of,

1025
00:34:50.591 --> 00:34:51.241
of planets,

1026
00:34:51.241 --> 00:34:52.051
the size of earth,

1027
00:34:52.051 --> 00:34:54.150
where from the ground you wouldn't be able to see that.

1028
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:54.960
Uh,

1029
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.400
and uh,

1030
00:34:56.401 --> 00:34:56.971
also.

1031
00:34:56.971 --> 00:35:00.480
And so what they want to do is sent up a mission that's going to do nothing but

1032
00:35:00.481 --> 00:35:04.410
make high precision measurements of stars in order to look for transit.

1033
00:35:04.411 --> 00:35:08.040
So the problem with the space telescope is everybody wants to use it for all

1034
00:35:08.041 --> 00:35:08.761
kinds of things.

1035
00:35:08.761 --> 00:35:11.910
There's relatively little limited amounts of time for any one particular

1036
00:35:11.911 --> 00:35:12.660
project.

1037
00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.240
It's also not perfectly designed for,

1038
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:15.690
uh,

1039
00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:17.540
making these kinds of transits observations.

1040
00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:19.260
So this is going to be a mission,

1041
00:35:19.261 --> 00:35:20.010
which is,

1042
00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:20.550
uh,

1043
00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:20.970
uh,

1044
00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:25.970
set up for the express purpose of making very high precision measurements of the

1045
00:35:26.011 --> 00:35:28.260
brightness of stars over and over and over again.

1046
00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:29.250
Uh,

1047
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:29.820
and,

1048
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:30.150
uh,

1049
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:35.150
the problem with this is just the general problem with transit that you only see

1050
00:35:35.701 --> 00:35:36.780
the ones that are edge on.

1051
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.090
So you've got to look at lots and lots of stars.

1052
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.890
Even if lots of them have planets,

1053
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.840
you'll only see a few transits,

1054
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:45.750
but this is designed to carry out that mission.

1055
00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:47.290
So they're going to be a lots of transits,

1056
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:47.970
observe,

1057
00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:49.930
including transits from Earth,

1058
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.760
uh,

1059
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.140
from Earth size starts.

1060
00:35:52.141 --> 00:35:56.280
So this will be the first moment when this thing gets launched that will really

1061
00:35:56.281 --> 00:36:00.180
have a good handle on being able to detect an earth sized planet around.

1062
00:36:00.181 --> 00:36:03.210
So if the aliens have launched their equivalent of Kepler,

1063
00:36:03.211 --> 00:36:04.620
they're looking at us right now,

1064
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:05.310
uh,

1065
00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:10.020
provided our solar system happens to be exactly edge on from their perspective.

1066
00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:13.110
This is due to launch in a year or two.

1067
00:36:13.140 --> 00:36:14.310
It's under construction.

1068
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:15.390
It's ready to roll.

1069
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:17.070
And this thing will be up in space,

1070
00:36:17.071 --> 00:36:17.904
taking data,

1071
00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:18.900
uh,

1072
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.733
by the time,

1073
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.490
uh,

1074
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:21.840
within the next couple of years.

1075
00:36:21.841 --> 00:36:26.400
So that's an exciting thing to look forward to a little bit further into the

1076
00:36:26.401 --> 00:36:28.290
future is something called Sim.

1077
00:36:28.291 --> 00:36:30.900
This is the space interferometry mission.

1078
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.340
Uh,

1079
00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.670
and this does astrometry,

1080
00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:33.361
uh,

1081
00:36:33.361 --> 00:36:38.361
and it's going to improve the accuracy of positions of stars from what we now

1082
00:36:38.761 --> 00:36:39.091
have,

1083
00:36:39.091 --> 00:36:41.160
which is in the Milly arc second range,

1084
00:36:41.161 --> 00:36:43.050
one 1000th of an arc second,

1085
00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:43.620
uh,

1086
00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:45.810
to the micro arc second range,

1087
00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:46.171
one,

1088
00:36:46.171 --> 00:36:47.970
1000000th of a,

1089
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:48.241
uh,

1090
00:36:48.241 --> 00:36:49.110
of an arc second.

1091
00:36:49.111 --> 00:36:49.561
And again,

1092
00:36:49.561 --> 00:36:54.561
as we just did in that little calculation that will in principle enabled us to,

1093
00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.213
uh,

1094
00:36:56.610 --> 00:36:57.660
to look for,

1095
00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:58.500
uh,

1096
00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:59.700
earthlike systems.

1097
00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:00.750
Um,

1098
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:05.610
now the limitation on this is that is this business that for astrometry,

1099
00:37:05.611 --> 00:37:07.410
you have to look at nearby stars,

1100
00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:08.250
uh,

1101
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:09.540
and the nearer the star,

1102
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:09.990
the better.

1103
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.301
And,

1104
00:37:10.301 --> 00:37:12.750
and if you get far out into these,

1105
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.370
into the galaxy,

1106
00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.680
then the method becomes less sensitive.

1107
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:17.371
Uh,

1108
00:37:17.371 --> 00:37:18.870
it's also true that you know,

1109
00:37:18.871 --> 00:37:23.871
this method favors long orbits and space missions tend not to last for 40 years.

1110
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.170
Uh,

1111
00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:28.200
and so if you're looking for Neptune,

1112
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:29.071
which has,

1113
00:37:29.071 --> 00:37:29.470
you know,

1114
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:30.240
uh,

1115
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.160
many decade long orbit,

1116
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:32.641
uh,

1117
00:37:32.641 --> 00:37:36.120
it's not clear that this is going to be around for long enough to actually make

1118
00:37:36.121 --> 00:37:36.721
those measurements.

1119
00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:37.170
So,

1120
00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:37.351
uh,

1121
00:37:37.351 --> 00:37:41.430
this astrometry thing is kind of squeezed between the requirement of the method

1122
00:37:41.431 --> 00:37:46.260
to have long orbits and the requirement of human beings to get results in a

1123
00:37:46.261 --> 00:37:47.940
relatively short amount of time.

1124
00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.360
Uh,

1125
00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.021
nevertheless,

1126
00:37:49.021 --> 00:37:49.950
this will be a,

1127
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:54.570
a factor of a thousand improvement over what we can do from the ground.

1128
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:56.340
This mission is authorized,

1129
00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:57.690
it's kind of under construction,

1130
00:37:57.691 --> 00:38:01.620
but it's one of those things where it's going to launch in five to seven years.

1131
00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:01.950
Uh,

1132
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:04.290
that was also true five to seven years ago.

1133
00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:04.951
Uh,

1134
00:38:04.951 --> 00:38:08.340
and it will probably be in on are pessimistic days.

1135
00:38:08.341 --> 00:38:11.070
We think it will still be true five to seven years from now.

1136
00:38:11.071 --> 00:38:12.810
It's always five years in the future,

1137
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:16.620
both for technical reasons and for funding and political reasons.

1138
00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:17.041
Uh,

1139
00:38:17.041 --> 00:38:17.370
but,

1140
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:17.551
uh,

1141
00:38:17.551 --> 00:38:19.140
there's some feeling that,

1142
00:38:19.141 --> 00:38:19.410
uh,

1143
00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:19.651
you know,

1144
00:38:19.651 --> 00:38:20.580
one of these days though,

1145
00:38:20.581 --> 00:38:20.740
the,

1146
00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.440
they'll actually get around to doing it,

1147
00:38:22.441 --> 00:38:24.210
but it's certainly further in the future,

1148
00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:24.580
uh,

1149
00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.860
than the Kepler mission is.

1150
00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.070
And then the great grand daddy of all,

1151
00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:29.390
uh,

1152
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:33.060
planet mission to something called the terrestrial planet finder,

1153
00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:34.050
the TPF,

1154
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.321
uh,

1155
00:38:34.321 --> 00:38:36.580
this is a NASA commitment,

1156
00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:37.760
uh,

1157
00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:40.750
and they want to directly image the planet.

1158
00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.360
So this is fundamentally different from everything else.

1159
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:43.991
This is,

1160
00:38:43.991 --> 00:38:47.770
we're going to actually take a picture of the light from the planet.

1161
00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:51.220
We're going to give up this silly business of observing the star to infer the

1162
00:38:51.221 --> 00:38:52.270
presence of the planet.

1163
00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:54.520
We're actually going to look at the planet itself.

1164
00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.840
In order to do that,

1165
00:38:55.841 --> 00:38:58.390
you have to get rid of the light from the star.

1166
00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:02.380
You have to blank out the light of the star because otherwise as we saw a,

1167
00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.670
it'll drown out the planet.

1168
00:39:03.671 --> 00:39:05.860
And there are a couple of different ways you can do it.

1169
00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:06.431
Uh,

1170
00:39:06.431 --> 00:39:07.264
one is,

1171
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.630
uh,

1172
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:08.980
basically just masking.

1173
00:39:08.981 --> 00:39:13.981
You just put a big opaque thing somewhere in the optical path of the telescope

1174
00:39:14.770 --> 00:39:16.900
and it just blocks out the light of the star,

1175
00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:22.050
but it's carefully sized so that the light of stuff around it can still get in.

1176
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.160
There are also more sophisticated,

1177
00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:24.900
uh,

1178
00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:25.520
uh,

1179
00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.590
optical methods,

1180
00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.240
something called interferometry,

1181
00:39:28.241 --> 00:39:29.680
which I won't explain right now.

1182
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.990
Uh,

1183
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:33.220
which can have the same effect of knowing out the light from the star.

1184
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.490
And so you then observed the planetary light directly.

1185
00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:36.941
Uh,

1186
00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:39.280
the best way to do this is not an optical light,

1187
00:39:39.281 --> 00:39:41.350
but an infrared optical light.

1188
00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:42.263
Uh,

1189
00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:44.980
optical light is where stars give out most of their life.

1190
00:39:44.981 --> 00:39:48.010
Planet give out most of their light in the infrared.

1191
00:39:48.011 --> 00:39:48.700
You know,

1192
00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:49.421
you may be aware,

1193
00:39:49.421 --> 00:39:51.100
we all glow in the dark,

1194
00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:51.461
uh,

1195
00:39:51.461 --> 00:39:53.170
but we glow in the dark and the infrared,

1196
00:39:53.171 --> 00:39:56.530
that's why the military uses those interesting infrared goggles,

1197
00:39:56.531 --> 00:39:57.850
which turn everything green.

1198
00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:58.480
Uh,

1199
00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:01.990
what those do is they take infrared photons and,

1200
00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:03.250
uh,

1201
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:08.050
they ingest infrared photons and they emit green light so that you can see

1202
00:40:08.051 --> 00:40:08.681
infrared.

1203
00:40:08.681 --> 00:40:09.101
And that's,

1204
00:40:09.101 --> 00:40:09.510
uh,

1205
00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:09.820
uh,

1206
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:11.800
how they do these night vision goggles.

1207
00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:12.260
Uh,

1208
00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.320
and that's because at the temperatures on,

1209
00:40:14.321 --> 00:40:15.700
on ordinary planets,

1210
00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:17.320
we glow in the infrared,

1211
00:40:17.321 --> 00:40:19.990
which is why you don't see each other glowing in the dark,

1212
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.561
uh,

1213
00:40:20.561 --> 00:40:23.290
because your eyes don't detect infrared.

1214
00:40:23.291 --> 00:40:25.210
But if you're going to be looking for planet,

1215
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:28.240
you're much better off looking in the infrared than an ordinary life.

1216
00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:31.330
And then once you can see the light from a planet,

1217
00:40:31.331 --> 00:40:32.830
you get to do a really cool thing,

1218
00:40:32.831 --> 00:40:37.180
which is you get to examine the spectrum of that planet to find out what the

1219
00:40:37.181 --> 00:40:38.440
atmosphere is made of.

1220
00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.460
Uh,

1221
00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:40.390
and uh,

1222
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:41.110
uh,

1223
00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:44.980
we talked a little bit about spectral features which come from different atoms

1224
00:40:44.981 --> 00:40:45.910
or molecules.

1225
00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:46.660
Uh,

1226
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:47.200
and,

1227
00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:47.650
uh,

1228
00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:51.100
once you actually see the light from the planet as opposed to the light from the

1229
00:40:51.101 --> 00:40:51.730
star,

1230
00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:54.160
you can actually study in detail what that stars,

1231
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:56.350
what that planet's atmosphere is made of.

1232
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.730
This by the way,

1233
00:40:57.731 --> 00:41:01.660
is how one goes about detecting low life on planet earth.

1234
00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:04.030
There was a very cute experiment a little while ago.

1235
00:41:04.031 --> 00:41:06.250
They were sending a mission to Jupiter,

1236
00:41:06.251 --> 00:41:07.390
the Galileo mission,

1237
00:41:07.391 --> 00:41:09.400
which is now at Jupiter doing science.

1238
00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:09.941
Uh,

1239
00:41:09.941 --> 00:41:11.410
but the way they did it was funny.

1240
00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:12.281
They sent it,

1241
00:41:12.281 --> 00:41:13.660
not outward toward Jupiter,

1242
00:41:13.661 --> 00:41:15.280
but inward toward Venus.

1243
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:16.930
It took a swing around Venus.

1244
00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:20.020
It turns out if you do it right and you swing around a planet,

1245
00:41:20.021 --> 00:41:21.550
you can pick up extra speed.

1246
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.770
And so to get this thing out to Jupiter,

1247
00:41:23.771 --> 00:41:27.880
they had it swing around Venus then come back to earth and swing around earth.

1248
00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:29.800
And each time it did one of these swings,

1249
00:41:29.801 --> 00:41:30.551
it picked up speed.

1250
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:32.890
So it got to Jupiter actually faster that way.

1251
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.000
A very clever bit of orbital dynamics.

1252
00:41:35.001 --> 00:41:37.520
But the consequence of it was that uh,

1253
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:38.870
this mission,

1254
00:41:38.871 --> 00:41:43.130
one of our prime missions to look at other planets with all the various

1255
00:41:43.131 --> 00:41:47.690
instruments that we like to look at other planets with swung by near to Earth.

1256
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:50.000
And so somebody had the very clever idea,

1257
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:55.150
let's use our standard suite of exploration instruments and see if we can detect

1258
00:41:55.251 --> 00:41:59.840
the existence of life on earth using one of the satellites that we use to

1259
00:41:59.841 --> 00:42:01.370
explore the rest of the solar system.

1260
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:04.010
And people had all kinds of thoughts about what would be detectable,

1261
00:42:04.011 --> 00:42:04.400
you know,

1262
00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.570
cities at night,

1263
00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:06.201
you know,

1264
00:42:06.201 --> 00:42:08.300
you would be able to see lights on the dark side,

1265
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:09.950
the Great Wall of China,

1266
00:42:09.951 --> 00:42:10.281
you know,

1267
00:42:10.281 --> 00:42:11.420
you would be able to detect,

1268
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:12.230
no,

1269
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:13.750
turns out that the group,

1270
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:18.530
that the strongest sign of life on earth is the fact that the atmosphere

1271
00:42:18.531 --> 00:42:19.550
contains methane.

1272
00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:20.480
Uh,

1273
00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:23.120
now the atmosphere of course is it has a lot of oxygen.

1274
00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:23.931
Methane,

1275
00:42:23.931 --> 00:42:28.250
you may recall is c h four a and if you put a little bit of methane into an

1276
00:42:28.251 --> 00:42:29.250
oxygen atmosphere,

1277
00:42:29.251 --> 00:42:30.570
it immediately dissociating.

1278
00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.860
You get water and carbon dioxide because of all the free oxygen.

1279
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:36.500
So there shouldn't be any methane in the atmosphere,

1280
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.431
but there is,

1281
00:42:37.431 --> 00:42:41.720
and you can detect it by looking at the infrared spectrum of the atmosphere.

1282
00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.490
Now what does it mean that there's methane in our atmosphere?

1283
00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:49.310
It means there's a continuous source of methane pumping into the atmosphere all

1284
00:42:49.311 --> 00:42:50.144
the time.

1285
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:52.040
What is the source of that methane?

1286
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:52.521
Uh,

1287
00:42:52.521 --> 00:42:55.160
it is as Carl Sagan delicately put it,

1288
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:57.080
bovine flatulence,

1289
00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:57.940
uh,

1290
00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:58.773
cow farts.

1291
00:42:58.940 --> 00:42:59.361
Uh,

1292
00:42:59.361 --> 00:42:59.621
and,

1293
00:42:59.621 --> 00:42:59.800
and,

1294
00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.870
and just digestion in general has a,

1295
00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:04.370
an output of methane,

1296
00:43:04.371 --> 00:43:06.500
which is continually piping into the atmosphere.

1297
00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:07.820
And if that weren't happening,

1298
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.280
that happens from biological activity.

1299
00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.540
And if that weren't happening,

1300
00:43:11.541 --> 00:43:14.210
there wouldn't be any methane observable in the atmosphere.

1301
00:43:14.211 --> 00:43:18.710
So what you do is if you find some other planet is look at the atmospheric

1302
00:43:18.711 --> 00:43:22.940
chemistry and you see if there's something in there that's out of equilibrium

1303
00:43:22.941 --> 00:43:27.941
that could only be a continually replenished by biological activity and having

1304
00:43:28.341 --> 00:43:32.600
both oxygen and methane at the same time is one such one,

1305
00:43:32.601 --> 00:43:33.411
such indicators.

1306
00:43:33.411 --> 00:43:36.830
So the hope would be that we could not only see the light from the planet,

1307
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.310
but we'd be able to detect the presence of biological activity as well.

1308
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:42.290
So how do you go about doing this?

1309
00:43:42.291 --> 00:43:44.360
Bovine flatulence equals life,

1310
00:43:44.410 --> 00:43:44.930
uh,

1311
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:45.950
words to live by.

1312
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:47.263
Um,

1313
00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:48.643
let's see.

1314
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:49.041
Uh,

1315
00:43:49.041 --> 00:43:49.790
so here's,

1316
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:50.660
here's how you do it.

1317
00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.060
You need to have very high resolution.

1318
00:43:53.061 --> 00:43:55.640
You need to be able to separate the light from the star,

1319
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:56.421
from the light,

1320
00:43:56.421 --> 00:43:58.640
from the planet to the greatest extent possible.

1321
00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:03.850
Turns out the way you do this is you have space telescopes spaced pretty widely

1322
00:44:03.921 --> 00:44:04.630
apart.

1323
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.950
Uh,

1324
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.520
that gives you the best handle on the resolution.

1325
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:12.620
But they have to know where each other is to a precision very substantially

1326
00:44:12.621 --> 00:44:15.380
greater than the wavelength of the light that they're observing.

1327
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:16.160
Uh,

1328
00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:16.820
and uh,

1329
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:17.001
uh,

1330
00:44:17.001 --> 00:44:20.000
so they need to be able to tell the distance apart of these things.

1331
00:44:20.001 --> 00:44:24.830
Too tiny fractions of a meter at pico meter metrology is the technical word.

1332
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:27.830
Pico meter is 10 to the minus 12 meters.

1333
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.360
Uh,

1334
00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.950
and metrology is just measuring how far apart you are.

1335
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.070
So they need to be able to figure out to formation fly and know how far apart

1336
00:44:35.071 --> 00:44:36.280
they are too about uh,

1337
00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.980
the width of an atom or psalm.

1338
00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:38.720
Uh,

1339
00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:43.720
you want to image and the infrared mid infrared imaging wants you to pushes you

1340
00:44:44.071 --> 00:44:45.210
beyond Jupiter.

1341
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:47.880
The problem is that inside the orbit of Jupiter,

1342
00:44:47.881 --> 00:44:50.700
there's all this warm dust in our own solar system and it's so,

1343
00:44:50.701 --> 00:44:54.720
it's like the sky is bright all the time from all the infrared emission from the

1344
00:44:54.721 --> 00:44:54.991
dust.

1345
00:44:54.991 --> 00:44:58.470
So you've got to go out into the colder parts of the solar system to do this.

1346
00:44:58.880 --> 00:44:59.713
Uh,

1347
00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:00.660
so we're,

1348
00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.620
what we're going to do,

1349
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:05.190
the plan is you're going to build a half dozen or so things,

1350
00:45:05.220 --> 00:45:08.520
each of which is about 10 times the size of the space telescope.

1351
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:11.730
We're going to move them out beyond Jupiter and formation,

1352
00:45:11.731 --> 00:45:13.320
fly them in this,

1353
00:45:13.321 --> 00:45:13.590
uh,

1354
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.630
to this extremely high precision.

1355
00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.690
This is not something we're capable of doing right now.

1356
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:19.291
Uh,

1357
00:45:19.291 --> 00:45:20.970
but there is a 25 year old,

1358
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:22.200
25 years,

1359
00:45:22.201 --> 00:45:25.230
so-called roadmap of series of missions,

1360
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:25.741
uh,

1361
00:45:25.741 --> 00:45:26.700
along the way,

1362
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:30.810
which is going to simultaneously be good missions in their own right and develop

1363
00:45:30.811 --> 00:45:31.644
the technology.

1364
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:33.850
Sam is one of these missions.

1365
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:36.300
It's going to develop the high precision,

1366
00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:36.780
uh,

1367
00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.820
spatial imaging that you need for this.

1368
00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:39.210
Uh,

1369
00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:44.100
Jwst is the acronym for the next generation space telescope,

1370
00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:46.500
which is due to be launched in 2012.

1371
00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:46.840
Uh,

1372
00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.710
that's basically one such telescope,

1373
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.030
but orbiting the earth.

1374
00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:52.170
That's a milestone.

1375
00:45:52.171 --> 00:45:54.740
And their various other milestones along this roadmap.

1376
00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.140
Uh,

1377
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:57.510
and the hope is that in 25 years,

1378
00:45:57.720 --> 00:45:57.990
uh,

1379
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.470
with,

1380
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.771
you know,

1381
00:45:58.771 --> 00:46:00.600
25 to $50 billion,

1382
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:02.730
we could actually do this thing.

1383
00:46:02.731 --> 00:46:07.620
And so here's the little artist's conception of these guys flying in formation

1384
00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:10.530
outside of the orbit of Jupiter.

1385
00:46:10.531 --> 00:46:13.770
That I guess this represents the sun down in the middle of the solar system.

1386
00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.000
They're looking out this way,

1387
00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:17.010
finding life on other planets.

1388
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:21.360
And the big problem with this whole mission is that it's been canceled,

1389
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:22.623
uh,

1390
00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:23.280
uh,

1391
00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.570
because a decision has been made that it's me.

1392
00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:25.831
You know,

1393
00:46:25.831 --> 00:46:29.610
this is very big expensive mission and the decision has been made that if you're

1394
00:46:29.611 --> 00:46:31.110
going to do something big and expensive,

1395
00:46:31.111 --> 00:46:32.430
you'll have to go to Mars instead,

1396
00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:33.900
put people on Mars instead.

1397
00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:34.830
However,

1398
00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:36.900
this is a 25 year timescale.

1399
00:46:36.901 --> 00:46:40.200
Things get canceled and canceled every three or four years.

1400
00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:40.741
Uh,

1401
00:46:40.741 --> 00:46:41.221
so,

1402
00:46:41.221 --> 00:46:41.520
uh,

1403
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:43.830
who knows exactly what's going to happen.

1404
00:46:43.831 --> 00:46:44.640
And I think a,

1405
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:49.620
this may reappear in the NASA plan at some point in the future.

1406
00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:50.311
And,

1407
00:46:50.311 --> 00:46:50.550
uh,

1408
00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:52.410
that's sort of the ultimate,

1409
00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:52.740
uh,

1410
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:57.570
that people can think of now in terms of fine studying planets around other

1411
00:46:57.571 --> 00:46:58.404
stars.

1412
00:46:58.590 --> 00:46:59.280
Okay.

1413
00:46:59.280 --> 00:46:59.551
Uh,

1414
00:46:59.551 --> 00:47:04.170
that's when I got to say about this and a test on Thursday.
