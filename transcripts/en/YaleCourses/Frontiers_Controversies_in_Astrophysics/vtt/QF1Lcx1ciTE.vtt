1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.580
Welcome back for more cosmology on a rainy day.
Uh,
you'll recall,

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.120
uh,
maybe what we were trying to do.
Uh,

3
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.240
we're trying to determine the past and future of the universe,

4
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.460
which it turns out can be summarized by a single number,

5
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.060
namely the scale factor of the universe.
Um,

6
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.440
it's actually not a,
it's not a single number.

7
00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:36.110
It's actually a function,
right?
It's a function of time.

8
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.060
The scale factor changes with time.

9
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.440
And so when I make this grandiose statement that I'm going to talk about the

10
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:44.000
past and future of the universe,

11
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.210
what I really mean is I want to determine what the scale factor is as a function

12
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:53.420
of time.
And so that's just a,
a standard kind of a graph.

13
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.400
Here's the scale factor.
Usually give them the letter,
a function of t,

14
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.110
here's time.
Uh,
the present is somewhere,

15
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.680
uh,
along this graph.
Call that now,
uh,

16
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:08.840
and so here's,

17
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.260
and the universe has some scale factor at the present time.

18
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.320
And what we're going to do is we're going to call that,

19
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.250
define the scale factor at the present time to be one.
There's,

20
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:22.570
we're just gonna that's called normalizing when you set a,

21
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.840
when you multiply something by some convenient number so that it comes out to be

22
00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:30.230
one at a convenient moment.
So that's just the definition.

23
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.800
We define the current scale factor to be one,

24
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.730
it'd be unity.
And so there's a point here,
uh,

25
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.350
right now,
uh,

26
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.360
the scale factor is what we also know what the slope of the scale factor is

27
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:55.470
because we measure that from the Hubble constant.
Uh,

28
00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:58.590
and so in an appropriate set of units,

29
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.590
the scale factor is increasing at a rate of,
uh,
the Hubble constant,

30
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:09.090
which is I think two times 10 to the minus 18,
uh,

31
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.470
per second.
So if the scale factor is one right now,

32
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:14.970
then one second from now,

33
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:19.800
the scale factor is going to be one plus two times 10 to the minus 18.

34
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.820
So every second it gets two times 10 to the minus 18 bigger.
Uh,

35
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.720
that's not a real large increase.
And in fact,
over,
uh,

36
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.750
uh,
over the entire history of humanity,
uh,
it won't,

37
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.210
it won't increase by that much.
Let's see,
in a,
in a million years,
uh,

38
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.080
there are something like,
okay,
Ian,
a 10 to this six years,

39
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.710
there are three times 10 to the seven times 10 to the six seconds.

40
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.780
That's three times 10 to the 13 seconds.

41
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:58.150
Multiply that by two times 10 to the minus 18.
Uh,

42
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.140
and the scale factor,
uh,

43
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.140
increases,
uh,

44
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.170
by three times 10 to the 13 times two times 10 to the minus 18.

45
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.230
Uh,
that's six times 10 to the minus five.

46
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:17.620
So it still hasn't made a whole lot of difference even in a million years from

47
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:20.890
now.
Uh,
but uh,

48
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.780
keep at it for awhile and the scale factor is going to pile up,
uh,

49
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.310
and will increase.
So we know that it's increasing.
Uh,
and then,
uh,

50
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:34.340
the question is,
is this increased changing with time?
So let's see.

51
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.050
This is,
if it doesn't change,

52
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.570
if it's just a straight linear increase,

53
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.200
this is the situation in which there's no matter in the universe.

54
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:47.590
So the universe is not slowing down because of gravity because there's no matter

55
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:51.670
in it.
And that gets labeled with this factor.

56
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.470
All Mugu being equal to zero.
Let me remind you.
Uh,

57
00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.530
Omega is defined as the density of the universe divided by the critical density.

58
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.670
The critical density is how dented has to be to turn around.
So,
uh,

59
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.430
another possible track for the universe.

60
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.460
We know it's expanding at a particular rate now,

61
00:04:12.461 --> 00:04:13.960
but it could slow down in the future.

62
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:17.380
Turner out of fallback could look something like this.

63
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.430
This is the case where Omega is greater than one.

64
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:23.200
<v 1>Okay.</v>

65
00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.790
<v 0>And then the intermediate case where Omega is less than one but not equal to</v>

66
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:31.630
zero,
it sort of does this,
it falls off a little bit,

67
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:33.580
continues to expand something like that.

68
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.770
And this is Omega less than one,
but still greater than zero.

69
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.283
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

70
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.260
<v 0>Okay.
So here's the goal.
We got to figure out which track we're on at the moment.</v>

71
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.320
We sit here,
uh,
and we measured the Hubble constant.

72
00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:52.510
So all we know is where we are and where we're going in the short run.

73
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:56.760
And what we want to do is to figure out which of these possibilities the

74
00:04:56.761 --> 00:04:59.490
universe is actually following.
And in so doing,

75
00:04:59.491 --> 00:05:02.100
decide whether we're going to end up falling back together.

76
00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:04.620
In this big crunch or expanding forever.

77
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.930
And we talked a little bit last time about a kind of direct way of determining

78
00:05:09.931 --> 00:05:13.140
this,
namely,
uh,
measuring all MCHA.

79
00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.760
This omika factor is the density of the universe divided by the critical
density.

80
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.210
You could in principle,
go out and measure the density of the universe.
Uh,

81
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.780
you could,
you can compute the critical density.

82
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:26.920
You divide one by another and you know,
uh,

83
00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.230
which of these possibilities turns out to be true and that ran into trouble,

84
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:32.064
as you'll recall.

85
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.060
So a direct measurement

86
00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:41.370
of all Monica,

87
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.720
this leads to trouble in the form of dark matter.

88
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.920
So the universe turns out to be full of this dark matter.
Uh,

89
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.090
if you add up all the galaxies,
the mass of all the galaxies,

90
00:05:54.091 --> 00:05:58.790
including dark matter.
So Mass Yen,
galaxies,

91
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.800
uh,

92
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.800
gives you an Omega that's less than one that's around a third or a quarter.

93
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.670
Uh,
but there might be,
you know,

94
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:13.400
now that we've already discovered that the vast majority of matter is something

95
00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:16.400
we know nothing about,
there might be more of it,
uh,

96
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:20.720
between galaxies that we don't know about.
So,
uh,
we want a different approach.

97
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.650
So here's something you can do
that,

98
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.350
that's really quite,
quite a different approach to this problem.
Let's,

99
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.010
let's draw that plot up again.
Uh,

100
00:06:41.011 --> 00:06:44.730
and so here's now and then there are these various possibilities,

101
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.573
<v 2>uh,</v>

102
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.420
<v 0>and it might go like this
or it might</v>

103
00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.120
fall all the way back down like that.
Uh,
so,
uh,

104
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.030
here's something you can do.
Remember that you can look back into the past.

105
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.290
You can look into the past by looking at very distant things and you see the

106
00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:12.300
light coming to you from the time in the past.
So you look,
uh,

107
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.290
into the past because of the light travel time.

108
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.880
And so if,
if now is here,
uh,

109
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.290
we can actually look at objects,
uh,
which,
uh,

110
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.030
were existing at some time in the past back say here,
I don't know,
uh,

111
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.350
by looking at things that are 3 billion light years away or something like that.

112
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.860
And the question is,
if you can do that,
uh,

113
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.100
you can figure out how far in the past it is.
By the way,
that's easy.

114
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.160
Measure a distance,

115
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:53.540
uh,
and time in the past is just distance,

116
00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.150
<v 2>uh,
uh,</v>

117
00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:56.880
<v 0>miles per hour,</v>

118
00:07:56.881 --> 00:08:00.780
which way up is it going to be a divided by the speed of light.

119
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:05.700
So if you can measure the distance to something,
you know,
how long ago,
how far,

120
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.140
how far in the past it was.
So that tells you where it is on this axis.

121
00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:13.480
So then all you need to do is measure the scale factor right

122
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.320
factor at that time.

123
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.100
Then you could see that if you could do this,

124
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:30.200
you would be able to determine whether at some point in the past you are here,

125
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.970
uh,
if the scale factor was low or here or here.

126
00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:36.540
And therefore,
uh,

127
00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:39.800
if you made accurate measurements of the scale factor in the past,

128
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.820
you could figure out which one of these tracks you're on.

129
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:47.600
And if you could figure that out,
then you can infer,
uh,

130
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.640
if that track continues,
uh,
without,
uh,
some other form of physics kicking in,

131
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.980
you could figure out that it will,
where it will go in the,

132
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.590
so you've got to be able to determine what the scale factor was,

133
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.420
which doesn't seem like,
uh,
it's actually all that easy.
Uh,

134
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.400
but it turns out that this can be done.

135
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.990
And a way to think about this is you have to think about the red shift,

136
00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.890
the cosmological red shift in different terms from what we've been thinking

137
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:16.560
about it so far.
So a different

138
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:23.130
view of red shift.
You remember,

139
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:25.590
this is where we started,
right?
We measured the distance to things.

140
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:27.810
We measure their velocity,
we got Hubble's law,

141
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:31.770
therefore the universe is expanding.
And the W as we were doing that,

142
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.810
we had the idea that the red shift is telling you something about velocity.

143
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.030
So a red shift.
So,
so one view

144
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.850
is that the red shift

145
00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.650
<v 1>okay.</v>

146
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.920
<v 0>Tells you something about velocity,
uh,</v>

147
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:53.790
and the velocities are all moving away from us and therefore the universe is

148
00:09:53.791 --> 00:09:56.790
expanding.
But you'll remember that,
um,

149
00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:03.470
that the cosmological red shift caused by the expansion of the universe,

150
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:04.890
uh,

151
00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:09.420
that velocity is a little different in kind from the way we ordinary think of

152
00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.000
velocity.
It's not,
objects are not moving through space.
Uh,

153
00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.790
it's just the space itself is expanding and that leads to some differences.

154
00:10:17.791 --> 00:10:20.430
For example,
in principle,
uh,

155
00:10:20.431 --> 00:10:24.990
the cosmological red shift can cause things that look like the velocity is

156
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:28.050
potentially greater than the speed of light and things like that.
Uh,

157
00:10:28.051 --> 00:10:30.350
so the cosmological redshift is,
uh,

158
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.670
not the same as an ordinary velocity.

159
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:36.843
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

160
00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.990
<v 0>And one way to think about,
uh,
what the red shift is,</v>

161
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.390
is the fall.
So another view,

162
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.990
the universe is expanding.
Uh,

163
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.260
but a lot of the things in the universe are not expanding.

164
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:02.250
Your not expanding the galaxies not expanding.
And we talked about this a little.

165
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.920
That's because there are forces holding it together.

166
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:09.160
The earth isn't expanding cause its gravitational force holds it together.
Uh,

167
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.320
I'm not expanding because the chemical bonds between the atoms in my body hold

168
00:11:13.321 --> 00:11:17.970
it together.
The galaxy is not expanding because gravity holds it together.
Um,

169
00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:23.300
but a wavelength of light doesn't have such a force to hold it together.

170
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.410
So as the universe expands,
wavelengths of light,

171
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.650
expand along with it.
Uh,

172
00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:35.400
so this is another view of where the red shift comes from.
Uh,
that wavelength

173
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.513
of light

174
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:45.110
expand along with the universe.

175
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.750
That's an interesting thought.
Uh,

176
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.570
so rather than fit.

177
00:11:55.571 --> 00:11:59.380
So the question is why do we observe light from distant galaxies to be red

178
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:02.170
shifted?
Uh,
in this interpretation?

179
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.840
It's not because these things are moving away from us.

180
00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:10.080
It's because during the time between when that wavelength was emitted and when

181
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:11.224
we see it,

182
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:15.460
the universe has expanded and the wavelength has expanded along with it,

183
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:20.560
and therefore we see a longer wavelength than we would have,
uh,
from,
from,
uh,

184
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:24.130
a photon that hadn't been traveling as long because the universe in that case

185
00:12:24.131 --> 00:12:27.180
wouldn't have traveled,
wouldn't have expanded as much,
uh,

186
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:32.320
wavelengths of light expand along with the universe.
Uh,
and so,

187
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.110
uh,
when we observe,

188
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:37.923
<v 1>uh,</v>

189
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.430
<v 0>distant objects,</v>

190
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.460
<v 1>okay,</v>

191
00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.820
<v 0>the wavelength we observe is longer</v>

192
00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:47.950
then when it was emitted

193
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.420
because the universe has been expanding during that time.

194
00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.300
This is,
yes,
go ahead.

195
00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:05.610
<v 3>So if the universe is expanding as wide as troubling to us,
it reaches us.</v>

196
00:13:05.611 --> 00:13:10.030
Universe will be somewhat larger than when then when the light was admitted.

197
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.910
So is the time,

198
00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:16.650
is the time that we calculate shipping in the past?

199
00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:19.950
Is that the distance divided by,

200
00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.580
is that the original distance divided by two light or,

201
00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.840
<v 0>okay,
so there's the really,</v>

202
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:31.400
this is this complicated thing about what do we mean by distance in an expanding

203
00:13:31.401 --> 00:13:35.960
universe.
Uh,
and what you mean?
This is a good question.

204
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:40.640
What you mean by distance is how much it,
okay.

205
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:45.200
So the first thing to say is that cosmologists worry about this a lot and there

206
00:13:45.201 --> 00:13:48.380
are different kinds of distances that can be defined.

207
00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.300
There's the coordinate distance,

208
00:13:50.301 --> 00:13:54.140
which doesn't change as the universe expands or other kinds of distances in the

209
00:13:54.141 --> 00:13:57.470
particular case of what we're doing right now.
Uh,

210
00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:01.940
the key way you measure distance remembers the standard candle.

211
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.880
So you'd define what's called the luminosity distance,

212
00:14:04.881 --> 00:14:07.220
which is how much fainter something looks.

213
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:11.450
And so basically distances defined.
Uh,
so let me,

214
00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.870
this is kind of a parentheses.
What do I mean by distance?

215
00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.690
Distance is defined by this equation.

216
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:26.640
So what do you mean by distance in this case is how much fainter or the object

217
00:14:26.641 --> 00:14:30.450
you're looking at,
uh,
then,
uh,

218
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.410
then otherwise,
uh,
and so something that's twice as far away,

219
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.870
what does that mean for something to be twice as far away?

220
00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.410
It means the light from a standard candle is four times fainter.

221
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:44.080
And so you'd define distance as,
uh,

222
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.860
the dimming of light because that's the way you measured the thing.

223
00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.160
And then you have to be careful when you're doing this out in,
in,

224
00:14:50.161 --> 00:14:54.050
in strict terms,
you have to be careful that,
that,
that kind,

225
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:55.910
that the way you've defined,

226
00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:59.750
you don't get confused about which kind of distance you're you're working on.
Uh,

227
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:04.430
so that defines distance.
Then time,
the look back time,

228
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:09.470
it turns out to be a more or less,
uh,
certainly for short distances,

229
00:15:09.471 --> 00:15:13.700
correctly defined as distance oversee.
Uh,

230
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.680
but you do have to worry about this when you get into large cosmological

231
00:15:18.681 --> 00:15:21.710
distances and a,
I don't want to go into that,

232
00:15:21.711 --> 00:15:25.190
but the different kinds of distances are related to each other in complicated

233
00:15:25.191 --> 00:15:28.920
ways.
Uh,
okay.
So this is how you,
this is,
uh,

234
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.170
basically back to the question of how you get the x axis on that graph.
Uh,

235
00:15:33.171 --> 00:15:37.870
I'm now talking about the y axis,
the scale factor.
So then you want to,

236
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:41.420
how do you measure the scale factor,
the scale factor.

237
00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:47.140
So the scale factor now of the universe now divided by the scale factor,

238
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:53.770
then when you emitted that wavelength is going to be equal to the observed

239
00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.640
wavelength divided by the wavelength of the light when it was emitted,

240
00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.510
because that's how much larger the universe has gotten and the wavelengths have

241
00:16:02.511 --> 00:16:07.370
gotten big along with it.
So that's equal to,
uh,

242
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:13.730
met Plus Delta Lambda as we've defined it before,
over lamb to emit it,

243
00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:18.050
which is equal to one plus xe is the red shift.

244
00:16:18.051 --> 00:16:19.220
Z remember,

245
00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:23.330
is the change in the wavelength divided by the wavelength and when it was

246
00:16:23.331 --> 00:16:24.164
emitted?

247
00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.310
So by measuring red shift,

248
00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.450
you can tell what the scale of the universe was relative to the scale of the

249
00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:40.340
universe.
Now,
uh,
when that light was emitted,
now remember,

250
00:16:40.341 --> 00:16:44.540
I defined the scale factor now to be one.

251
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:50.110
So that means one over a is equal to one plus the Z or the scale factor of the

252
00:16:52.041 --> 00:16:57.041
universe in units where it's currently equal to one is equal to one over one

253
00:16:57.231 --> 00:16:58.064
plus xe.

254
00:16:58.190 --> 00:16:59.023
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

255
00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.840
<v 0>And Z.
You measure.</v>

256
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:06.183
<v 1>Okay.</v>

257
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:11.460
<v 0>And so,
uh,
in principle you can measure both,</v>

258
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:17.070
both axes of that graph.
And so if I now go back to that,

259
00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.390
to my plot,

260
00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.800
you could measure some points on this plot.
Now all of them are in the past,

261
00:17:26.801 --> 00:17:28.820
not the future because you can't,
uh,

262
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.840
you can't look into the future by this light travel time trick.

263
00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.500
But you could go out there and you could discover a,

264
00:17:35.501 --> 00:17:38.320
if you made really excellent measurements,

265
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:43.530
you could discover that there's a point right here that have particular a galaxy

266
00:17:43.691 --> 00:17:45.740
or whatever it is you're looking at is,

267
00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.060
is far away such that the time back is this.

268
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.400
And then you measure the red shift,
you get a scale factor.
Uh,

269
00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.330
and you could measure,
uh,
that,
uh,

270
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:59.250
at that time the universe had such and such a scale factor.

271
00:17:59.251 --> 00:18:03.270
And if you measured a whole bunch of these things and they sort of wind up in

272
00:18:03.271 --> 00:18:07.400
this nice way,
uh,
then you might conclude,
well,
uh,

273
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:13.190
the universe is doing this and you might then extrapolate to determine what the

274
00:18:14.041 --> 00:18:15.750
universe is going to do in the future.

275
00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:17.953
<v 2>Uh,</v>

276
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.520
<v 0>and so this is just the huddle diagram interpreted in a slightly different way,</v>

277
00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:26.590
uh,
and uh,

278
00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:31.620
being looked at at a distance sufficiently far away that the rate of expansion,

279
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:36.400
uh,
would have been different back then than it is now.

280
00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:40.900
So,
uh,
I'm going to draw it all again.
Here's a,
here's t,

281
00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.210
there's this,
uh,
here's one of these.

282
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:48.103
<v 2>Uh,</v>

283
00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:50.670
<v 0>and here's this.</v>

284
00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.860
But you know,
that's not usually how we plot the huddle diagram.

285
00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:02.000
What we're usually plotting,
as you'll recall,

286
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.520
is distance versus philosophy,
because those are the things we actually measure.

287
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:11.030
Velocity is red shift Z.

288
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:13.580
And remember that,
uh,

289
00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:18.290
one over one plus z equals a,
um,

290
00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:23.270
or let's see,
one over a,
a one plus Xe,

291
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:24.873
<v 2>uh,</v>

292
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:31.540
<v 0>a overlay,
one over one minus a over a,
yeah,</v>

293
00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.170
one minus a over a equals z.

294
00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:40.240
So this represents the scale factor.
This access,

295
00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:42.090
whereas this,
uh,

296
00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:46.090
what we actually usually plot is m minus M,

297
00:19:46.091 --> 00:19:50.620
which you'll recall is equal to five log d over 10 parsecs.

298
00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:51.880
Uh,

299
00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:56.880
and so this scale represent time because distance can be converted to time

300
00:19:57.971 --> 00:19:59.200
because we know the speed of light.

301
00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.680
So this is a time axis in really weird unit and this is a scale factor access in

302
00:20:08.081 --> 00:20:09.340
really weird unit.

303
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:11.400
<v 2>Okay.</v>

304
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:15.390
<v 0>But you can therefore transform each of these lines,</v>

305
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.980
which is scale factor versus time into an equivalent line on this plot.

306
00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:26.040
Uh,
so the Green Line is the plot where where the universe just expand,

307
00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:29.910
uh,
and there's no mass,
nothing slows down.
So it kind of looks like this.

308
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.770
<v 2>All right.
Now</v>

309
00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.050
<v 0>what are the points?</v>

310
00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:39.910
This is now and uh,
in,

311
00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:43.990
in,
uh,
in the time factor.
And then up here is then,

312
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:48.490
okay,
so you're going from now to then,
so you're of sitting on this point,

313
00:20:48.491 --> 00:20:51.910
looking back this way.
Uh,

314
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:57.370
and here is scale factor eight equals one.
And here's scale factor.

315
00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:01.430
A equal small.
Okay.

316
00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:04.250
Cause the Z is getting bigger,
therefore is getting smaller.

317
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:10.270
So what would the red curve look like on this plot of the things we actually

318
00:21:11.061 --> 00:21:15.410
measure?
Well,
when it's close,

319
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.690
the red curve sits right on top of the green curve.

320
00:21:17.691 --> 00:21:21.440
So it kind of starts out like this.
No,
there's no distinction.

321
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:25.840
Then at a certain point in the past,
let's see.
Um,

322
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.220
what do I want?
How do I want to do this?
Uh,

323
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:35.000
let's pick a particular time.
So that's a particular distance.

324
00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.840
Uh,
at that time,

325
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:44.230
the scale factor is smaller on the red curve than it is on the green curve.

326
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.950
If the scale factor is smaller,
the red shift has to be bigger.

327
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:57.250
So what's gonna be happening here is that the red line is going to gradually

328
00:21:57.381 --> 00:22:02.360
diverged from the Green Line and just the same way it does here in such a way

329
00:22:02.361 --> 00:22:05.810
that attic given distance,
that is to say,
given time in the past,

330
00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:09.290
the red shift is bigger,
which means the scale factor is small.

331
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.480
And then the brown curve,
what kind of do the same thing?
Only more.
So

332
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.820
though,
this is what we expect to see.
This is Omega Greater Than One,
uh,

333
00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:24.840
Omega less than one,
but still greater than zero.

334
00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.110
Omega equal to zero,

335
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:34.040
so all the Hubble dot grants we've looked at so far have been down at this end

336
00:22:34.531 --> 00:22:36.570
here where they're all lying on top of each other.

337
00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:41.040
But you can imagine that if you get out to big redshifts redshift of one at a

338
00:22:41.041 --> 00:22:44.550
retrofit of one,
the scale factor is half of what it is today.

339
00:22:44.551 --> 00:22:48.300
You're halfway back to the big,
to the big bang.
In terms of scale factor,

340
00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:51.540
you could imagine that these things would really look quite different as indeed

341
00:22:51.541 --> 00:22:51.871
they do.

342
00:22:51.871 --> 00:22:56.460
In this little plot I've drawn when the scale factor is half of what it is
today,

343
00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.820
if the scale factors 1% less than it is today,

344
00:22:59.821 --> 00:23:04.320
you'll have a tough time telling these things apart.
So what do you need to do?

345
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.500
What you want to do is measure redshifts in distances,

346
00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:11.520
plop them on this plot and see which of these lines turns out to be true.

347
00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:16.140
What do you need to do that what you need is a really bright standard candle.

348
00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:24.970
Why does it need to be bright?

349
00:23:24.971 --> 00:23:28.870
Because you need to be able to see it at large

350
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:30.700
<v 1>distances.</v>

351
00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:34.701
<v 0>Uh,</v>

352
00:23:34.701 --> 00:23:39.701
and the thing that happened in the 1990s and that has transformed cosmology is

353
00:23:39.891 --> 00:23:43.610
that we are now able to make these kinds of measurements all the way out to a

354
00:23:43.611 --> 00:23:46.250
red shift of one and some cases further.

355
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:51.370
And the particular standard candle we're looking at are you so called type one a

356
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:57.170
supernovae.
Uh,
I'll discuss what these are later on,

357
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:59.270
but for the moment,
let's just,
uh,

358
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.580
let's just take the point that their standard candles,

359
00:24:01.581 --> 00:24:05.240
therefore we know how bright they are and they're really,
really bright,
uh,

360
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:08.870
absolute magnitude of something like minus 19.
Uh,

361
00:24:08.871 --> 00:24:12.290
so they're as bright as whole galaxies.
In fact,

362
00:24:12.291 --> 00:24:16.340
they often out shine the galaxy they're in.
These are exploding stars.

363
00:24:16.341 --> 00:24:16.881
And as I say,

364
00:24:16.881 --> 00:24:20.150
we'll talk about the details of exactly how these things work later on.

365
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.980
So type one a Supernova,

366
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.720
turn out to be these really bright standard candles and you can make this kind

367
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:31.700
of measurement on the,
uh,
I have the data here.
Uh,

368
00:24:31.701 --> 00:24:36.020
but,
uh,
I have to talk about one more technical thing about the way the data's

369
00:24:36.021 --> 00:24:39.920
presented.
Um,
let's see.

370
00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:46.160
Ordinarily the way you tend to plot these things,
as I said,

371
00:24:46.161 --> 00:24:51.161
as you plot red shift versus a apps parent minus absolute magnitude,

372
00:24:51.921 --> 00:24:56.921
this is a quantity known as the distance modulars and it's related to distance,

373
00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.090
uh,
by the equation we had before.
Uh,

374
00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:07.180
and so then what you get is you get this and you get this and you get this,

375
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.750
uh,
as,
uh,
as we've written it down before.
And the problem is,
uh,
that,

376
00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:19.640
uh,
it's hard to tell the differences between these lines because the,
uh,

377
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:24.080
this is now being measured in magnitude these separation out here to red shift

378
00:25:24.081 --> 00:25:28.130
of one.
Uh,
this is about,
uh,

379
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.990
this interval here in magnitude.
Let me write it that way,

380
00:25:32.991 --> 00:25:37.220
is about,
oh,
I don't know,
a third of a magnitude or something like that.

381
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:42.110
But this whole plot is,
you know,
if you go all the way back to time zero,

382
00:25:42.111 --> 00:25:46.940
this whole plot is,
I dunno,
uh,
can be 10 to 20 magnitudes.

383
00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:51.440
And so it's just kinda hard to see these little differences between the thing.

384
00:25:51.441 --> 00:25:53.890
So they plot it differently.
Uh,

385
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:57.260
so that you can bring out these slight differences.

386
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.000
And what they do is they do this,

387
00:25:59.001 --> 00:26:03.800
they plot a quantity called Delta m minus Sam.

388
00:26:03.801 --> 00:26:06.440
What's that?
That's the difference.

389
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:07.870
<v 2>Okay.</v>

390
00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:11.020
<v 0>Between the measured,</v>

391
00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:13.203
<v 2>uh,</v>

392
00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:19.650
<v 0>distance modulars and the distance modulates that you would expect,</v>

393
00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.850
uh,
at that particular red shift in an empty universe.

394
00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:30.480
So m minus M in at a given red shift in an empty universe.

395
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.230
So what does the green curve look like?

396
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.350
The green curve is Omega Equals Zero.

397
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:53.210
That is to say an empty universe.
Yes.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

398
00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.080
It's just a,

399
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:58.670
it's just a straight line at zero because it's always true that the empty

400
00:26:58.671 --> 00:27:02.630
universe minus what you expect for the Empty Universe is zero.

401
00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:08.060
So what you've done basically is you've taken this plot and tipped it 45 degrees

402
00:27:08.061 --> 00:27:11.990
so that,
uh,
this,
uh,
uh,
this Green Line is straight at zero.

403
00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:16.530
And then the brown line,
uh,
will look like this.

404
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:21.360
Uh,
sorry.
The red line will look like this.
Uh,

405
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:25.440
the brown line will look like this.
This again,
oh my God.

406
00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.160
Greater than one.
Oh my God.
Less than one.

407
00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.053
Oh zero.

408
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:32.063
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

409
00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.850
<v 0>So that's just convenient because then you can have your scale here.</v>

410
00:27:37.851 --> 00:27:42.800
Go from I dunno,
uh,
minus oh 0.3 to plus 0.3 or something like this.

411
00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.550
Uh,
and uh,
uh,

412
00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:51.240
and so you can see the uh,
the whole thing.
Actually I've got the signs wrong,

413
00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:54.340
have an eye,
uh,
because bright things are minus.

414
00:27:54.341 --> 00:27:56.470
So let's just put it as bright.

415
00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:57.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

416
00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:02.160
<v 0>And Faint.
So we've done our very best to confuse you,
right?</v>

417
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:03.031
First of all,

418
00:28:03.031 --> 00:28:06.780
we started out with a magnitude system that's upside down and logarithmic.

419
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.400
Second of all,

420
00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:13.490
we took the intuitively simple plot of a scale factor versus time,

421
00:28:14.881 --> 00:28:17.400
which actually tells you what you need to know about the universe.

422
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:20.190
Is it getting bigger?
Is it getting smaller?
Is it going to have a big crunch?

423
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.460
And we transformed it into this rather stranger thing where the things we are

424
00:28:26.731 --> 00:28:28.410
plotting or the things we measure,

425
00:28:28.411 --> 00:28:33.411
but it's not at all obvious how this translates into what the universe is doing.

426
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.330
Then not content with that.

427
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.980
We take that whole thing and subtract something you don't understand from it.

428
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:45.750
Uh,
so as to flatten out one of the lines.
Okay,

429
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.720
so it's a three part exercise in confusion.
Uh,

430
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:54.950
and I would say that the number one conceptually difficult thing in this entire

431
00:28:57.091 --> 00:29:02.091
course is to understand how this plot relates to this plot and more difficultly

432
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:07.750
how this plot relates back to the scale of the universe plot.
Uh,

433
00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.360
and that,
uh,

434
00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:13.860
if you can understand that you can understand 21st century cosmology.

435
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:16.920
Uh,
and so we will work on this a little bit.

436
00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:20.270
So if you're not quite getting it yet,
don't,
don't,
don't freak out.
Ah,

437
00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.810
you'll have plenty more opportunities to discuss it,
I assure you.
Uh,

438
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:29.820
in any case,
uh,
even if you're a little puzzled at the moment,

439
00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.440
uh,
let's look at this plot because this is how the data show up.

440
00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:37.710
So there's an Omega equals zero line,
which is straight,

441
00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:42.400
and then lines below it are increasingly large values of Omega.

442
00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.610
And so if you go out and measure a bunch of point a,

443
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.960
you expect to see them kind of lying in a straight line here.

444
00:29:49.961 --> 00:29:52.870
And then you expect to see them falling below that straight line.

445
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:56.680
And depending on how far below the straight line they fall,

446
00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:59.860
you can determine whether the universe is going to re collapse or not.

447
00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:03.430
So if they end up,
you know,
down here it's going to re collapse.

448
00:30:03.431 --> 00:30:06.130
If they end up here,
it's going to expand forever.

449
00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:10.460
<v 3>Okay.
How are we doing?</v>

450
00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.840
Ready for some data?
Okay.

451
00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:18.570
<v 0>So,
uh,
in the 1990s,
as I mentioned,
uh,</v>

452
00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.650
they actually made this measurement.
In fact,

453
00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.450
two different groups made the measurement and they were rivals.

454
00:30:24.451 --> 00:30:25.980
They did things slightly differently.

455
00:30:25.981 --> 00:30:30.540
They are measuring the same kinds of objects.
Here's what they found.
Okay?

456
00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:35.100
So let's see.
This is this Delta and minus m.

457
00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:39.900
So zero on this plot is the empty universe.

458
00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:44.940
Uh,
and then this dotted line is omega.

459
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:50.520
Uh,
so let me,
let me a color code.
This the way I had color coded,
uh,

460
00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:55.430
uh,
everything earlier.
So I'm gonna,
I'm gonna just take this in.

461
00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.613
<v 2>Uh,</v>

462
00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.530
<v 0>draw the relevant line.
So here's,</v>

463
00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:07.780
here's the Green Line at exactly a Omega equals zero.

464
00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:12.520
And then this thing is the brown line.
Oh,
sorry.
The red line.

465
00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:16.610
You got to get my color straight.
Red Line.

466
00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.820
This is Omega less than one.
In fact,

467
00:31:19.821 --> 00:31:22.190
this particular line is for Omega equals a quarter.

468
00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.150
And then the brown line is this thing here,

469
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:31.550
which is oma get equal to one.
So if you fall below the Brown line,

470
00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.350
uh,
the university is gonna re is going to really collapse.
Um,

471
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:41.660
and uh,
right.
What else do I want to do?

472
00:31:41.661 --> 00:31:46.280
I want to say about that.
Nothing because I've now put some points on there.

473
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:51.300
<v 3>Yes.
Why are they lying?</v>

474
00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:54.900
Stop in that graph.
Whereas the ones that you drew before they were curved.
Oh,

475
00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:55.110
okay.

476
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:58.750
<v 0>Uh,
these are,
these are actually curved.
It's just,</v>

477
00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.210
it's just I exaggerated the curvature.
Uh,

478
00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:04.510
the reason that it comes out less curved on this is it's only going up to a

479
00:32:04.511 --> 00:32:07.330
retrofit of what if you continue this out much further,

480
00:32:07.331 --> 00:32:09.820
the curvature would become more obvious.
Uh,

481
00:32:09.821 --> 00:32:11.800
but these are not in fact straight line.

482
00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:16.030
The green one's a straight line because it's just it and everything equals zero.

483
00:32:16.031 --> 00:32:20.920
But there is curvature on these lines.
Okay?
So the problem is obvious.

484
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:26.130
Here are the observed points and they don't go through any of these lines.

485
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:31.000
Uh,
and you can,
first of all,
okay,
so there are many things to say about this.

486
00:32:31.001 --> 00:32:35.070
First,
uh,
the error bars.
Let's talk about the error budge.

487
00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:37.450
Rhett shifts are relatively easy to observe.

488
00:32:37.451 --> 00:32:40.650
You can do that to high to high accuracy.
Uh,

489
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.340
this distance modulates is more complicated.

490
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:48.560
There are two kinds of errors incorporated into these error bars.

491
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:51.530
Uh,
one is measurement,

492
00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:53.120
<v 1>okay.</v>

493
00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.440
<v 0>Uh,
errors.
That is to say,</v>

494
00:32:54.441 --> 00:32:57.350
how accurately can you actually measure the brightness of these things?

495
00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:01.430
That's an error in little amp.
You know,
how,
how bro,

496
00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.990
how accurately can you measure these things?

497
00:33:02.991 --> 00:33:05.780
They're pretty fate by the time they're out at a red shift of 0.6.

498
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.080
But the other is how good is standard candle?
Is it,

499
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:13.580
how well do you know exactly what,
uh,

500
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:17.510
what the absolute magnitude is supposed to be?
So,
uh,

501
00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.070
accuracy,
uh,
of the standard candle.

502
00:33:24.930 --> 00:33:29.640
And that's an error you'd big amp because you don't know these things turn out

503
00:33:29.641 --> 00:33:33.060
to have a little bit of a spread and brightness and your don't know that.
Uh,

504
00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:37.530
and so,
uh,
that's why the nearby ones,
these ones down on this end,

505
00:33:37.531 --> 00:33:39.720
which you can measure really quite precisely,

506
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:43.650
still have substantial errors because you don't know how bright the standard

507
00:33:43.651 --> 00:33:48.000
candle is supposed to be,
uh,
to,
uh,
to perfect precision.

508
00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:52.350
And so you can see that down below or redshift of 0.2 down in this region here,

509
00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.590
you're going to have a really tough time telling the difference between these

510
00:33:55.591 --> 00:34:00.000
lines because the lines are separated by a tiny fraction of a magnitude.

511
00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:01.590
And the errors on these things,

512
00:34:01.591 --> 00:34:05.670
on any individual object is several tenths of a magnitude.
So,
you know,

513
00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:10.710
pretty much pretty much all of these points go through all of the lines.

514
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:15.000
And so that isn't going to tell you a great deal by the time you're out in here,

515
00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:19.440
you're starting to get several tenths of a magnitude difference in the

516
00:34:19.441 --> 00:34:23.250
prediction.
Now the errors are still several tenths of a magnitude.

517
00:34:23.251 --> 00:34:27.380
So observing one such object isn't going to tell you anything.
Uh,

518
00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.780
because supposing I observe any one of these things,
I don't care.

519
00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:35.480
Here's an error bar.
Uh,
and while it doesn't go through this line,
that's only a,

520
00:34:35.490 --> 00:34:37.960
you know,
two times the error.
Uh,

521
00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:42.030
two sigma error for those of you who have studied statistics isn't such a crazy

522
00:34:42.031 --> 00:34:43.200
thing.
Uh,

523
00:34:43.201 --> 00:34:47.490
and so one of these points would not tell you all that much,

524
00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.230
but on this plot,
uh,

525
00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:53.760
which was published in 2003 and contains data up until about 2001,

526
00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.820
uh,
there are a couple dozen points.

527
00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:01.740
Now this line here,
the red line with Omega equals a forth.

528
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:06.720
We already know that Omega has to be equal to at least a quarter,

529
00:35:06.721 --> 00:35:10.050
cause we've measured all that dark matter out there and we added it up and it

530
00:35:10.051 --> 00:35:14.760
comes out to about Omega equals a quarter or a third or something like that.
Uh,

531
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:16.320
and so if there's nothing,

532
00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.520
nothing else in the universe beyond what we already know about,

533
00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.920
you expect it to be on this line.

534
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:25.650
If there is matter in the universe that we don't know about,

535
00:35:25.651 --> 00:35:27.180
you expect it to be below that line.

536
00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:32.090
So if you take the point at red shift greater than a Ha,

537
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:37.160
then point to the interesting fact is all of them lie above this line and none

538
00:35:39.361 --> 00:35:44.010
of them lie below that line.
Uh,
now each of them has a different era,

539
00:35:44.011 --> 00:35:46.590
but nevertheless,
the points there are all above the line.

540
00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:50.790
So if it universe truly,
we're following this red line here,

541
00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:53.310
then,
uh,
what would you say?

542
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:57.210
You would say that half of them should lie above and half of them point should

543
00:35:57.211 --> 00:36:00.210
lie above,
below,
just by random chance.
Um,

544
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:02.400
so this is throwing,

545
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:07.770
throwing two dozen coins and having them all come up heads because they've all

546
00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:11.730
by random chance.
If the universe is following this line,
landed above the line.

547
00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:15.450
So you can figure out what the probability of that is.
It's,
you know,

548
00:36:15.451 --> 00:36:19.620
if they're 20 points and they're all heads,
uh,
that's two to the 20th.

549
00:36:19.621 --> 00:36:24.180
That's about one part,
a probability of one in a million.
Uh,

550
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.520
there was another team doing the same experiment.

551
00:36:26.521 --> 00:36:29.620
They measured about the same number of points,
you got the same result.
Uh,

552
00:36:29.621 --> 00:36:34.290
so that's two incidences of a one in a bit,
in a million chance,

553
00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:35.880
that's one in a trillion.

554
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:41.150
So random errors are not going to get you back down onto the red line,

555
00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.730
much less there.
Now look at the Green Line.

556
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:49.000
This is an empty universe.
Nothing in it at all for ha.

557
00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.350
Maybe we're just totally wrong.
If we've screwed up all the dark energy,

558
00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.430
all the dark matter,
uh,

559
00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:58.830
and we've got only two points below that that's almost equally improbable.

560
00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:04.220
And so what we think is going on is that this line actually goes above the Green

561
00:37:05.191 --> 00:37:05.880
Line.

562
00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.880
And the one current hypothesis for what such a line should be is this solid line

563
00:37:11.051 --> 00:37:12.020
up here.
Uh,

564
00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:16.590
which nicely goes through the point in such a way that kind of half of them are

565
00:37:16.591 --> 00:37:20.940
above and half of them are below the way points ought to be.
Um,

566
00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:27.410
so this is quite strong evidence that in fact,

567
00:37:27.991 --> 00:37:32.280
what the universe is doing is not going below that line,
but going above it.

568
00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:37.440
So what does that tell us?
All right,

569
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.720
let's do this whole exercise backwards.

570
00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:45.700
Delta and minus M versus Z.
Here's the empty universe.

571
00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:48.910
Uh,
and here's what we see,

572
00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:51.363
<v 1>right?</v>

573
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:54.530
<v 0>So how does that go onto the next plot?</v>

574
00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:59.240
This is now a m minus M versus red shift.

575
00:37:59.241 --> 00:38:02.310
Again,
here's the empty universe.
Uh,

576
00:38:02.311 --> 00:38:05.150
and so what appears to be happening is this.

577
00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:11.920
How does that then map onto the scale factor versus the red shift?

578
00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.040
Uh,
oh,
it was scale factor versus time.
Sorry,
years.
Now

579
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.760
here's one.
Here's this.

580
00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:28.470
This is now still the empty universe.
It's a straight line in this case.
Uh,

581
00:38:28.471 --> 00:38:29.730
and so what is happening here?

582
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:32.940
If you go back and you look at a particular distance,

583
00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:37.480
that is to say a particular time ago.
So you're looking here,

584
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.033
uh,

585
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:44.370
the purple line here has a s has a red shift that is smaller and therefore the

586
00:38:45.791 --> 00:38:50.470
scale factor is large.
So you ought to be here,

587
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:53.063
<v 1>right?</v>

588
00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:57.460
<v 0>So that's what we're observing the implication of,</v>

589
00:38:57.461 --> 00:39:00.700
which is that the future,
it's going to look like this.

590
00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:02.490
<v 1>Okay,</v>

591
00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:06.960
<v 0>so the universe in this is universe is expanding.</v>

592
00:39:06.961 --> 00:39:08.100
We already knew that.

593
00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:09.440
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

594
00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.030
<v 0>And the expansion,</v>

595
00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:12.570
<v 1>yeah.</v>

596
00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:14.150
<v 0>Is accelerated.</v>

597
00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:24.270
So something is pushing the universe outworked.

598
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.590
So we had a thought all along,
what's going to happen?

599
00:39:26.591 --> 00:39:29.030
Gravity is gonna pull it back together again.
It's going to be slowing up,

600
00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:32.690
slowing down,
no,
not true.
The universe,
uh,

601
00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.460
is being pushed outward

602
00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:44.520
by some kind of force by some kind of energy,
uh,

603
00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.710
which has re the,
uh,

604
00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:49.770
the characteristics of a repulsive gravity.

605
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:52.050
So it's anti gravity if you like.

606
00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:54.750
This is what the science fiction writers would certainly call it.

607
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:58.050
It's something that pushes things away from each other.
Uh,

608
00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:01.410
and this pervades the universe in such a way that it did.

609
00:40:01.411 --> 00:40:05.520
It actually dominates the behavior of the university as a whole.
Uh,

610
00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.830
we give this the name dark energy.

611
00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:08.993
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

612
00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.480
<v 0>And we have absolutely no idea what it is.</v>

613
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.600
Uh,
and uh,

614
00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:22.770
but of course as as my colleague Charlie Ball,
he likes to point out,
uh,
we never,

615
00:40:22.771 --> 00:40:26.550
we never actually admit to people that we don't know what we're talking about.

616
00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.910
Uh,
so you,
you,
you observe this kind of thing.
You don't say,

617
00:40:29.911 --> 00:40:32.370
we have no idea what's going on in the universe.
Know you save.

618
00:40:32.371 --> 00:40:35.820
We discovered dark energy,
big triumph,
uh,

619
00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.710
and uh,
uh,
and so we have discovered dark energy.
And furthermore,

620
00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:45.090
we know something about how much of it there is namely,
uh,

621
00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:48.090
because we can actually measure this curve.

622
00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:53.130
And so you can ask what is the density?

623
00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:54.620
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

624
00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.660
<v 0>Of the dark energy.</v>

625
00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

626
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.360
<v 0>Compared to matter.</v>

627
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:06.420
No.
Uh,
you know how to compare energy to matter,
right?

628
00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:11.010
You have to use e equals MC squared.
So,
uh,
uh,
if you have,

629
00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:15.960
uh,
energy,
uh,
some amount of energy per meter cubed,

630
00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:16.400
uh,

631
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:21.400
you that can transform that into a energy oversee squared per meter cube.

632
00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.210
And that now is in the same units of,
uh,
as a matter density.

633
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:30.960
Uh,
and so you can have Omeka of the matter,

634
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:35.390
which we think is about a third or a or something like that.
Uh,

635
00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.890
and,
uh,
you can ask how much energy is there?

636
00:41:39.891 --> 00:41:44.891
You can ask how much Omega is there an energy in this dark energy?

637
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:49.310
Not photons,
not ordinary kinds of energy,
but,
but this repulsive,
mysterious,

638
00:41:49.311 --> 00:41:50.420
repulsive dark energy.

639
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:54.380
It about three times the amount of matter,

640
00:41:56.230 --> 00:42:00.800
uh,
where all Mugu remember is equal to density over the critical density.

641
00:42:00.801 --> 00:42:01.371
And you know,

642
00:42:01.371 --> 00:42:04.930
it doesn't matter whether it's an energy density divided by c squared or some,

643
00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.830
some amount of matter.
Okay?

644
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.460
That's what we think the universe consists of.

645
00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:13.520
So here is the famous pie chart of the universe,

646
00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:20.480
which tells you what's going on.
So you know how pie charts work.

647
00:42:20.481 --> 00:42:21.530
You start with a circle,

648
00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:23.170
<v 1>okay?</v>

649
00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:27.910
<v 0>Not to everything.
Uh,
and here's us.</v>

650
00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:32.200
Uh,
so this is all ordinary matter

651
00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:39.790
and all ordinary kinds of energy,
photons,
what have you,
that we know about,

652
00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:43.060
uh,
and it's something like 4% of the universe.

653
00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:48.470
Then there's a big chunk that's dark matter

654
00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:57.650
and that we discussed last time.
But dark matter is this,
uh,
stuff we can't see.

655
00:42:57.651 --> 00:43:01.780
It might be wimps,
it might be machos.
We don't know.
We can't see it.
But,
uh,

656
00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.590
we know it's there.
Why do we know it's there?

657
00:43:03.591 --> 00:43:07.880
Because it exerts a gravitational force on galaxies and stars and galaxies.

658
00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:12.440
And we can measure how much of them there is by looking at stars,
galaxies,

659
00:43:12.441 --> 00:43:15.650
and clusters of galaxies and inferring the mass of them by,

660
00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:19.370
by observing the orbits of things around the of justice we did with black holes

661
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:23.660
just as we did with planets.
This is a fairly straight forward,
uh,

662
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:26.750
astronomical technique.
All rest of it.

663
00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:28.213
<v 1>Okay.</v>

664
00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:31.660
<v 0>This region here is dark energy,</v>

665
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:37.310
which not only can we not detect directly,

666
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:42.400
but it has a physical effect unlike anything else we know anything about at all.

667
00:43:42.650 --> 00:43:45.540
Namely,
it pushes out.
It's a,

668
00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:50.060
it's a purely repulsive force of some time.
Uh,

669
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:54.810
and uh,
and it,
uh,
uh,
and that purely were false of force,

670
00:43:54.811 --> 00:43:59.750
provides three quarters of the mass energy of the earth.
Well,

671
00:43:59.751 --> 00:44:04.610
that's bad.
Uh,
cause we have even less idea.

672
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:05.810
Oh,
and I should say,

673
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:08.840
so we've been counting up frontiers and controversies with time.

674
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:11.570
This is frontiers and controversies in 2007.

675
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:16.040
What the heck is going on with this pie chart?
What's this?

676
00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:20.600
What's this and why?
That's what we need to find out.

677
00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.690
Uh,
now,
oddly enough,

678
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:28.610
it turns out Einstein predicted this.
Einstein was a genius.

679
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:32.490
Only he then retracted it and decided it was the greatest mistake you'd ever

680
00:44:32.491 --> 00:44:37.230
made.
Uh,
and then it because he said it was a great mistake.

681
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:40.380
Everybody ignored it for 70 years until we discovered the dark energy.

682
00:44:40.381 --> 00:44:44.730
And then somebody said,
oh,
you know,
Einstein told us about this already a,

683
00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.690
and here's how,
why he did it.
Uh,
remember,
uh,
Einstein,

684
00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:54.270
uh,
wanted,
uh,
a static universe.

685
00:44:54.271 --> 00:44:56.550
This is before,
uh,

686
00:44:57.030 --> 00:45:01.800
this is before Hubble discovered that the universe was expanding.
Its all.

687
00:45:01.801 --> 00:45:05.250
Einstein was looking at the implications of his equations of general relativity.

688
00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.560
And he thought it would be nice if the universe was static.

689
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:10.380
And the problem is there's all this matter in the universe,

690
00:45:10.381 --> 00:45:11.490
so it attracts itself.

691
00:45:11.491 --> 00:45:14.940
So it can't be static because if you try and hold it in one place,

692
00:45:14.941 --> 00:45:15.810
it'll fall down.

693
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:20.670
It has to either be expanding up or expanding down just like the pen is either

694
00:45:20.671 --> 00:45:24.790
going up or going down.
So,
uh,
but that's bad spot Einstein,

695
00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:27.780
because it ought to be static.
So he invented a,

696
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:32.490
an additional term for his equation,
additional term,

697
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:37.200
which he wrote down as a capitol lambda and called the cosmological constant.

698
00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:38.973
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

699
00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:41.890
<v 0>And this had a,</v>

700
00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:46.900
generated a repulsive force that would balance

701
00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:53.340
gravity and lead to a static universe.

702
00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:58.460
And it was allowed in the equations.
It fit fine into the equations.

703
00:45:58.461 --> 00:46:01.790
There was no problem there.
Those of you who have done calculus,
um,

704
00:46:02.210 --> 00:46:06.170
this shows up as a constant of integration.
So it can be any,
any value you like,

705
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:11.570
um,
if you don't know calculus,
ignore that last sentence.
Uh,

706
00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:15.260
okay.
Uh,
and so he invented this repulsive force,

707
00:46:15.261 --> 00:46:19.430
this cosmological constant to balance grab gravity so that you could have a

708
00:46:19.431 --> 00:46:23.600
static universe.
Then Hubble discovered that the universe isn't static,

709
00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:26.840
discovers expansion.

710
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:30.740
And Einstein says,
damn,

711
00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:35.870
I could have predicted that and then I would have been famous,
you know?
Uh,

712
00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:38.600
so Einstein says,
uh,

713
00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:41.960
Lambda was my biggest mistake

714
00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:47.510
because if he hadn't been so insistent that the universe needed to turn out to

715
00:46:47.511 --> 00:46:50.900
be static,
he could have said,
your doll,
my equations predicted university.

716
00:46:50.901 --> 00:46:53.630
There has to be expanding or contracting.
It has to be moving around.

717
00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:58.210
And then Hubble would have verified Einstein's prediction and Einstein might've

718
00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:00.950
won the Nobel prize or something.
Uh,

719
00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:06.470
so lambda was my biggest mistake,
except it turns out that it might be true.

720
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:11.000
Uh,
so this is one of those fables,
right?
Uh,

721
00:47:11.001 --> 00:47:14.870
the fable of Einstein's,
uh,
biggest

722
00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:21.330
a mistake,
uh,

723
00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:22.700
and the moral is

724
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:28.230
interesting ideas,
uh,

725
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:32.350
can turn up in a different context and turn out to be even more important than

726
00:47:32.351 --> 00:47:35.800
you thought they were,
who turn up in other

727
00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.410
contexts.
So for 70 years,
you know,
the idea of this,

728
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:45.920
this lamb determined this cosmological constant was kind of buried in the

729
00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:47.830
textbooks.
It would be,
you know,

730
00:47:47.900 --> 00:47:51.290
problem 53 at the end of chapter seven,
you know,

731
00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:56.150
supposing there is a cosmological constant,
then what would happen?
Uh,
and uh,
uh,

732
00:47:56.151 --> 00:47:58.070
and generations of Grad students,
you know,

733
00:47:58.071 --> 00:48:01.190
thought about this for 15 minutes and then forgot.
Uh,

734
00:48:01.191 --> 00:48:06.140
and then all of a sudden,
uh,
it turns out to be,
uh,
uh,

735
00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:10.610
an explanation for this very mysterious,
uh,

736
00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:14.240
um,
uh,
a force.
Now this,

737
00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.970
just because you stick it in an equation doesn't tell you what it is.

738
00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.540
So what might it be?
The particle physicist,
it turns out,

739
00:48:20.541 --> 00:48:24.140
have a little bit of an explanation for this called the vacuum energy.

740
00:48:24.141 --> 00:48:26.270
I'll talk more about that later.
Never mind what it is.

741
00:48:26.271 --> 00:48:29.750
I just wanted to point out that if you calculate what the vacuum energy is,

742
00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:34.930
what you discover is that Omeka associated with this lambda is equal to 10 to

743
00:48:36.441 --> 00:48:40.190
the hundred and 20.
That's a particle physics calculation.

744
00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:42.253
<v 2>Uh,</v>

745
00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:46.180
<v 0>the observed Omega is equal to about three quarters.</v>

746
00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:52.060
Okay?
So this is the wrong guest calculation in the history of science.

747
00:48:52.570 --> 00:48:57.160
Uh,
it's off by 120 orders of bag that you're nit fact,

748
00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:01.120
it would be very bad if this was true because if there was that much repulsive

749
00:49:01.121 --> 00:49:05.170
energy,
no galaxies would have formed.
No,
uh,
planets would have formed.

750
00:49:05.171 --> 00:49:06.060
We wouldn't be here.
We,

751
00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:10.090
all our stuff would have been sprayed out into the far reaches of the universe.

752
00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:13.540
Uh,
so we knew already that that couldn't really be true.
Uh,

753
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:16.180
and so what the particle physicist said was,
you know,

754
00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:20.290
obviously this can't be true.
Salt must somehow cancel out,
so it must be zero.

755
00:49:20.650 --> 00:49:24.310
Uh,
because otherwise we have this embarrassing problem,

756
00:49:24.311 --> 00:49:26.900
which we know can't be true.
The fact that it,

757
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:31.450
it small but not zero is completely mysterious.

758
00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:34.960
Uh,
and,
uh,
that's where we'll start next time.
