1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.580
Okay,
welcome back for a,
for cosmology.

2
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.980
What I want to do today is,
um,
uh,

3
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.020
quickly review what we were doing about magnitudes and make a comment or two

4
00:00:13.121 --> 00:00:18.121
about the problem set and then go back and talk about the implications of the

5
00:00:18.191 --> 00:00:21.810
Hubble law and the Hubble Diagram,
which are,
uh,

6
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.740
a formidable to put it mildly.
Okay.

7
00:00:26.741 --> 00:00:30.940
Magnitudes.
Uh,
there's a couple of these magnitude equations.

8
00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:34.630
I'm just gonna write them down.
Uh,
the first of them looks like this.

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.223
<v 1>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.710
<v 0>and uh,
this equation is used.
Uh,
we focus,</v>

11
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.220
okay.
So this equation is used to relate,
uh,

12
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.740
magnitudes of two different objects to each other so that we've got two

13
00:00:57.741 --> 00:01:02.690
different objects and it can be used for either kind of magnitude,

14
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.190
either,
uh,

15
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.030
absolute or apparent magnitude just so long as,
uh,

16
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.180
you don't mix them.
So it's two different objects,
but only one of the magnitudes.

17
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.523
Uh,

18
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.210
one kind of magnitude.

19
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.730
And depending on which kind of magnitude you use,
this brightness ratio,

20
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:26.640
it's either the bright,

21
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.790
the ratio of how bright it looks or the ratio of how bright it is.
Uh,

22
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.800
whatever's appropriate.
Now,
uh,
on the help sheet on the web,

23
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.180
uh,
I sh I have this equation in a somewhat different format.

24
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.600
It's important to realize that it's the exact same equation.
Watch this.
Uh,

25
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.760
let's see.
Let's multiply both halves by minus two fifths,
which is minus 0.4.

26
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.090
So this is minus 0.4 m one minus m two is equal to log,

27
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.090
be one over B two.

28
00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:04.070
And then let's take 10 to the power of that.
That gets rid of the log.

29
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.900
And this is now the form that it is on the help sheet,
uh,

30
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:11.630
on the web.
So it's exactly the same equation,

31
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.570
just express differently and you can use either form,

32
00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:19.200
whichever is more convenient.
Okay.

33
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.110
The other equation looks like this,

34
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.620
a five log d over 10 parsecs.

35
00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.680
And this relates one object,

36
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.680
but it relates both kinds of magnitude to each other.

37
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.990
So the first one is two different objects,
but only one of the magnitude,

38
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.460
the other's one object.

39
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:50.240
And it relates to the two different kinds of magnitudes to each other and to the

40
00:02:50.241 --> 00:02:54.480
distance to the object.
Uh,
and as you can see this,

41
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.730
both of these equations actually have three unknowns.
One,
two,
three.

42
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.370
That means you've got to know two things in order to find out the third.
Uh,

43
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.430
and that brings me to the comment I want to make about problem to a,

44
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.800
on the current problem set.
Uh,

45
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.430
you are asked in this problem to determine the difference between the absolute

46
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:22.360
magnitude of one kind of star called type one Cepheids.
So I label it,

47
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:23.870
see one,
uh,

48
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:28.800
and another kind of stark type two Cepheids,
which I labeled C to.

49
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.850
Uh,
and if you're asked to,
and,
and this difference is called,
I don't know,

50
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:37.300
Delta,
AMC or something like that.
Um,

51
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.420
if you're [inaudible] and having been asked to do this,

52
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:43.210
the logical thing that you might try to do is say,
all right,

53
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:45.430
I'm going to use one or the other of these equations.

54
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:48.400
I'm not sure in advanced which to compute this one.

55
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.940
Then I'm going to compute this one and I'm going to subtract the two.

56
00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:56.860
And that's going to give me the answer.
That approach will fail.
Okay?

57
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:00.850
That doesn't work in this particular case because you don't actually have enough

58
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:04.030
information to compute either one of these things.

59
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.590
You do have enough information to compute the difference.
Uh,

60
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:13.591
and let me just give you a very brief hint on how you might go about doing that.

61
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.050
Uh,
let's see.
Let me take a new piece of paper here.
Write down,

62
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.483
uh,

63
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.070
m c one minus M C one is five log d c One over 10 parsecs.

64
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.840
And now write the exact same equation down for c two,

65
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.630
where the two different distances are the distances you get by assuming a one or

66
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:51.520
the other kinds of,
uh,
of these magnitudes.
This equation,
this equation too.

67
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.410
Now let's subtract one minus two.
So then you get little MC,

68
00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:58.530
one minus little MC,

69
00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:01.450
two minus big MC,

70
00:05:01.451 --> 00:05:06.010
one minus big MC two is equal to five,

71
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.120
log d c One

72
00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.160
minus log D C Two.

73
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.090
Okay,
now here's the trick.
Uh,
turns out,
uh,

74
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.630
for reasons that you had better.

75
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:30.631
Tell me a and t apps take note that we really want them to say why this is true.

76
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.620
Now that I've told them it is,
uh,
this is zero.
The two,
uh,

77
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.870
the two apparent magnitudes are the same.

78
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.980
And so that means that this side of the equation is what you want.

79
00:05:41.981 --> 00:05:45.730
It's the difference between these two,
these two magnitude.

80
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.500
And then over here you have to use one of these log rules,

81
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.590
log of x minus log of y.

82
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.710
If you remember back to 11th grade is log of x over y.

83
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:01.820
And if you use that,

84
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.650
it turns out that you have information elsewhere in the problem,

85
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.790
which we'll tell you what you need to know,
uh,
about the distances.

86
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.230
And so in this way you can solve for the difference without actually being able

87
00:06:22.231 --> 00:06:24.510
to determine either one of these two things.

88
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.310
So we'll just leave it at that for the moment.
If you have problems,

89
00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.260
there's the usual forum,
there's the usual office hours,
uh,
but,

90
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.110
but ponder this,
uh,
uh,
that's uh,
basically how the problem has to do

91
00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:42.923
<v 1>okay.</v>

92
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.290
<v 0>Problems with magnitude.</v>

93
00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.950
Okay.
If you,
if you,
if you do have some,
let,

94
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.000
let us know because this is going to be critical for solving,
uh,

95
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.410
basically problems for the whole rest of the class.

96
00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

97
00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.220
<v 0>All right.
Yes,
go ahead.</v>

98
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.850
This,
uh,

99
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.480
this is log d,
uh,

100
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.510
c one over 10 parsecs minus log DC to over 10 parsecs.

101
00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.370
That's just subtracting the two right hand sides of this equation.

102
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.390
But then you get to do the log thing and divide the,
divide them instead,

103
00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.310
which is fis to this on the,
on this log subtraction.

104
00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:42.520
Okay.
Let me remind you why we're putting ourselves through this pain.

105
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.710
Okay.
Uh,
recall why we started doing this in the first place.

106
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:53.190
The goal was to figure out how to measure the Hubble Diagram.

107
00:07:53.771 --> 00:07:56.680
The Hubble diagram is this diagram of velocity,

108
00:07:56.681 --> 00:08:00.220
which you can measure by red shift versus distance.

109
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.400
And the whole reason we embarked on this adventure in magnitudes was because

110
00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:09.760
that's how that's a critical component in how you determined that distance.

111
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.950
But if you've got a bunch of,
um,

112
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.390
of galaxies and you measure these two quantities for each one of them,

113
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.820
what you discover,
what Hubble discovered,

114
00:08:18.821 --> 00:08:22.960
what Edwin Hubble discovered many years ago,
is that they line up,

115
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:28.450
you get this perfect,
well not quite perfect,
but close to it.
Uh,

116
00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.040
there's beautiful straight line.

117
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.090
If you measure a bunch of these things and the way you represent that straight

118
00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:38.440
line is,

119
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.393
<v 1>uh,</v>

120
00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.610
<v 0>with this equation where h is Hubble's constant.</v>

121
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.580
And so that's the purpose of all this magnitude stuff,

122
00:08:50.581 --> 00:08:53.130
is to be able to determine the y axis of this plot.

123
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:58.520
What I now want to do is talk the implications of this observational fact that

124
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:02.100
the guy that galaxies lineup on this line,

125
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.400
it turns out this is one of the most profound plots in all of astrophysics and

126
00:09:07.561 --> 00:09:11.340
possibly all of science.
Because what this implies is first of all,

127
00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:12.990
that the universe is expanding.

128
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.770
And hence,
uh,
the,

129
00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.680
it's the basis for the whole big bang theory of cosmology.

130
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.270
Uh,
and by,
uh,

131
00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:31.060
performing relatively simple calculations using this quantity age,
uh,

132
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.230
you can determine the age of the universe

133
00:09:36.380 --> 00:09:38.870
and the ultimate fate of the universe.

134
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:48.480
Not Bad,
uh,
for a relatively simple algebraic equation.
Yes.

135
00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:54.320
Huh.
Oh,
fate.
Uh,
I'll,
I'll get,
I'll get back to that.
Uh,
the,

136
00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.740
the big question in cosmology is,
you know,
the universe is now expanding.

137
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.960
The question is,
will it continue to expand,

138
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:05.961
in which case the universe just gets sparse and cold and boring and expands

139
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:09.480
forever until there's,
you know,
one pathetic hydrogen atom,

140
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:13.380
every cubic mega parsec of space,
or alternatively,

141
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.390
it could stop slow down and re collapsed into something called a big crunch,

142
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:22.980
uh,
and,
uh,
which is sort of the big bang run backwards.
Uh,

143
00:10:22.981 --> 00:10:27.750
and basically the whole thing turned into a massive black hole.
Uh,
these are,
uh,

144
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:32.430
uh,
you know,
this is Andy again,
fire or an ice,
I guess.
Uh,

145
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:36.540
and it can be computed,
uh,
and in,
in ways we'll describe later.

146
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:43.090
Okay.
So here's what I wanna do.
I wanna I want to start understanding,
uh,

147
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.320
how this plot and this little equation gives you all these wonderful things.

148
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:50.730
I'm going to go on for a little while,

149
00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:55.320
then we'll pause and we'll do one of these Q and a sessions because this is sort

150
00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:57.540
of the heart of the Big Bang theory.

151
00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.810
And so we'll do one of these things that we did when we were talking about

152
00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:03.990
relativity where you talk to each other and come up with questions.

153
00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:08.580
So if you've got questions along the way,
by all means ask them.
Uh,
but,
uh,

154
00:11:08.581 --> 00:11:10.830
we will have a specific moment,

155
00:11:10.831 --> 00:11:14.070
a little ways down the line where we actually pause and,
uh,
uh,

156
00:11:14.071 --> 00:11:17.790
and do this on purpose.
So everybody keep,
keep thinking as we go along.

157
00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:20.040
What are your questions?
What don't you understand?

158
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.750
Or what questions could you ask to understand more than what I've just told you?

159
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.410
Okay,
here we go.

160
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.090
Imagine a one dimensional universe

161
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.460
just cause it's easy for me to write down

162
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:43.080
and here's our one dimensional universe.
It's all strung out on a line.

163
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:47.310
Here's the line.
Uh,
and it's got a bunch of galaxies on it.

164
00:11:47.311 --> 00:11:52.020
Let's label these galaxies a,
B,
c,
d,
e,

165
00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:56.710
and f,
uh,
and these galaxies are spaced evenly.

166
00:11:56.711 --> 00:11:59.050
Let us imagine and we'll give them coordinates.

167
00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:03.310
So this is at 0.0 0.1,
0.2 and so forth.

168
00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.630
Okay?
Now next thing we're going to do,

169
00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.700
the universe is going to double in size.

170
00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.550
So we're just going to stretch the thing.

171
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.540
The whole thing is going to get stretched.
So here's our universe,
and now

172
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:21.120
<v 2>a,
B,
c,
d,
e,
n,</v>

173
00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.600
<v 0>f are further apart by a factor of two.</v>

174
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.710
<v 2>Hey,
B,
c,
d,
e,</v>

175
00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:33.220
<v 0>F and F,
a.
You know,
we imagined stays at the saint coordinate.</v>

176
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:38.050
If our coordinate system starts with a,
this means B is now at to see is it four,

177
00:12:38.051 --> 00:12:41.080
six,
eight,
and 10.
Okay.

178
00:12:41.081 --> 00:12:46.081
And let us imagine that it takes one time unit one year or something like that

179
00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.280
for this doubling to take place.

180
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:53.470
Now we're going to ask if you sit,
if you live in galaxy a,

181
00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:58.471
if you live on planet a and you observe the distance and velocity of all these

182
00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:03.520
other galaxies,
uh,
what's it gonna look like?
So a observer on a,

183
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:10.920
uh,
and so we're going to observe a particular galaxy,

184
00:13:10.921 --> 00:13:15.240
one of these other galaxies.
Uh,
we're going to write down the distance,

185
00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:20.650
uh,
will choose the distance at the start because it's going to change them.

186
00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:25.470
We're going to,
uh,
evaluate how that galaxy has moved.

187
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.370
Uh,
and then,
uh,

188
00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:32.970
the total,
the distance changed.

189
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.410
And then over here we're going to get the velocity.
The velocity is going to be,

190
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:42.060
uh,
the change in distance,
uh,

191
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:46.080
divided by the change in time,
which we've defined to be one time yet.

192
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:48.383
<v 1>Okay.</v>

193
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:56.470
<v 0>So galaxy be galaxy be start at a distance of one away from us cause it starts</v>

194
00:13:57.741 --> 00:14:00.230
at one gay star,
tits in a row.
Uh,

195
00:14:00.260 --> 00:14:05.260
it moved from one to two a and that gives it a change in distance of one,

196
00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.590
and therefore it's velocity over this time it's changed in distance by one.

197
00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:17.390
It's taken one time unit.
The velocity is one divided by one equals one.

198
00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.310
Okay.
The algebras easy.
Okay.

199
00:14:24.311 --> 00:14:28.480
So how about c?
C starts to away.
It's motion.

200
00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:30.970
It goes from two away to four away.

201
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:36.280
And so the change in its distances to,
uh,
and,
uh,

202
00:14:36.281 --> 00:14:39.730
since it takes one time unit to do it,
it's velocity is two over one,

203
00:14:39.731 --> 00:14:43.750
which is equal to we,
which is equal to two seat Algebra simple.

204
00:14:43.751 --> 00:14:47.670
But I screw it up,
right Beth,
and he's laughing at me,
uh,

205
00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:54.750
and well might,
uh,
but I caught myself.
All right.

206
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:58.760
And so on down the line,
I could repeat this,
a,
this simple exercise.

207
00:14:58.761 --> 00:15:02.970
D E F start at three,
four and five,
uh,

208
00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:06.840
goes from three to six,
from four to eight,
uh,

209
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.330
from five to 10.
And their velocities are three,
four,

210
00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.710
and five,
respectively.
And so if I plot distance,

211
00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.940
uh,
vs velocity,
I'll get points lined up just like this.

212
00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.040
And so basically what happens is this,

213
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:27.220
if you take a set of points on a coordinate system and you simply stretched the

214
00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:32.630
coordinate system,
what happens is that the further away you start,

215
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:35.900
the greater the stretches.
And so,
uh,

216
00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:40.760
there is a correlation between how far away you start and how fast,
uh,

217
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:45.440
the thing receives from you.
Now this is true,

218
00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:50.000
regardless of where a of which,
uh,

219
00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.770
point you sit on.
Let's sit.

220
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.270
Let's imagine that we sit on point that the observer is now on point

221
00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.213
<v 1>e.</v>

222
00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:05.640
<v 0>So on point e we're now going to,
uh,
which galaxy,</v>

223
00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:11.280
uh,
initial distance motion,
uh,

224
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.433
velocity.

225
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:18.110
So this is the same plot of charges before e let's look at f starts at a

226
00:16:19.141 --> 00:16:23.490
distance of one because it's one unit away.
Uh,
the motion.
Okay.

227
00:16:23.491 --> 00:16:27.090
At the start it's uh,
let me take,

228
00:16:27.091 --> 00:16:31.110
let's take a quick look at how this is set up here.
Yes,

229
00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:35.970
he is at four.
So at the start the distances between four and five,

230
00:16:35.971 --> 00:16:40.770
which is one,
and it goes to a distance of Eight,
eight,

231
00:16:40.771 --> 00:16:44.340
which is where he ends up and 10,
which is where f ends up.

232
00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.240
So that is a change,
uh,
of two,

233
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:53.700
no change of one.
Right,
because it's gone from one a way to,

234
00:16:53.701 --> 00:16:55.440
to away the velocities want.

235
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:56.463
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

236
00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.230
<v 0>If we look at d,</v>

237
00:16:59.410 --> 00:17:04.360
it starts at a distance of one goes starts at four to three.

238
00:17:04.361 --> 00:17:08.020
That's one separation goes to eight to six.

239
00:17:08.021 --> 00:17:10.900
That's a separation of two.
Delta d is again,

240
00:17:10.901 --> 00:17:13.360
equal to one velocity is equal to one

241
00:17:15.070 --> 00:17:16.600
that's looked for example at B,

242
00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.800
that starts three away and it starts from four B.

243
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.070
See ya from four to one,

244
00:17:27.370 --> 00:17:31.150
and it goes to from eight to two.

245
00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:35.950
So that's uh,
a difference of six year difference of three there.

246
00:17:35.951 --> 00:17:40.951
And so Delta d is equal to three until the velocity is once again three.

247
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:45.670
And so you get the exact same plot with different galaxies cause you're sitting

248
00:17:45.671 --> 00:17:46.570
in a different place.

249
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:50.730
So it doesn't matter which galaxy you're sitting on,

250
00:17:50.731 --> 00:17:55.731
you see the exact same ratio of distance to velocity and you create the exact

251
00:17:56.791 --> 00:18:01.470
same Hubble flow no matter which galaxy you sit on,
uh,
in this,

252
00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.910
in this little toward universe.

253
00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:11.490
So that's the key point that if you take a coordinate system and you expand it,

254
00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:17.250
you naturally get this relationship between distance and velocity or to turn it

255
00:18:18.311 --> 00:18:22.420
around.
If you observe this relationship between distance and velocity,

256
00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.820
then what you're looking at is a system in which all the coordinates are,
are,
uh,

257
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:31.780
in which you've simply stretched the coordinate system.
Okay.

258
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.273
Now

259
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:38.800
this give rise to this analogy with this,

260
00:18:38.801 --> 00:18:41.610
with this stretching one dimensional line,
uh,

261
00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:45.790
gives rise to two questions people have,
which,

262
00:18:45.850 --> 00:18:49.120
which I like to call unquestioned because,
uh,

263
00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:52.390
there are actually questions that arise because of the analogy,

264
00:18:52.391 --> 00:18:55.180
not because of the way the universe works.
Uh,

265
00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.840
one question is Q one,

266
00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:04.290
where is the center?
You know,

267
00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:08.390
here's your line.
It's expanding,
right?
Yeah.

268
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:12.460
But somewhere in the middle here around C or d,
and our thing is,

269
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:17.250
is the center away from which everything is expanded?
Uh,
so that's one question.

270
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:21.300
And the second question is,
what is it expanding into?

271
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:31.650
You know,
uh,
here you have a little universe and it's moving outward.
Uh,

272
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.290
and so what's going on over here?

273
00:19:33.291 --> 00:19:37.910
What was there before the universe moved into it?
Uh,
these kinds of questions,

274
00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:41.970
uh,
and those kinds of questions,
uh,

275
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.860
come about because this is actually a bad analogy,

276
00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.740
this straight line universe.
So let me give you a slightly better one.

277
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.930
We'll stick with a one dimensional universe,
but now we'll do it this way.

278
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.590
Here's a one dimensional universe.
You have to stay on the line.
So here's,
yeah,

279
00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.900
<v 2>a,
B,
c,
d,</v>

280
00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:09.140
e,

281
00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.190
<v 0>f,
whatever,</v>

282
00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:14.510
and it's going to expand and it's going to expand it to something that looks

283
00:20:14.511 --> 00:20:15.344
like this.

284
00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:20.010
<v 2>A,
B,
c,
d,
e,
f,</v>

285
00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:28.610
<v 0>uh,
and all of what we just did about the velocity and so forth remains the same.</v>

286
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.950
Uh,
but,
uh,
notice that this system is unbounded.

287
00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.240
There's no edge.

288
00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:41.940
There's no edge.
There's no place where you can say,
uh,
uh,

289
00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:44.900
this is the end of the universe.
Because if you traveled around,

290
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.490
it could just come back to where you were and therefore there's also no center.

291
00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:54.180
And where does it expand into?

292
00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.630
It expands into a dimension that if you're a one dimensional creature,

293
00:20:57.631 --> 00:21:01.500
you can't experience,
cause it's,
it's the whole thing is being pushed out.

294
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.380
But if you're forced to live on this,
on this circle,
you can't even,
uh,

295
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.890
you have no comprehension of what it expands into.

296
00:21:07.891 --> 00:21:09.750
It expands into a higher dimension.

297
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:20.900
<v 1>Okay.</v>

298
00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.180
<v 0>But all of this stuff about,
you know,</v>

299
00:21:23.181 --> 00:21:25.640
velocity and distance remains basically the same.

300
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:28.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

301
00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.050
<v 0>Here's a two dimensional analogy.</v>

302
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.810
Let's see this,
uh,
this is,
so I made a little,

303
00:21:36.811 --> 00:21:39.060
a little diagram of the old campus.

304
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.840
Here's Linsley Chittenden where we're sitting right now.
Yes.
Uh,

305
00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:47.220
here's The statue of Abraham Pearson.
Uh,
this is,
uh,

306
00:21:47.221 --> 00:21:51.560
the gate between Durfee and right.
Here's Phelps.
Great.
Here's Vanderbilt.
Uh,

307
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.560
this is harkness tower and here Starbucks.
Okay,
you fall.

308
00:21:55.590 --> 00:22:00.370
That's all that's important,
right?
Uh,
so you following me with that?
Uh,

309
00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:04.170
and what I did was I took this little picture and I took it to the Xerox machine

310
00:22:04.171 --> 00:22:08.850
and I blew it up by 20%.
So here's the exact same diagram,

311
00:22:08.851 --> 00:22:10.380
blown up by 20%.

312
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.980
So now supposing we're sitting of Lindsley Chittenden,

313
00:22:13.981 --> 00:22:15.210
which we happened to be doing,

314
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:16.593
<v 1>uh,</v>

315
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.800
<v 0>and the universe expanded by 20%,</v>

316
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:24.450
or are a little corner of the universe expanded by 20%.
Here's what would happen.

317
00:22:24.451 --> 00:22:29.190
Now notice what's happening.
Every object in the universe is moving away from us.

318
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.150
See,
here's where harkness was,

319
00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:36.390
and now it's moved a little further in a straight line away from us.

320
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:41.880
Here is Pearson.
And he's moved a little further straight away from us.

321
00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:47.010
And here's Phelps and it's moved a little further straight away from us.
Uh,

322
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.530
and uh,
uh,

323
00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:55.010
let me race those lines because what I want to demonstrate is that if you're

324
00:22:55.021 --> 00:22:58.740
anywhere else in this universe,
the exact same thing happens here.

325
00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:03.860
We're now a sitting on that statue and Lindsley cit is moving away from us.

326
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.980
Harkness is moving away from us.
Phelps is moving away from us.

327
00:23:07.981 --> 00:23:11.400
Starbucks is moving away from us and so forth.
Similarly,

328
00:23:11.401 --> 00:23:15.060
if you're sitting in Starbucks waiting for students to come by or something,

329
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.400
<v 1>uh,</v>

330
00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:22.460
<v 0>the exact same thing happens and now,
uh,
because the distances are greater,</v>

331
00:23:22.461 --> 00:23:26.870
you can see the effect that the velocity is greater at greater distances.
Uh,

332
00:23:26.871 --> 00:23:30.560
if I'm looking down at Vanderbilt and only move,
it moves straight away from me,

333
00:23:30.561 --> 00:23:34.190
but only a little bit.
If I'm looking all the way across all campus,

334
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.760
this gate moves a lot of weight from me.
And so once again,

335
00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:41.010
you have a situation in which,
uh,

336
00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:46.130
the further away some everything is moved,
everything is moving away from you,

337
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.180
but the further away it is,
the faster it's moving away,

338
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:52.913
<v 1>right?</v>

339
00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.910
<v 0>And that's just a consequence of the fact that you have taken this,</v>

340
00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.320
uh,
this geometry and expanded it.

341
00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:06.400
And so wherever you sit in an expanding,
uh,
uh,

342
00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.180
in an expanding geometry,
every object you see,

343
00:24:10.181 --> 00:24:13.240
we'll be moving directly away from you.
And the further away it is,

344
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:15.670
the faster it will be moving,
which is Hubble's law.

345
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.310
So,
uh,

346
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.830
oh,
and one other thing about this,

347
00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:30.950
this nice analogy here,

348
00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:36.100
let us imagine for a second that this tiny piece of a tiny universe is actually,

349
00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.520
uh,
not a flat plane,

350
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.920
but it's sitting on a curved surface,

351
00:24:42.921 --> 00:24:45.770
which is curved all the way round into a big ball.

352
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.340
That's actually not so hard to imagine it because it's true.
Uh,

353
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:51.380
this sits on the surface of the earth.

354
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:56.620
And so what is happening when this thing blows up by 20% is basically somebody

355
00:24:56.901 --> 00:24:57.740
has taken,
you know,

356
00:24:57.741 --> 00:25:02.741
taking a valve to the earth and has blown the earth up by a factor of 20% and

357
00:25:03.531 --> 00:25:08.531
that would have this effect and it would have the exact same effect everywhere

358
00:25:09.411 --> 00:25:14.240
else on the surface of the earth and the earth,
you know,

359
00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:18.140
uh,
where is the center of the surface of the earth?

360
00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:21.320
You can answer the question where is the center of the earth?

361
00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:25.130
But you can't answer this question of where's the center of the surface of the

362
00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:27.020
earth?
Because wherever you sit,

363
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.220
whether you're sitting at Starbucks or in Phelps Gate or uh,
you know,

364
00:25:31.221 --> 00:25:35.870
in Los Angeles somewhere or wherever,
if they blow the Earth up by 20%,

365
00:25:35.871 --> 00:25:37.490
you're going to see this exact same effect.

366
00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:40.730
Everything will be moving away from you.
The further away something is,

367
00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.110
the faster it will be moving.

368
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:49.690
So
that's the one,
yes,
go ahead.

369
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:54.520
Yeah.
Talk.

370
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.200
Yes,
yes.
Good question.
If something's far away from you,
will it be appear,

371
00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:07.140
appear to be moving at the speed of light?
Yes,
it will.

372
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.910
And that's one of the fundamental differences between,
uh,

373
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:15.300
the motion of an object due to what's called the Hubble float due to the

374
00:26:15.301 --> 00:26:18.630
expansion and ordinary motion of,
of,
of objects.

375
00:26:18.631 --> 00:26:22.170
Now something's moving faster than the speed of light.
Of course.
Uh,
you can't,

376
00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:27.300
you can't see it because the light from that is red shifted down to greater than

377
00:26:27.301 --> 00:26:32.070
infinite wave length.
So the photons don't have any energy left.
Uh,
but,

378
00:26:32.071 --> 00:26:34.650
but let me come back to that question after I do one more thing.

379
00:26:34.651 --> 00:26:38.880
That's a good question here.
Here's the thing I want to do.
Um,
so

380
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.823
<v 1>why</v>

381
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.100
<v 0>we've had the one dimensional case,
the circle,
we've the two dimensional case,</v>

382
00:26:44.101 --> 00:26:48.270
the expanding sphere course.
What we want us the three dimensional space case.

383
00:26:48.271 --> 00:26:51.660
Here we are in three dimensions.
Someone is expanding the universe.

384
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.690
So everywhere we look,
everything is going away from us.

385
00:26:54.691 --> 00:26:56.800
And the further away it is,
the faster it's going.

386
00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.673
<v 3>Uh,</v>

387
00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:04.480
<v 0>what's it expanding into?
Well that we have a little more trouble visualizing,</v>

388
00:27:04.481 --> 00:27:04.751
right?

389
00:27:04.751 --> 00:27:09.070
Cause in one dimension you can visualize this circle expanding onto the plane in

390
00:27:09.071 --> 00:27:13.330
two dimensions.
You can be imagined this,
the spherical surface expanding,
uh,

391
00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:16.870
in three dimensions.
We can't imagine what it's expanding into.
That's,
that's,

392
00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.260
that's beyond us.
Uh,

393
00:27:18.261 --> 00:27:22.540
and so having had this failure of the imagination,
what do you do?

394
00:27:22.541 --> 00:27:27.250
You resort to mathematics.
That's what we always do.
Uh,
and so,
uh,

395
00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.890
imagine that every object,
uh,

396
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.460
has a,
uh,
position,

397
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.440
which is dean noted by three coordinates,
three spacial coordinates,

398
00:27:40.441 --> 00:27:42.720
x,
y,
and Z.
Uh,

399
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:47.010
but now let's imagine that every object's position has,
is,

400
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.910
has this coordinate system times and,

401
00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:53.083
<v 3>uh,</v>

402
00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.960
<v 0>a scale factor,
which is a function of t.</v>

403
00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:03.140
So it's a scale factor
times.

404
00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:04.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

405
00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.960
<v 0>Uh,
uh,
coordinate position.</v>

406
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:14.850
And there are two ways that things can change their position.

407
00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:19.080
One is they can move,
they can change their xyz position.

408
00:28:19.081 --> 00:28:22.320
This is the equivalent of somebody walking across the old campus.

409
00:28:22.530 --> 00:28:25.230
You walk from Starbucks to Phelps Gate or something like that,

410
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:26.970
and you change your x,
y,

411
00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:31.710
z coordinate position by moving through space.
So,

412
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:33.780
uh,
changes in position,

413
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:37.200
which is to say velocity

414
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:43.980
can be accomplished in two ways.
One is,
oops,
where's my

415
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:52.430
one is a motion through the coordinate system.

416
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:55.860
<v 1>Okay.</v>

417
00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.500
<v 0>That is to say changing your x,
Y,
and z.</v>

418
00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:00.870
This is called peculiar motion.

419
00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.880
That's a jargon and it's called peculiar because one object can have a different

420
00:29:06.981 --> 00:29:10.160
peculiar emotion from,
uh,
from every other.

421
00:29:10.161 --> 00:29:14.750
It's peculiar in the old fashioned sense,
meaning specific to one object.
Uh,

422
00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.420
so you have a peculiar motion that's all your own.

423
00:29:17.421 --> 00:29:22.310
I have one that's all mine as we move through x,
Y,
and z.
But the other is,

424
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:27.200
uh,
just the effect of the change.

425
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:31.930
And in particular,
in the case of the current university increase,
uh,

426
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.500
in the scale factor

427
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:42.460
and these two kinds of philocity,
uh,

428
00:29:42.490 --> 00:29:46.000
are conceptually different from each other,
uh,

429
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:51.780
because you don't have to do anything to have to change your position in this

430
00:29:52.181 --> 00:29:56.140
way.
You just sit there,
you don't expend any energy,
you don't have,

431
00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.000
you don't have,
uh,

432
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:02.470
any requirement to expend energy or to exert a force or to do any of these

433
00:30:02.471 --> 00:30:04.780
things that we ordinarily do to change our position.

434
00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.040
You just sit there in the universe,
expands you or expand to your position.

435
00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.460
And that's why,
going back to your question,

436
00:30:12.461 --> 00:30:17.461
that's why it's possible for this kind of velocity to turn out to be greater

437
00:30:17.771 --> 00:30:20.300
than the speed of light if it's far enough away.
Uh,

438
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:24.280
whereas it's not possible here.
What the effect of having a,

439
00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.570
this kind of velocity be fast than the speed of light does is it makes the

440
00:30:28.571 --> 00:30:32.020
objects impossible to see,
uh,
because uh,

441
00:30:32.021 --> 00:30:36.880
photons coming off them would be red shifted into,
uh,
into oblivion.
Uh,

442
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.710
and so you can't actually see them in this imposes a kind of cosmic event

443
00:30:41.711 --> 00:30:45.970
horizon similar in kind to the event horizons around black holes.

444
00:30:45.971 --> 00:30:50.020
You can't see events on the other side of these horizons.
All right,

445
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.820
let me go backwards in time.

446
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:58.290
Back in time to when this scale factor a of t is equal to zero.

447
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:05.020
So if,
if the scale factor is expanding and you know,
the old campus,

448
00:31:05.021 --> 00:31:06.670
whatever is expanding,
uh,

449
00:31:06.671 --> 00:31:10.030
and you and you reverse time and you think about what happened long ago,

450
00:31:10.150 --> 00:31:13.870
it must have been smaller.
So this a factor must've been smaller.

451
00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:19.020
And if you go back a sufficient amount in time and go back to the point where a

452
00:31:19.391 --> 00:31:23.980
is equal to zero,
so then what does the old campus look like?
It looks like this,

453
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:29.450
right?
It's all been imagined.
I take a xerox machine and I,
uh,

454
00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:34.160
and Id Xerox id magnify the thing,
uh,
by uh,

455
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:34.900
uh,

456
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:39.790
down to 0% of its original size or zero plus epsilon.

457
00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:43.270
Perhaps.
Uh,
what,
what does that little diagram looks like?

458
00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.830
It looks like a tiny little dot.

459
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:49.660
A a single point except it isn't a single point.
What it is,

460
00:31:49.661 --> 00:31:52.930
is it's many points superposed on each other.

461
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.540
And not only is the old campus in there,

462
00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:59.920
imagine you've taken this sphere that is the earth and collapsed it to radius

463
00:31:59.921 --> 00:32:03.580
down to zero.
Uh,
not only the old campus is there,

464
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.340
but so's the rest of new haven sows.
Connecticut's sows.

465
00:32:06.341 --> 00:32:08.830
Los Angeles sews the whole rest of the surface of the earth.

466
00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:14.370
All of the points that will eventually make the surface of the earth are super

467
00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.880
posed on one another.
And yet,
uh,

468
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:23.000
the whole geometry of the earth,
of the old campus,
whatever,
uh,

469
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:27.520
is already,
uh,
somehow encoded in that point because,

470
00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:32.650
uh,
you know,
you're taking zero times x,

471
00:32:32.651 --> 00:32:34.330
Y,
Z for every point.

472
00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:39.540
But then if you increase this so that it becomes epsilon or some nonzero number

473
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:42.710
times x,
y,
Z,

474
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:47.030
then you already get a did geometry of,
uh,

475
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.760
the old campus in everything else on the surface of the earth.

476
00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:54.940
So it is wrong to think of the Big Bang as starting at a point and expanding

477
00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:00.350
into space.
Uh,
that's kind of the impression that the word,
the Big Bang,

478
00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.880
uh,
gives you and you think naturally enough of an explosion,

479
00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:09.500
uh,
where there's something at a point explodes into empty space,

480
00:33:09.501 --> 00:33:13.010
but that's not right.
All the,
all the space,

481
00:33:13.011 --> 00:33:17.750
all the empty space is contained in that point.
It's all in there.
It's just,

482
00:33:17.751 --> 00:33:19.010
it's all multiplied by zero.

483
00:33:19.011 --> 00:33:22.340
So it all comes out to being on top of each other in the same place.

484
00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:25.433
How are we doing?

485
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:32.700
Wonderful.
Uh,
okay.
Um,

486
00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.480
that the essence of,
uh,

487
00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:39.720
the big bang of the whole idea of the big bag,

488
00:33:39.721 --> 00:33:44.550
that what is happening is that the whole coordinate system of the universe is

489
00:33:44.551 --> 00:33:49.440
multiplied by this constant.
And that constant changes in time.
It gets bigger.

490
00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.083
Uh,

491
00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:56.450
and that fact is inferred from the observations of these galaxies,

492
00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.580
uh,
that you observe galaxies and that they're moving away from us.

493
00:34:02.581 --> 00:34:04.100
But more than that,
that the,

494
00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:08.460
that there's a linear relationship between how far away from us they are and how

495
00:34:08.461 --> 00:34:13.050
fast they're moving.
That implies this kind of coordinate expansion.

496
00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:17.090
And if you run it in reverse,
it implies a,

497
00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:20.550
an origin to the universe at some specific time in the past.

498
00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:25.760
All right,
let's have questions.
I tell you what,
talk to each other,

499
00:34:25.761 --> 00:34:30.170
come up with good questions.
Uh,
and remember how I remember how we do this.

500
00:34:30.171 --> 00:34:31.970
When you,
when you come up with a question,

501
00:34:31.971 --> 00:34:35.330
can be either to explain some of this or to expand upon it.

502
00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.550
When you're ready with a question,
put your hand up.

503
00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.940
I'll answer a few of them while other people are getting their questions

504
00:34:40.941 --> 00:34:42.770
together.
And then,
uh,

505
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.400
then we'll answer as many of them as we have time for in the remainder of the

506
00:34:46.401 --> 00:34:50.270
class.
So talk to each other,
talk amongst yourselves,
come up with a question,

507
00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:54.710
any question,
all questions are good,
uh,
and see what you can do.

508
00:34:54.711 --> 00:34:57.740
I'll come around and try and answer some of these.
Yeah.

509
00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.010
So talk to each other.
By all means.
Yes.

510
00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.290
<v 4>A center of the Universe isn't there?
No.</v>

511
00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:10.490
There's gotta be a point in the universe at which like all other points,

512
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.630
all the points that are farthest away from that point.
No.
Expanding really fast,

513
00:35:14.631 --> 00:35:14.880
right?

514
00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:18.300
<v 0>No,
no.
Well,
that's true of every point of the universe.</v>

515
00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:20.250
That's true of every point in the universe.

516
00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:24.300
If you're sitting on the statue of Pearson,
everything is,

517
00:35:24.301 --> 00:35:27.660
everything is the same.
Distance is moving away from you by the same amount.

518
00:35:27.661 --> 00:35:28.680
That's true of every point.

519
00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.253
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

520
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.820
<v 0>Imagine a three dimensional thing,
expanding it.
The fourth dimension,</v>

521
00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.180
the way the surface of a sphere expands into three.

522
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:45.210
You switched from expansions,
getting close together.

523
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:49.590
Point Oh,
oh,
we'll talk about that later.

524
00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:53.140
You can imagine that gravity is going to slow the expansion down.

525
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:58.340
But at the moment,
I'm just thinking about running backwards in time.
Yeah.

526
00:35:59.750 --> 00:36:02.100
Or could,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

527
00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:06.080
<v 5>So you had like fake event horizon,</v>

528
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:09.100
so something could be like a period of removing yeah,

529
00:36:11.890 --> 00:36:15.020
that's normal.
If it hurts,
you can't pass allocation between,
right.

530
00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:17.320
But could you relay information?

531
00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.870
<v 0>Yes.
But by the time you had done that,
uh,
that is,</v>

532
00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:26.700
say the universe is expanding faster than the information would get to you.
Uh,

533
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:31.030
so you know,
by the time you've moved your information from here to here,

534
00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:34.210
the distance from here to here,
his expanded.
Uh,

535
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:36.430
and so it's not actually getting any closer.

536
00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:46.860
Okay.
Let's,
let's,
let's have,
let's have a few of these.
Yes,
go ahead.

537
00:36:48.930 --> 00:36:50.230
<v 6>First.
Essentially,</v>

538
00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:54.790
I didn't understand why it's zero times the coordinate,

539
00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:58.930
why there's a point at all and why there's just nothing.
Why there's not

540
00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:01.960
<v 0>well,
uh,
okay.
So,
uh,</v>

541
00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:05.740
if a is equal to zero here,

542
00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:11.040
then all events are at zero comma zero comma zero.

543
00:37:11.171 --> 00:37:15.250
So that point of zero comma zero comma zero is occupied.

544
00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:17.380
If you think of want to think of it that way,

545
00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:21.520
it's the point at the point in question is the one at zero zero,
zero.

546
00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:25.300
And if you have anything in here times zero,
that's where you're going to end up.

547
00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:30.250
And as you go backwards and run this scale factor down to zero,

548
00:37:30.251 --> 00:37:34.090
as you think about going back in time,
uh,
everything's going to,

549
00:37:34.091 --> 00:37:37.780
everything's going to end up,
uh,

550
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:41.680
closer and closer to zero.
And then at the moment when this equals zero,

551
00:37:41.681 --> 00:37:46.600
it's all piled on top of itself.
That makes sense.
Yeah,

552
00:37:46.601 --> 00:37:47.434
go ahead.

553
00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:49.693
<v 6>MMM,</v>

554
00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:58.860
<v 0>no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Uh,
Imagine,</v>

555
00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:07.160
oh,
in the other dementia.
Yeah,
yeah.
Okay.
In the higher dimension.

556
00:38:07.161 --> 00:38:11.090
That's true.
Well,
okay,
let me back off.
That's true.

557
00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.970
If you have a constant curvature,

558
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:18.200
you could imagine something that,
you know,
looks like this,

559
00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:21.290
that also expands in exactly the same way,
uh,

560
00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.620
and what creates the curvature of space,
time gravity.

561
00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:28.300
And so we're going to end up in a situation where,
uh,

562
00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:33.200
we're going to be able to determine what the curvature of space is by seeing how

563
00:38:33.201 --> 00:38:36.820
much mass there is.
So this actually back to part two of the course

564
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:43.480
differently.
Huh?
Would that time could move differently too?
Yup.

565
00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:50.990
<v 6>Yes.
We'll circle when he said that,
uh,</v>

566
00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:52.730
things expand into a higher dimension.

567
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:58.360
<v 0>Okay.
So imagine you're a one dimensional creature.
You can only go on a lie.
Uh,</v>

568
00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:03.330
and but your line unbeknownst to you is curved so that it ends on itself.
Uh,

569
00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:07.500
that then ext the line expands,
the circle expand.
Uh,

570
00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:08.960
and what do you think is happening?

571
00:39:08.961 --> 00:39:11.610
You think suddenly all the distances are greater,
uh,

572
00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.230
but you can't perceive what it's expanding into because that's a second

573
00:39:15.231 --> 00:39:18.710
dimension in your constrained to move on the line.
Similarly,

574
00:39:18.711 --> 00:39:22.520
if you're an aunt or something moving on the surface of the earth and you have

575
00:39:22.521 --> 00:39:25.290
no understanding that there's up and down,
uh,

576
00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:29.040
and the earth suddenly increases in size,
you have no,

577
00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:32.750
you have no perception of the dimension you're moving into.

578
00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:40.370
Well,
uh,
our perception is of a three dimensional universe.

579
00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:45.260
So if you say,
uh,
okay,
what happens when the scale factor gets bigger?

580
00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:46.783
Uh,

581
00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:50.210
you can write it down mathematically and do all these calculations in what you

582
00:39:50.211 --> 00:39:51.740
have to imagine.
Uh,

583
00:39:51.741 --> 00:39:56.580
if you want to have a conceptual understanding of this is that there's some,
uh,

584
00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:01.630
fourth spacial dimension into which this three dimensional spaces moving into,

585
00:40:02.121 --> 00:40:06.180
but we can't perceive that.
Uh,
so it's better to do it mathematically cause it,

586
00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:10.540
it's hard on the brain,
uh,
to imagine that fourth dimension.
And so there's,

587
00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:14.180
and there's basically two ways to think about this.
One is by analogy,

588
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:17.690
you think of the one dimensional creature and what it thinks about the second

589
00:40:17.691 --> 00:40:19.280
dimension or the two dimensional creature,

590
00:40:19.281 --> 00:40:20.840
what it thinks about the third dimension.

591
00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:25.070
And then you just sort of take this leap of faith into us moving into the fourth

592
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:27.260
or you have to write things down mathematically.

593
00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.470
Those are the only two options you have actually picturing this is not going to

594
00:40:30.471 --> 00:40:31.304
happen.

595
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:35.470
<v 6>Yes.
Speed up this process.</v>

596
00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:43.710
<v 0>Ah,
interesting question.
Would we,
if we cracked up this process,
some,</v>

597
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.890
would we actually,
you know,
be able to,
uh,

598
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:50.340
take out our tape measure and notice that the distance between here and

599
00:40:50.341 --> 00:40:52.410
Starbucks has increased?
No.

600
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:57.000
Here's why we are not we,

601
00:40:57.060 --> 00:41:00.150
that is to say,
you,
me,
our bodies,
whatever,
uh,

602
00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:04.650
are not participating in the expansion of the universe at the moment.
Why?

603
00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:09.120
Because the molecules in our body are being held together by other forces,

604
00:41:09.121 --> 00:41:11.070
chemical forces.
We are being held.

605
00:41:11.071 --> 00:41:14.370
The Earth has held together by gravitational forces,
uh,

606
00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:19.400
and that those forces have stopped the expansion of the universe locally,

607
00:41:20.670 --> 00:41:21.720
but not globally.

608
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:24.900
And that's why you have to go out and measure this stuff with galaxies.

609
00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:29.960
Otherwise you'd be able to,
you know,
measure it with this.
Now,

610
00:41:29.961 --> 00:41:34.520
of course,
then there's the problem.
The ruler also expand this kind of stuff.
But,

611
00:41:34.521 --> 00:41:38.750
uh,
uh,
uh,
but,
uh,
uh,
but in fact,

612
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:42.410
what happens is that locally local objects,

613
00:41:42.411 --> 00:41:45.830
by which I mean our own galaxy and anything smaller,

614
00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.580
are held together by other forces.
Picture of balloon expanding.

615
00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:51.260
So that's the two dimensional case.

616
00:41:51.261 --> 00:41:54.890
This balloon expand and put a bunch of leather patches on the balloon.

617
00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:58.910
So those leather patches don't expand.
But the distance between,

618
00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:02.060
because they're held together by something,
something else.
But the,

619
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:03.710
but the distance between them does.

620
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:05.563
<v 6>Yes.</v>

621
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:12.410
<v 0>What causes the expansion?
Oh,
that's theology.
Uh,
no,
no,</v>

622
00:42:12.411 --> 00:42:17.300
seriously.
It's an,
it's an initial condition.
Uh,
something,

623
00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.900
something at the start at t equals zero,

624
00:42:20.901 --> 00:42:25.790
where this a a is a,
uh,
where this a is zero.

625
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.050
Uh,
so you're starting with a of with this scale factor of zero,

626
00:42:30.051 --> 00:42:32.900
but the derivative isn't zero.
Uh,

627
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:36.050
it's expanding a is increasing.
Why,

628
00:42:36.051 --> 00:42:39.560
why is it increasing by the particular amount?
It is,
uh,

629
00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:44.000
you have to think of that as,
as being a parameter of the universe.
Uh,

630
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:46.790
it's one of the things about these sort of like the speed of light.

631
00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:51.630
Why is that the quantity it is or why is the gravitational constant fee the

632
00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.180
value it is,
uh,

633
00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:57.080
it's one of the parameters that governs our universe.

634
00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.610
Why those particular parameters?
Uh,
that's uh,

635
00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:06.470
not quite a science question.
Uh,
and we don't know.
Uh,
you can turn it around.

636
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:08.060
You can make the following.
Interesting point.

637
00:43:08.061 --> 00:43:11.360
If it wasn't expanding at approximately the rate it is,

638
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:16.340
we wouldn't be here to notice it because if it was expanding a whole lot slower,

639
00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:21.080
um,
then it would never have gotten big enough.

640
00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:26.000
Force four stars to condense out.
If it was expanding a whole lot faster,

641
00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:30.060
uh,
the whole,
all the atoms would be spread out so far that again,

642
00:43:30.061 --> 00:43:31.220
stars could never form.

643
00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:35.420
So you can make this interesting argument that why you don't know why it has

644
00:43:35.421 --> 00:43:36.770
this particular value.

645
00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:41.120
It's very important that it does because otherwise we wouldn't be here to

646
00:43:41.121 --> 00:43:45.320
observe it.
This is a form of argumentation called the anthropic principle.

647
00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:49.010
It is a highly debated among scientist,

648
00:43:49.011 --> 00:43:53.630
whether this is a scientific argument or not.
Uh,
but it's amusing either way.

649
00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:54.840
So yes.

650
00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:00.023
<v 6>Great.</v>

651
00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:04.620
<v 0>Well,
you go back before a and you're in trouble.
Uh,
so,</v>

652
00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:10.490
okay,
so,
so this is,
this is another one of these unquestioned,
uh,

653
00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:14.260
the,
it's usually phrased as well what happened before the big bang.
Right?

654
00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:19.270
And that's the equivalent question.
Uh,
and again,
that's a theological question.

655
00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:20.490
Uh,
uh,
your,

656
00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:24.360
it's like asking the question of what's going on inside and a veteran.

657
00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:27.010
You can write down equations,
you can talk about it,

658
00:44:27.130 --> 00:44:30.880
but it's untestable by its very nature.
Uh,
and so something,

659
00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.190
something have this by the way is why,
uh,

660
00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:38.130
the Catholics like the Big Bang theory so much,
uh,
in fact,
the,
the,
the,

661
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:41.850
um,
the,
uh,
mathematics,

662
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:46.170
the relativistic mathematics that described the big bang and the expansion of

663
00:44:46.171 --> 00:44:50.250
the universe were worked out by a man named [inaudible] who was a,

664
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:54.860
who was a Catholic priest.
It was a Jesuit.
Uh,
they love this,
uh,

665
00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:58.410
because it gives you a creation moment.
Uh,

666
00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:02.050
it kind of gives you a scientifically verify creation moment.
Uh,

667
00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:05.070
John Paul was very enthusiastic about astrophysics.

668
00:45:05.071 --> 00:45:08.790
He used to throw big conferences in the Vatican,
give speech,

669
00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:10.500
give after dinner speeches.
Uh,

670
00:45:10.501 --> 00:45:13.560
there's a thing called the Vatican astrophysical observatory.

671
00:45:13.561 --> 00:45:16.500
They have a bunch of Jesuits.
They run a telescope in Arizona.

672
00:45:16.501 --> 00:45:19.440
They do research into this.
Uh,
and so,
you know,

673
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:24.210
if you want to see science and religion converge,
uh,

674
00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.670
you want to run away from biology as fast as you can.
Uh,

675
00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:30.740
and talk to us about cosmology.
Uh,

676
00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:35.260
what I don't understand is why is why the,
the,
uh,

677
00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:39.270
sort of fundamentalist type worry so much about biology where all the science is

678
00:45:39.271 --> 00:45:43.350
dead set against them,
whereas in the case of a astrophysics,

679
00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:47.010
now of course it is possible if you take an atheistic point of view to come up

680
00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:51.970
with all kinds of clever ways to avoid this creation event.
Uh,
but again,
it,

681
00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.480
it,
it stops being science at a certain point.

682
00:45:54.481 --> 00:45:57.030
It becomes another odd kind of theology.

683
00:45:57.031 --> 00:45:59.400
And we'll talk about that perhaps a little bit.
Uh,

684
00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:04.580
but if you want a place where science turned out to be congruent to at least

685
00:46:05.611 --> 00:46:08.550
certain kinds of non fundamentalist religious beliefs,

686
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:11.730
you're way better off in astrophysics,
then you are in biology.

687
00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.310
<v 6>Yeah.
Oh,
go ahead.</v>

688
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:23.820
<v 0>No,
that's a fourth spacial dimension that I'm talking about.
In this case,</v>

689
00:46:29.310 --> 00:46:33.270
it's expanding into a dimension which,
uh,
we don't perceive,

690
00:46:33.271 --> 00:46:38.240
or at least that's one way of conceptualizing it.
Uh,
you know,
we don't get to,
uh,

691
00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:42.420
uh,
to deal with that dimension.
So it's,
again,
it's a kind of a,
it's a concept.

692
00:46:42.421 --> 00:46:46.290
It's not a,
it's not a,
it's not necessarily a physical thing.

693
00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:49.030
<v 6>Yes.
You said that.
All</v>

694
00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:56.510
right.
Just wondering,
does that mean like meaning that anything that will ever

695
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:59.090
<v 0>yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
It has to be,</v>

696
00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:02.270
think of all the points that now exist in the universe,

697
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:06.500
multiply them by zero and they're all on top of each other.

698
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:14.250
<v 6>Yes.
Um,
so if you were to go really,</v>

699
00:47:14.251 --> 00:47:17.610
really fast in a straight line,
right,
you eventually ended up,

700
00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:22.530
<v 0>ah,
so this is the question of what is the curvature of the universe?</v>

701
00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:26.850
Is it in fact like this analogy with a circle or the surf surface of this
sphere,

702
00:47:26.851 --> 00:47:29.530
if you go forever,
you come back to,
you are,

703
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:33.670
that depends on what the overall curvature of the universe turns out to be.

704
00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:38.710
That depends on how much mass it contains because mass curve space,
uh,

705
00:47:38.711 --> 00:47:42.870
and so that is,
that's a question that empirically answerable,
uh,

706
00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:47.470
we think the answer is no.
Uh,
in any case though,

707
00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:52.030
it would take you longer at the speed of light then the age of the universe to

708
00:47:52.031 --> 00:47:53.470
accomplish it.
So,
uh,

709
00:47:53.471 --> 00:47:56.420
so even if it were a positively curved in this sense that it,

710
00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.010
the rejoined itself,
you wouldn't actually be able to make that voyage?

711
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:04.863
<v 6>No.</v>

712
00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:11.070
<v 0>Well,
you would,
you might eventually,</v>

713
00:48:11.071 --> 00:48:15.390
unless the universe is expanding faster than you can move,
right.
Uh,

714
00:48:15.391 --> 00:48:17.790
this is this question.
This goes back to the question of camp.

715
00:48:17.791 --> 00:48:21.210
Parts of it expand faster than the speed of light and he answers his guests.

716
00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:25.230
So yeah,
you take off on this voyage to the back of your own head,
you know,

717
00:48:25.231 --> 00:48:27.840
going in that direction,
you're going to end up here,
uh,

718
00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.080
except the universe is expanding faster than you can go.

719
00:48:31.650 --> 00:48:35.370
And so you don't necessarily end up back there.
Yes.

720
00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:41.940
Oh.
Oh.
One of the things that we haven't talked about is,

721
00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:45.030
is the expansion rate constant.

722
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:50.130
Might it be fit?
The universe is expanding,
but perhaps slowing down,

723
00:48:50.131 --> 00:48:54.530
why would it slow down?
It's full of mass.
Gravity slows things down.
Uh,

724
00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:58.440
and so in principle,
if you've got enough mass,
the universe will stop,

725
00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:03.240
turn around and fall backwards,
uh,
and well,
and you can compute from,

726
00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:08.700
we will compute next period how fast you have to go to make that happen.

727
00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:12.210
Or contrary how dense the universe has to be to stop it.
Uh,

728
00:49:12.211 --> 00:49:17.060
and so what you expect is the universe is slowing down because you know,

729
00:49:17.070 --> 00:49:19.930
you don't know how much it slowing down,
whether it will stop the expansion up,

730
00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:21.510
but you expect it to be slowing down.

731
00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:25.620
The punchline of this whole part of the course in order to anticipate where

732
00:49:25.621 --> 00:49:27.660
we're going is that in fact,

733
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:31.650
we can measure the change in the expansion rate and it's speeding up,

734
00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:33.540
not slowing down.

735
00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:37.860
This is very disturbing because it means there's some kind of pervasive cosmic

736
00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:42.930
antigravity,
uh,
which we called dark energy because we don't know what it is.
Uh,

737
00:49:42.931 --> 00:49:47.100
and that's basically the punchline of this whole section of the course.
Uh,
but,

738
00:49:47.101 --> 00:49:50.040
uh,
uh,
but you could imagine that the,

739
00:49:50.041 --> 00:49:54.700
that there is a change in the expansion rate,
either positive or negative,
uh,

740
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:57.720
and that therefore various different outcomes are possible.

741
00:49:58.410 --> 00:49:59.243
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

742
00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:07.710
The Big Bang and sort of expanded the whole geometry of the universe where a big

743
00:50:07.711 --> 00:50:10.500
crunch like gravity would only call up the optics.

744
00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:15.520
<v 0>No,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It turns out,
uh,
it,
you might imagine that,</v>

745
00:50:15.521 --> 00:50:19.930
but you'd be wrong.
It turns out that the,
uh,
this scale factor,

746
00:50:19.931 --> 00:50:23.770
you can write down a differential equation for the scale factor and that it's

747
00:50:23.771 --> 00:50:27.740
the scale factor that stops,
turns around and comes back.
Uh,

748
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.200
now it is the case that when it's going out,

749
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:35.270
the particular objects the universe contains,
are different because,

750
00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:37.190
uh,
because of the peculiar emotions,

751
00:50:37.191 --> 00:50:42.191
it starts out much more evenly spread and then gradually stuff accumulates due

752
00:50:42.201 --> 00:50:44.360
to gravity.
And you get,
when you're coming back,

753
00:50:44.361 --> 00:50:47.870
you get a lot of individual points rather than a smooth distribution of matter.

754
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:49.840
But that has to do with peculiar emotions,

755
00:50:49.850 --> 00:50:54.670
not the overall motion of the universe.
One more.
And then we got to,
uh,
uh,

756
00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:56.720
continue this next time.
Yes,
go ahead.

757
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:03.750
<v 6>Minus a negative.</v>

758
00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:10.180
<v 0>Right?
So before the big bank,
can you put a negative number in to that?</v>

759
00:51:10.181 --> 00:51:10.750
A,

760
00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:15.520
this gets you into exactly the same kind of mathematical difficulty as moving

761
00:51:15.521 --> 00:51:17.050
inside an event horizon.

762
00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:20.650
All you can actually write down a metric for the whole universe,
uh,

763
00:51:20.651 --> 00:51:25.651
and you change all the signs when that happens and you get into a very similar

764
00:51:26.111 --> 00:51:31.000
kind of problem.
So mathematically you could compute a bunch of stuff.

765
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:36.230
Uh,
the physical meaning of that is not if,
first of all,

766
00:51:36.231 --> 00:51:38.140
if first of all,
the,
the,
uh,

767
00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:42.070
the fact that that mathematics actually works in the real world is impossible to

768
00:51:42.071 --> 00:51:47.020
determine.
And the physical nature of that up consequences of that,
uh,
uh,

769
00:51:47.021 --> 00:51:50.080
are,
uh,
questionable.
All right.
Stop.
