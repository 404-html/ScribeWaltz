1
00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:00.791
Okay.

2
00:00:00.791 --> 00:00:05.791
This is the last class of the section on black holes and relativity,

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.670
I should say.
This particular section has of the course has gone into direction.

4
00:00:12.671 --> 00:00:16.100
I didn't quite expect.
We've done a little more,
uh,
uh,

5
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.800
gone a little more deeply into the theory.
Uh,

6
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.640
we haven't done quite as much on a actual observed objects.
Uh,

7
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.130
that's not such a terrible thing.
I'm quite happy with that.

8
00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:31.990
I just want to point out a couple of things that were on the syllabus that we

9
00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:34.360
didn't get to because they're very interesting things.

10
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.260
You can look them up on the little black hole website and find out all sorts of

11
00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:43.120
things about them.
Uh,
and one of them is,
uh,
there exist,

12
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.080
uh,

13
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.580
a category of a what's called supermassive black holes.

14
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.910
Uh,
I mentioned the black holes that are,
uh,

15
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.850
that come from stars and I'll talk about that much more today,

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.090
but I don't think I'm going to have a chance to talk about the supermassive

17
00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:01.924
black holes.

18
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.930
These are black holes that live in the centers of galaxies and can have masses,

19
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.450
uh,
of hundreds of thousands,
millions,

20
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.370
sometimes even billions of times the mass of the sun.
So very massive,

21
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.440
<v 1>uh,
black holes,</v>

22
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.410
uh,
in

23
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.390
<v 0>these centers of galaxies,
including our own galaxy,
by the way.</v>

24
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.310
<v 1>Uh,
and,</v>

25
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.060
<v 0>uh,
it is gas falling into these black holes.
The powers,</v>

26
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.740
the quasars,
we saw a gravitational,
the lensed are the other day.

27
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.810
These are very,
uh,
very powerful sergeant sources of emission,
uh,

28
00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:48.880
that are located in the centers of galaxies,

29
00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:52.590
sometimes called active Galactic Nuclei and,
uh,

30
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.670
they're caused by these very massive black holes.

31
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:59.090
So that's one thing we're probably not going to get to.
Another thing is,
uh,

32
00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:03.790
I had it originally intended to talk a little bit about gravitational waves.

33
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:05.640
<v 1>Uh,</v>

34
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.880
<v 0>we,
uh,
I mentioned that in the context of the fact that,
uh,</v>

35
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.200
the mission of these waves causes,
uh,

36
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.800
causes the orbital periods of things like the binary Poles are,

37
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:21.630
and indeed all orbits in principle to gradually become shorter.

38
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:25.020
The orbital period,
the semi major axes gradually become shorter.

39
00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:28.050
But there's also the hope it hasn't yet been done,

40
00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.300
that you could detect these waves directly,

41
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:33.570
that you can make a kind of telescope that would actually observe gravitational

42
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:38.130
waves.
This is now in progress.
It hasn't yet succeeded.
Uh,

43
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.810
so these can in principle be directly detected,

44
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.230
<v 1>uh,
that hasn't been done
yet,</v>

45
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.270
but

46
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.140
<v 0>it will be soon.</v>

47
00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:59.141
I think there's something called the laser interferometer for,

48
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.070
um,
her gravity observatory.

49
00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.720
<v 2>[inaudible] Lyco,
uh,
which is basically a,</v>

50
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.990
a kilometer long hunk of metal,
uh,

51
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.820
the length of which can be measured to some fraction of the size of an atom.

52
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.960
And when a gravitational wave rolls over this,
uh,

53
00:03:26.961 --> 00:03:30.020
what you expect to happen is you should see the thing getting slightly longer

54
00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:32.120
and slightly shorter as the wave goes over it.

55
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.330
The problem with this is that the effect of passing trucks on highways 10 miles

56
00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:42.200
away is many,
many times greater than the effect of passing gravitational waves.

57
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.710
Uh,
and so what they've done is they built two of these things once and one in

58
00:03:45.711 --> 00:03:47.840
Washington state and one in Louisiana.

59
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.990
And the plan is to operate them simultaneously so that you can see,
uh,

60
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.060
things that happen in both places might be attributable to some cosmic source.

61
00:03:58.311 --> 00:04:01.070
There's a whole bunch of other stuff,
uh,
to talk about this.

62
00:04:01.071 --> 00:04:05.440
It's a fabulous experiment.
Uh,
and,
uh,
as I say,
uh,

63
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.450
we probably won't get a chance to talk about it in detail,

64
00:04:08.451 --> 00:04:12.530
but you can go to the black hole website and that has links to all sorts of

65
00:04:12.531 --> 00:04:15.470
other things.
And you may,
uh,
if they succeed in this,

66
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.900
somebody is winning the Nobel prize.
Uh,

67
00:04:17.901 --> 00:04:22.400
and so you may find out about it by reading in the paper five years from now or

68
00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:23.234
so.
Yes.

69
00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.303
<v 0>Hmm.</v>

70
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.120
<v 2>Have we ever directly observed a supermassive black hole?</v>

71
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.930
It depends what you mean by directly observe a,
by definition,

72
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:37.610
you can't directly observe a black hole.
Uh,

73
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.650
we infer their presence in almost exactly the same way that we infer the

74
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:45.720
presence of the small black holes,
which I'm going to talk about now,
uh,

75
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.960
namely by watching things orbit around them.
And so basically what you,

76
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:54.910
for example,
in the center of our own galaxy,
uh,
there's,
uh,
a one mil,

77
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.100
uh,
I think 1 million,
3 million,

78
00:04:57.101 --> 00:05:02.101
I don't remember some number of millions of solar masses of stuff right at the

79
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:05.410
center of the galaxy.
You can tell that because of the orbits of the,

80
00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:09.310
of the stars closest in,
uh,
which emits no radiation at all.

81
00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.820
And so there's something down there that's extremely massive and totally dark.

82
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.970
And we know that that's true by watching the orbits of nearby stars.

83
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.580
And we can actually carry out this same kind of observation,
uh,

84
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.690
in the centers of other galaxies.
And as far as we can tell,

85
00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.860
there's one of these supermassive black holes in the middle of every significant

86
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:31.060
galaxy.
Uh,

87
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:35.830
and that's actually been one of the achievements of this kind of astronomy over

88
00:05:35.831 --> 00:05:37.210
the past dozen years or so,

89
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:41.020
is to demonstrate in each case for which we have enough data.

90
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.860
There seems to be,
uh,
an extremely massive invisible,

91
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:46.570
something down in the middle of these states.

92
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.080
And there are other reasons to think that they're actually black holes rather

93
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:55.060
than,
you know,
a 100 million neutron stars or something silly like that.
Uh,

94
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.010
and uh,
and so we're pretty convinced by now that

95
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.150
<v 0>these things live in the centers of galaxies and were quite convinced that</v>

96
00:06:02.151 --> 00:06:03.890
there's one in the middle of our own galaxy.

97
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.993
<v 1>Yes.</v>

98
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:08.790
<v 0>Why are they in the middle of all the galaxies?</v>

99
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.860
This is actually a little bit of a mystery.

100
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.750
How these things get made is not clear.
It's pretty clear how the,

101
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.700
uh,
uh,
stellar mass,
the 10 solar mass ones get made.

102
00:06:20.701 --> 00:06:24.870
It's the collapse of a single star.
Uh,
how,
uh,

103
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.270
how these things build up,
how they grow,

104
00:06:27.271 --> 00:06:30.270
where they came from in the first place is a little less clear than it is for

105
00:06:30.271 --> 00:06:31.820
the stellar mass things.
Uh,

106
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.830
there is recent work which suggests that the very first generation of stars was

107
00:06:37.051 --> 00:06:41.570
quite massive.
Thousands of solar masses rather than an in,
uh,

108
00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.830
stars of one solar mass or something like that.

109
00:06:43.831 --> 00:06:48.450
And it maybe this first generation of stars collapsed down at the thousand mass

110
00:06:48.451 --> 00:06:52.170
black holes and then a whole bunch of them ran into each other and fell into the

111
00:06:52.171 --> 00:06:53.370
centers of galaxies.

112
00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.570
But I would have to say that that isn't entirely clear where these super massive

113
00:06:57.571 --> 00:07:02.370
things come from in contrast to the situation with uh,
uh,

114
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.060
uh,
10 solar mass black holes where we have,
where we have,

115
00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.800
if not a detailed theory,
at least a good handle on,
uh,
the broad,

116
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.900
uh,
story of where they come from.

117
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:15.063
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

118
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.490
<v 0>Okay.
So that's what we're not going to talk about.</v>

119
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.630
So now let me talk about what we are going to talk about it.
Uh,

120
00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:31.380
sort of a Meta lecture I guess.
Uh,
let's see.
Um,

121
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.770
what we,
last time I talked about the binary pulse are,

122
00:07:34.771 --> 00:07:37.100
and that was an example of,
uh,

123
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.740
a very detailed test of post Newtonian relativity.

124
00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:44.940
And what I want to talk about now is strong field relativity,

125
00:07:44.941 --> 00:07:49.660
relativistic effects,
uh,
that,
um,

126
00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:54.270
uh,
that have nothing to do with Newtonian theory that are totally different and

127
00:07:54.271 --> 00:07:59.271
then happen when you're a really very close to an event horizon or in some other

128
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:03.730
kind of drastic situation.
So here's the plan.
Uh,

129
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.340
here's how you would,

130
00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:09.690
how would you go about testing the predictions of strong field relativity?
Well,

131
00:08:09.691 --> 00:08:12.060
the first thing you'd want to do is find a black hole.

132
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:13.093
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

133
00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:16.280
<v 0>Not just talk about them,
but you know,</v>

134
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.150
be able to point in the sky to where one of them is

135
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:23.620
and then you'd like to study it and find out,

136
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.900
uh,
whether this thing you think is a black hole,
uh,

137
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:34.990
actually behaves as general relativity would predict for such an object.

138
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:39.110
And you in particular,

139
00:08:39.111 --> 00:08:43.370
there's this very strong prediction from relativity and it's such a thing would

140
00:08:43.371 --> 00:08:47.390
not have a surface that,
uh,
it would have a

141
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:48.310
<v 1>okay,</v>

142
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.900
<v 0>an event horizon</v>

143
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.400
down which things would disappear.
Uh,
not

144
00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.500
<v 2>a surface of any kind.</v>

145
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:05.850
And so what I want to talk about today is,
uh,
both of these steps.

146
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.400
Um,
and the story starts,
uh,

147
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:15.180
in the late 1960s,
in the middle of the 1960s,
uh,
when,
uh,

148
00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:20.240
the first x-ray astronomical observations of x rays were made.

149
00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:23.700
So it starts with x ray astronomy.
Um,

150
00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.710
one of the features of astronomy for the past half century or so is that,

151
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.210
uh,
you know,
uh,
in,
in the 1950s,
by the 1950s,

152
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.150
there had been a lot of astronomy,
but it all,

153
00:09:35.151 --> 00:09:39.810
all been done in optical light with optical telescopes.
Uh,
and,

154
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.700
uh,
the story of astronomy for the past 50 years has basically been one after

155
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:49.040
another of different kinds of electromagnetic radiation,
not optic,

156
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.050
other than optical light have gradually been opened up.

157
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:55.110
The first of these was radio astronomy.
And so all of a sudden,

158
00:09:55.111 --> 00:09:58.830
people point radio telescopes at the sky and they find out all sorts of things.

159
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.940
One of which,
for example,
was pulsars,
which we talked about the last time.
Uh,

160
00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:08.010
the next,
uh,
part of the electromagnetic spectrum that was opened up was x-rays.

161
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:11.070
Now x rays,
there's a problem with doing x ray observations,

162
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:13.350
which is that x rays don't make it through the atmosphere.

163
00:10:13.351 --> 00:10:17.460
The atmosphere is completely opaque.
Tax rates,
this is a good thing.
Uh,

164
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.920
the sun emits x-rays.
Uh,

165
00:10:19.921 --> 00:10:24.240
and you would not want to be in a place in which you didn't have an atmosphere

166
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:29.130
to absorb the x rays on the way to yourself.
You'd get skin cancer immediately.

167
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:32.400
Uh,
and so the fact that the,
um,
uh,

168
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:36.060
the atmosphere absorb x rays is good for everybody except for the x ray

169
00:10:36.061 --> 00:10:39.690
astronomers because it makes it difficult to do these kinds of observations.

170
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.770
So this only got started at the point where,
uh,

171
00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:48.360
you could put satellites into orbit outside the atmosphere and equip them with x

172
00:10:48.361 --> 00:10:51.540
ray detectors.
Basically,
Geiger counters.
Uh,
I,
you know,

173
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:56.070
there's a lot of talk these days about going back to the moon.
Uh,
and,
uh,

174
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.670
one of the very few scientific exam,
uh,

175
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:04.680
advantages of a moon colony is that you could do ground based ex-ray astronomy.

176
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.870
Uh,
and so,
you know,
you picture a hobbyist in his backyard,
you know,

177
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:13.290
where that kind of Geiger counter in a coffee can or something going outside and

178
00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:17.910
observing x rays from the sky.
Uh,
and I think that would be a great thing.
Uh,
but,

179
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.340
uh,
I digress.
Uh,
let's see.
X Ray Astronomy.
Yes.
In the 1960s.

180
00:11:22.341 --> 00:11:26.010
So they send up Geiger counters on satellites and,

181
00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:30.510
and increasingly sophisticated a x ray telescopes over the years.

182
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.960
And they discovered something that they didn't expect.
Namely,

183
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.820
so this is now in the 1960s.

184
00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:39.390
Also around the same time the pulsars were discovered.
Uh,

185
00:11:39.391 --> 00:11:44.391
they also discover a very strong sources of x rays,

186
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.870
x rays,
sources,
and these,

187
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.440
there's a lot of energy coming out of,
out of these things.
Thousands of times,

188
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:54.460
uh,

189
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.580
<v 0>even hundreds of thousands of times.
Uh,</v>

190
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.670
the radiation that the sun emits.

191
00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.170
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

192
00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:09.070
<v 0>Radiation and,
and from these ex-ray sources,
essentially all of it in x rays.</v>

193
00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:11.280
<v 1>Okay.</v>

194
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:15.320
<v 0>There's a small amount of optical radio,
other kinds of radiation.</v>

195
00:12:15.321 --> 00:12:19.190
But basically these are ex-ray emitting stars.
There's stars that he met,

196
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:23.540
huge amounts of extra and luminosity and not a whole lot else.
Uh,

197
00:12:23.541 --> 00:12:27.650
and they're very,
very,
very powerful.
Uh,
and,

198
00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.750
uh,
so people wondered what these words,
these were unexpected.

199
00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:35.720
Nobody had predicted that this would,
uh,
be there.

200
00:12:35.721 --> 00:12:39.290
And as they started to think about what these things might be,
they realize,
well,

201
00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:42.530
what is an x Ray?
And X ray is a very energetic photon,

202
00:12:42.531 --> 00:12:45.080
very short wavelength light.
Therefore,

203
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.930
each one of the photons carries a big punch.

204
00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:51.790
So these are energetic photons,
uh,

205
00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:57.970
and the more energetic the radiation that is emitted in,
in,

206
00:12:57.971 --> 00:13:00.920
in sort of general terms,
the hotter at the material,

207
00:13:00.921 --> 00:13:03.540
but he admits it has to be just in order to,
to,

208
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:05.780
to crank up the energy a you need.

209
00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:10.530
That's why a ordinary objects at room temperature glow in the infrared.
Uh,

210
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.960
if you heat them up,
they start at two thousands of degrees,

211
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.850
things start to glow in the red.
If you heat them up still further,

212
00:13:16.851 --> 00:13:18.980
you get white light,
blue light.
Uh,

213
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.620
if you crank things up to hundreds of thousands of degrees,

214
00:13:21.621 --> 00:13:24.980
you start to get ultraviolet radiation.
And it turns out,
uh,

215
00:13:24.981 --> 00:13:29.330
in order to get x rays,
you need to have things,
uh,
that,
uh,

216
00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:32.760
have been heated up to millions of degrees.
So,
uh,

217
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:38.050
energetic photons would come from a US require high temperature,

218
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.000
uh,
by which I mean,
you know,
a million degrees or so.

219
00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:49.520
Uh,
by contrast,
the sun and other stars and other similar stars,

220
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.760
uh,
has a surface temperature,
uh,

221
00:13:53.761 --> 00:13:55.880
of about 6,000 degrees.

222
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.380
That's hot enough to glow in the optical,
uh,

223
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.920
but not hot enough to generate large numbers of x rays.

224
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:10.030
And you can also go further and say,
uh,

225
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:15.420
you can figure out how much radiation ought to come from a given volume of

226
00:14:16.631 --> 00:14:20.560
million degree,
whatever it is,
uh,
and you discover,

227
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.820
so combining,
uh,

228
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:30.100
the temperature and the,
uh,
luminosity,

229
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:33.940
uh,
there's a little formula which I wrote won't write down,

230
00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:38.110
which tells you how big the thing has to be in order to emit that much
radiation.

231
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:42.730
If the sun were five times bigger,
where'd he meet?
Five squared?
More,

232
00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:47.190
uh,
more radiation.
And it turns out that if you combine this stuff,
uh,

233
00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.250
the emitting region is small.
Yeah,

234
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.470
much smaller than an ordinary star.

235
00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:07.710
There's another argument,
completely different argument that,
that,
uh,

236
00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.170
whatever is emitting these ex,
uh,
these x rays has to be small,

237
00:15:11.171 --> 00:15:15.040
which is the following.
Uh,
the brightness of these things varies.

238
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.810
So also,
here's the second argument.

239
00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.230
Brightness varies and it varies quickly,

240
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:28.860
uh,
hundreds of times this second hundreds,

241
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.730
uh,
so on timescales of,
you know,
one,
100th of a second,

242
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.510
the brightness of these things can vary by a factor of two or more.

243
00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:45.890
Now that immediately tells you that the size of the region that is emitting the

244
00:15:45.991 --> 00:15:50.940
radiation has to be smaller than one 100th of a light.

245
00:15:50.941 --> 00:15:53.400
Second.
Because imagine here's the thing,

246
00:15:53.401 --> 00:15:57.330
the team meeting radiation and a,
so it's got,
you know,

247
00:15:57.331 --> 00:16:01.140
photons coming off in all directions and you're kind of over here watching the

248
00:16:01.141 --> 00:16:05.370
thing.
Uh,
if it's suddenly changes brightness,
uh,

249
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:10.430
you'll see the brightness change from the front part of the object before you

250
00:16:10.891 --> 00:16:14.070
see the brightness change from this part of the object.

251
00:16:14.071 --> 00:16:18.450
Because this part of the object has less of a distance to travel to get to you.

252
00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:23.490
And so the amount of time it takes light to get from one side of this object to

253
00:16:23.491 --> 00:16:28.491
the other is a kind of a minimum amount of time that you would expect to be able

254
00:16:29.461 --> 00:16:32.160
to see a change in the brightness.
Now you can ask,

255
00:16:32.161 --> 00:16:34.980
what if just this little piece gets brighter?

256
00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.730
Well then that little piece,
uh,

257
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.710
had better be emitting essentially all of the radiation.
You see,
uh,

258
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:47.790
uh,
uh,
when it,
all of the increased brightness of the radiation that you see.

259
00:16:47.791 --> 00:16:50.550
And so then you just apply this same argument to that little piece.

260
00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:55.910
And so the size of this has to be less than 0.01 of a light second.

261
00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.360
Now light is three times 10 to the eight meters per second.

262
00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:07.800
So,
uh,

263
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:12.920
the size of these things has to be less than three times 10 to the six meters.

264
00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:19.380
Uh,
that's less than what,
3000 kilometers.

265
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.360
This is something that's,
so all this radiation thousands of times,
uh,

266
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:30.210
the radiation,
uh,
uh,
that you see from the sun,

267
00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.660
all of it in x rays has to becoming from something that's substantially smaller

268
00:17:33.661 --> 00:17:37.250
than the earth.
And in fact,
some of these things a very on timescales,

269
00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:41.310
even smaller than that.
So lots of energy,

270
00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:45.510
very small object,
this point you again towards neutron stars,

271
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.040
uh,

272
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:52.040
because they can pack a punch in a relatively small volume.

273
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:56.430
And as,
uh,
these objects were studied more and more,

274
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.870
um,
a picture came,

275
00:18:00.871 --> 00:18:03.120
a came up of what they actually were.

276
00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:06.840
And these are things that are called ex-ray binary stars,

277
00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:11.970
binary meaning a double star,
two stars in orbit around one another.

278
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:16.830
And the idea here is that one of these stars is a kind of ordinary star.

279
00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:21.330
Like the sun got a slightly weird shape,
which I'll explain in a minute.
Uh,

280
00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:24.210
so this is some kind of relatively ordinary star.

281
00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:26.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

282
00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:30.910
<v 0>And the other star in the system that it's orbiting around is,</v>

283
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.900
uh,
well the generic term is compact object.

284
00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:39.623
<v 1>MMM.</v>

285
00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:42.040
<v 0>An example of which would be a neutron star</v>

286
00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.120
or potentially a black hole.
Uh,

287
00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:52.440
and the deal is that these guys are orbiting so close to each other that if you

288
00:18:52.441 --> 00:18:56.040
look at the gravitational force on a,

289
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.100
an atom of gas at this point of the star,
oh,

290
00:18:59.101 --> 00:19:03.600
I should say the reason that star is this weird shape is because of huge,

291
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.810
is his basic.
This is basically a tide.
This,
uh,

292
00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.260
pulls one part of the star towards it,
uh,

293
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.280
and that distorts the ordinarily spherical shape.
And so this is,

294
00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.080
you get this kind of teardrop thing,

295
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:19.740
and if you analyze the gravitational forces on an atom of gas here,

296
00:19:19.890 --> 00:19:24.380
it's pulled in two directions.
It's pulled downward by its build towards a,

297
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.310
at the ordinary star,
by the gravity of the ordinary star,

298
00:19:27.311 --> 00:19:31.350
but it's also pulled in the other direction by the gravitational force of this

299
00:19:31.351 --> 00:19:34.650
other thing and whatever it is.

300
00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:38.490
And at this sort of a teardrop,

301
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.960
a place here,
this,
this peak here,
uh,
the gravity

302
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:44.640
<v 1>okay,</v>

303
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.000
<v 0>uh,</v>

304
00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
toward the Compact object is greater.

305
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:58.070
And that means that the surface of this particular point on the surface of the

306
00:19:58.741 --> 00:20:00.150
ordinary star,
in fact,

307
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:04.260
that material is pulled off the star and pulled onto the compact objects.

308
00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:05.040
It kind of,

309
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.510
what happens is it kind of goes into orbit and it ends up orbiting around the

310
00:20:09.511 --> 00:20:11.910
Compact object.
So you have a gas stream

311
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:18.870
and all this stuff ends up in a big disc of material here called an accretion

312
00:20:20.591 --> 00:20:21.424
disk.

313
00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.660
And so basically the gas goes into orbit around to the Compact object.

314
00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:33.620
Now you know something about orbits.
So these are perfectly ordinary.

315
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:38.390
Each atom has its own little orbit.
Uh,
the orbits are perfectly ordinary orbits,

316
00:20:38.391 --> 00:20:41.060
which can be described by the usual set of equations.

317
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.400
And one thing you know about that is that the inner,
uh,

318
00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:50.440
or bit go faster than the outer orbits.

319
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:58.650
And so if you imagine two pieces of gas sort of right next to each other,

320
00:20:58.651 --> 00:21:02.280
one inside the other,
inside,
one has to go faster.

321
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:07.390
And so they rub against each other the different parts of the gas.
So,
uh,

322
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:10.110
this gas generates friction

323
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:17.690
and friction does two things.
First,
uh,
it heats the stuff up.

324
00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:20.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

325
00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.350
<v 0>And the,
and where does the energy for that?
He'd come from?</v>

326
00:21:23.351 --> 00:21:26.320
It extract energy from the orbit.

327
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

328
00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:35.160
<v 0>And that in turn leads to the gas spiraling in.</v>

329
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:41.640
So the gas in this disk gradually spirals in as it does.

330
00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.960
It emits a lot of,
it creates a lot of heat,
generates a lot of radiation.

331
00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:51.170
And what was demonstrated in the early 1970s is that the inner parts of such an

332
00:21:51.241 --> 00:21:54.660
accretion disk can be heated up to millions of degrees,

333
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.900
which is exactly what you want to be able to explain the x rays.

334
00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:01.020
So inner accretion disk,

335
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:04.883
<v 1>okay.</v>

336
00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:08.480
<v 0>Uh,
goes up to millions of degrees</v>

337
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:14.340
and that's where all these x rays are coming from.

338
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:22.063
Okay.

339
00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:25.433
<v 1>Okay.</v>

340
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:29.840
<v 0>So that's what these,
uh,
x ray sources are supposed,
uh,</v>

341
00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:34.610
in principle to be a,
and there's now by now a lot of,
uh,
uh,

342
00:22:34.810 --> 00:22:39.810
a lot of evidence that this general picture is basically true questions.

343
00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:41.423
Yes.

344
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.930
The accretion discs,
yes,
absolutely.

345
00:22:52.931 --> 00:22:55.390
These are also observed around supermassive black holes.

346
00:22:55.810 --> 00:22:58.000
That's where the light from quasars comes from,

347
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:02.560
from accretion discs around the supermassive black holes.
They have it too.
Again,

348
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.640
the question of where that gas comes from is a little less clear than it is in

349
00:23:06.641 --> 00:23:10.210
the case of the x Ray binders.
But yes,
this is why,
uh,

350
00:23:10.211 --> 00:23:13.390
so there's two ways you know that the supermassive black holes exist.

351
00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:17.680
One is from the orbits of stuff around them and the other is from the emission

352
00:23:17.681 --> 00:23:20.440
from the accretion disk,
but there isn't always gas.

353
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.650
The one in the center of our galaxy,
there is no accretion disk.

354
00:23:23.651 --> 00:23:24.880
And so we don't see it at all.

355
00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.760
And so in some cases they're creating gas in other cases,

356
00:23:27.761 --> 00:23:32.080
not presumably that's also true of black holes and binary star systems that

357
00:23:32.081 --> 00:23:35.920
there are some of them that aren't close enough to their companion to pull mass

358
00:23:35.921 --> 00:23:40.780
off and you know,
uh,
and we don't see them as bright x rays sources

359
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:49.610
<v 1>army are not getting,
sorry.
Does that mean,</v>

360
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.640
does that necessarily mean that the nearby objects are not getting pulled apart

361
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:53.520
by the black hole?

362
00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.650
<v 0>The nearby objects are not getting pulled apart?
Well,
the uh,
uh,</v>

363
00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:02.210
the companion star is gradually being stripped of all its gas by the black hole

364
00:24:02.211 --> 00:24:04.370
in this case.
But if it were a little further away,

365
00:24:04.371 --> 00:24:08.450
it would be a perfectly stable orbit.
Yeah.
Other questions?
Yes.

366
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:12.703
<v 1>Oh,</v>

367
00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.560
<v 0>this is smaller.
That's bigger.</v>

368
00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.780
<v 1>Yes.
If you're a contract out there,
just a neutron star,</v>

369
00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.740
could it also be a full,
sorry.

370
00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:29.010
<v 0>Uh,
in principle it could,</v>

371
00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:33.540
in practice it turns out that all that gas swirling around does bad things to

372
00:24:33.541 --> 00:24:35.880
the magnetic field and to the radio emission.

373
00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.510
So in practice they tend not to be pulsars,
but in principle they could be

374
00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:43.190
<v 1>pull,
start by definition,</v>

375
00:24:43.191 --> 00:24:47.040
like one desk oriented in such a way that we can see it.
The CW,

376
00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:51.730
<v 0>well,
I mean it depends on exactly how you define it,
but a pulse are,</v>

377
00:24:51.731 --> 00:24:56.731
is something that ha that emit radio from an off axis magnetic field.

378
00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:02.160
Presumably if it doesn't happen to cross us,
we wouldn't know it's a pulse are,

379
00:25:02.161 --> 00:25:03.810
but somebody else in the galaxy mine.

380
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.130
<v 1>Other questions at this point?</v>

381
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:11.170
<v 0>All right.</v>

382
00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:16.030
So having found a bunch of these x Ray Binary's,

383
00:25:16.031 --> 00:25:19.180
the question is,
can you tell whether they're black holes or not?

384
00:25:19.181 --> 00:25:24.181
And now let me remind you that the mass of a neutron star has to be less than

385
00:25:24.581 --> 00:25:26.590
three times the mass of the sun.

386
00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:32.190
So the plan is you observe the orbit of the companion,

387
00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:39.430
uh,
and determine,

388
00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:40.750
<v 1>okay,</v>

389
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:44.240
<v 0>the mass of the compact objects.</v>

390
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:48.020
<v 1>Okay.</v>

391
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:52.040
<v 0>And there's a,
uh,
there's a derivation you can do,</v>

392
00:25:52.041 --> 00:25:56.060
which I won't show you,
but again,
you can look up on the,
uh,
uh,

393
00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:00.770
on the black hole website,
which shows,
uh,
remember what,
what we're doing here.

394
00:26:00.771 --> 00:26:05.330
Let's observe the radial velocity of the companion versus time goes up,

395
00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.410
goes down,
and you determine two things from this,

396
00:26:09.411 --> 00:26:13.490
the orbital period and the amplitude of this sine curve,

397
00:26:13.491 --> 00:26:17.880
which I'm going to call k.
And it turns out you can prove,
uh,

398
00:26:17.881 --> 00:26:22.160
the following a relationship.
This is actually easy to prove,
but it takes,

399
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:26.270
it takes three pages to do it.
So I won't,
uh,

400
00:26:26.271 --> 00:26:31.271
I won't go through the exercise that PK cubed over two Pi g,

401
00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:36.260
uh,
is equal to the mass of the Compact object.

402
00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:40.890
The mass of the thing.
You don't see times sign cubed.
I,

403
00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:45.900
I'll explain that in a second times plus the mass of the object that you either

404
00:26:47.651 --> 00:26:51.540
they choose the ordinary star divided by the mass of the Compact object.

405
00:26:51.541 --> 00:26:56.190
And this is squared.
So now why would you do this?

406
00:26:56.191 --> 00:26:59.160
This is,
so this is a little calculation.
You start with Kepler's laws.

407
00:26:59.161 --> 00:27:01.860
You do three pages of Algebra,
you come out with this,
uh,

408
00:27:01.861 --> 00:27:04.500
it's written down on the class of server.
Why would you do that?

409
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.920
Why would you express it in this particular form?
Here's the deal.

410
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.870
This is called the mass function.
Uh,
so called,

411
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.440
uh,
and uh,
it is,

412
00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:20.600
can be observed from the velocity curve only.

413
00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:27.250
Yes.
The whole term.
Yes.
Uh,

414
00:27:27.251 --> 00:27:30.220
only that's called the mass function.
Uh,

415
00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:32.290
and the term on the right here,

416
00:27:32.291 --> 00:27:37.291
it's very interesting because it's the mass of the object.

417
00:27:37.421 --> 00:27:40.400
You don't see
massive,

418
00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:45.410
the Compact object times something that is less than one sign of any angle.

419
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.730
Oh,
I should take the I here.

420
00:27:47.731 --> 00:27:51.530
This is the inclination of the object to the line of sight.
Uh,

421
00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:56.490
if it's it coming exactly toward towards you and away from Ui is 90 degrees.

422
00:27:56.491 --> 00:27:59.400
If it's going around this way,
it's zero.

423
00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.730
That has to be in there because you're observing radial velocity.

424
00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:08.090
But it doesn't matter what this is a sign of anything is one or less signed

425
00:28:09.121 --> 00:28:13.950
cube,
Dev,
anything is one or less.
So this term up here has to be less than one.

426
00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:19.320
Uh,
this term of the bottom,
uh,
has to be greater than one.

427
00:28:19.321 --> 00:28:22.590
It's one plus something squared.
So,
uh,

428
00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.350
on the bottom you have a term that's greater than one.

429
00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.380
That means that this quantity,

430
00:28:28.381 --> 00:28:33.381
which you can easily observe is less than the mass of the Compact object.

431
00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:40.123
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

432
00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.040
<v 0>So if the mass function,</v>

433
00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:47.960
if you measure the mass function and it comes out to be greater than three solar

434
00:28:47.961 --> 00:28:50.660
masses,
then the compact object,

435
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:57.210
there's also greater than three solar masses.
And if that's true,

436
00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:02.010
uh,
it has to be a black hole because it has to be small,
smaller,

437
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:05.760
so small that it could otherwise only reasonably be a neutron star.

438
00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:10.140
And yet it's bigger than the mass of the neutron star itself.

439
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:16.800
There's a Ma moderate technical problem with making this observation.

440
00:29:16.801 --> 00:29:17.760
And the problem is

441
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.260
this is hard to observe

442
00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:29.020
because the,
um,
the accretion disk is too bright

443
00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.120
out shot.
So the creeks in discount shines the star.

444
00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.100
Uh,
fortunately nature solves that

445
00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:46.420
<v 2>problem for us because many of these objects</v>

446
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:49.550
<v 1>have,
yeah,</v>

447
00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.180
<v 2>intermittent.</v>

448
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:54.363
<v 1>Okay,</v>

449
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.870
<v 2>accretion.
So the accretion happens.
You see all these x rays,</v>

450
00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.560
then the accretion turns off for various reasons.
Uh,

451
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.830
and then when the accretions off,
all you see is the companion star.

452
00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.100
And so you can win the accretions off.
You can make this measurement.

453
00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.650
So here's how you go about finding a black hole

454
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:18.150
first.
Uh,
suddenly there's a new source of x rays.

455
00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:21.240
The X rays turn on in one of these transients system.

456
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:25.790
Then you wait.

457
00:30:28.990 --> 00:30:29.500
<v 1>Okay.</v>

458
00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:34.150
<v 2>Then the x rays turnoff.
This happens after a few months.
Typically</v>

459
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:39.100
once the x rays turn off,

460
00:30:39.101 --> 00:30:43.450
that means the accretion disk isn't there anymore and you measure the mass

461
00:30:43.451 --> 00:30:44.284
function.

462
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:47.680
<v 1>Okay.</v>

463
00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.430
<v 2>And then if that's greater than three solar masses,
you win,</v>

464
00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:56.730
namely you've discovered a black hole.
Uh,
and uh,

465
00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:01.860
this is a sequence of events that I'm rather fond of.
This is what got me tenure.

466
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:04.170
Uh,
and so,
uh,

467
00:31:04.171 --> 00:31:07.680
I thought I'd just show you an example of how this works out in real life.

468
00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:10.730
<v 1>Let's see.
Okay,</v>

469
00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:18.010
<v 2>here is,
uh,
well let me turn the lights down just slightly.</v>

470
00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:22.163
<v 1>Okay.</v>

471
00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:26.570
<v 2>Right?
So this is just a sort of artist's conception of an x,
right?
Binary.</v>

472
00:31:26.571 --> 00:31:30.140
Here's the companion star.
Uh,
here's the accretion disk.

473
00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:34.190
Down in the middle there is a compact objects.
So small you can't see it.

474
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:38.710
This red stuff is supposed to be radio emission coming out of the polls.
Uh,

475
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:41.960
and you can see the little gas stream going from one to another.

476
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:45.920
This is what it looks like when it,
when it's x ray active.
When it,

477
00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:49.130
when the x rays turn off,
what happens is the,
uh,

478
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.920
stuff just piles up in the outer part of the accretion disk.

479
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:55.100
There's not enough friction to drive it down in there.
No X rays.

480
00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.590
And basically all you can see is the companion star.

481
00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:58.800
<v 1>Okay?</v>

482
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:03.480
<v 2>So let me now take you back 15 years in time.</v>

483
00:32:03.481 --> 00:32:08.040
This is something that crossed my desk shortly after I came to Yale as an

484
00:32:08.041 --> 00:32:10.800
assistant professor in the early 1990s.
Uh,

485
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:15.510
this is an astronomical telegram.
A,
that's an old fashioned word.
Now,

486
00:32:15.511 --> 00:32:17.730
of course,
we do it all by email.
Uh,

487
00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:22.790
and these are a system for distributing the results of Fast Breaking News in the

488
00:32:24.601 --> 00:32:24.910
heavens.

489
00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:28.230
Do you know if you see a supernova or some exciting or comment or something

490
00:32:28.231 --> 00:32:29.760
exciting going off in the sky,

491
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.990
you can't wait to publish it for a year and a half because by then it will be

492
00:32:33.991 --> 00:32:36.190
gone and no one else will,
will study it.

493
00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:40.250
So we have this system for distributing news of fast breaking events so that

494
00:32:40.251 --> 00:32:43.370
other people can study them.
Uh,
in this particular case,

495
00:32:43.371 --> 00:32:46.850
there's a whole bunch of astro jargon down in here.
The titles,

496
00:32:46.851 --> 00:32:51.230
the only thing you have to pay attention to x ray transient in the constellation

497
00:32:51.231 --> 00:32:55.430
of Musca new extra source suddenly appeared in Musca.
These,

498
00:32:55.431 --> 00:32:57.160
these guys found it.
Uh,

499
00:32:57.170 --> 00:33:01.070
you've probably never heard of the constellation of Musca Muscow the fly.

500
00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.790
Yeah.
Uh,
there's two reasons you haven't heard of it.

501
00:33:04.791 --> 00:33:07.620
One is it's in the southern hemisphere.
You can't see it from here.
Uh,

502
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:11.120
but the other reason is it's a pretty pathetic excuse for a constellation.

503
00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:15.820
It's one lousy fourth magnitude star.
That's why they call it the fly,
right?
Uh,

504
00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.440
but they had to call that part of the sky something.

505
00:33:18.441 --> 00:33:22.280
And it's now my favorite constellation because it has this object in it.
Anyway,

506
00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:26.270
a bright x ray stores suddenly turned up in Muskoka,
uh,

507
00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.840
a month or so later,
the x ray source was still bright.

508
00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:34.490
I found myself in this lovely spot.
This isn't observatory in the,
in Chile,

509
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:38.150
uh,
where you can see the southern hemisphere among other things.

510
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:42.260
And the two telescopes pictured here.
This is was at the time,
the largest,

511
00:33:42.261 --> 00:33:45.800
most powerful telescope in the southern hemisphere.
This is the door,

512
00:33:45.801 --> 00:33:49.490
just to give you a sense of scale and this thing here in the foreground,

513
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.180
which looms large in this picture,
but it's actually much smaller than that,

514
00:33:53.181 --> 00:33:54.014
I have to tell you,

515
00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:58.770
is one of the more far flung outposts of the Yale Empire.
Uh,

516
00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:02.510
this is Yale's one meter telescope.
It was built in Bethany,
Connecticut.

517
00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:05.420
And then in the late,
in the early 1970,
somebody said,
well,

518
00:34:05.421 --> 00:34:08.210
Connecticut's are really stupid place to have a research telescope.

519
00:34:08.211 --> 00:34:09.380
It snows all the time.

520
00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:14.060
And so they kind of picked it up and took it down to Chile.
Uh,
and uh,
so it's,

521
00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:18.410
it's a buy now only our second best research telescope and I'm very fond of it.

522
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:23.600
Uh,
and so I found myself observing at this telescope a few months after the

523
00:34:23.601 --> 00:34:25.970
discovery of this x ray source in Musca.

524
00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:30.350
So I junked the program I thought I was going to do and looked at that thing

525
00:34:30.351 --> 00:34:31.160
instead.

526
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:35.960
And what I found was that every 10 and a half hours it got a little brighter.

527
00:34:35.961 --> 00:34:40.520
And then a little fainter and then a little brighter.
And I,
this was the,
uh,
the,

528
00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:45.560
uh,
the accretion disk was still there.
So presumably this was some effect,

529
00:34:45.561 --> 00:34:46.071
for example,

530
00:34:46.071 --> 00:34:49.730
of the companion start crossing in front of the accretion disk or something like

531
00:34:49.731 --> 00:34:53.390
that.
Uh,
and so I fired off my own telegram.

532
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.980
There's two things you need to know from this one.
That's me.
Uh,

533
00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.100
and the other one is that,
uh,

534
00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:03.920
I claimed that there was a 10 and a half hour modulation in the brightness of

535
00:35:03.921 --> 00:35:06.230
the source,
which might be the orbital period.

536
00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.940
That's an interesting thing to know because if you know the orbital period,

537
00:35:10.941 --> 00:35:11.450
if you know,

538
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:15.770
pee in the mass function and you think that this might turn out to be a black

539
00:35:15.771 --> 00:35:16.011
hole,

540
00:35:16.011 --> 00:35:20.480
you can figure out how big K has to be in order for this to be a black hole.

541
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:24.320
And the answer is that if you were to measure the radio velocity of this thing,

542
00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:29.620
the difference between the maximum and the minimum radio velocity would be 800.

543
00:35:29.931 --> 00:35:33.050
If that were 800 kilometers a second or greater,

544
00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:37.130
then the compact object in this system would have to be a black hole.

545
00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.110
Problem was,
I couldn't make that measurement because first of all,

546
00:35:40.111 --> 00:35:43.920
the Yale telescope wasn't powerful enough to do it.
Second of all,
uh,

547
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:47.820
the accretion disk was still too bright to allow observations of the companion.

548
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:53.240
So I teamed up with a couple people who had done this once already before.

549
00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:57.420
Uh,
Ron [inaudible] from Mit,
Jeff Mcclintock from the Smithsonian,

550
00:35:57.421 --> 00:36:01.350
and we applied to get time on the big telescope.
The big telescope,

551
00:36:01.351 --> 00:36:05.490
which I showed you is from the National Observatory and you have to write a

552
00:36:05.491 --> 00:36:09.120
proposal to get time on it.
Many people want to get time on it.

553
00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.730
It's quite competitive.
But we wrote a good proposal.

554
00:36:11.731 --> 00:36:14.790
And so the following year after the x rays and turned off,

555
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:19.110
they gave us three nights of telescope time on the big telescope in order to

556
00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:24.030
make this radio velocity curve.
So,
uh,
just to orient you,
here's chilay.

557
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:29.170
Uh,
here's the Capitol Santiago,
Sarah to is up in the Andes here.
Uh,

558
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.980
so you take this enormous plane ride and then drive up to,
uh,

559
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:36.930
drive up into here.
Uh,
and then what happened was,
let's see,

560
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.840
the first night it rained,
this is kind of an occupational hazard.
You,

561
00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.220
the reason there are all these telescopes in Chile is because it's mountains in

562
00:36:44.221 --> 00:36:48.390
the desert,
which is an excellent place to put telescopes.
As it turns out,

563
00:36:48.391 --> 00:36:51.060
even in the desert,
sometimes it's cloudy,
sometimes it range.

564
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:55.020
That was the first night.
So that was out,
uh,
the second night.
Oh,

565
00:36:55.021 --> 00:36:57.390
that was interesting.
There was a hailstorm.
I,

566
00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.270
I don't know if you've ever been in a six story,

567
00:37:00.271 --> 00:37:04.950
high hollow steel building in the Hale.
It's a very interesting experience,

568
00:37:04.951 --> 00:37:08.130
but it's not productive scientifically.
And so,
you know,

569
00:37:08.131 --> 00:37:12.900
they give you these little rooms to sleep in which our light tight and,
uh,

570
00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.570
and sound tight because you have to sleep in the daytime.

571
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.280
And so there's this very dramatic moment.

572
00:37:17.281 --> 00:37:21.210
You wake up at four in the afternoon and you raise the shame to see if there are

573
00:37:21.211 --> 00:37:24.090
clouds.
So fortunately,
the third of our three nights,

574
00:37:24.091 --> 00:37:28.350
it was all clear the storm had passed.
Uh,
and we were able then Nassau,

575
00:37:28.351 --> 00:37:30.820
now we're sitting somewhere in this building.
Uh,

576
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.920
and we were able to make our observations.
So let me show you what we did.

577
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.250
Here is a plot of hours,

578
00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.820
time in hours on the night of the 3rd of April,

579
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:45.820
1992 versus radio velocity.
So this is going to be a radio velocity plot.

580
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:50.670
First thing we observed was this point right after sunset.

581
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:55.140
And you notice that the object is coming toward us at 250 kilometers a second.

582
00:37:55.470 --> 00:38:00.030
That's already very good news because 250 kilometers a second is actually a

583
00:38:00.031 --> 00:38:02.580
little greater than the escape velocity of the galaxy.

584
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:04.960
And so the only reason something would,
uh,

585
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:10.190
have that kind of speed is if it was an orbit around some other nearby object or

586
00:38:10.531 --> 00:38:12.990
objects in the galaxy.
Don't,
aren't usually that bright.

587
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:16.740
So we made a couple more observations.
Uh,

588
00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.990
and after the third observation,

589
00:38:18.991 --> 00:38:23.670
it was clear that at the basic parameters of this system,
uh,
were,

590
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:25.170
uh,
more or less correct.

591
00:38:25.171 --> 00:38:29.190
And it started off coming at us at 250 kilometers a second,

592
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.150
couple hours later.
It was going away from us at 200 kilometers a second.

593
00:38:33.151 --> 00:38:34.590
So in a mere two hours,

594
00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:38.590
it had turned itself around from coming at us at a high rate of speed to going

595
00:38:38.591 --> 00:38:40.090
away from us.
So that's good.

596
00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:44.440
It's in an orbit and attended an orbit with a very short period.
Uh,

597
00:38:44.441 --> 00:38:48.900
and so that was a very encouraging.
Uh,
and then,
uh,

598
00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:53.290
we collected more data and by about midnight we were feeling pretty pleased with

599
00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:57.830
ourselves because you can see what's happening.
It was coming.
It's now coming,
uh,

600
00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.280
going away from us at 400 kilometers a second.

601
00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:02.800
But clearly it's about to turn around and go this way.

602
00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:07.980
If you extrapolate five and a quarter hours before this turnaround,

603
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:10.030
you'd get a point down here.

604
00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:14.140
That meant it would have been going from minus 400 to positive 400.

605
00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.410
That's 800 kilometers a second.
If you believe that,

606
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:19.540
then this probably is a black hole.

607
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:22.110
So we're feeling pretty pleased with ourselves.
Uh,

608
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:27.130
we opened a little bottle of the local firewater awful stuff called Pisco.

609
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:28.960
Uh,
you're not supposed to do that,
right?

610
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.700
You're not supposed to operate heavy machinery.
Uh,
uh,
and,
uh,

611
00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:38.050
nature was not kind.
We were punished for this.
Uh,
there was a small earthquake,

612
00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:43.120
uh,
a Chili's in an earthquake zone.
And so the,
uh,
uh,

613
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:46.180
this does bad things for precision aligned optics.

614
00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:51.130
So the next point was a little skew for reasons that we never explained in our

615
00:39:51.131 --> 00:39:54.370
paper.
And then there was a gap,
uh,

616
00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.760
where for a little while we didn't take any data while we were straightening

617
00:39:57.761 --> 00:40:00.940
ourselves out again.
And then here's the next point.
And so now that's,

618
00:40:00.941 --> 00:40:04.440
that's encouraging again.
Uh,
and then,
uh,

619
00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:07.300
more data was collected toward the end of the night.

620
00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:12.250
And so as dawn was beginning to come up,
uh,
we were kind of backward.
We started,

621
00:40:12.251 --> 00:40:15.520
the thing was coming towards this a 250 kilometers a second,

622
00:40:15.521 --> 00:40:19.240
and we really needed one more point down here in order to nail the whole thing

623
00:40:19.241 --> 00:40:23.800
down.
Uh,
the problem was that the object of course,
is now setting in the west.

624
00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:27.460
Uh,
you know,
the earth turns.
So objects rise in the east,
they set in the West.

625
00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:30.730
If you can picture a telescope following an object down into the west,

626
00:40:30.731 --> 00:40:32.560
it's port of pointing like this.
Uh,

627
00:40:32.561 --> 00:40:37.300
the principal optical element in this telescope is a huge mirror of four meter

628
00:40:37.301 --> 00:40:38.140
wide mirror.

629
00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.640
So 13 feet across and it's not bolted down particularly cause you could put

630
00:40:42.641 --> 00:40:44.890
bolts in the mirror,
changes in temperature,

631
00:40:44.891 --> 00:40:48.370
will change the size of the bolts and it'll throw the optics out of alignment.

632
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:52.330
So it's just kind of sitting there and it's tipping this way and eventually it's

633
00:40:52.331 --> 00:40:56.470
going to,
you know,
fall out,
fall on the floor.
It is way more than seven years.

634
00:40:56.471 --> 00:41:01.120
Bad luck for an astronomer to break the primary mirror of the largest telescope

635
00:41:01.121 --> 00:41:02.200
in the southern hemisphere.

636
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:06.190
And so they don't let the astronomers actually move the telescope themselves.

637
00:41:06.191 --> 00:41:07.450
That would be far too dangerous.

638
00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:12.340
They have trained experts to do this and the trained expert was saying to us at

639
00:41:12.341 --> 00:41:14.470
this point,
you know,
you've got to stop observing this object.

640
00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:18.220
We're beyond the safety limits and so forth.
We said as scientists,
do you no,
no,

641
00:41:18.221 --> 00:41:20.820
no.
In the interest of science,
we must have one more point.
Uh,

642
00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:25.720
this argument went on for a while,
uh,
and they were about to,
uh,
uh,

643
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:29.950
kind of,
uh,
pull the plug on us and then we said,
okay,
fine.
You know,

644
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:34.360
we understand safety of the telescope is paramount,
but the argument,
uh,

645
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.170
we'd accumulated one more point.

646
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:41.960
And so this is kind of the clinching case down here as it's coming towards us at

647
00:41:41.961 --> 00:41:46.070
400 kilometers a second.
So we're very pleased with ourselves over breakfast.

648
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:50.780
We did the exercise of finding the best fit sine curve.

649
00:41:50.781 --> 00:41:53.810
Here it is.
Uh,
and uh,
uh,

650
00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.930
if you work out what the mass function is,
the orbital periods,

651
00:41:56.931 --> 00:42:01.250
10 and a half hours,
the mass function is 3.1 times the mass of the sun.

652
00:42:01.251 --> 00:42:06.200
So very good,
very good news.
Uh,
you'll notice this plus or minus 0.05,

653
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:08.300
the data is not all that great.

654
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:11.150
We've subsequently gotten a lot more data on this thing.

655
00:42:11.151 --> 00:42:13.100
It does turn out to be about 3.1,

656
00:42:13.101 --> 00:42:18.101
but it's also true that remember that that formula had this sign I in it and we

657
00:42:18.741 --> 00:42:21.800
were able by other means to determine what the inclination is.

658
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.590
And it's now clear that this object hasn't caught,

659
00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:29.620
that this binary system has a compact object of a mass of about seven solar

660
00:42:29.871 --> 00:42:34.110
masses in it.
Very,
uh,
a very nice thing.
Uh,

661
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:38.540
we published this paper,
uh,
other people have published other papers by now.
Oh,

662
00:42:38.541 --> 00:42:42.840
here's our telegram from the next morning.
Uh,
again,
Gobbledygook,
uh,

663
00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:47.450
except for the fact that the value of the mass function is 3.1 providing

664
00:42:47.451 --> 00:42:50.690
dynamical evidence that the primary is a black hole.

665
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:52.940
So we want it to publish a paper,
you know,

666
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:56.150
entitled Black Hole found in the constellation of Musca.

667
00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.270
People were a little cautious about that.
They said,
you know,

668
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:03.950
you haven't yet proved that Einstein's relativity is correct if Einstein's
wrong,

669
00:43:03.951 --> 00:43:07.130
this doesn't necessarily have to be a black hole.
And we said,
come on,

670
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:10.640
you get to assume that Einstein's right.
They said,
Eh,
maybe not.

671
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:15.850
So we get to call these things dynamically confirmed black hole candidates.

672
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:21.200
That's the official word.
Uh,
and here is the current collection of these things.

673
00:43:21.201 --> 00:43:25.220
Scale to the sun and Mercury.
The one we were looking at,
very close one.

674
00:43:25.221 --> 00:43:28.640
This is a,
that's 10 and a half hour orbit,
this thing,
much bigger,

675
00:43:28.641 --> 00:43:33.380
30 hour or bit much bigger companion star.
But all of the,
uh,

676
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:37.250
black holes in here are sort of between five and,

677
00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:41.540
uh,
between five and 15 times the mass of the sun.

678
00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:46.310
And so now 15 years later,
there's a whole collection of these things.

679
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:51.440
There's also a collection of things that turned out to be new trucks,
stars.

680
00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:56.680
So now you can do an experiment and you can do an experiment in general

681
00:43:56.811 --> 00:44:00.350
relativity and whoops,
here's the derivation.
I'll skip that for you.

682
00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.970
And you can ask yourself whether you've bent horizons actually exist.

683
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:09.920
So here's the experiment.
You have a dozen or so things that are neutron stars.

684
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:12.440
You'll have another dozen or so things that are black holes.

685
00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:16.360
You pour gas onto both of them.
Uh,
and indeed,
you know,

686
00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.430
that's what the companion stars are doing.
That's why they have all these x rays.

687
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.510
What happens if of gas falls on a neutron star?
It picks up a lot of speed.

688
00:44:23.511 --> 00:44:27.410
It starts going at the speed of light and it hits right into the surface.

689
00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:30.980
And so when it hits the surface,
all its kinetic energy,

690
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:35.990
all its thermal energy has to stop the kinetic energy stops and all that energy

691
00:44:36.331 --> 00:44:38.290
goes into the surface of the neutron star,

692
00:44:38.291 --> 00:44:42.960
somehow at what's called a boundary layer and has to in some way get reradiated.

693
00:44:42.961 --> 00:44:45.360
It basically heats up the surface of the neutron star.

694
00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:50.190
You get x rays from this surface layer gas falling onto a black hole,

695
00:44:50.191 --> 00:44:51.024
doesn't do it.

696
00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:54.960
It falls right through the event horizon and the kinetic energy and the thermal

697
00:44:54.961 --> 00:44:59.850
energy in that gas just contributes to the mass of the black hole and it doesn't

698
00:44:59.851 --> 00:45:00.890
get reradiated.

699
00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:05.310
So your prediction is for the same amount of mass falling onto a neutron stars

700
00:45:05.311 --> 00:45:06.450
onto a black hole,

701
00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:10.620
you would predict that the neutron star would be brighter because all of this

702
00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:15.750
extra energy brought in by the accreting material would be radiated.

703
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:18.330
Whereas in the case of the black hole,
it would not be,

704
00:45:18.331 --> 00:45:23.280
it would just be captured by the black hole itself.
So,
uh,
with a,

705
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:26.910
uh,
with the most sophisticated recent x ray telescope,

706
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:30.060
people have tried to measure,
uh,

707
00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:33.750
black holes and neutron stars incomparable in,

708
00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:36.920
in a situation where they emit comparable amounts where,

709
00:45:36.921 --> 00:45:38.430
where the mass accretion rate,

710
00:45:38.431 --> 00:45:41.220
the amount of mass that's being accreted is comparable.

711
00:45:41.221 --> 00:45:44.070
So the black things here are the black holes.

712
00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:47.010
The open circles are the neutron stars.

713
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:50.700
This is a measure of brightness and it's logarithmic.

714
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.840
So this is 10 to the minus eight,
10 to the minus six in some silly set of units.

715
00:45:55.170 --> 00:46:00.060
Uh,
and so this between here and here,
that's a factor of a hundred.

716
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:01.770
This is the orbital period.

717
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:06.310
The reason they plot the orbital period is there's good reason to think that,
uh,

718
00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:06.720
uh,

719
00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:11.720
the amount of mass accretion is proportional to the orbital period.

720
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:15.900
So you expect long orbits to have more master creation than,
than shorter ones.

721
00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:18.900
But the point of this graph is clear.
There's a,

722
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:24.360
there's a gap you can drive a truck through of about a factor of a hundred in

723
00:46:24.361 --> 00:46:26.730
the brightness between the neutron stars,

724
00:46:26.731 --> 00:46:30.480
the things that we think our neutron stars and the things we think of as black

725
00:46:30.481 --> 00:46:34.740
holes.
And so the interpretation of this has been that the,

726
00:46:34.741 --> 00:46:38.940
that the black holes don't have a surface because if they had a surface,

727
00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:43.110
then all of this extra energy would have to radiate as it does in the case.

728
00:46:43.111 --> 00:46:46.460
So the neutron star,
so this is a first step towards a,

729
00:46:46.461 --> 00:46:50.430
a test of strong field general relativity.

730
00:46:50.431 --> 00:46:54.480
It's only a first step because you really have to understand how much mass is

731
00:46:54.481 --> 00:46:57.510
falling and what the geometry of the mass flow is.

732
00:46:57.511 --> 00:47:00.540
And a whole bunch of very complicated gas dynamics.

733
00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.940
This is sometimes called gastro physics.
Uh,

734
00:47:02.941 --> 00:47:06.870
and so that's what we're working on doing now to try and understand exactly

735
00:47:06.871 --> 00:47:11.040
what's going on with these things.
Uh,
and if one understood that,

736
00:47:11.041 --> 00:47:15.180
then you might take such a plot to represent,

737
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:19.110
uh,
a proof that event horizons exist.

738
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:24.380
And so that kind of brings you up to 2007 in the study of strong field

739
00:47:25.021 --> 00:47:29.130
relativity and black holes.
And that's the end of this section of the course.

740
00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:33.750
That's the end of this section of this semester.
Uh,
have a good break and we'll,

741
00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:36.450
uh,
you know,
torment you with a test afterwards.
