WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.160
We had gotten at the end of last time to the big Rep.

2
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:06.940
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

3
00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.260
<v 0>This is where the ever expanding cosmological constant,</v>

4
00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.330
which is of course a contradiction in terms.

5
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.680
If you imagine the dark energy is not a cosmological constant,

6
00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:19.600
that it's actually increasing in time,

7
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.190
rips everything to shreds.

8
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.210
The universe becomes infinite in size and a finite amount of time and everything

9
00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:26.050
gets pulled apart.

10
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.410
What I want to start by doing today is to go back and do that again slowly.

11
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.913
Okay.

12
00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.730
Uh,

13
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.500
because I think this is,

14
00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:36.550
this is not a,

15
00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.270
uh,

16
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.840
uh,

17
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.350
it's not a simple line of reasoning that leads you to this.

18
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.620
So let's go all the way back to what we know about,

19
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.230
uh,

20
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.280
the universe from,

21
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.900
from observing galaxy.

22
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.390
Supernova is things like that.

23
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.930
Uh,

24
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.030
we know that the university is expanding,

25
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.860
uh,

26
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.240
and that we know,

27
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.940
Hubble already figured that out.

28
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:00.620
We know this from the Hubble law

29
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.620
when the Hubble law and from,

30
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.010
uh,

31
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.843
other,

32
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:08.743
uh,

33
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:09.270
uh,

34
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.270
just in general from the study of a standard candles at relatively low red

35
00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:15.290
shift.

36
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.010
So,

37
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.420
uh,

38
00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.910
distances out to,

39
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.953
I dunno,

40
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.990
Z of less than oh 0.2 or so.

41
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.780
You can't tell the difference between an accelerating or decelerating universe.

42
00:01:29.781 --> 00:01:33.260
All you know is that it's expanding and you can figure out how fast it's

43
00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:34.094
expanding.

44
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.210
Uh,

45
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.270
now the next question then becomes,

46
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.343
uh,

47
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.300
the rate of expansion.

48
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.100
Is the rate of expansion changing?

49
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.700
Is it,

50
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.900
is it accelerating?

51
00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:45.860
Is it decelerating?

52
00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:46.940
What's going on there?

53
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.020
Uh,

54
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.020
and so you want to compare acceleration versus deceleration,

55
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.200
which is a fancy word is,

56
00:01:57.201 --> 00:01:57.531
you know,

57
00:01:57.531 --> 00:01:58.730
for slowing down,

58
00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.660
uh,

59
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.310
and deceleration,

60
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.100
this is a relatively easy to grasp.

61
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.670
Uh,

62
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.720
this is what,

63
00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.160
uh,

64
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.560
uh,

65
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.120
what happens because of matter,

66
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.800
matter exists.

67
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.810
It's got gravitational force,

68
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.321
uh,

69
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:14.840
and gravitational force tends to hold things together.

70
00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:18.020
So if you've got something that's moving apart with grout and there's some

71
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:21.350
gravitational force of will tend to hold it together and thus slow it down,

72
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.540
most of the matter it turns out,

73
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:24.920
is this weird dark matter,

74
00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:26.240
which we don't understand.

75
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.553
Uh,

76
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.341
but,

77
00:02:28.341 --> 00:02:28.730
uh,

78
00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.000
uh,

79
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.540
that's what's responsible for the deceleration.

80
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.780
If you're going to make it go faster and you need something much weirder,

81
00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:37.010
that pushes outward,

82
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:38.390
that has repulsive force.

83
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.990
Uh,

84
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.000
this we believe actually exists.

85
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:42.830
This we labeled dark energy,

86
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.820
hence sell the question of is it accelerating or as a decelerating is basically

87
00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:50.690
a question of,

88
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.763
uh,

89
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.550
how much dark energy is there versus how much matter is there?

90
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.660
Because the more,

91
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.520
if you have more of this,

92
00:02:58.521 --> 00:02:59.170
then this,

93
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.280
then it will accelerate.

94
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.771
Uh,

95
00:03:00.771 --> 00:03:01.870
and vice versa.

96
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.170
And what we have discovered by a supernovae observations with red shifts,

97
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.160
uh,

98
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.160
greater than oh 0.3 and a buy now out to about a,

99
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:17.830
about a red shift of one or so,

100
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.750
uh,

101
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.260
demonstrate that.

102
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.570
Well,

103
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.840
what exactly does this sec?

104
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:23.674
Let's go slowly.

105
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.250
Uh,

106
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.420
in the past,

107
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.243
uh,

108
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.080
the universe

109
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.870
was expanding

110
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.920
more slowly than it is now.

111
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.120
And therefore those three dots are the mathematical symbol for therefore,

112
00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.100
therefore the universe is accelerating

113
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.350
and therefore there's more dark energy

114
00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.361
there.

115
00:03:59.361 --> 00:04:00.420
There is matter.

116
00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

117
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.510
<v 0>And you'll recall we did the little pie chart of the universe and it turns out</v>

118
00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:08.000
it's three quarters dark energy in one quarter matter.

119
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.571
Uh,

120
00:04:08.571 --> 00:04:09.020
and,

121
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.260
uh,

122
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.260
those proportions are determined by,

123
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.160
uh,

124
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.993
the,

125
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.780
uh,

126
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.420
rate at which the universe is accelerating.

127
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.070
Not The rate at which it's expanding,

128
00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:22.310
but the rate at which it's accelerating because that's the change in the

129
00:04:22.311 --> 00:04:23.144
expansion.

130
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.900
Fine.

131
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.733
So far.

132
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.353
Uh,

133
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.620
or maybe it isn't fine.

134
00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:27.980
I should,

135
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.360
I should pose that as a question.

136
00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.283
Fine.

137
00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.243
Uh,

138
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.740
this is the basic,

139
00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:34.010
uh,

140
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.310
uh,

141
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.600
uh,

142
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.280
premise of where we had gotten to about a week ago.

143
00:04:37.281 --> 00:04:37.521
Yes,

144
00:04:37.521 --> 00:04:38.120
sir.

145
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.953
Hold on a minute.

146
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.000
Hold on.

147
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.220
How Dark Energy Causes Acceleration?

148
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.090
Excellent question.

149
00:04:44.091 --> 00:04:44.924
I have no idea,

150
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.410
uh,

151
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.090
because we don't have any idea what it is.

152
00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.380
Uh,

153
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.181
and,

154
00:04:50.181 --> 00:04:50.330
uh,

155
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.350
it shows up.

156
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.720
The reason we have even a name for it,

157
00:04:53.721 --> 00:04:54.290
you know,

158
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.180
is that it is that it showed up in Einstein's equation as a potential

159
00:04:59.181 --> 00:05:00.830
contribution to the universe,

160
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:01.260
uh,

161
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.760
that you,

162
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.860
that you could add but didn't have to,

163
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.940
uh,

164
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:05.240
uh,

165
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.270
constant of integration for those of you who like that kind of thing.

166
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.660
What it is physically very hard to understand.

167
00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.500
The only physical explanation that's been offered,

168
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.281
well,

169
00:05:16.281 --> 00:05:17.150
many had been offered,

170
00:05:17.151 --> 00:05:18.080
but the only one that,

171
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.710
uh,

172
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.400
uh,

173
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.510
connects to anything else we know is the idea that it's the vacuum energy

174
00:05:23.511 --> 00:05:25.190
predicted by quantum mechanics.

175
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.960
And it turns out that if that's true,

176
00:05:26.961 --> 00:05:29.510
it ought to be 10 to the hundred and 20 times stronger.

177
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:30.411
Uh,

178
00:05:30.411 --> 00:05:32.300
and so that's not a good prediction.

179
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.700
Uh,

180
00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.760
and so exactly how this works,

181
00:05:34.761 --> 00:05:36.080
what the mechanism is,

182
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.750
what the nature of this stuff is completely unknown.

183
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.930
And the only reason we think it's there is that we see it to fact we see the

184
00:05:44.931 --> 00:05:46.130
universe getting faster.

185
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:50.840
And so it's just a name that's attached to whatever is causing that effect.

186
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.340
Okay?

187
00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.173
Yes.

188
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.363
University

189
00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.420
was expanding more slowly than it is now.

190
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.990
Right?

191
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.670
So that is,

192
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.360
uh,

193
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.840
this,

194
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.673
uh,

195
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.920
transformation between these two different kinds of graphs,

196
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:11.900
one of which is the observed graph.

197
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:12.980
And one of which,

198
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.610
uh,

199
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.443
is the,

200
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.293
uh,

201
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.250
is the plot of the scale factor versus time.

202
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:23.630
Here's now,

203
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.160
here's one.

204
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.930
We're at one and now.

205
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.150
And so if it were not,

206
00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.030
uh,

207
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.930
accelerating,

208
00:06:31.931 --> 00:06:33.070
if it were just going on,

209
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.490
coasting along with that would be a straight line.

210
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:37.570
And a,

211
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.800
what happens is we can look back into the past and what we see is this.

212
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.900
So at this point,

213
00:06:43.901 --> 00:06:44.734
if you think about it,

214
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:47.470
believe me for a sec,

215
00:06:47.471 --> 00:06:48.304
that this is true.

216
00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:49.810
Supposing you were sitting here,

217
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.930
what the,

218
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.400
the rate of expansion is the slope of this line.

219
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.490
That's how much you're expanding.

220
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.020
And so at this point,

221
00:06:59.021 --> 00:07:01.390
the slope is shallower than it is up here.

222
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.680
And so,

223
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.130
uh,

224
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:08.130
one interpretation of this line is that in the past used to be expanding,

225
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:10.090
you know,

226
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:10.923
like this,

227
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:13.060
and now it's expanding like this.

228
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.800
Ah,

229
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.160
how do you,

230
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.410
how do you know it's doing that particular shape?

231
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.573
Uh,

232
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.050
well,

233
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.883
uh,

234
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.880
you of course observe points all along the way here.

235
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:26.960
Uh,

236
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:27.500
now,

237
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:27.711
uh,

238
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:31.490
we're about to get to the question of whether that shape actually continues.

239
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.820
Uh,

240
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:32.653
if you ask,

241
00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.050
how do you know that it would continue this way?

242
00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:36.801
Uh,

243
00:07:36.801 --> 00:07:41.390
that of course you don't know for sure if you invent some piece of magic whereby

244
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:43.610
everything changes right now.

245
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.810
Uh,

246
00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.640
for some obscure reason,

247
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:49.370
it could go off in some other direction.

248
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:50.240
Uh,

249
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.790
but the assumption is that whatever it is,

250
00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.220
that's,

251
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.630
that we do not live at a special time and that therefore,

252
00:07:56.631 --> 00:08:00.230
whatever it is that's doing the accelerating is gonna keep at it.

253
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:00.670
Uh,

254
00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:02.510
and indeed the whole of the big rip,

255
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:03.890
which is where I'm going with this,

256
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:04.370
uh,

257
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:06.140
comes about by asking the question.

258
00:08:06.141 --> 00:08:09.890
Supposing the acceleration rate is changing in a different way from the way we

259
00:08:09.891 --> 00:08:10.940
thought it was going to.

260
00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:11.990
Uh,

261
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.970
just to complete the thought here.

262
00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:15.973
Uh,

263
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.130
the way this works out in the observational plane,

264
00:08:19.131 --> 00:08:19.964
you'll recall,

265
00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.160
looks like this.

266
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:27.190
Here's the empty universe in this set of units and you observe a bunch of

267
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:30.290
supernovae and they seem to be doing that.

268
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.140
And that line,

269
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.093
if you then,

270
00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:34.760
uh,

271
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.080
transform,

272
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.490
uh,

273
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:39.290
red shift and distance,

274
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:44.291
this is kind of a weird measure of distance into a scale factor and time.

275
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.613
Uh,

276
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:50.800
let me make this line solid so that of course the two graphs correspond this

277
00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:54.890
line and that line corresponds with each other.

278
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.890
And so as you observe many points along here,

279
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.080
that's essentially observing many points along.

280
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:06.993
<v 1>Okay?</v>

281
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:11.463
Yes.

282
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.410
<v 2>Given the empirical data that we knew,</v>

283
00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:15.890
if we were going to scratch it,

284
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.930
if we were to extrapolate that curve,

285
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.120
it actually intersection the t axis,

286
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.870
or would we or would we need to have,

287
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:22.460
<v 0>ah,</v>

288
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:23.450
let me come back to that.

289
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:24.500
Let me come back to that.

290
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:25.760
The answer is yes,

291
00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.410
it does go to zero.

292
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.420
Uh,

293
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:28.600
it,

294
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.620
it doesn't keep going up like this,

295
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.080
but let me come back to that in a second and you'll see why.

296
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:37.963
<v 1>Okay.</v>

297
00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:39.363
Um,

298
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:44.160
<v 0>so it's all a balance of dark energy</v>

299
00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:49.400
versus dark matter or matter in general,

300
00:09:49.401 --> 00:09:51.230
but the dark matter predominate.

301
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.160
And at the moment it is true that the dark energy is a,

302
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.040
there's more of it.

303
00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.310
It exerts more,

304
00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.090
uh,

305
00:09:59.090 --> 00:09:59.390
uh,

306
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.980
more of an influence on the universe.

307
00:10:00.981 --> 00:10:01.281
Therefore,

308
00:10:01.281 --> 00:10:02.770
the university's is x,

309
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.430
not just expanding,

310
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:05.570
but also accelerating.

311
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:08.330
We know that because these points are above the line,

312
00:10:08.331 --> 00:10:09.380
not below the line.

313
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:10.220
Uh,

314
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.860
but this didn't always have to be true.

315
00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.160
This balance changes with time.

316
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:20.191
Oh,

317
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:21.180
so currently,

318
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.273
<v 1>uh,</v>

319
00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:25.780
<v 0>d blows away the dam.</v>

320
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.950
Uh,

321
00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:27.340
but,

322
00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:27.611
uh,

323
00:10:27.611 --> 00:10:28.450
this can change.

324
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.350
This changes.

325
00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:29.861
In fact,

326
00:10:29.861 --> 00:10:34.861
this is almost certain to change with time.

327
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.400
And the reason is that the energy density of the dark energy and the matter

328
00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:46.600
density of the dark matter behave differently as you change the size of the

329
00:10:46.601 --> 00:10:47.434
universe.

330
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.960
It's all about the density here.

331
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.120
So matter density,

332
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:55.470
uh,

333
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.670
in the past,

334
00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:57.900
uh,

335
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.510
you have the same amount

336
00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.280
<v 1>of matter,</v>

337
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.350
<v 0>but the universe was smaller.</v>

338
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:10.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

339
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:14.450
<v 0>Dance city is equal to mass over volume.</v>

340
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.930
So if you have the same m but smaller V,

341
00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.010
uh,

342
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:22.190
this would have to have been bigger in the past.

343
00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:30.930
And in fact goes as the scale factor cubed or one over the scale factor cubed.

344
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:31.840
Uh,

345
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.750
just because volume goes as a linear scale cube.

346
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:37.710
So in the past there was the,

347
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:38.130
the,

348
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.530
the matter density was much greater than it is right now.

349
00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:46.090
And therefore the gravitational force trying to hold the universe together was

350
00:11:46.091 --> 00:11:47.410
greater than it is right now.

351
00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.300
Uh,

352
00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.480
but the cosmological constant is constant.

353
00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:01.280
And what that means is that it's density is constant.

354
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:08.470
And what that means is that in the past,

355
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.070
the dark energy density

356
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.960
was the same as it is now.

357
00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:25.200
That's just the way,

358
00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:25.560
uh,

359
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.410
this particular piece of Einstein's equations works.

360
00:12:28.411 --> 00:12:29.244
It's a constant.

361
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:29.650
Uh,

362
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.530
now if you're about to ask the question,

363
00:12:31.531 --> 00:12:31.801
well,

364
00:12:31.801 --> 00:12:33.420
how does anything behave that way?

365
00:12:33.421 --> 00:12:34.860
I'm going to give you the same answer.

366
00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:35.611
You know,

367
00:12:35.611 --> 00:12:38.730
they have this wonderful thing in the British parliament where they ask,

368
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:39.241
uh,

369
00:12:39.241 --> 00:12:44.220
ask the prime minister question obnoxious questions and when they start getting

370
00:12:44.221 --> 00:12:46.080
too many obnoxious questions in a row,

371
00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:46.411
uh,

372
00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:48.270
what he'll do is he'll look at the camera and say,

373
00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:52.380
I refer the honorable gentleman to the answer I gave some moments ago.

374
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.150
So,

375
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.280
uh,

376
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.160
if you're going to ask what this is and why it behaves that way,

377
00:12:56.161 --> 00:13:00.630
I will refer you to the answer I gave to the honorable gentleman one at some

378
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:00.750
moments ago.

379
00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.081
Namely,

380
00:13:01.081 --> 00:13:02.220
I don't have a clue.

381
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:03.120
Uh,

382
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.060
something they don't generally say in political situations.

383
00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:07.253
Um,

384
00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:08.640
alright.

385
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:08.941
Uh,

386
00:13:08.941 --> 00:13:09.930
so it's the same as now.

387
00:13:09.931 --> 00:13:11.460
But look at the application of this.

388
00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:12.720
If the,

389
00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.350
uh,

390
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:14.610
matter density

391
00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.410
gets bigger and bigger and bigger as you go into the past

392
00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:25.170
and the dark energy density does not,

393
00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:31.410
then at some point in the past it must have been true that the matter density

394
00:13:31.411 --> 00:13:33.060
overwhelms the dark energy.

395
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.253
And,

396
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:35.550
uh,

397
00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:40.290
at some point in the past,

398
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:41.723
uh,

399
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
the dark energy and the dark matter exert comparable effects on the universe.

400
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.260
And before that

401
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:52.790
dark matter wins,

402
00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:54.550
<v 1>okay?</v>

403
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:56.710
<v 0>That is to say the universe</v>

404
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.430
was decelerating.

405
00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:04.530
Now turn this around and go in chronological order,

406
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.520
uh,

407
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:05.791
uh,

408
00:14:05.791 --> 00:14:08.370
from the start of the universe

409
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:13.400
<v 3>until some moment</v>

410
00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.100
the universe

411
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.540
<v 0>decelerated it.</v>

412
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:19.090
Got It.

413
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:20.290
It was expanding,

414
00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:21.490
but it kept,

415
00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:22.773
uh,

416
00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:24.160
uh,

417
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:28.000
it kept getting slower then after

418
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.860
<v 3>some moment.</v>

419
00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:35.660
<v 0>And we know that this moment was in our past because after this moment,</v>

420
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:36.920
it starts to accelerate.

421
00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:38.940
<v 1>Okay?</v>

422
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.190
<v 0>And we know that it's accelerating now.</v>

423
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:42.990
Uh,

424
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.850
and so at some point in the past,

425
00:14:44.851 --> 00:14:47.970
there was a magic moment where everything balanced and then it started to

426
00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:48.451
accelerate.

427
00:14:48.451 --> 00:14:50.880
So now what does this look like on our graphs?

428
00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:56.900
What does this look like on the graphs here?

429
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.920
Well,

430
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.500
let's do the a versus t thing again.

431
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:05.533
Here we are.

432
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:06.711
Here's the,

433
00:15:06.711 --> 00:15:07.160
uh,

434
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.500
here's our reference empty universe.

435
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:12.980
And so recently it's been accelerating.

436
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.420
So you know,

437
00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:18.650
if we look into the past and then the prediction is the extrapolation back to

438
00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:20.690
zero looks kind of like this.

439
00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.010
And remember if it looks like,

440
00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:28.050
if it looks like this,

441
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.880
it's decelerating.

442
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.190
If it looks like this,

443
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.980
it's accelerating.

444
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:41.970
And so the dotted lines or extrapolations are extrapolations based on the idea

445
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:49.870
that the dark energy is the cosmological constant and the dark matter behaves

446
00:15:49.871 --> 00:15:54.160
like matter ought to behave until if you make those two assumptions,

447
00:15:54.161 --> 00:15:55.270
this is the curve you get.

448
00:15:55.510 --> 00:16:00.510
And so this is what you expect for Omega matter equals 0.25.

449
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:04.780
Omega Lambda equals 0.75.

450
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:06.430
<v 1>Okay.</v>

451
00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:07.900
<v 0>At the Er at present.</v>

452
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:12.463
<v 1>Okay</v>

453
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.131
<v 0>Matt.</v>

454
00:16:13.131 --> 00:16:14.480
So you can predict,

455
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:19.750
given given these two quantities and a measurement of h naughty calls about 70,

456
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.520
this gives you an age of the universe.

457
00:16:25.521 --> 00:16:29.420
That is to say the time from when it equals zero to now

458
00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.880
of the universe of something like 13 point.

459
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:36.601
Uh,

460
00:16:36.601 --> 00:16:38.070
I think it's actually at the moment,

461
00:16:38.071 --> 00:16:42.420
13.4 billion years plus or minus,

462
00:16:42.421 --> 00:16:42.781
I don't know,

463
00:16:42.781 --> 00:16:43.920
point for something,

464
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:48.690
something like that under the,

465
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.151
this,

466
00:16:49.151 --> 00:16:51.900
that the assumption that lamb did equals,

467
00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:52.890
uh,

468
00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.920
that lab that the cosmological constant really is constant.

469
00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.100
That you've got these kinds of proportions and this kind of card,

470
00:16:59.250 --> 00:16:59.790
uh,

471
00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:00.570
Habo constant.

472
00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.690
And then you could just extrapolate all these lines in whatever direction you

473
00:17:03.691 --> 00:17:04.310
like,

474
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:04.650
uh,

475
00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.440
and figure out where it crosses a equals zero.

476
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:08.603
Yes.

477
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:12.543
<v 1>Sorry.</v>

478
00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:14.040
<v 0>Excellent question.</v>

479
00:17:14.041 --> 00:17:14.581
The question is,

480
00:17:14.581 --> 00:17:18.120
can we see back far back in the past to see this deceleration?

481
00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.730
The answer is just about yes,

482
00:17:20.731 --> 00:17:22.410
and I'll show you some data in a second.

483
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.160
Uh,

484
00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:27.120
because this is a very strong prediction of the model that is to say that it

485
00:17:27.121 --> 00:17:30.810
should turn around if you're imagining that there's something wacky about

486
00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:33.870
supernovae and that as you go into the past,

487
00:17:33.871 --> 00:17:37.140
they look fater or something as you were assuming on the problem set,

488
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:37.770
uh,

489
00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:41.250
then you wouldn't necessarily predict that that would turn around and do the

490
00:17:41.251 --> 00:17:43.200
other thing as you go further back in the past.

491
00:17:43.201 --> 00:17:46.560
So this is a very strong prediction of what ought to happen.

492
00:17:46.561 --> 00:17:50.220
Cosmologically and so of course people have been trying to it yes.

493
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.790
<v 2>If the density of the universe is changing,</v>

494
00:17:52.791 --> 00:17:56.270
then wouldn't that indicate that word special time right now given the fact that

495
00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:56.781
the current,

496
00:17:56.781 --> 00:17:59.180
if the university is really close to the critical density?

497
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.981
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

498
00:17:59.981 --> 00:18:00.460
So,

499
00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:00.740
uh,

500
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.930
the question is,

501
00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:02.900
uh,

502
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.570
about if the density's changing,

503
00:18:04.571 --> 00:18:05.370
why does the,

504
00:18:05.370 --> 00:18:07.450
what's so unusual about,

505
00:18:07.451 --> 00:18:09.310
now that we're close to the critical density,

506
00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.610
the thing you have to remember is the critical density also changes with time.

507
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.040
It's based on,

508
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.720
remember the critical density,

509
00:18:16.721 --> 00:18:19.390
it's three h squared over something or other.

510
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.931
Well,

511
00:18:19.931 --> 00:18:23.710
h changes with time because the velocity is more or less the same,

512
00:18:23.711 --> 00:18:25.150
but the distances all change.

513
00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:26.630
<v 2>So it's always been pretty close.</v>

514
00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:27.631
<v 0>Uh,</v>

515
00:18:27.631 --> 00:18:29.880
well what is true is that,

516
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.070
uh,

517
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.560
the way it works out mathematically,

518
00:18:31.561 --> 00:18:36.561
what's true is that the Somme of these two quantities has always been close to

519
00:18:36.631 --> 00:18:37.464
one.

520
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.750
The ratio changes.

521
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:40.500
Uh,

522
00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.150
but the sum of these two,

523
00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.070
if the total Omika,

524
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.380
if the total Omeka starts as one,

525
00:18:46.381 --> 00:18:47.280
it stays at one.

526
00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:48.391
Uh,

527
00:18:48.391 --> 00:18:51.900
but it turns out it's the total omega that you can see that is conserved.

528
00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:52.761
Uh,

529
00:18:52.761 --> 00:18:53.021
and,

530
00:18:53.021 --> 00:18:55.590
and we'll come back to that point a little later.

531
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.520
Okay.

532
00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.353
Uh,

533
00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:04.523
let's see.

534
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.020
Right?

535
00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:08.500
Okay.

536
00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:08.831
So,

537
00:19:08.831 --> 00:19:09.220
yes,

538
00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:09.971
let's go there.

539
00:19:09.971 --> 00:19:10.511
Let's go,

540
00:19:10.511 --> 00:19:12.310
let's go for the observational evidence.

541
00:19:12.311 --> 00:19:13.510
What would you expect it to be?

542
00:19:13.511 --> 00:19:14.344
Here we go.

543
00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:15.363
Uh,

544
00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:17.020
this one again,

545
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.810
we keep going back and forth between these two plots.

546
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:20.560
Uh,

547
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.490
it's what it's all about.

548
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.100
Uh,

549
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.040
so here's empty universe has always,

550
00:19:24.370 --> 00:19:25.000
uh,

551
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:25.833
and then,

552
00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:26.320
uh,

553
00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.370
in this plot,

554
00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:32.140
acceleration means a positive slope.

555
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.350
So if you're moving up in this plot,

556
00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.330
the universe has been accelerating,

557
00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:42.540
is accelerating at that particular red shift at that particular time in the

558
00:19:43.001 --> 00:19:43.834
past.

559
00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.710
So,

560
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:45.071
you know,

561
00:19:45.071 --> 00:19:45.391
the,

562
00:19:45.391 --> 00:19:49.120
the data we've looked at so far kind of look like points along the line like

563
00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:49.660
this.

564
00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.570
That's the demonstration that the universe is now accelerating.

565
00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:53.980
So here's the prediction.

566
00:19:58.040 --> 00:19:59.150
And you know,

567
00:19:59.151 --> 00:20:01.250
here's a magic moment where,

568
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:02.480
uh,

569
00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:03.470
at that point,

570
00:20:03.471 --> 00:20:05.000
this slope is flat.

571
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.223
And so,

572
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:06.560
um,

573
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.251
this side,

574
00:20:07.251 --> 00:20:08.690
it's decelerating.

575
00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:10.550
And on this side it's excellent,

576
00:20:10.551 --> 00:20:11.384
right?

577
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.110
And the question is,

578
00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.660
is it getting further away from,

579
00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.370
uh,

580
00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:19.203
uh,

581
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:19.851
uh,

582
00:20:19.851 --> 00:20:22.460
is it moving up compared to the amputee universe?

583
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:25.070
Or is it moving down compared to the empty universe?

584
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:29.120
Because the empty universe neither accelerates nor decelerates.

585
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.160
That's the definition of an empty universe.

586
00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:32.630
It doesn't have any mass.

587
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.130
It doesn't have any energy.

588
00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.460
The excel or the expansion rate is constant forever.

589
00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:38.420
So,

590
00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:38.810
uh,

591
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:43.100
if you're going this way with respect to that line or going this way with

592
00:20:43.101 --> 00:20:44.210
respect to that line,

593
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:44.781
uh,

594
00:20:44.781 --> 00:20:45.620
you're accelerating.

595
00:20:45.621 --> 00:20:48.070
And if you're coming back going in the other direction,

596
00:20:48.071 --> 00:20:48.970
you're decelerating.

597
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:50.260
So here's,

598
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.390
here's a closed universe,

599
00:20:52.391 --> 00:20:52.691
right?

600
00:20:52.691 --> 00:20:53.460
Which is going to,

601
00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:53.880
uh,

602
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.400
uh,

603
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:54.881
this is,

604
00:20:54.881 --> 00:20:56.650
this is a big crunch universe,

605
00:20:56.651 --> 00:20:59.950
which is going to re collapse because it's decelerating all the time.

606
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:02.170
Now,

607
00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:03.160
interestingly,

608
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:08.470
this turnaround point a where you turn around between accelerating and

609
00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:12.550
decelerating is not so far back into the past.

610
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:13.070
It,

611
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.430
so,

612
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.720
uh,

613
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.050
if,

614
00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:16.090
if you believe this set of parameters,

615
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:16.990
the standard model,

616
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.850
it's it around oh 0.8,

617
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:21.520
we can see stuff at all 0.8.

618
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:22.541
And,

619
00:21:22.541 --> 00:21:22.810
uh,

620
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:25.750
you could hope to go and see things,

621
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:26.440
uh,

622
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.670
even further out.

623
00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:28.510
Uh,

624
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:29.830
turns out it's kind out now,

625
00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:30.460
uh,

626
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.360
right at Oh,

627
00:21:31.361 --> 00:21:33.070
if you only go out to about 0.8,

628
00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:36.760
which is about as far out as the as they did for the first time round,

629
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.310
you're not going to see the turnaround because you know,

630
00:21:39.311 --> 00:21:40.600
it's just more or less flat.

631
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:44.140
You've got a few points out there and you're going to have a tough time telling

632
00:21:44.141 --> 00:21:47.380
the difference between that and that at this point here.

633
00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:49.780
But if you go out just a little bit further,

634
00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:53.020
you might really be able to see this turn around happening.

635
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.000
Unfortunately,

636
00:21:55.001 --> 00:21:57.480
that turns out to be hard observation.

637
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:00.873
Uh,

638
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:06.300
it's hard to see supernovae with red shifts greater than one,

639
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:08.980
uh,

640
00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.870
for a number of different reasons.

641
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.211
First of all,

642
00:22:13.211 --> 00:22:14.044
their fate,

643
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.220
the further away they are,

644
00:22:15.221 --> 00:22:16.120
the faint or they are.

645
00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:18.710
Second of all,

646
00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:21.740
they appear on top of galaxies.

647
00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.200
Obviously they live in galaxies.

648
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:25.940
The further away you look,

649
00:22:25.941 --> 00:22:27.680
the galaxies look smaller.

650
00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:32.630
And so the supernova appear to be super.

651
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.940
The further away you look,

652
00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:34.600
a,

653
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.890
the more of the Gout,

654
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:36.610
more peace,

655
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:38.080
more light from the galaxy,

656
00:22:38.081 --> 00:22:42.730
the Supernova is super imposed on and it becomes harder to separate the light

657
00:22:42.731 --> 00:22:47.200
from the Supernova and the light from the galaxy that it lives in.

658
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.670
And the third part is that the light is red shifted,

659
00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.010
very red,

660
00:22:55.011 --> 00:22:55.550
shifted,

661
00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:57.530
red shifted by a factor of two.

662
00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:01.100
So supernovae give off most of their light in optical light,

663
00:23:01.101 --> 00:23:02.120
which we can observe.

664
00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.580
But by the time they were a red shift of one,

665
00:23:04.581 --> 00:23:06.140
all the wavelengths are doubled.

666
00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.650
And so most of the radiation

667
00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.570
is n the infrared,

668
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.370
just much harder to see from the ground because everything glows in the

669
00:23:18.371 --> 00:23:19.204
infrared.

670
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:19.721
Uh,

671
00:23:19.721 --> 00:23:20.200
and you've,

672
00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:20.681
it's like,

673
00:23:20.681 --> 00:23:20.940
look,

674
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:21.880
as I said before,

675
00:23:21.881 --> 00:23:23.230
it's like looking in the day time.

676
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.550
The whole sky is glowing,

677
00:23:24.551 --> 00:23:25.840
your telescope is glowing.

678
00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:26.470
Uh,

679
00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.860
it's just really hard to make those kinds of observations.

680
00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:31.960
It is possible,

681
00:23:31.961 --> 00:23:32.501
however,

682
00:23:32.501 --> 00:23:32.891
to do.

683
00:23:32.891 --> 00:23:35.860
It's much easier to do this from space.

684
00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.020
Now thanked his fate.

685
00:23:42.021 --> 00:23:43.570
It doesn't matter whether you're an orbiter,

686
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.940
not,

687
00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:47.660
but the other two things are greatly aided by looking from space,

688
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.320
uh,

689
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.250
point to,

690
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.440
uh,

691
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:55.440
you get much better images from space.

692
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.540
Uh,

693
00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:00.770
and you may recall last time I showed you a picture of a supernova and from the

694
00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:01.490
ground,

695
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:01.821
uh,

696
00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:02.181
you know,

697
00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:05.900
it was a little extra light on top of some galaxy and then when you look from

698
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:06.291
space,

699
00:24:06.291 --> 00:24:11.291
the galaxy was clearly delineated and then the supernova was a tiny point in the

700
00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:13.070
outskirts of that galaxy.

701
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:14.090
So it makes it much,

702
00:24:14.091 --> 00:24:15.890
much easier to separate,

703
00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:16.540
uh,

704
00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:16.910
uh,

705
00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.830
the galaxy from the Supernova.

706
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:23.870
And it is also true that the infrared background light

707
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.930
is much fainter

708
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.940
cause you can keep stuff cold out there.

709
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.020
Uh,

710
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.000
the infrared background light as much fainter,

711
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:35.660
uh,

712
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.200
and there's no atmospheric absorption.

713
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:41.703
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

714
00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:42.211
<v 0>yeah.</v>

715
00:24:42.211 --> 00:24:46.410
Atmosphere actually absorbs a large fraction of the infrared light that,

716
00:24:46.411 --> 00:24:46.850
uh,

717
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:47.190
uh,

718
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.060
that hits us.

719
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:49.320
Um,

720
00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.470
that's actually why the greenhouse effect works.

721
00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:57.030
Cause light comes in as optical light and it makes it all the way through.

722
00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:58.800
Then it heats up the surface of the earth.

723
00:24:58.801 --> 00:25:00.270
The earth radiates heat,

724
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.280
which doesn't make it through the atmosphere.

725
00:25:02.281 --> 00:25:03.114
It gets trapped.

726
00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:04.223
Um,

727
00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:05.431
so,

728
00:25:05.431 --> 00:25:05.730
uh,

729
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:08.280
there no atmospheric absorption out there.

730
00:25:08.281 --> 00:25:09.110
And so,

731
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.270
uh,

732
00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:11.730
you have a much easier time doing this from space.

733
00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:14.550
So what they have been doing is,

734
00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:15.181
uh,

735
00:25:15.181 --> 00:25:16.014
recently,

736
00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:17.220
uh,

737
00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.620
people in particular guy named Adam Reece,

738
00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:20.670
uh,

739
00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.280
have been using the space telescope,

740
00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.900
the Hubble Space Telescope to find high red shift

741
00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.533
<v 1>supernova.</v>

742
00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:33.070
<v 0>This,</v>

743
00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:38.070
there is a flaw in the way the space telescope is designed from the point of

744
00:25:38.081 --> 00:25:39.670
view of tried to do this experiment.

745
00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
And the flaw is that it doesn't look at very much of the sky at once and only

746
00:25:45.131 --> 00:25:47.410
looks at a small field of view.

747
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:51.860
Oh phew.

748
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.280
So you don't find many,

749
00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:01.500
cause you're just not looking at that big a part of the Scott.

750
00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:02.520
Uh,

751
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.360
and so,

752
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:04.290
uh,

753
00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:05.040
you can only,

754
00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.050
you only look at a tiny piece of the sky at once,

755
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.280
however they have spent,

756
00:26:08.281 --> 00:26:10.620
because this is of some clear importance.

757
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:11.940
They've spent many,

758
00:26:11.941 --> 00:26:12.331
many,

759
00:26:12.331 --> 00:26:14.420
many hundreds of observing hours,

760
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.000
uh,

761
00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.890
with the space telescope trying to track down a few supernovae at a red shift

762
00:26:19.891 --> 00:26:20.820
greater than one.

763
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:21.721
Uh,

764
00:26:21.721 --> 00:26:23.820
and they have now succeeded in doing so.

765
00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:25.740
So here's what the data look like.

766
00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.700
This is from Adam's recent paper,

767
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:32.541
2004,

768
00:26:32.541 --> 00:26:34.580
I guess it's no longer quite so recent.

769
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:35.410
Uh,

770
00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.400
and this is the plot.

771
00:26:37.401 --> 00:26:37.480
Well,

772
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.080
let me see if I can focus this.

773
00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:41.740
Uh,

774
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.010
it's actually the xerox quality.

775
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:45.120
Uh,

776
00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.760
we have a joke in astronomy that many,

777
00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:48.060
uh,

778
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:52.910
important objects turned out to be a ls [inaudible],

779
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.370
which stands for low significant xerox transients source.

780
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.220
That means you've made a xerox in a little blip,

781
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:00.360
appears on your graph,

782
00:27:00.361 --> 00:27:00.991
and somebody says,

783
00:27:00.991 --> 00:27:03.150
what's that point in the upper right hand corner?

784
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:03.631
And you say,

785
00:27:03.631 --> 00:27:03.721
oh,

786
00:27:03.721 --> 00:27:04.770
that's the xerox machine.

787
00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:05.431
All right,

788
00:27:05.431 --> 00:27:06.900
so I apologize for that.

789
00:27:06.901 --> 00:27:07.830
But look what's happening.

790
00:27:07.831 --> 00:27:08.700
This is red shift.

791
00:27:08.701 --> 00:27:09.241
This is the,

792
00:27:09.241 --> 00:27:11.340
this is the plot we've been looking at before.

793
00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:13.200
Zero Point Five,

794
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.400
1.0,

795
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:16.170
1.5 and two.

796
00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:20.370
And this is the delta m minus m access.

797
00:27:20.371 --> 00:27:23.160
So zero is what you expect,

798
00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:24.840
uh,

799
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.700
the empty universe to have.

800
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:31.340
And he has marked on here a different set of lines from the set of lines I've

801
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.921
been drawing.

802
00:27:31.921 --> 00:27:32.790
But nevertheless,

803
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.320
you can see what's going on.

804
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:35.550
Here are,

805
00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:37.530
these are all supernovae,

806
00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:38.700
uh,

807
00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.570
all the Supernova,

808
00:27:39.571 --> 00:27:40.310
they know,

809
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.470
uh,

810
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.620
these kinds of fuzzy gray points are the ones they found with the space

811
00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:44.454
telescope.

812
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.990
The ones in here are the ground based ones known at the time.

813
00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:50.430
And what they've done is they've,

814
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:50.911
is,

815
00:27:50.911 --> 00:27:55.020
they've averaged them together in different groups of red shift grouping by

816
00:27:55.021 --> 00:27:55.410
Retro.

817
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:56.370
That's the bottom thing.

818
00:27:56.371 --> 00:27:59.910
So each one of these points is an average of many supernovae.

819
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:00.630
Uh,

820
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.090
this point is an average of these two.

821
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.141
Uh,

822
00:28:04.141 --> 00:28:07.710
and then as you get down to lower shifts where they have lots and lots of them,

823
00:28:07.711 --> 00:28:09.000
the precision gets much better.

824
00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:12.570
But you can definitely see what's happening here out to about,

825
00:28:12.571 --> 00:28:12.871
you know,

826
00:28:12.871 --> 00:28:14.310
0.5 0.8,

827
00:28:14.490 --> 00:28:15.390
it's going up.

828
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.960
And then it does definitely seem like it's going down.

829
00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:20.010
Uh,

830
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:23.580
and so there really is now some evidence for this,

831
00:28:23.581 --> 00:28:24.540
for this turnaround.

832
00:28:24.541 --> 00:28:25.374
Now,

833
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.213
uh,

834
00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.890
it Kinda all depends on these two points.

835
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.581
Uh,

836
00:28:29.581 --> 00:28:30.810
I have a rule of thumb.

837
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:34.170
My rule of thumb is you can put your thumb over any one point,

838
00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:34.650
uh,

839
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:36.000
because you never know.

840
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.300
Uh,

841
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.850
what screw up might have happened in any one measurement.

842
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:39.450
Uh,

843
00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:40.140
so,

844
00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:40.470
uh,

845
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:41.790
I can't really do that on the top,

846
00:28:41.791 --> 00:28:44.040
but if I do this okay,

847
00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:46.050
and I make that point go away,

848
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.250
uh,

849
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:52.250
you could still kind of draw a line that keeps going up.

850
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:53.761
Uh,

851
00:28:53.761 --> 00:28:55.590
it would miss this point by a little,

852
00:28:55.591 --> 00:28:56.760
but not by a lot.

853
00:28:57.170 --> 00:28:57.540
Uh,

854
00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.770
it's really this,

855
00:28:58.771 --> 00:28:59.371
that does it.

856
00:28:59.371 --> 00:29:03.870
It's these last two individuals supernovae down there,

857
00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.500
which really make the case that the thing is turning over and coming back down.

858
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:08.930
Now,

859
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:09.763
uh,

860
00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.800
you have to worry a little bit and there's actually a good reason to worry

861
00:29:13.801 --> 00:29:14.400
about,

862
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:14.710
uh,

863
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.940
uh,

864
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.610
the brightnesses of high redshift.

865
00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:17.523
Supernovae.

866
00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:18.010
Uh,

867
00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:21.660
and let me give you one particular reason to worry,

868
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.903
uh,

869
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:25.650
a reason to worry.

870
00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:30.123
<v 1>Uh,</v>

871
00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.470
<v 0>namely gravitational lensing</v>

872
00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.420
member gravitational lensing.

873
00:29:36.930 --> 00:29:37.410
Uh,

874
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:38.870
you stick some mass in,

875
00:29:38.871 --> 00:29:39.091
in,

876
00:29:39.091 --> 00:29:41.620
in the middle between you and the object you're looking at.

877
00:29:41.621 --> 00:29:42.850
It focuses the light.

878
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:45.580
Gravitational lensing makes things look brighter.

879
00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.230
The further away you look at something,

880
00:29:53.231 --> 00:29:56.230
the more likely it is that there's something in between that we'll do the

881
00:29:56.231 --> 00:29:57.064
lensing.

882
00:29:57.520 --> 00:29:58.353
Uh,

883
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.910
so first of all,

884
00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:04.270
0.1 more distant objects,

885
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:09.900
more likely to be lensed

886
00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:15.630
0.2.

887
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.033
Uh,

888
00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.070
if you're out looking for very distant,

889
00:30:20.071 --> 00:30:21.090
very faint objects,

890
00:30:21.091 --> 00:30:22.740
which are the ones you're going to see first,

891
00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:25.550
the bright ones,

892
00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.473
yes.

893
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.353
Ah,

894
00:30:27.850 --> 00:30:28.160
AH,

895
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.080
at the sort of faint limit.

896
00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:33.060
<v 1>Uh,</v>

897
00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:36.120
<v 0>you see abnormally bright things first.</v>

898
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:41.260
I can't even spell that abnormally,

899
00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:43.143
right?

900
00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.033
Things

901
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.420
preferentially.

902
00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:56.020
So you could imagine if you're basing your entire cosmology on one or two high

903
00:30:56.241 --> 00:30:57.650
redshift supernovae,

904
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:59.450
you got to ask yourself the question.

905
00:30:59.451 --> 00:31:01.720
Supposing those happen to be lent.

906
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.040
So let me now go back to this plot.

907
00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:07.220
Here's the plot.

908
00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.400
So if they're lensed,

909
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:14.660
then they're brighter than they seem to be brighter than they actually are.

910
00:31:14.661 --> 00:31:16.430
They're actually fainter than they look.

911
00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.360
That would have the effect that this one actually ought to be up here.

912
00:31:20.361 --> 00:31:22.040
And this one actually ought to be up here

913
00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.410
if they were lens by some amount.

914
00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.380
So if these things are lenses,

915
00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:33.460
then the true correct position of these points would be higher up in the graph

916
00:31:33.461 --> 00:31:34.420
than it actually is.

917
00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:37.750
So this is the effect of lending.

918
00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.260
Now when it was only one of these points,

919
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:45.790
uh,

920
00:31:45.790 --> 00:31:47.720
people were very concerned about this.

921
00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:53.080
Now that there's two people or a lot less concerned because you know,

922
00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:57.020
it would be pretty bad luck to have both of the supernovae,

923
00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.153
uh,

924
00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.510
that you know about it.

925
00:31:59.511 --> 00:32:01.010
High redshift turnout to be lance.

926
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:02.870
If they had 20,

927
00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:03.890
uh,

928
00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:07.880
this whole problem would go away because there'd be no possible way that you

929
00:32:07.881 --> 00:32:08.930
could be so unlucky.

930
00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:09.700
Well,

931
00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:14.330
you could calculate the probability that you would be so unlucky as to have the

932
00:32:14.331 --> 00:32:16.670
first 20 high redshift supernovae,

933
00:32:16.671 --> 00:32:17.180
you know,

934
00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.000
happened to line up right behind some massive object.

935
00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:22.640
And it would be some incredibly small probability.

936
00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.810
So each time you observe another one of these things out here and it's low,

937
00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.550
you get around this lending problem,

938
00:32:28.551 --> 00:32:29.270
I should say,

939
00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.340
this is only one of a number of problems.

940
00:32:31.341 --> 00:32:33.140
These things are very hard to observe.

941
00:32:33.141 --> 00:32:34.520
They're very faint objects.

942
00:32:34.940 --> 00:32:35.300
Uh,

943
00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:36.440
but nevertheless,

944
00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:37.850
I think at the moment,

945
00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:38.750
uh,

946
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:39.290
the,

947
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:40.123
uh,

948
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:41.030
uh,

949
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:44.390
the evidence for this turnaround is highly suggestive,

950
00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.300
but not yet holy conclusive.

951
00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:49.033
Uh,

952
00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:50.300
all right.

953
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:52.760
But now suppose,

954
00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:54.990
uh,

955
00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:55.260
you,

956
00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:59.070
you actually want to get higher accuracy than just seeing the thing turned

957
00:32:59.071 --> 00:33:02.430
around because suppose dark energy

958
00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.980
isn't constant.

959
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:09.720
Suppose,

960
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:10.340
uh,

961
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:15.340
the big rep really is going to happen then d e density increases with time.

962
00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:24.030
This leads to the big rep as we discussed last time.

963
00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:31.610
And therefore the dark energy density was Wes in the past,

964
00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:34.720
then in now

965
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:39.310
and therefore,

966
00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:40.413
uh,

967
00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:42.460
the deceleration,

968
00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.093
<v 1>uh,</v>

969
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:47.820
<v 0>the moment of balance between deceleration.</v>

970
00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.710
Okay.

971
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:49.543
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

972
00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:50.220
<v 0>Uh,</v>

973
00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.680
between deceleration and acceleration,

974
00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:53.370
uh,

975
00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:55.140
was more recent

976
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.640
because as you go back in the past,

977
00:33:59.641 --> 00:34:01.710
under this new scenario where there's,

978
00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:04.150
where the density of dark energy is,

979
00:34:04.151 --> 00:34:05.460
is increasing with time,

980
00:34:05.461 --> 00:34:07.770
it's therefore decreasing as you go into the past.

981
00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:09.090
So as you go into the past,

982
00:34:09.091 --> 00:34:10.110
two things happen.

983
00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:15.410
The a density of matter gets bigger and the density of dark energy gets less.

984
00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:19.350
So there's an additional effect that will make that crossover happen earlier.

985
00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:20.640
Uh,

986
00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:21.473
and so,

987
00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:21.870
uh,

988
00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:23.300
to summarize on these,

989
00:34:23.301 --> 00:34:23.860
uh,

990
00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:24.360
uh,

991
00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.193
by now,

992
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:26.263
uh,

993
00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.330
uh,

994
00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:30.870
almost boring and ubiquitous plots here.

995
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.063
All right.

996
00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:33.691
Uh,

997
00:34:33.691 --> 00:34:34.710
so here's,

998
00:34:36.830 --> 00:34:39.500
here's the kind of standard cosmological model.

999
00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:40.580
Uh,

1000
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.190
and if it's going to be a big Oh,

1001
00:34:43.191 --> 00:34:46.430
and then this predicts in the future that it's going to go something like that.

1002
00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:47.930
If it's a big rip,

1003
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:53.030
then what happens is it's doing this and it's going to do that

1004
00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.060
because the dark,

1005
00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:57.500
the dark matter,

1006
00:34:57.830 --> 00:34:58.280
uh,

1007
00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.220
takes over from the dark energy more,

1008
00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:01.940
uh,

1009
00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:06.940
more recently in the past because you've also lost oomph in your dark energy,

1010
00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.700
but the dark energy is getting bigger and bigger with time.

1011
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.730
This then translates onto this plot.

1012
00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:18.453
<v 1>Uh,</v>

1013
00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:21.910
<v 0>and here is well,</v>

1014
00:35:21.911 --> 00:35:22.750
we expect it.

1015
00:35:22.751 --> 00:35:24.940
Here's the kind of prediction into the future,

1016
00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:26.560
a future,

1017
00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:28.420
a future of observations,

1018
00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:28.920
uh,

1019
00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.670
further into the past in time.

1020
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:34.300
And what you would expect is that this would sort of Keel over earlier.

1021
00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:36.400
So this is

1022
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:40.890
a big rip cosmology,

1023
00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.530
big rip cosmology has,

1024
00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:44.310
uh,

1025
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:45.270
the same

1026
00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:52.830
big rip would have the same expansion rate now

1027
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:58.650
the same acceleration now,

1028
00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:01.323
<v 1>uh,</v>

1029
00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:06.260
<v 0>but more acceleration in the future than you expect and</v>

1030
00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:12.900
more deceleration in the past.

1031
00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.673
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1032
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:22.970
<v 0>And so it's important not just to see this turn around,</v>

1033
00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:23.960
uh,

1034
00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:28.220
but to actually plot in detail where that line goes.

1035
00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.110
Because if it turns out that you're,

1036
00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:34.580
that you're supernovae are kind of lined up like this or they're kind of lined

1037
00:36:34.581 --> 00:36:35.241
up like this,

1038
00:36:35.241 --> 00:36:38.720
you already know that there are a bunch of them like this or that they're kind

1039
00:36:38.721 --> 00:36:42.740
of lined up like this makes a huge difference in how you understand the dark

1040
00:36:42.741 --> 00:36:46.520
energy and tells you something new about the dark energy.

1041
00:36:46.521 --> 00:36:46.881
In fact,

1042
00:36:46.881 --> 00:36:49.820
it tells you the first thing you know about the dark energy.

1043
00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:51.170
Other than that it exists,

1044
00:36:51.410 --> 00:36:56.000
namely that it would be getting bigger or less big or maybe staying constant as

1045
00:36:56.001 --> 00:36:56.834
a function of time.

1046
00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.620
Yes.

1047
00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:57.960
<v 2>If,</v>

1048
00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:58.640
um,

1049
00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.960
if they do celebration was,

1050
00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.060
was earlier than expected,

1051
00:37:02.061 --> 00:37:02.600
you know,

1052
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:03.433
following the big,

1053
00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:04.443
big rip.

1054
00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.940
Wouldn't we have seen it already since we can already see SPEC.

1055
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.540
<v 0>Ah,</v>

1056
00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:08.290
so,

1057
00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:08.650
uh,

1058
00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:11.410
these three lines at about,

1059
00:37:11.411 --> 00:37:11.740
you know,

1060
00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.090
old 0.8 are very,

1061
00:37:13.091 --> 00:37:13.990
very close together.

1062
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:19.710
They don't diverged all that much until a red shift until the turnaround at

1063
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:21.460
about a red shift of 0.8 to one.

1064
00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.800
Now in principle,

1065
00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:26.650
you could go out and make a whole bunch of,

1066
00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:27.340
you know,

1067
00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:31.600
measure 10,000 of these things that are red shift to 0.5 and try and distinguish

1068
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:32.703
that way.

1069
00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:34.390
Okay,

1070
00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:35.890
so how are we going to figure this out?

1071
00:37:35.891 --> 00:37:38.470
The space telescope kind of finds these things one at a time.

1072
00:37:38.471 --> 00:37:40.660
It's going to be off like puff to make this distinction.

1073
00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:41.650
Uh,

1074
00:37:41.650 --> 00:37:45.730
but let me introduce you to two projects currently underway.

1075
00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.820
The goal of which is a to figure this out.

1076
00:37:48.821 --> 00:37:49.011
And they,

1077
00:37:49.011 --> 00:37:49.260
they,

1078
00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.750
they do the exact two things that we've just been talking about.

1079
00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.330
One is designed to go deep to a high red shift.

1080
00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:57.250
Uh,

1081
00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:58.960
and the other is designed to do many,

1082
00:37:58.961 --> 00:37:59.321
many,

1083
00:37:59.321 --> 00:38:01.000
many at intermediate red shift.

1084
00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:01.691
Uh,

1085
00:38:01.691 --> 00:38:02.410
so,

1086
00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:02.710
uh,

1087
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:04.810
there is something called the,

1088
00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:05.530
uh,

1089
00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.090
so there's a space mission,

1090
00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:10.480
a space telescope.

1091
00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:11.320
Uh,

1092
00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:15.010
this is called j Damn stands for joint,

1093
00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:16.720
uh,

1094
00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.720
joint dark energy mission and the joint means joint between NASA and the

1095
00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:28.030
Department of Energy.

1096
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.050
Whoever named this stuff,

1097
00:38:29.051 --> 00:38:33.370
dark energy gets a little prize because now we get money from the Department of

1098
00:38:33.370 --> 00:38:34.203
Energy to study it.

1099
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:35.203
Uh,

1100
00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.420
let's see.

1101
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:37.731
And,

1102
00:38:37.731 --> 00:38:39.400
and the idea of which,

1103
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:42.370
an example is something called snap one proposal.

1104
00:38:42.371 --> 00:38:44.280
That's the Super Nova

1105
00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.540
cosmology supernova acceleration

1106
00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.113
<v 3>probe.</v>

1107
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.040
<v 0>This is,</v>

1108
00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:57.940
this is an example of one mission proposed to be jaded.

1109
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:59.020
Uh,

1110
00:38:59.020 --> 00:38:59.710
this is,

1111
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.861
uh,

1112
00:38:59.861 --> 00:39:00.760
an example.

1113
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.013
Uh,

1114
00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:02.981
and,

1115
00:39:02.981 --> 00:39:03.101
uh,

1116
00:39:03.101 --> 00:39:05.860
it's an example I'm familiar with because we have people here at Yale who were

1117
00:39:05.861 --> 00:39:06.694
working on it.

1118
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.481
Uh,

1119
00:39:07.481 --> 00:39:08.740
and there are competitors,

1120
00:39:08.741 --> 00:39:10.330
they haven't actually selected the thing.

1121
00:39:10.331 --> 00:39:11.050
Yep.

1122
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:11.740
Uh,

1123
00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.000
and what is this going to be?

1124
00:39:13.001 --> 00:39:18.001
Is it's a space telescope that differs from the current space telescope in two

1125
00:39:18.491 --> 00:39:19.480
major ways.

1126
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:22.060
One is it has a wide field of view,

1127
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.670
uh,

1128
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:30.550
dozens of times bigger than the current space telescope.

1129
00:39:30.570 --> 00:39:32.260
Cause all it can do to I,

1130
00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.330
let me see if I can remember it.

1131
00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:36.010
It's like 20,

1132
00:39:36.011 --> 00:39:36.250
it's,

1133
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:40.030
it's over a hundred times bigger field of view than the current space telescope.

1134
00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:42.640
So the discovery rate of supernovae will be much,

1135
00:39:42.641 --> 00:39:45.820
much greater and it's optimized for the infrared.

1136
00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:52.230
And so it's goal is to find,

1137
00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:53.340
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1138
00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:56.160
<v 0>Many supernovae</v>

1139
00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:57.890
<v 1>okay.</v>

1140
00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.180
<v 0>With red shift,</v>

1141
00:39:59.181 --> 00:40:00.170
greater than one,

1142
00:40:00.171 --> 00:40:01.820
perhaps out to a redshift of two.

1143
00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.130
That's its purpose in life.

1144
00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:05.240
Uh,

1145
00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:05.841
and,

1146
00:40:05.841 --> 00:40:06.674
uh,

1147
00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.513
uh,

1148
00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:12.380
proposals are currently being evaluated for this launch time is supposed to be,

1149
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.690
well the optimists say 2013,

1150
00:40:14.691 --> 00:40:17.120
but that means congressional funding this year,

1151
00:40:17.121 --> 00:40:22.121
which is actually unlikely more likely 2016 or 2017 and then we'll know.

1152
00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:22.840
Yes,

1153
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.410
<v 1>yes.</v>

1154
00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:24.570
Sort of optimization frame.

1155
00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:27.890
Are there any other predictive sort of benefits of it?

1156
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.950
<v 0>Oh,</v>

1157
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:33.950
it's very nice to look at the infrared because anything at high redshift chimed

1158
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:37.530
in the infrared until if you're looking at hi Richard Galaxies,

1159
00:40:37.531 --> 00:40:39.240
how galaxies evolve and so forth.

1160
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.900
Uh,

1161
00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:40.770
this is useful too.

1162
00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:45.000
There's actually a big debate over whether you totally set the thing up to do

1163
00:40:45.001 --> 00:40:49.680
nothing but supernovae or whether you sort of generalize it and spent half your

1164
00:40:49.681 --> 00:40:51.030
time doing other things.

1165
00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:51.630
Uh,

1166
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:53.670
and there's one other project at least,

1167
00:40:53.671 --> 00:40:55.100
which I'll describe next week that,

1168
00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.000
that these guys are interested in doing.

1169
00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:57.690
Uh,

1170
00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:01.620
but there's a real trade off between making it a general purpose telescope like

1171
00:41:01.621 --> 00:41:04.890
the Hubble or doing this one thing especially well.

1172
00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:05.910
And that's,

1173
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:06.151
you know,

1174
00:41:06.151 --> 00:41:08.100
the kind of thing that's currently under discussion.

1175
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:14.270
So snap is one example of where people might go in the future.

1176
00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:16.120
Another is a,

1177
00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:20.040
a ground based project called the large

1178
00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:21.613
<v 3>uh,</v>

1179
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:27.820
<v 0>synoptic survey telescope.</v>

1180
00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.320
This is otherwise known as l.

1181
00:41:31.321 --> 00:41:33.030
S.

1182
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.030
S.

1183
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.030
T.

1184
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.030
L.

1185
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.320
S.

1186
00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.280
The plan is this,

1187
00:41:34.281 --> 00:41:37.640
and this has a lot of other science beside this.

1188
00:41:37.820 --> 00:41:42.820
It's going to do a full skirt survey of the sky survey of the sky every three

1189
00:41:44.271 --> 00:41:45.104
days.

1190
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:49.820
So it's gonna every three nights at marches across the entire sky cakes,

1191
00:41:49.821 --> 00:41:54.350
a really deep image of the sky and saw the consequence of this for cosmology is

1192
00:41:54.351 --> 00:41:59.351
that you find every low and intermediate,

1193
00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:03.183
uh,

1194
00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:08.490
red shift supernova that's tens to hundreds of thousands,

1195
00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:09.940
tens of thousands,

1196
00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:11.500
maybe 10,000 a year

1197
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:16.870
approximately.

1198
00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:19.270
So you'll find lots of these things.

1199
00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:20.260
So first of all,

1200
00:42:20.261 --> 00:42:24.400
you build up incredible statistics out to a red shift of about a half.

1201
00:42:24.850 --> 00:42:27.700
So huge statistics,

1202
00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:29.080
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1203
00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.420
<v 0>to z of about a half.</v>

1204
00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:33.940
That's kind of where it's limit is going to kick in.

1205
00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.080
Uh,

1206
00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.490
and you also,

1207
00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:37.540
uh,

1208
00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:42.540
can study the details of subclasses of supernovae.

1209
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:48.610
So this is important because you know,

1210
00:42:48.611 --> 00:42:52.780
if you're fooling yourself because the distance supernovae are different somehow

1211
00:42:52.781 --> 00:42:53.980
from the local supernovae,

1212
00:42:53.981 --> 00:42:55.300
their fainter for some reason.

1213
00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:55.810
Uh,

1214
00:42:55.810 --> 00:42:57.160
but in the local sample,

1215
00:42:57.161 --> 00:43:00.010
only one in a hundred is the of the fate kind.

1216
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:01.900
If you've got 10,000,

1217
00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.310
that means you've got,

1218
00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:03.881
you know,

1219
00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:07.420
a sample of a hundred of the weird subclass that's causing your trouble.

1220
00:43:07.421 --> 00:43:09.340
So this will be hugely helpful,

1221
00:43:09.341 --> 00:43:13.750
not only in beating down the statistics so that you can tell the difference

1222
00:43:13.751 --> 00:43:18.100
between lines that are really quite close to each other theoretical predictions

1223
00:43:18.101 --> 00:43:19.180
that are close to each other.

1224
00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:23.590
But it also will test the systematic problems that you might have different

1225
00:43:23.591 --> 00:43:27.610
kinds of supernovae and generally enhance your overall confidence that you know

1226
00:43:27.611 --> 00:43:28.600
what you're talking about.

1227
00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:29.740
Also,

1228
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:30.190
uh,

1229
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:31.870
these kinds of sky surveys,

1230
00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:32.381
uh,

1231
00:43:32.381 --> 00:43:34.000
are of benefit for many,

1232
00:43:34.001 --> 00:43:36.100
many other fields of astronomy.

1233
00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.970
The issue with this is the following statistic,

1234
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:40.600
uh,

1235
00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.690
30 terabytes of data per night,

1236
00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:46.713
right?

1237
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:50.680
That's a 30,000 Gig per night,

1238
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.340
uh,

1239
00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:53.710
30 million megabytes every night.

1240
00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:54.131
Uh,

1241
00:43:54.131 --> 00:43:55.930
and so this is not something that us,

1242
00:43:55.931 --> 00:43:57.730
normal astronomers can handle.

1243
00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:58.211
Uh,

1244
00:43:58.211 --> 00:44:03.211
and so the recent news from the LSST project is Google has joined the project a

1245
00:44:04.451 --> 00:44:04.741
ad.

1246
00:44:04.741 --> 00:44:05.690
So we're bringing in,

1247
00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:06.610
we're bringing in the,

1248
00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:06.851
yeah,

1249
00:44:06.851 --> 00:44:07.440
right?

1250
00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:07.660
Uh,

1251
00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.580
we're bringing in the big boys for this.

1252
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:10.001
Uh,

1253
00:44:10.001 --> 00:44:12.490
and I think this is kind of Google universe,

1254
00:44:12.491 --> 00:44:13.120
right?

1255
00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:13.953
Uh,

1256
00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:14.621
because it's,

1257
00:44:14.621 --> 00:44:15.160
uh,

1258
00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:15.551
you know,

1259
00:44:15.551 --> 00:44:16.210
you take all,

1260
00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:17.620
you do this for a few years,

1261
00:44:17.770 --> 00:44:19.900
then you've done a hundred sky surveys.

1262
00:44:19.901 --> 00:44:23.020
You can then add them all up and get incredibly deep data.

1263
00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:24.730
And so I guess Google figured,

1264
00:44:24.731 --> 00:44:24.941
you know,

1265
00:44:24.941 --> 00:44:29.941
if somebody is going to be a piling up a catalog of the entire known universe,

1266
00:44:30.611 --> 00:44:31.860
they'd better a part of it.

1267
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.880
Uh,

1268
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.690
and it's fortunate for us because they're probably the only people in the world

1269
00:44:36.691 --> 00:44:38.790
who can create a data database,

1270
00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:39.001
a,

1271
00:44:39.001 --> 00:44:40.740
of data coming in at this rate.

1272
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:41.141
Uh,

1273
00:44:41.141 --> 00:44:42.060
and I should say,

1274
00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:42.891
keep in mind too,

1275
00:44:42.891 --> 00:44:45.810
that you have to actually not just acquire this data,

1276
00:44:45.811 --> 00:44:49.440
you have to actually look at it each night because you've got to actually

1277
00:44:49.441 --> 00:44:53.550
discover these supernovae in real time because they're going to be gone three

1278
00:44:53.551 --> 00:44:55.920
weeks from now or four or three months from now.

1279
00:44:56.130 --> 00:44:59.550
And so you not only have to pile up 30 terabytes of data every night,

1280
00:44:59.551 --> 00:45:02.430
you've got to actually look at it and find all the interesting object.

1281
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.260
So,

1282
00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:04.093
uh,

1283
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:05.160
uh,

1284
00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:09.540
the plan currently is to operate for a at least five and probably 10 years.

1285
00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:10.830
They have a site picked out,

1286
00:45:10.831 --> 00:45:12.330
they're going to put it down in Chile,

1287
00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:13.710
actually on the mountain where,

1288
00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:14.800
uh,

1289
00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:17.010
our tiny telescope is a,

1290
00:45:17.011 --> 00:45:17.910
and so we're,

1291
00:45:17.911 --> 00:45:20.640
we're actually like this because they'll pay for some of the infrastructure

1292
00:45:20.641 --> 00:45:21.474
costs down there.

1293
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:22.330
Uh,

1294
00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:24.750
hopefully for all of the infrastructure costs.

1295
00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:27.360
But a negotiation is still in progress.

1296
00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:27.961
And,

1297
00:45:27.961 --> 00:45:28.250
uh,

1298
00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:28.580
uh,

1299
00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:28.700
they,

1300
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.500
they have a whole design plant for this.

1301
00:45:31.501 --> 00:45:32.700
It's all ready to go.

1302
00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:33.330
Uh,

1303
00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:35.820
but it's going to cost a fair amount of money to build them.

1304
00:45:35.821 --> 00:45:36.990
What's even more important,

1305
00:45:36.991 --> 00:45:39.360
it's going to cost an enormous amount of money to run,

1306
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:40.170
uh,

1307
00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.030
just on a night to night basis.

1308
00:45:42.031 --> 00:45:46.680
So actually the construction costs of the telescope or not the dominant costs,

1309
00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:50.310
the dominants costs are building the software and running the program.

1310
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:55.550
And it turns out that's harder to get some rich guy to give you $100 million for

1311
00:45:57.330 --> 00:45:59.400
a and a it's ground face,

1312
00:45:59.401 --> 00:46:02.160
so it doesn't fall into the NASA category.

1313
00:46:02.430 --> 00:46:04.710
And so it isn't clear what the money is gonna come from.

1314
00:46:04.711 --> 00:46:08.010
They actually have a fair amount of private money already piled up there.

1315
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:08.251
Uh,

1316
00:46:08.251 --> 00:46:08.551
they,

1317
00:46:08.551 --> 00:46:09.241
and as I say,

1318
00:46:09.241 --> 00:46:10.290
they have detailed,

1319
00:46:10.291 --> 00:46:11.880
elaborate plans for this thing.

1320
00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.990
You can look at their website,

1321
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.530
uh,

1322
00:46:13.530 --> 00:46:13.921
in fact,

1323
00:46:13.921 --> 00:46:16.320
you will have to look at their website because that's going to be part of the

1324
00:46:16.321 --> 00:46:17.130
problem set.

1325
00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:17.963
Um,

1326
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:18.451
and,

1327
00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:18.661
uh,

1328
00:46:18.661 --> 00:46:23.460
so these are two of the projects which are currently,

1329
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:24.540
uh,

1330
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:25.740
being designed.

1331
00:46:25.741 --> 00:46:28.020
And hopefully soon we'll be built,

1332
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:28.411
uh,

1333
00:46:28.411 --> 00:46:33.411
that are going to try and push this a little further and try and find out more

1334
00:46:34.231 --> 00:46:37.890
about the dark energy than simply the fact that it exists.

1335
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.540
Okay.

1336
00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.440
Um,

1337
00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:43.650
let me put back up this,

1338
00:46:43.651 --> 00:46:44.484
uh,

1339
00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:48.000
a piece of paper with details.

1340
00:46:48.001 --> 00:46:50.070
Remember no sections on Monday,

1341
00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:51.600
no sections on Monday.
