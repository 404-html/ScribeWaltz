1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.630
We were talking about relativity and uh,

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.160
where we ended up last time,

3
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:11.520
we're talking about special relativity and all the weird things that happened to

4
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:12.570
space and time.

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.550
And the question arose,

6
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.270
you know,

7
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.210
what prompted Einstein to think these thoughts?

8
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:19.890
And we talked a little bit about,

9
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.120
uh,

10
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.200
the fact that the speed of light is always the same no matter what the velocity

11
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:26.550
of the person observing it.

12
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.563
And how,

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.930
uh,

14
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.680
that,

15
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.100
uh,

16
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.100
then if you take that literally it tells you that space and time are weird and

17
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.650
a,

18
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.340
and are not constant and absolute the way you might think.

19
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:40.470
They are a in a Newtonian sense,

20
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:40.830
but,

21
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:41.100
uh,

22
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.100
but very according to the velocity of the observer and uh,

23
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.990
uh,

24
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.000
in,

25
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.300
in these various ways having to do with that parameter gamma.

26
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.640
And so Einstein's great stroke of genius was not to try and fix up these little

27
00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:02.571
problems with the experiment in some sort of patchwork kind of way or to try and

28
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:05.270
evoke a minor change in,

29
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.780
in the laws of nature,

30
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.380
but to recognize that this was a very big deal.

31
00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.670
And that would involve changing fundamentally how we think space.

32
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:15.504
And time work.

33
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.690
So this is a very famous fable of science.

34
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:18.901
You know,

35
00:01:18.901 --> 00:01:23.640
this is the thing where Einstein is a young man and he's sort of,

36
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.503
uh,

37
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.710
uh,

38
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.730
he sort of a rebel and he refuses to take his exam and he pisses off his

39
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:30.564
professors,

40
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.991
uh,

41
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:32.010
and the consequences.

42
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:33.660
He doesn't get a good job.

43
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.261
And,

44
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:34.480
uh,

45
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.650
he gets this job at the patent office right in a,

46
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:38.251
in Bern,

47
00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:42.660
Switzerland where he labors away in obscurity and then suddenly in a blaze of

48
00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:44.610
glory glory in 1905,

49
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.470
he publishes three papers,

50
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.450
one of which is about relativity,

51
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.940
one of which is the start of quantum mechanics.

52
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.760
And the other one of which proves that Adam's exist.

53
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.391
Uh,

54
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:59.391
and so these are three of the greatest papers of all time published in a single

55
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.160
year by some clown who was a clerk in a patent office.

56
00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.641
All right?

57
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:03.391
Very big deal.

58
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:04.620
This happened in 1905,

59
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:05.454
two years ago.

60
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.230
It was the hundredth anniversary of this.

61
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:08.940
This was declared Einstein year,

62
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:11.130
and all sorts of fuss was made about it.

63
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.980
So there are various morals that can be drawn from this.

64
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.551
Uh,

65
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:18.630
and I'm going to draw several of them in what you might call increasing order of

66
00:02:18.631 --> 00:02:19.560
sophistication.

67
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.401
So the,

68
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:20.940
uh,

69
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.210
uh,

70
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.530
the low sophistication,

71
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:25.080
moral moral number one here is,

72
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.651
you know,

73
00:02:25.651 --> 00:02:27.420
about the genius in obscurity.

74
00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.880
No Genius in obscurity,

75
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.321
uh,

76
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:33.570
can revolutionize science.

77
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.263
Uh,

78
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.570
this is a very dangerous way to approach the Einstein story because it,

79
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.080
you know,

80
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.250
it's really easy to convince yourself that you are a genius in obscurity.

81
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.910
Uh,

82
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.240
many people have convinced themselves that they are genius is it?

83
00:02:51.241 --> 00:02:52.190
It's your obscurity.

84
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.210
I know about this cause they send me email,

85
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.350
uh,

86
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.560
and they explained to me in their email that they send me,

87
00:02:58.561 --> 00:02:59.270
and this happens to,

88
00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.531
you know,

89
00:02:59.531 --> 00:02:59.950
any,

90
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.970
any scientists,

91
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:04.630
particularly someone working in astrophysics or fundamental physics of some

92
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:05.080
kind.

93
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.560
They explained to me why Einstein was wrong.

94
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.281
Uh,

95
00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:09.911
anti deed,

96
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:13.570
why all science known to date is wrong and they are bright.

97
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.651
And then they said,

98
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:14.861
you know,

99
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.540
nobody believed Einstein either.

100
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.800
Uh,

101
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.701
and uh,

102
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:21.730
as if that was somehow meant to make you believe them.

103
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.820
They tend to write these things all in capital letters.

104
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:25.290
You know,

105
00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.510
uh,

106
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.871
there's a,

107
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:28.300
there's a kind of pathology when they used to write,

108
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.570
when they used to do it on,

109
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.090
on Pencil and paper,

110
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.920
they would write in such a way that they covered every inch of the paper and you

111
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:36.071
know,

112
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:36.791
they'd write something,

113
00:03:36.791 --> 00:03:39.100
then they'd ride around the margins back to the top.

114
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.530
Uh,

115
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.960
there's some psychological thing.

116
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:41.794
I don't know what it is.

117
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.760
Uh,

118
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.211
but,

119
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:43.590
uh,

120
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.200
uh,

121
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.200
but the legend of Einstein prompts a whole bunch of people to think that,

122
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:49.900
uh,

123
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.171
uh,

124
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:52.120
that they too might be a patent.

125
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.953
Clark's yes.

126
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.240
Huh.

127
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.630
Oh,

128
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.463
well look,

129
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.460
uh,

130
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.490
you can look up the astronomy department website of Harvard,

131
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.821
Yale,

132
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:02.920
and Princeton and you'll find a whole bunch of people,

133
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:03.754
I suppose.

134
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.490
Uh,

135
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.010
I also have have published papers on black holes and things that made their way

136
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:09.611
into the media.

137
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:12.520
I've actually had a fall off on this because I haven't been,

138
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.330
you know,

139
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.510
quoted opining about black holes in the New York Times recently,

140
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:16.800
but,

141
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.040
but 10 years ago,

142
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.270
uh,

143
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.350
uh,

144
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.070
that,

145
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.281
well,

146
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:22.910
I'll explain that in a couple of weeks there,

147
00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.890
there was an interesting,

148
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:25.210
an interesting thing that happened.

149
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.930
Uh,

150
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.630
in any case,

151
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.671
uh,

152
00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:27.220
you know,

153
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.470
if,

154
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.790
if,

155
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.890
if you want to publicize your theory,

156
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:33.790
what you do is you find a bunch of fairly prominent people in the field and you

157
00:04:33.791 --> 00:04:35.800
send them a big screen saying,

158
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:36.490
you know,

159
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.060
uh,

160
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.600
uh,

161
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.530
you will regret it if you do not appreciate my genius.

162
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.763
Uh,

163
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.720
uh,

164
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.620
sometimes I do.

165
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:48.580
We have a little file in the library called the crank file in the astronomy

166
00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:49.570
department library.

167
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.130
And from time to time,

168
00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.670
uh,

169
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:52.031
you know,

170
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:54.670
we assigned graduate students to figure out why they're wrong.

171
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.183
Uh,

172
00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.830
uh,

173
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.430
we haven't done,

174
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.450
we haven't done that lately.

175
00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.291
Sometimes,

176
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:00.400
sometimes people,

177
00:05:00.401 --> 00:05:00.700
uh,

178
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.620
people amusing themselves by answering them.

179
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.960
Uh,

180
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.020
this can get you into various kinds of trouble.

181
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.510
Uh,

182
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.250
there was the gentleman with the theory of the universe who,

183
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:14.020
which he illustrated in colored pencils a and while he was serving his time at a

184
00:05:14.021 --> 00:05:17.350
medium security institution in Wa in Washington State.

185
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.431
And we thought,

186
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:19.264
you know,

187
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.440
what a great way to,

188
00:05:20.441 --> 00:05:20.740
you know,

189
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.800
much better way to be spending your time in prison than some other things you

190
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:24.311
could think of.

191
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:26.530
So we sent him a bunch of textbooks and stuff.

192
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.300
Then we started getting letters back saying,

193
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.650
after I finished my sentence,

194
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:30.221
my sentence,

195
00:05:30.221 --> 00:05:34.240
I'm coming to study with you and explaining why he was innocent of the crime of

196
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:35.320
which he had been committed.

197
00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.390
And,

198
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.700
uh,

199
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.700
so at a certain point we started returning things,

200
00:05:39.701 --> 00:05:40.140
you know,

201
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.230
no terribly sorry.

202
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:42.630
This individual has left Yale.

203
00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:43.464
We gone to where he is,

204
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.280
whoever this is,

205
00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:48.010
carry a rose who carried on this conversation for a while.

206
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.611
Uh,

207
00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:50.860
and so you have to be a little bit careful.

208
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:51.580
And there though,

209
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.361
there was the guy,

210
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:53.200
this was amazing.

211
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.860
Uh,

212
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.410
there was a guy who showed up at the start of the semester.

213
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.130
He's dressed a suit and tie,

214
00:05:58.131 --> 00:05:59.240
carrying a briefcase,

215
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.040
walks into the department office.

216
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:01.341
It says,

217
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:02.210
where's my classroom?

218
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.610
I'm supposed to teach cosmology.

219
00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.841
And uh,

220
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:06.340
you know,

221
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.430
look very respectable.

222
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:09.620
The secretary thoughts not with us.

223
00:06:09.621 --> 00:06:09.981
You're not.

224
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:11.610
So send them over to the physics department.

225
00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.340
He asked the same question in the physics department.

226
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.500
It just walked in off the street with a,

227
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.800
uh,

228
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.990
with a briefcase full of his textbook.

229
00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.053
Uh,

230
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.690
and he was very annoyed that we hadn't assigned him a classroom and assigned

231
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:25.130
students to come and learn,

232
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.461
you know,

233
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:27.230
his particularly theory of cosmology.

234
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.710
Uh,

235
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.330
and in the anti you had to be escorted off the premises and asked never to

236
00:06:32.331 --> 00:06:32.661
return.

237
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:33.494
So yeah,

238
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.810
all kinds of patent clerks in the world,

239
00:06:35.811 --> 00:06:37.010
but most of them aren't.

240
00:06:37.011 --> 00:06:37.844
Einstein.

241
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.540
That's kind of the moral and the reason you can tell you,

242
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:43.040
you asked whether I read these things,

243
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:45.740
it's very easy to tell whether there's anything,

244
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.910
uh,

245
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.880
that you might immunize the Mike be useful to read.

246
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.993
Uh,

247
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.120
because what these people tend to say when they are not worth reading is they

248
00:06:56.121 --> 00:06:56.451
sent,

249
00:06:56.451 --> 00:06:59.030
tend to say that all previous science is wrong.

250
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.010
I am revolutionizing things.

251
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.870
Einstein is wrong,

252
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:03.733
they say,

253
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.130
but Einstein didn't say that Newton was wrong.

254
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.720
That wasn't what happened.

255
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.640
That wasn't how revolution works.

256
00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:11.330
Uh,

257
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:16.100
you revolutionize science only if the new theory

258
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:20.900
encompasses what was previously no.

259
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.420
<v 1>Okay.</v>

260
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.710
<v 0>The previous theories,</v>

261
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.830
and this is this business of the parameter gamma where,

262
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.311
uh,

263
00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:33.800
under appropriate circumstances,

264
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.080
a gamma is one.

265
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.240
And under those circumstances,

266
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.200
you reproduce the theory that was already in existence.

267
00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:43.103
<v 1>It's,</v>

268
00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:47.150
<v 0>and so,</v>

269
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:47.810
you know,

270
00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.620
there's been hundreds and hundreds of years of Newtonian physics,

271
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:53.120
all of which is basically right,

272
00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:54.050
one way or another.

273
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.330
So whatever your new idea is,

274
00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:01.130
has to encompass all the things that we're right about the old idea.

275
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:03.590
And so you don't overturn Newton.

276
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:08.830
What you do is you demonstrate that Newton's theory is only a part of a bigger

277
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:09.860
theory.

278
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.880
And then the bigger theory is the new theory.

279
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.380
And it encompasses new kinds of data and explain to new kinds of things while

280
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:20.210
simultaneously not overturning all the things that you know are right about the

281
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:20.961
old theory.

282
00:08:20.961 --> 00:08:25.250
And this is the thing that the people who wish they were Einstein but aren't,

283
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:26.030
uh,

284
00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.020
don't understand.

285
00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:27.480
Uh,

286
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.630
and so anytime you see something where you're,

287
00:08:29.631 --> 00:08:31.800
where they're going to revolutionize all of science,

288
00:08:31.801 --> 00:08:36.500
it's certainly wrong because there's a large fraction of science in current

289
00:08:36.501 --> 00:08:38.090
existence that is correct.

290
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:41.810
And you have to understand that and you have to encompass it and go beyond that.

291
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.200
Uh,

292
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.610
but it's not going to get overturned.

293
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:47.480
The planets aren't going to stop going and capillary in orbit because somebody

294
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:48.350
has a new idea.

295
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.840
And so it has to encompass the old idea.

296
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:56.370
Recently in conjunction in part with Einstein year or two years ago,

297
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.410
the historians of science have been,

298
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:00.930
have been rethinking what's going on with Einstein,

299
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.420
uh,

300
00:09:01.420 --> 00:09:03.420
and what happened in that patent office.

301
00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.830
And there's a new,

302
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:05.310
uh,

303
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:07.770
kind of idea that actually it was,

304
00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.670
it wasn't that he was working in obscurity and some in,

305
00:09:10.671 --> 00:09:10.930
in,

306
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:11.220
you know,

307
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:15.630
flipping burgers or something that his work in the patent office was very

308
00:09:15.631 --> 00:09:18.210
important to the way he developed his theory.

309
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:18.691
And that,

310
00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.250
one of the reasons Einstein,

311
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:20.940
uh,

312
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.690
did what he did was he was working in a patent office and not in a university

313
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.090
because what was he doing in the patent office?

314
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:27.541
Well,

315
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:30.090
it turns out that in the early part of the 20th century,

316
00:09:30.091 --> 00:09:33.870
one of the big set of inventions that was coming through were ways of

317
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:35.460
synchronizing clocks.

318
00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:36.390
Uh,

319
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:38.760
it turns because railroads had just been invented.

320
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:43.350
And until then you had had a situation where every city had its own time.

321
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.220
Every city,

322
00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:46.110
every city had a little observatory.

323
00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:48.510
They would figure out when the sun was directly overhead,

324
00:09:48.511 --> 00:09:50.160
they would proclaim that to be noon.

325
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.540
They'd fire off a whistle.

326
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:53.010
Everyone would set all their clocks.

327
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.800
But that meant that they didn't have time zones.

328
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.160
And that meant that every little town had a different time system.

329
00:09:59.161 --> 00:10:03.210
There was Boston time was different from Hartford time with different buy new

330
00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:04.380
from New York time by,

331
00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:04.621
you know,

332
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:08.070
22 and a half minutes or whatever the appropriate amount would be.

333
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.960
And that's all fine if you move between these cities slowly,

334
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.300
if you start running trains,

335
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.500
you've got to have,

336
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.860
the train system has to have a unified system of,

337
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.640
of time.

338
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.140
Otherwise they run into each other,

339
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.771
uh,

340
00:10:22.771 --> 00:10:24.810
and there were crashes and terrible things.

341
00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.700
And so then you have to have,

342
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:26.911
okay,

343
00:10:26.911 --> 00:10:30.180
then you have to have Boston and New York having the same time.

344
00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.190
So how do you synchronize those clocks?

345
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:32.700
Well,

346
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:34.410
you've just invented the Telegraph.

347
00:10:34.411 --> 00:10:35.390
So you send an,

348
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:40.730
you send an electromagnetic signal at the speed of light from Boston to New York

349
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.880
and then back again in order to synchronize your clocks.

350
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:46.560
And there were various inventions that,

351
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.580
that Einstein was reviewing in the patent office to accomplish this.

352
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:51.563
And so he,

353
00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:52.670
in his job,

354
00:10:52.671 --> 00:10:53.760
in his day job,

355
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:58.850
he spent all his time thinking about clocks and time and signals moving at the

356
00:10:59.671 --> 00:11:00.504
speed of light.

357
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.100
So perhaps it isn't surprising that he had deep insights into these kinds of

358
00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:05.580
things.

359
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.180
So,

360
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:06.510
uh,

361
00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:06.800
the,

362
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.410
the,

363
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:07.801
the,

364
00:11:07.801 --> 00:11:12.300
the current feeling among at least some historians of science is that the patent

365
00:11:12.301 --> 00:11:13.134
office,

366
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.280
uh,

367
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.090
was in fact key to Einstein's thinking.

368
00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:19.770
So he didn't come out of obscurity at all.

369
00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:23.400
He came out of the only place where the surroundings were,

370
00:11:23.401 --> 00:11:25.140
such that you would have thought these thoughts.

371
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:26.640
Uh,

372
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.430
this is associated with a,

373
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:29.180
uh,

374
00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.380
a historian of science named Peter Galison,

375
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:36.890
among others who wrote a book called Einstein's clocks and Poincare's maps to

376
00:11:37.291 --> 00:11:41.090
try and demonstrate how the practical work these people were doing influenced

377
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.450
their theoreticals work.

378
00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:43.284
Yes.

379
00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.261
Well,

380
00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:46.621
no,

381
00:11:46.621 --> 00:11:47.131
he was,

382
00:11:47.131 --> 00:11:49.020
he triggered by one particular event.

383
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:54.460
What prompted him to think about this was a whole series of experiments that had

384
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:55.294
been carried out,

385
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:56.561
all of which,

386
00:11:56.561 --> 00:11:57.670
as I mentioned last time,

387
00:11:57.671 --> 00:11:58.870
one way or another,

388
00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.620
uh,

389
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.820
demonstrated,

390
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.590
uh,

391
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:05.290
that this business at the speed of light was constant in all reference frames.

392
00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:05.981
Uh,

393
00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:06.814
and,

394
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:07.341
and,

395
00:12:07.341 --> 00:12:10.450
and that there was no ether through,

396
00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:14.410
which was the medium that was imagined to exist through which electromagnetic

397
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:15.880
waves were supposed to pass.

398
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.500
And there had been a series of experiments to try and detect slight changes in

399
00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:22.330
the speed of light when you put it on a railroad,

400
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.070
when you put it on after train,

401
00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:24.341
right.

402
00:12:24.341 --> 00:12:25.930
It's all about trains and elevators,

403
00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:27.070
which had just been invented.

404
00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.150
Uh,

405
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.840
and,

406
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.170
uh,

407
00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:31.990
but it wasn't one particular triggering event.

408
00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.700
There was this whole range of things.

409
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:34.601
And Einstein,

410
00:12:34.601 --> 00:12:35.201
it should be said,

411
00:12:35.201 --> 00:12:38.620
was by far not the only person thinking about this.

412
00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.290
We call the transformation Lorentz transformations.

413
00:12:41.291 --> 00:12:43.300
Cause there was a guy named Lorenz who thought them up,

414
00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:44.170
uh,

415
00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.080
mathematicians like punk Carre,

416
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:46.630
uh,

417
00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:47.920
physicists like Minkowski.

418
00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:50.830
There were a whole bunch of people thinking about this and it was an urgent

419
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:52.030
problem in physics.

420
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:53.020
Uh,

421
00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:53.741
and uh,

422
00:12:53.741 --> 00:12:55.390
so that had to be dealt with.

423
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.520
And if Einstein hadn't existed,

424
00:12:57.521 --> 00:12:58.810
it might've taken a little longer,

425
00:12:58.811 --> 00:12:59.380
but we would've,

426
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:01.150
we would've gotten special relativity,

427
00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:01.630
uh,

428
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.463
in the end.

429
00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.380
That's not necessarily true of general relativity.

430
00:13:05.381 --> 00:13:05.621
He has,

431
00:13:05.621 --> 00:13:06.730
I'll explain in a second,

432
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:07.900
general relativity,

433
00:13:07.901 --> 00:13:09.160
if Einstein hadn't existed,

434
00:13:09.161 --> 00:13:14.020
general relativity might not have happened until the 1960s because it was not

435
00:13:14.021 --> 00:13:16.420
prompted by a range of experimental results.

436
00:13:16.421 --> 00:13:18.250
The other bunch of experimental results,

437
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:18.650
uh,

438
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.320
that were prominent at the time where the,

439
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.740
where the atomic physics experiments that led to quantum mechanics,

440
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.380
which Einstein had a hand in as well.

441
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.383
Okay.

442
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.373
Uh,

443
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.560
so now let me move on to two general relativity.

444
00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:32.930
That's a,

445
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.050
that's a good moment to make this transition.

446
00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:35.981
Uh,

447
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:40.000
so general relativity known as Gr for short,

448
00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:40.870
uh,

449
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.910
is now a theory of gravity.

450
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.500
So the part of Newtonian physics that is overthrown or,

451
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.070
uh,

452
00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:50.400
uh,

453
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.110
encompassed as I was saying,

454
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.560
uh,

455
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.720
by special relativity are the laws of motion.

456
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.203
Uh,

457
00:13:57.450 --> 00:14:00.150
now general relativity has the law,

458
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.650
those same laws of motion but also has embedded in it a theory of gravity,

459
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:08.730
which is fundamentally different from the way Newton thought about gravity.

460
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.710
So Newtonian gravity,

461
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:13.310
uh,

462
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.641
yes,

463
00:14:13.641 --> 00:14:18.290
thought of as a force to particular force.

464
00:14:18.291 --> 00:14:19.550
It's the force of gravity.

465
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:20.990
There's a little equation.

466
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:21.390
Uh,

467
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.880
the force of gravity is equal to the gravitational constant g times the mass of

468
00:14:25.881 --> 00:14:29.720
one object times the mass of the other object divided by the distance between

469
00:14:29.721 --> 00:14:30.554
them square.

470
00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:32.210
Uh,

471
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.610
and the odd thing,

472
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:38.300
and this was sort of the starting point of Einstein's thought,

473
00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:41.270
the odd thing is these masses.

474
00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.260
And because remember somebody asked me last time what is mass?

475
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.020
And I gave you a whole thing about the inertial mass,

476
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:56.480
how much it resists being pushed.

477
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:59.270
And that comes about from,

478
00:14:59.440 --> 00:14:59.840
you know,

479
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.550
f equals m a.

480
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.940
And so the kind of mass that I defined last time is the inertial mass,

481
00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.640
how much it resists being pushed.

482
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.380
Uh,

483
00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.770
and so conceptually the mass that's in the,

484
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:16.110
in,

485
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.170
in Newton's equations of gravity,

486
00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.480
conceptually that's a different kind of mass.

487
00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:22.400
It doesn't have to be the same number.

488
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.140
This is gravitational mass because it's defined differently.

489
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:33.490
It's defined not by how much an object resists being pushed by a force,

490
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.240
any force,

491
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:40.450
but by how much the object create a particular kind of force.

492
00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:41.821
So in this,

493
00:15:41.821 --> 00:15:43.670
it's how much it resists forces in this.

494
00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.710
It's how much the force is created.

495
00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:47.540
And these are conceptually different things.

496
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:52.870
It turns out that to the best experimental evidence that you,

497
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:54.260
uh,

498
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.280
that you can muster,

499
00:15:55.281 --> 00:15:56.300
which by now is many,

500
00:15:56.301 --> 00:15:57.500
many decimal places.

501
00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.800
These two kinds of mass are exactly the same.

502
00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:01.970
This has,

503
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.450
uh,

504
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:06.230
an experimental consequence that was known already to Galileo in the 17th

505
00:16:06.231 --> 00:16:06.950
century.

506
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:07.281
Look,

507
00:16:07.281 --> 00:16:07.721
what happens.

508
00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:12.721
Supposing [inaudible] is the earth and m two is some object that is that you're

509
00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:15.470
dropping from a high tower.

510
00:16:15.471 --> 00:16:16.080
So,

511
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:16.490
uh,

512
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.380
the stories Galileo goes to the top of,

513
00:16:18.381 --> 00:16:21.290
that's how our piece that he drops a cannon ball or something and watches it,

514
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.280
watches it fall.

515
00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:23.450
Then what happens?

516
00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.733
Uh,

517
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.250
you,

518
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:30.250
you substitute a f gravity into the equation of motion

519
00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:35.510
and what do you get?

520
00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.970
So you're using a particular kind of force.

521
00:16:37.971 --> 00:16:41.750
So you get g m of the object am of the earth,

522
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:42.970
uh,

523
00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:47.240
divided by distance squared where the distance is the distance between the

524
00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:48.320
centers of the object.

525
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:52.520
So this is basically the distance to the center of the earth is equal to the

526
00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:54.530
mass of the object times its acceleration.

527
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.510
And look,

528
00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.950
if this mass is the same as that mass they canceled.

529
00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.170
What does that mean?

530
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:04.520
So when you can do this,

531
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:07.010
it means it means the motion,

532
00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:11.150
the acceleration of the object doesn't depend on its mass.

533
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.360
The acceleration of the object will be the same for any object because if it has

534
00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:18.320
greater inertia,

535
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:22.010
it also generates by exactly a proportional amount,

536
00:17:22.011 --> 00:17:23.060
a greater force.

537
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.530
And so everything falls from the tower at the same rate.

538
00:17:27.531 --> 00:17:28.280
And that's what,

539
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.330
that's what Galileo did.

540
00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:32.330
He brought up a cannon ball and a wooden ball and a whole bunch of other objects

541
00:17:32.331 --> 00:17:34.880
dropped them and discovered that,

542
00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:35.990
uh,

543
00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.550
that the Greeks had been wrong.

544
00:17:37.551 --> 00:17:39.380
The Greeks and match and the heavier the thing is,

545
00:17:39.381 --> 00:17:40.580
the faster it falls.

546
00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:44.810
But the only reason you think that is because of dropping things like feathers,

547
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.420
which do fall kind of slowly and erotically.

548
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.070
That has nothing to do with gravity.

549
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.040
That's air pressure,

550
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:51.090
right?

551
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:55.410
And so if you drop things that are heavy enough so that air pressure isn't

552
00:17:55.411 --> 00:17:56.100
important,

553
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.420
they fall at the same rate.

554
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:02.270
So that is the experiment that proves that gravitational mass is the same as

555
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.123
inertial mass.

556
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:07.020
All other forces don't have this consequence.

557
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:07.980
There is,

558
00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.030
for example,

559
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:09.560
I'll,

560
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:11.250
let me not draw on the corner here.

561
00:18:11.251 --> 00:18:12.240
How be just like the,

562
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.051
the cranks,

563
00:18:13.051 --> 00:18:13.381
you know,

564
00:18:13.381 --> 00:18:16.230
I'll start drawing all the way around the edge of the,

565
00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.580
the thing here.

566
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:18.121
Uh,

567
00:18:18.121 --> 00:18:19.290
so let us go on.

568
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.393
Uh,

569
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.430
let's see.

570
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.630
Uh,

571
00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:22.111
there is,

572
00:18:22.111 --> 00:18:22.750
for example,

573
00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:23.270
uh,

574
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.480
electrical force,

575
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:26.443
which has,

576
00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:27.830
uh,

577
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.780
a very similar kind of equation.

578
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:30.950
That's a constant,

579
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.440
the times the charge of one object times the charge of another object divided by

580
00:18:39.261 --> 00:18:40.640
the distance between them squared,

581
00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:45.560
that looks almost identical to what the gravitational force looks like.

582
00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:49.730
But because the charge of an object isn't equal to its mass,

583
00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.940
different objects respond differently to,

584
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.570
uh,

585
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:54.170
put in,

586
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:54.351
uh,

587
00:18:54.351 --> 00:18:54.710
when,

588
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.660
when an electric force is exerted on them.

589
00:18:56.661 --> 00:18:58.460
If you compare a proton,

590
00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.600
which is a bass of sub Tomic particle of charge one with a positron,

591
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.840
which is a low mass particle of charge one,

592
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.000
and you put the same amount of force on them,

593
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.870
the positron will move much more because it has so much less mass.

594
00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:17.170
And so different objects respond in different ways to all forces except it.

595
00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.780
So the unusual thing about gravity,

596
00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.120
so gravity is weird,

597
00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:25.370
<v 1>okay?</v>

598
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.420
<v 0>Because</v>

599
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:27.940
<v 1>yeah,</v>

600
00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.690
<v 0>the gravitational mass turns out to be</v>

601
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:35.910
exactly equal,

602
00:19:35.911 --> 00:19:39.270
at least to the best possible measurement to the inertial mass.

603
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:41.000
<v 1>Okay?</v>

604
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
<v 0>And there's no excuse within Newtonian theory to explain why that might be and</v>

605
00:19:47.841 --> 00:19:49.400
why all objects move,

606
00:19:49.401 --> 00:19:49.911
therefore,

607
00:19:49.911 --> 00:19:52.220
move the same subject when,

608
00:19:52.221 --> 00:19:52.641
when,

609
00:19:52.641 --> 00:19:53.210
uh,

610
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:53.630
uh,

611
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.370
when put in a gravitational field.

612
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:57.020
Okay.

613
00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:58.790
So this bugged Einstein.

614
00:19:58.791 --> 00:19:59.910
This is the kind of thing that,

615
00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.231
that,

616
00:20:00.231 --> 00:20:01.310
that bothered him.

617
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:02.443
And so,

618
00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.350
uh,

619
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.630
to explain this and other,

620
00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.633
uh,

621
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.530
related sort of conceptual issues,

622
00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:10.370
uh,

623
00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:13.340
he promulgated a completely different theory.

624
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.653
Uh,

625
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.943
namely.

626
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:17.143
Uh,

627
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:18.710
so Einstein says,

628
00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:23.351
okay,

629
00:20:23.351 --> 00:20:26.500
so gravity Einstein says is not a force.

630
00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:30.700
That's not the right way to think about it.

631
00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.033
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

632
00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.813
<v 0>Uh,</v>

633
00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.980
and so what,

634
00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:37.110
how does this work then?

635
00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:37.710
All right.

636
00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:42.710
So 0.1 objects move in a straight line when they are not in a straight line.

637
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:48.230
In the absence

638
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:49.063
<v 1>of a force.</v>

639
00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.280
Yeah.

640
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:53.791
<v 0>This is,</v>

641
00:20:53.791 --> 00:20:54.091
you know,

642
00:20:54.091 --> 00:20:55.740
Newton's first law or something.

643
00:20:55.741 --> 00:20:56.070
You know,

644
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.760
if you're,

645
00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:56.971
uh,

646
00:20:56.971 --> 00:21:00.810
if you're moving at a constant velocity will continue moving in the same

647
00:21:00.811 --> 00:21:03.660
direction at the same speed unless something happens,

648
00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.490
like a force is applied to you.

649
00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:08.910
If gravity isn't a force that should still be true,

650
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.950
objects are moving in straight lines,

651
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.520
uh,

652
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.301
all the time.

653
00:21:12.301 --> 00:21:13.530
Whether there's a gravitate,

654
00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:15.300
whether there's gravity around or not.

655
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:15.760
Uh,

656
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.980
that seems very odd because we know perfectly well the things that when you have

657
00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:22.260
a gravitational force and you're in an orbit,

658
00:21:22.261 --> 00:21:23.370
you go around in a circle,

659
00:21:23.371 --> 00:21:24.630
not in a straight line at all.

660
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:25.940
So how does a,

661
00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:28.140
an Einstein reconcile this with reality?

662
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:28.771
Uh,

663
00:21:28.771 --> 00:21:30.600
and that's part two of the theory.

664
00:21:30.601 --> 00:21:35.400
Part two of the theory is that the presence of mass

665
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:39.330
inertial mass now,

666
00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.553
uh,

667
00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.610
create

668
00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.140
curvature

669
00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.180
in space,

670
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.531
time,

671
00:21:47.531 --> 00:21:48.520
space and time.

672
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:49.780
<v 1>Okay.</v>

673
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.280
<v 0>Now how does that help?</v>

674
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.710
That helps because,

675
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:54.340
uh,

676
00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.320
because you have to then go back and think,

677
00:21:56.321 --> 00:21:58.930
what do you mean by going in a straight line?

678
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:00.310
If you're in a curved space?

679
00:22:00.311 --> 00:22:01.840
And I'll give you some examples of this,

680
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.200
uh,

681
00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.490
that you can see in a minute.

682
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:04.653
Uh,

683
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.760
what you mean by a straight line is the shortest distance between two points.

684
00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:14.743
Now,

685
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:16.140
<v 1>okay,</v>

686
00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:21.140
<v 0>we know from experience or many of us know from experience that on a curved</v>

687
00:22:21.511 --> 00:22:22.290
space,

688
00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:22.770
uh,

689
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:23.340
the,

690
00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.120
uh,

691
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.630
shortest difference between two points is not exactly what you expect it to be.

692
00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:28.290
Uh,

693
00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:32.250
has anyone flown on an airplane from here to Asia,

694
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.420
for example,

695
00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.340
fly from New York to Beijing?

696
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:37.033
Uh,

697
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:39.660
so let's make a map a flat map.

698
00:22:39.661 --> 00:22:41.340
So here's a flat space,

699
00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:41.970
uh,

700
00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:42.803
north,

701
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:43.733
east,

702
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.371
west,

703
00:22:44.371 --> 00:22:45.180
south.

704
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.320
Here's New York,

705
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:47.640
here's Beijing.

706
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.670
And you might imagine if things were flat,

707
00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.470
that the way you would get in,

708
00:22:52.471 --> 00:22:55.080
the quickest way that the airlines would save money,

709
00:22:55.081 --> 00:22:55.381
you know,

710
00:22:55.381 --> 00:22:56.214
because they don't,

711
00:22:56.310 --> 00:23:00.270
that is that they would fly directly east because it's more or less at the same

712
00:23:00.271 --> 00:23:01.650
latitude in New York and Beijing.

713
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.420
But that isn't what happens.

714
00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:04.920
That isn't what happens at all.

715
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.060
What you do,

716
00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:06.601
if you,

717
00:23:06.601 --> 00:23:09.290
if you fly that route or if you go the other way to,

718
00:23:09.291 --> 00:23:09.590
to,

719
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.261
to Europe,

720
00:23:10.261 --> 00:23:11.490
wherever it is that you're going,

721
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:12.743
um,

722
00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.960
is you fly this way,

723
00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.110
you go way up north,

724
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:21.150
you've looked down halfway through,

725
00:23:21.151 --> 00:23:22.020
there's the Arctic.

726
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:23.580
Why do you do that?

727
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.980
It's because the earth isn't flat.

728
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.600
The earth is a sphere.

729
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.090
And so what it really looks like is this.

730
00:23:30.091 --> 00:23:30.540
Here's,

731
00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:30.991
here's,

732
00:23:30.991 --> 00:23:31.950
here's the earth.

733
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.153
Uh,

734
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.180
here's New York,

735
00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:37.680
here's Beijing.

736
00:23:37.681 --> 00:23:42.360
And you fly this way because that's the shortest distance across a,

737
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.240
the surface of a sphere between two points.

738
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:45.640
Uh,

739
00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.940
I have a severe somewhere.

740
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:48.103
Um,

741
00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:49.880
let's see.

742
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.720
Here's a sphere,

743
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:52.220
<v 2>uh,</v>

744
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.380
and uh,

745
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:55.700
uh,

746
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.070
<v 0>this line here,</v>

747
00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:58.970
uh,

748
00:23:58.970 --> 00:24:00.290
think of this as the equator.

749
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:02.000
And if you go from here to here,

750
00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:05.960
it would be the shortest distance between the two points would be to go right

751
00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:06.741
across the equator.

752
00:24:06.741 --> 00:24:08.120
But we're not going on the equator.

753
00:24:08.121 --> 00:24:09.320
We're in the northern hemisphere.

754
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:12.980
So now I'm going to tip this upward so that these two things are both in the

755
00:24:12.981 --> 00:24:16.910
northern hemisphere and now this line goes up and across.

756
00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.760
And if I tip it all the way up so that he,

757
00:24:20.761 --> 00:24:21.051
you know,

758
00:24:21.051 --> 00:24:24.830
so that you would be dealing with two cities on the opposite side of the world

759
00:24:24.831 --> 00:24:25.041
as,

760
00:24:25.041 --> 00:24:26.090
as New York and Beijing,

761
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.560
and close enough it goes,

762
00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.620
the closest line between them doesn't go around this way.

763
00:24:30.621 --> 00:24:32.840
It goes straight up over the top.

764
00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:35.900
So if you project that onto a flat map,

765
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:37.220
it looks like this,

766
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:38.420
but in fact,

767
00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:42.170
a on a sphere on the surface of this sphere,

768
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:44.990
that is the shortest distance between those two points.

769
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.940
It's the exact same distance as it would be,

770
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.350
uh,

771
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.600
in,

772
00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.321
in the equator.

773
00:24:48.321 --> 00:24:52.070
You just tip the thing up and it's clear that this is the long way round.

774
00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:57.820
So if you have a curved space and uh,

775
00:24:58.620 --> 00:24:58.911
uh,

776
00:24:58.911 --> 00:25:02.750
and you're trying to get in the shortest way from one point to another and you

777
00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:04.520
don't know you're on a curved space,

778
00:25:04.521 --> 00:25:06.350
you would interpret it as a flat space,

779
00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:11.030
then you will interpret the path that you take as curved.

780
00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:16.240
And so Einstein's statement is that the presence of mass doesn't exert a

781
00:25:17.451 --> 00:25:18.770
gravitational force.

782
00:25:18.771 --> 00:25:20.300
That's the wrong way to think about it.

783
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:23.900
What it does is he creates a curvature in the space time.

784
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:28.340
And so then objects traveling from one place to another.

785
00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:29.210
Uh,

786
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:30.380
move in,

787
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:34.850
move in straight lines to define just the shortest distance between those two

788
00:25:34.851 --> 00:25:35.330
points.

789
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:37.820
But if we're not taking the curvature into account,

790
00:25:37.821 --> 00:25:39.830
it looks like it's going around in circles.

791
00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:41.643
All right.

792
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:43.850
Tough concept.

793
00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.230
The sheet is supposed to represent spacetime.

794
00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:49.020
Uh,

795
00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:50.430
spacetime is,

796
00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:51.330
and now,

797
00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:51.660
uh,

798
00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:52.920
now I got to explain that,

799
00:25:52.921 --> 00:25:53.720
right?

800
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:54.553
<v 2>Uh,</v>

801
00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.293
so,

802
00:25:57.260 --> 00:25:57.690
uh,

803
00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.040
<v 0>what is space time?</v>

804
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.903
<v 2>Uh,</v>

805
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:04.880
<v 0>because it's space time that's doing the curving.</v>

806
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.800
Uh,

807
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:06.320
it's,

808
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.530
you can think of it as a four dimensional,

809
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.280
as a four dimensional,

810
00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:11.900
a coordinate system,

811
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:13.430
uh,

812
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:15.200
where the four dimensions are,

813
00:26:15.201 --> 00:26:17.360
the three familiar spatial dimensions,

814
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:17.661
x,

815
00:26:17.661 --> 00:26:17.931
Y,

816
00:26:17.931 --> 00:26:20.570
Z and t for time.

817
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:23.660
And you could understand where any given event,

818
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.800
where an event is something that happens can be identified with four numbers.

819
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:29.270
It's spacial position.

820
00:26:29.271 --> 00:26:32.030
That's three numbers and the time at which it occurs.

821
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.680
Now in order to get these things into the same units,

822
00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:40.520
you have to actually represent it to this as the speed of light times time

823
00:26:40.521 --> 00:26:44.260
because that track multiplying by the speed of light turns time,

824
00:26:44.261 --> 00:26:49.200
units into space units cause this is a miles per hour space per time.

825
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:54.620
So one year of time is the equivalent of one light year of distance.

826
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.220
That's how it converts.

827
00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:03.840
Uh,

828
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.490
and so,

829
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:06.510
uh,

830
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:10.830
one interesting thing and of course this sheet there was a two dimensional space

831
00:27:10.831 --> 00:27:14.160
and only had x and y that could identify any point on the sheet.

832
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.400
So the metaphor is to use to spacial dimensions to represent what is actually a

833
00:27:20.911 --> 00:27:21.930
for uh,

834
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.000
conceptually afforded mentioned space.

835
00:27:24.001 --> 00:27:26.340
That's why it's a metaphor and not something real.

836
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:27.413
Yes.

837
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:31.583
Uh,

838
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.610
yes,

839
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:33.180
yes,

840
00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.260
absolutely correct.

841
00:27:34.261 --> 00:27:36.150
Does gravity bend time too?

842
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.220
It has an effect on time.

843
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:40.050
Similar to time dilation.

844
00:27:40.051 --> 00:27:41.190
When you're going really fast,

845
00:27:41.191 --> 00:27:43.080
if you get really close to a back black hole,

846
00:27:43.081 --> 00:27:44.160
your clocks will slow down.

847
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.750
Yeah.

848
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:46.583
Yes.

849
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:48.413
Why is that?

850
00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:48.990
Uh,

851
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.810
let me,

852
00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:50.400
uh,

853
00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.580
next time I'll write down the Schwab trialed metric and I'll try and answer that

854
00:27:53.581 --> 00:27:54.414
question.

855
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:55.343
Um,

856
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:55.890
let me,

857
00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:57.570
let me go on here for a minute and,

858
00:27:57.571 --> 00:28:00.690
and point out an important thing about this,

859
00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:01.950
uh,

860
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:02.430
this,

861
00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:02.611
uh,

862
00:28:02.611 --> 00:28:03.450
agreement here,

863
00:28:03.451 --> 00:28:04.284
which is,

864
00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.130
uh,

865
00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:07.380
that means the earth in its motion.

866
00:28:07.381 --> 00:28:08.310
For example,

867
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:10.140
in one year,

868
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:13.050
the time coordinate moves one light year,

869
00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.090
which is 10 to the 16 meters.

870
00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:19.830
The space coordinate moves two Pi Times.

871
00:28:19.831 --> 00:28:21.030
The Sami major axis,

872
00:28:21.031 --> 00:28:22.620
which is one astronomical unit,

873
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:24.023
uh,

874
00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:28.470
that two Pi Times 1.5 times 10 to the 11 meters,

875
00:28:28.471 --> 00:28:30.510
that's something like 10 to the 12 meters.

876
00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:35.220
So the Earth moves 10,000 times further in time.

877
00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.650
Then it moves in space in a year.

878
00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:43.010
And that means that the earth's or the earth's motion in spacetime is almost

879
00:28:43.801 --> 00:28:47.670
precisely a straight line going straight forward in time.

880
00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:48.870
So here's time.

881
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:49.501
Here's,

882
00:28:49.501 --> 00:28:50.850
I don't know if the x axis,

883
00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:53.430
and you could imagine that as time goes on,

884
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.430
the earth moves around the sun.

885
00:28:56.431 --> 00:28:57.420
So it's x axis.

886
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:58.620
So it's x coordinate,

887
00:28:58.621 --> 00:29:00.540
goes back and back and back and forth.

888
00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:01.770
Here's The sun,

889
00:29:02.430 --> 00:29:02.850
which,

890
00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:03.120
uh,

891
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:03.391
you know,

892
00:29:03.391 --> 00:29:04.320
wiggles a little bit,

893
00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.360
much less than the earth as we discussed.

894
00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:06.991
Uh,

895
00:29:06.991 --> 00:29:07.620
but this,

896
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:07.861
uh,

897
00:29:07.861 --> 00:29:10.800
this picture here is inaccurate because in fact,

898
00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:11.843
this,

899
00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:12.931
uh,

900
00:29:12.931 --> 00:29:13.890
this distant here,

901
00:29:13.891 --> 00:29:15.090
which is half a year,

902
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:19.500
is 10,000 times longer than this distance here,

903
00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:21.210
which is half an orbit.

904
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:22.200
Uh,

905
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.033
and so,

906
00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:24.150
uh,

907
00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:25.320
and so in fact,

908
00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:30.120
the earth's motion is represented by something that's almost exactly a straight

909
00:29:30.121 --> 00:29:30.361
line,

910
00:29:30.361 --> 00:29:33.690
so much so that I couldn't possibly draw the wiggle in a way that you could see

911
00:29:33.691 --> 00:29:33.810
it.

912
00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:34.710
So here's the earth,

913
00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:35.370
uh,

914
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:38.550
going forward in time and the wiggle is really small.

915
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:42.490
That's not surprising because the gravitational force of,

916
00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.180
uh,

917
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:48.180
of the sun is small enough so that the Earth's orbit is correctly described by

918
00:29:48.521 --> 00:29:50.380
Newtonian physics.

919
00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.620
And so this is one of those situations where you have a Newtonian,

920
00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:54.733
uh,

921
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:56.560
a Newtonian physics,

922
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:57.783
uh,

923
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:02.200
in relatively low gravitational fields and ask the gravitational field to get

924
00:30:02.201 --> 00:30:03.034
stronger,

925
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:03.460
uh,

926
00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.290
weird relativistic effects kick in,

927
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:06.640
but that doesn't happen for the earth.

928
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:07.653
So there's,

929
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:08.200
uh,

930
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:13.200
the number is this Schwartzwald radius divided by distance is the measure of how

931
00:30:15.401 --> 00:30:16.390
relativistic,

932
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:18.370
uh,

933
00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:20.620
and orbit is.

934
00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.440
And if this number is small,

935
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:28.990
then you get correct answers from the new Tony in theory,

936
00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:32.920
and we can work it out.

937
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:34.450
Dishwasher radius of the sun,

938
00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.250
three times 10 to the three meters,

939
00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.320
the distance from the earth to the sun,

940
00:30:38.321 --> 00:30:40.690
1.5 times 10 to the 11 meters,

941
00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.240
that's two times 10 to the minus eight.

942
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:44.550
Uh,

943
00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:45.760
and that's a small number.

944
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.910
So earth works fine in a Newtonian sense.

945
00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:50.133
Yes.

946
00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:52.240
Are the reason orbital radius,

947
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:57.270
that is the distance of the moving object from the center of the gravitating

948
00:30:57.611 --> 00:30:58.910
thing that's making the,

949
00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:00.310
the curvature happened.

950
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:00.940
Yeah.

951
00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.560
So yes is the answer.

952
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.030
It's the radius of the orbit.

953
00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:04.893
Yes.

954
00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:07.150
<v 3>Is the theory of general relativity</v>

955
00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:10.120
theory that would probably get it.

956
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:11.620
Third visit actually have equation.

957
00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:12.930
<v 0>Oh yes.</v>

958
00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:13.090
Uh,

959
00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:14.800
does it have a questions associated with it?

960
00:31:14.801 --> 00:31:15.540
You Bet.

961
00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:15.761
Uh,

962
00:31:15.761 --> 00:31:16.690
you don't want to see them.

963
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.823
Uh,

964
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.280
there's a branch of mathematics called differential geometry,

965
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.060
uh,

966
00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:22.781
because the,

967
00:31:22.781 --> 00:31:23.471
what happens is,

968
00:31:23.471 --> 00:31:23.681
you know,

969
00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:28.360
this curvature stuff is all geometry and the problem is that the further away

970
00:31:28.361 --> 00:31:29.590
you get from an object,

971
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:31.390
the less the space is curved.

972
00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:33.880
So the amount of on the sphere,

973
00:31:33.881 --> 00:31:34.990
on the surface of the sphere,

974
00:31:34.991 --> 00:31:36.760
it's curved the same way everywhere.

975
00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:40.570
So the equations that describe the curvature or the same at any point on a

976
00:31:40.571 --> 00:31:41.230
sphere,

977
00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:45.010
but you can imagine something that starts out with strong curvature and tails

978
00:31:45.011 --> 00:31:45.371
off.

979
00:31:45.371 --> 00:31:49.030
And then the amount of curvature at any given point is different from any other

980
00:31:49.031 --> 00:31:49.540
point.

981
00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:53.740
So you have to describe it with a differential amount of curvature and then you

982
00:31:53.741 --> 00:31:55.600
integrate over the path that thinks,

983
00:31:55.601 --> 00:31:56.351
take this,

984
00:31:56.351 --> 00:31:57.520
get heinous.

985
00:31:57.760 --> 00:31:58.090
Uh,

986
00:31:58.090 --> 00:31:59.290
and we're not going to go there,

987
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:04.470
but I will show you next time some specific examples of some of these equations

988
00:32:04.781 --> 00:32:09.070
because it'll help explain things like why space and time are reversed inside an

989
00:32:09.071 --> 00:32:10.000
event horizon and stuff.

990
00:32:10.001 --> 00:32:10.281
But yeah,

991
00:32:10.281 --> 00:32:10.751
you bet.

992
00:32:10.751 --> 00:32:12.190
There's a whole mathematical theory.

993
00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:12.970
In fact,

994
00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:17.920
Einstein was not the world's greatest mathematician and it took him until 1917

995
00:32:17.921 --> 00:32:18.880
to get all this worked out.

996
00:32:18.881 --> 00:32:22.210
He had to go and get himself some math tutoring at the University of Gooding and

997
00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.770
so that he could understand the,

998
00:32:23.771 --> 00:32:23.921
uh,

999
00:32:23.921 --> 00:32:25.360
the geometric properties.

1000
00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:25.871
Uh,

1001
00:32:25.871 --> 00:32:26.291
so yeah,

1002
00:32:26.291 --> 00:32:28.200
there's a big mathematical theory behind it.

1003
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:29.060
Yes.

1004
00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:29.840
<v 3>So if,</v>

1005
00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:30.280
um,

1006
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.850
if gravity is not a force,

1007
00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.360
how can you use that equals

1008
00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:34.511
<v 0>Oh,</v>

1009
00:32:34.511 --> 00:32:36.880
f equals m a is a,

1010
00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:37.630
uh,

1011
00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:39.680
is a general equation of motion.

1012
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:40.300
Okay.

1013
00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.680
It doesn't have to be the force of gravity.

1014
00:32:42.681 --> 00:32:44.330
There are many other forces in the world,

1015
00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:48.170
but when you're setting f equals m a to GM,

1016
00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:48.920
right?

1017
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.860
So that's the Newtonian idea that you set.

1018
00:32:51.861 --> 00:32:54.800
F equals m a equal to GMM m over d squared.

1019
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.570
Uh,

1020
00:32:55.570 --> 00:33:00.080
and the thing that prompted Einstein's thought was the fact that the two

1021
00:33:00.081 --> 00:33:05.081
different kinds of masses on each side of the equation turned out to be equal.

1022
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.810
And you can see why this explains that.

1023
00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:14.050
Because if what's happening is that you curve space and then things follow a

1024
00:33:14.331 --> 00:33:17.480
trajectory dictated by the curvature of that space,

1025
00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:20.900
then it makes perfect sense that all objects follow the same trajectory

1026
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:22.280
regardless of their mass,

1027
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:26.060
cause they're not actually being forced to move anywhere.

1028
00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:27.740
They're just going in straight lines.

1029
00:33:27.741 --> 00:33:30.090
And straight lines are the same no matter what your mass is.

1030
00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.200
And so that's why this kind of curvature,

1031
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:34.040
uh,

1032
00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:39.040
provide an explanation for what in the Newtonian approximation is the equality

1033
00:33:39.051 --> 00:33:41.090
of the inertial and the gravitational mass.

1034
00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:44.650
How are we doing?

1035
00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:44.801
Oh,

1036
00:33:44.801 --> 00:33:45.670
we got some more time.

1037
00:33:45.671 --> 00:33:45.911
Good.

1038
00:33:45.911 --> 00:33:46.744
Go ahead.

1039
00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.810
Literally slow down as you move towards the

1040
00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.260
perception of,

1041
00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:53.830
well,

1042
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:55.330
of course you are a clock,

1043
00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:56.030
right?

1044
00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:56.560
Uh,

1045
00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:56.851
you're,

1046
00:33:56.851 --> 00:33:57.070
you,

1047
00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:57.311
no,

1048
00:33:57.311 --> 00:33:58.210
you wouldn't notice.

1049
00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.770
But what would happen is this,

1050
00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:01.560
supposing you're falling into a,

1051
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:02.980
to a black hole or something,

1052
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:03.730
uh,

1053
00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:04.990
you look at your clock,

1054
00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:05.371
you,

1055
00:34:05.371 --> 00:34:06.580
you feel your pulse.

1056
00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.210
You know,

1057
00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:09.430
your pulse metric by your clock is,

1058
00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.510
it has not changed.

1059
00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.380
Uh,

1060
00:34:11.380 --> 00:34:16.380
but you look back out into the world that is distant from the black hole and

1061
00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.240
things are moving really fast out there.

1062
00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:21.640
And so if you had two synchronized,

1063
00:34:21.641 --> 00:34:24.100
identical clocks at the start of your voyage,

1064
00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.710
and you keep an eye on what's happening out here,

1065
00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:27.551
uh,

1066
00:34:27.551 --> 00:34:31.450
you will discover that all of a sudden it looks like your clock is moving slow

1067
00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:32.590
and all of a sudden,

1068
00:34:32.591 --> 00:34:32.861
you know,

1069
00:34:32.861 --> 00:34:35.230
people are aging and dying back on earth.

1070
00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:36.161
A while,

1071
00:34:36.161 --> 00:34:36.401
you know,

1072
00:34:36.401 --> 00:34:37.810
it's only been a week in your,

1073
00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.080
uh,

1074
00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.250
in your perception.

1075
00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:41.560
And so you turn it around,

1076
00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:44.370
you're sitting on earth watching your friend fall through,

1077
00:34:44.590 --> 00:34:46.060
fall into a black hole,

1078
00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:50.770
and it looks like he's slowing down and slowing down and slowing down in and

1079
00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:55.270
maybe never really quite get to the event horizon even in an infinite amount of

1080
00:34:55.271 --> 00:34:55.840
time.

1081
00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.900
But the perception of the person falling through is that they just fall through.

1082
00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:02.140
It's just the whole universe has evolved in the time that they've done it.

1083
00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:02.880
Uh,

1084
00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.880
so it's one of these weird things where time turns out how fast time passes

1085
00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:13.240
turns out to be a property of who's doing the measuring.

1086
00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:18.340
Very strange concept and very counterintuitive to the way we live our life

1087
00:35:18.341 --> 00:35:23.230
because we all think because we live in low gravitational fields at low speeds,

1088
00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:24.190
uh,

1089
00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:28.210
we think time is an absolute thing that ticks on word for everybody in the same

1090
00:35:28.211 --> 00:35:28.361
way.

1091
00:35:28.361 --> 00:35:29.620
But it turns out it isn't true.

1092
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.860
Yes.

1093
00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:33.020
Oh,

1094
00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:33.360
and uh,

1095
00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:33.731
again,

1096
00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:37.030
I'll show you an equation that actually this is much easier to deal with in

1097
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:39.240
equations than it is conceptually a,

1098
00:35:39.241 --> 00:35:40.860
and I'll show you an equation next time,

1099
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:41.310
uh,

1100
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:41.800
which,

1101
00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.090
uh,

1102
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:42.923
may help.

1103
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.510
<v 3>Can you explain what the names behind the two theories of relativity?</v>

1104
00:35:45.511 --> 00:35:45.720
I mean,

1105
00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.690
it doesn't seem like the general theory is a generalization,

1106
00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:48.540
but,

1107
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:48.950
<v 0>uh,</v>

1108
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:49.250
it,

1109
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:49.790
it,

1110
00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:54.790
it actually is because it incorporates aspects of the special theory and,

1111
00:35:55.221 --> 00:35:58.370
and it's a generalization in terms of what's called the metric.

1112
00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:03.640
The metric is the mathematical formula that describes the curvature and the

1113
00:36:03.651 --> 00:36:08.651
special theory of relativity is the special case where the metric is flat and

1114
00:36:09.111 --> 00:36:10.160
then the jet jet.

1115
00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:14.390
The reason general relativity as a generalization is because it allows,

1116
00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:15.493
uh,

1117
00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:16.483
other,

1118
00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:19.160
in many other kinds of metrics.

1119
00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:19.940
Okay.

1120
00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:20.031
Well,

1121
00:36:20.031 --> 00:36:20.720
at least that's one,

1122
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.740
that's one way of thinking about it.

1123
00:36:21.741 --> 00:36:21.921
Yes,

1124
00:36:21.921 --> 00:36:22.754
sir.

1125
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.730
<v 3>Second one.</v>

1126
00:36:25.730 --> 00:36:26.001
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1127
00:36:26.001 --> 00:36:26.271
Well,

1128
00:36:26.271 --> 00:36:31.271
I too small for me to draw the wiggles from the motion of the earth around the

1129
00:36:31.431 --> 00:36:36.140
sun and it's caused by the mass of the sun.

1130
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:38.060
Warps the space.

1131
00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:39.771
Yeah,

1132
00:36:39.771 --> 00:36:39.951
yeah,

1133
00:36:39.951 --> 00:36:40.310
yeah.

1134
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:41.360
It's just all,

1135
00:36:41.361 --> 00:36:41.710
all,

1136
00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:43.040
all I meant in the second one.

1137
00:36:43.041 --> 00:36:43.311
Sorry,

1138
00:36:43.311 --> 00:36:44.450
I didn't explain this clearly.

1139
00:36:44.451 --> 00:36:46.460
All I meant in the second one was,

1140
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:47.270
uh,

1141
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:50.840
that this one is inaccurate in terms of scale

1142
00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:54.200
and that the scale,

1143
00:36:54.201 --> 00:36:56.080
the true scale is such that,

1144
00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:56.601
that,

1145
00:36:56.601 --> 00:36:59.540
that this length thought it'd be 10,000 times longer than that,

1146
00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:00.890
and under those circumstances,

1147
00:37:00.891 --> 00:37:02.030
you'd never be able to see it.

1148
00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.290
That's all I meant by that.

1149
00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:06.483
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

1150
00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:09.670
What happens to time when you're traveling?

1151
00:37:09.671 --> 00:37:10.241
You mentioned this,

1152
00:37:10.241 --> 00:37:13.420
but what happens at times when you're traveling close to the speed of life slows

1153
00:37:13.421 --> 00:37:14.170
down.

1154
00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.003
Yeah.

1155
00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:16.143
Yes.

1156
00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:16.993
I'm not sure.

1157
00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:20.590
I'm getting a little confused because you said now that gravity is,

1158
00:37:20.591 --> 00:37:21.371
and of course anymore,

1159
00:37:21.371 --> 00:37:23.700
but like all our lives who've been exploited,

1160
00:37:23.701 --> 00:37:25.210
like that's why we see on earth.

1161
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:26.490
How does that,

1162
00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:26.970
<v 0>ah,</v>

1163
00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:27.781
so how does,

1164
00:37:27.781 --> 00:37:28.950
how does this work?

1165
00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:29.903
Um,

1166
00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:33.120
right.

1167
00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:33.450
Uh,

1168
00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:34.440
we are,

1169
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.950
you know,

1170
00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:39.390
you can explain the motion of the earth in terms of uh,

1171
00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:43.410
these so called space time diagrams where one,

1172
00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:43.800
you,

1173
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:45.330
you take the four dimensional thing,

1174
00:37:45.331 --> 00:37:46.980
you projected onto two dimensions.

1175
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:52.050
You can write a spacetime diagram for yourself and you can explain all of the

1176
00:37:52.051 --> 00:37:54.870
motion and all of the things that happen,

1177
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:55.590
uh,

1178
00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:56.310
by,

1179
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:56.491
uh,

1180
00:37:56.491 --> 00:37:57.221
such a curves thing.

1181
00:37:57.221 --> 00:37:58.650
So what happens if your jump,

1182
00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.513
for example,

1183
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:01.020
in the Newtonian theory,

1184
00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:01.680
uh,

1185
00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.460
you jump,

1186
00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:04.680
you ought to keep going straight up.

1187
00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.240
Uh,

1188
00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:09.150
except that there's a force which pulls you back down so that we understand what

1189
00:38:09.151 --> 00:38:09.660
happens.

1190
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.150
How is that explained in general relativity?

1191
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.340
You jump and,

1192
00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.030
uh,

1193
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:16.500
you go in a straight line,

1194
00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.730
but the straight line is through a curved space curve because of the presence of

1195
00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:21.300
the earth.

1196
00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:24.660
And so it turns out that the straight line looks like this.

1197
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:27.450
It goes up and comes back down again,

1198
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:28.090
uh,

1199
00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:33.030
in just the same way that the straight line between New York and Beijing goes

1200
00:38:33.031 --> 00:38:34.230
over the North Pole.

1201
00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:38.500
It goes up and comes back down again because space is space.

1202
00:38:38.501 --> 00:38:41.050
Time is curved due to the gravity of the earth.

1203
00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:45.100
So something that we perceive to be a curve trajectory,

1204
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:45.641
jumping up,

1205
00:38:45.641 --> 00:38:49.120
falling back down if you projected into space time,

1206
00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:53.170
is actually the closest distance between two events.

1207
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:58.570
So there's two alternative explanations of these things in the situation where

1208
00:38:58.571 --> 00:39:00.040
you're nowhere near a black hole.

1209
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.680
It turns out that mathematically there exactly equivalent.

1210
00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:04.240
If they are exactly equivalent,

1211
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:08.680
it's much easier to calculate the Newtonian way and much easier to think about

1212
00:39:08.681 --> 00:39:08.771
it.

1213
00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:12.430
So until you get into a situation where,

1214
00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.413
uh,

1215
00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:18.440
the swatch showed radius is comparable to the distances involved a,

1216
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:20.320
you're way better off thinking Newtonian,

1217
00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:20.680
like,

1218
00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:21.520
because you know,

1219
00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.420
we're just better at it.

1220
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:25.583
<v 3>Yes,</v>

1221
00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:31.350
I understand that in order to get units that you can line up in any way

1222
00:39:31.351 --> 00:39:32.184
meaningfully,

1223
00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:35.810
you need to multiply time of philosophy.

1224
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:38.960
I'm a little confused about it.

1225
00:39:38.961 --> 00:39:41.650
End of the sea important.

1226
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:46.380
But if the only reason why,

1227
00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:47.243
um,

1228
00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:48.313
the,

1229
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.690
you know,

1230
00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:53.040
the wiggles and that graph of are really tiny is because c is so enormous.

1231
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.353
I mean,

1232
00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:56.180
<v 0>couldn't you pick another velocity?</v>

1233
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:57.283
Right?

1234
00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.500
What makes that inaccurate?

1235
00:39:58.740 --> 00:39:59.210
Okay,

1236
00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:02.480
so the reason that's an accurate scaling is one of the things that comes out of

1237
00:40:02.481 --> 00:40:05.810
the theory of relativity is that there is a natural unit.

1238
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:11.170
There's a natural set of units and the natural set of units or the units in

1239
00:40:11.271 --> 00:40:16.271
which these crucial constants of which C is one and g is another and h the

1240
00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:18.591
Planck constant,

1241
00:40:18.591 --> 00:40:19.310
which governs,

1242
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:20.120
uh,

1243
00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.190
quantum mechanics are all equal to one.

1244
00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.460
And that turns there that those are called Planck units.

1245
00:40:26.461 --> 00:40:27.690
And they have,

1246
00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:28.590
uh,

1247
00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:29.070
and,

1248
00:40:29.070 --> 00:40:32.280
and the conversion between different kinds of energy,

1249
00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:33.510
mass to energy,

1250
00:40:33.511 --> 00:40:34.344
things like that.

1251
00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.160
Uh,

1252
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:40.160
all workout as equalities in the particular set of units where all those

1253
00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.910
constants come out to be one.

1254
00:40:42.570 --> 00:40:43.180
So,

1255
00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:43.420
uh,

1256
00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.100
there is a reason why that particular Po,

1257
00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.690
why that particular velocity is chosen.

1258
00:40:48.691 --> 00:40:52.890
And it's not surprising if you had to pick a velocity that you would end up with

1259
00:40:52.891 --> 00:40:53.551
the speed of light,

1260
00:40:53.551 --> 00:40:55.350
which has this sort of profound importance.

1261
00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:56.671
Okay,

1262
00:40:56.671 --> 00:40:57.810
we'll continue next time.
