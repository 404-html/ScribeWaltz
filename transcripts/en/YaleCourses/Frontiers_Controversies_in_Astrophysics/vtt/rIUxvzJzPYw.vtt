WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.960
Okay.
Here's the plan for today.
Uh,

2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.790
I want to do one last foray into relativity theory.
Uh,

3
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.000
and,
uh,
this is going to be a tricky one,

4
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:18.110
so I hope you're all feeling mentally strong this morning.
Uh,
if not,
we,
Gosh,

5
00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:22.330
we should've ordered coffee for everyone.
Uh,
and uh,

6
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.470
uh,
and in so doing,

7
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:29.471
I want to introduce a one t concept and also answer at least three of the

8
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:34.670
questions that you guys have asked,
uh,
before in a more,
uh,

9
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.320
in,
in more depth and also relate the whole thing back to black holes.
Uh,

10
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.120
and then,
uh,
having done that,
we'll,
we'll,
we'll have some more questions.

11
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.790
And then having done that,
I want to get back to astronomy.

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
That is to say two things in the sky that actually manifests these relativistic

13
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.430
effects.
So that's where we're going today.
Uh,

14
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.570
and along the way,
as I said,
uh,

15
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.540
we'll deal with some of the questions you've been asking in a,
in a,
uh,

16
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.170
in a deeper kind of way in particular.
So questions,

17
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.750
watch out for the answers to these questions.
Somebody asked,
uh,

18
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.960
what's special about special relativity and what general about general

19
00:01:20.751 --> 00:01:22.310
relativity,
how do they relate?

20
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.740
So we'll come back to that one.
Uh,

21
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.810
somebody also asked why use the speed of light to convert a time into space and

22
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:39.810
vice versa to get them in the same coordinate system.
So why,

23
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.640
uh,
use C to convert,

24
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.983
<v 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.600
<v 0>time to space and vice versa.</v>

26
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.810
And then also there was the question of,
you know,

27
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.400
what is the mathematical formulation of general relativity?
Uh,

28
00:01:58.401 --> 00:02:02.090
so how,
uh,
to express,

29
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.480
<v 1>ah,</v>

30
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.200
<v 0>general relativity in some kind of equation.</v>

31
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.030
And uh,
we'll get to the key equation,
uh,

32
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.600
which is something called a metric,
uh,
for general relativity.

33
00:02:18.601 --> 00:02:23.580
And then we're going to stop because to go on from there is a fairly heavy

34
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:26.130
calculus and we're just not going to do that,

35
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.420
but I want to get as least that far.
Okay.

36
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.070
So let's go back to special relativity for a minute.

37
00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.170
So special.

38
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

39
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.230
<v 0>Relativity,</v>

40
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.713
<v 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.700
<v 0>flat space time,
no gravity.</v>

42
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.960
And you'll recall what happens as you get close to the speed of light.

43
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.010
All sorts of things that you thought were kind of constant and properties of

44
00:02:57.011 --> 00:03:01.810
objects like mass and length and duration and duration of time and things like

45
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:05.610
that all start to get weird and change.
So length

46
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.640
<v 1>time,
okay.</v>

47
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.690
<v 0>Mass.</v>

48
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.690
All these things vary with the velocity of the person doing the measuring.

49
00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.850
Uh,
and so you could ask the question,
is there anything that doesn't fare it?
Uh,

50
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.210
is there anything that an invariant,
and the answer is yes,

51
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.580
there are some things that don't vary.

52
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.680
So some things are invariant.

53
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.530
Uh,
and uh,

54
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.880
Einstein actually said later in his career that it's actually the invariants

55
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.010
that are important,
not the things that change.

56
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.440
And so he should have called his theory,
uh,

57
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.440
invariant theory instead of relativity theory.

58
00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.270
Think of what that would've done to pop philosophy,
right?
Instead of saying,
oh,

59
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:02.500
everything is relative,
all this stuff,
you would have had the exact same theory,

60
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:07.501
you would have called it invariance theory and the pop philosophy interpretation

61
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:10.900
of this would be some things never change.
Uh,

62
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:14.740
and it would have been a whole different concept in,
uh,
uh,

63
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.250
three in the morning dorm room conversations.
Okay.
Uh,

64
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:21.700
so some things are in variant.
What things now?
Uh,

65
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.760
let me first give you a little bit of a metaphor and then come back to how this

66
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:29.770
really works.
Uh,
in space time.

67
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.800
Supposing you're just looking at an x,

68
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:36.790
y coordinate system and you have two points in a two dimensional space.

69
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.870
So here's a point and here's a point.
Now,

70
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.680
if you arrange for some kind of coordinate system,

71
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.420
here's a coordinate system.
Uh,
this is x.
This is why,

72
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.610
and you ask how far apart these points are a well,
you can do that.
Uh,

73
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.020
let's see.
Uh,

74
00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.270
they're separated in x by this amount here,
uh,

75
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.120
which we'll call delta x and they are separated.

76
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:09.121
And why by this amount here and that Delta y,

77
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.003
but of course,

78
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.350
those quantities depend on the orientation of your coordinate system.

79
00:05:17.351 --> 00:05:20.800
If I now take this coordinate system and I shift it like this,

80
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.263
<v 1>uh,</v>

81
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.660
<v 0>now,
uh,
it's going to be totally different.
Now I'm going to have,</v>

82
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.753
<v 1>uh,</v>

83
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.880
<v 0>x look like this.</v>

84
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.983
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

85
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.130
<v 0>And I'm going to have y Delta y look like that.</v>

86
00:05:42.201 --> 00:05:46.850
So Delta wise gotten a whole lot smaller.
Delta x has gotten a whole lot bigger.

87
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.990
Uh,
and all I did was twist the,
the coordinate system.
Yeah.

88
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.970
You still get the same distance.
Thank you very much.
That's exactly right.

89
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.920
The distance is invariant.

90
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.420
The x coordinate and the y coordinate those vary with the coordinate system,

91
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.300
but the distance is the same.
That's exactly the point.
Uh,

92
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.790
and so the quantity,
so four,
let me summarize this.

93
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:15.680
Four points on a two d space.

94
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.050
Uh,
Delta x varies Delta y fairies,

95
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.490
but there is a quantity that is invariant.
Uh,

96
00:06:26.491 --> 00:06:28.150
and that is uh,

97
00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.480
we'll let you call it delta x squared plus Delta y squared,

98
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.800
which is the distance squared,
Delta d squared.

99
00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.110
And this is invariant

100
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.350
and it doesn't matter which way you twist things around that will,
uh,

101
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.280
that quantity will remain the same.
So,
uh,

102
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.350
in,
uh,
now imagine that you've got,
uh,

103
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.870
events
in space time.

104
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

105
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:07.050
<v 0>So an event,</v>

106
00:07:07.051 --> 00:07:12.051
it's based time has three spacial coordinates and one time coordinate.

107
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.900
So it's basically a point in a four dimensional space,
uh,

108
00:07:18.901 --> 00:07:21.720
and as your velocity changes,

109
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.953
<v 1>yeah,</v>

110
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.430
<v 0>changes the,
uh,</v>

111
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.290
distance and time also change.

112
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.650
That's the equivalent of rotating the coordinate system,

113
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.670
but there is something that doesn't change.
Uh,

114
00:07:39.671 --> 00:07:42.610
and let me write that down.
Uh,

115
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.640
this is usually given the Greek letter Tao squared.

116
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:48.460
Uh,

117
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:53.460
and this is equal to Delta x squared plus Delta y square plus Delta z squared

118
00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.990
minus c squared,
Delta t squared.

119
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.090
Uh,
and this is invariant.

120
00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.810
This is an invariant interval,
uh,

121
00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.620
sometimes called proper distance.
But,
uh,

122
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.050
and uh,
as you,
uh,

123
00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:25.100
as you change your velocity as the space as the mass is the just time all change

124
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:27.600
this quantity,
uh,

125
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.330
describing the separation of two events.
Uh,

126
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:35.400
so this describes the separation of two events that quantity changes.

127
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:39.840
It doesn't change that quantity is in varied.
Uh,

128
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:43.830
and okay,
so now this answers one of the questions that was asked before.

129
00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:49.010
Why does one use c squared or c to transform the space,

130
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.680
coordinate into the,
into the time coordinating back?

131
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.450
It's because you need the c squared here in order to make this invariant.
Uh,

132
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.700
if you're calculating the distance,

133
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:04.790
if you use a x squared plus one half y squared or some other constant times y

134
00:09:05.581 --> 00:09:08.430
squared,
a,
you're not going to get something that's invariant.

135
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.200
And it's only when you use the see here that you end up with something that's

136
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:14.680
invariant.
And so,
uh,

137
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.620
if you think about these as representing the four coordinates of the system,

138
00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:23.630
it's clear this one coordinators,
the x one is why one is z,

139
00:09:23.631 --> 00:09:25.830
just as you would expect.
Uh,

140
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.810
and then there's this other coordinate which is c times t,
uh,

141
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.130
but it's negative.
So it has to be times the square root of,
of,
of,
of one.

142
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.160
So the four coordinates in space time can be thought of as x,
Y,
z.

143
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.060
And I see tea if you want to think of it that way.

144
00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:45.270
And the time coordinates imaginary cause when you square it,

145
00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:48.060
you have to end up with a negative number.
Uh,

146
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:53.550
don't worry about the details of that.
Um,
but uh,

147
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:58.560
but the see the presence of the c squared here is why you have to use C in

148
00:09:58.561 --> 00:10:03.420
particular to get from tea.
Uh,
from time to space and back.

149
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:08.110
And that's necessary because this is the thing that doesn't vary with,
uh,

150
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.560
uh,
with philosophy.
All right,

151
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.800
so this is actually kind of a weird expression because unlike the distance

152
00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:21.450
between two points,
uh,
and,
and you'll notice these three terms put together,

153
00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:24.690
that's just the distance square,
uh,
ordinarily,

154
00:10:24.691 --> 00:10:28.260
but that is not invariant to any more because there's this other term here which

155
00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:31.890
can vary.
Um,
unlike the distance,

156
00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:36.300
this doesn't have to be positive.
You've got three different cases here.

157
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.780
Uh,
this interval,
uh,

158
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.840
can be zero four different points in ordinary distance.

159
00:10:45.481 --> 00:10:47.640
It can only be zero if the two points are the same,

160
00:10:47.641 --> 00:10:52.560
but this can be zero for different points or different events.
It can be zero,

161
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:57.420
it could be negative,
and it can be positive.
So what does that mean?

162
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.050
What happens when it's zero?
So if the interval is zero,

163
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.360
that means that the distance between the events in light years,

164
00:11:11.021 --> 00:11:11.920
for example,

165
00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:18.270
is equal to the time separation to the time separation

166
00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.370
in years.

167
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:22.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

168
00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:23.763
<v 0>Because that,</v>

169
00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:29.130
because this term has to be exactly equal to that term there,

170
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.890
uh,
in order for them to subtract out and get zero.

171
00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:37.000
And the c squared converged from like years,
two years in back again.
Uh,

172
00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.910
and so what does that mean?
That means if you,

173
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.610
if you emit a photon

174
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.660
at one event,

175
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:54.910
that same photon
can,

176
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.050
uh,
if it's going in the right direction,
uh,

177
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:03.100
be present at the second event.

178
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.850
So if you ride along with light,
uh,

179
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.900
you'll see both the,
you'll,
you'll participate in both these events.

180
00:12:12.901 --> 00:12:16.840
So you sit at event one,
uh,
you flash a light,
uh,

181
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.970
you ride along with the expanding a light waves from,
from,

182
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.860
from that event,
and you get to,
uh,
something one light year away.

183
00:12:25.861 --> 00:12:29.430
Exactly a year later.
Uh,
and so,
uh,

184
00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:34.140
if the second event is one light year away and distance and a year later in
time,

185
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.330
uh,
that same photon will,

186
00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.840
will be present at the second event is at the first event.
Uh,

187
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:44.400
so things that have at one of these intervals of zero,

188
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.151
uh,

189
00:12:45.151 --> 00:12:50.151
are separated by an appropriate amount so that the same ray of light can

190
00:12:50.551 --> 00:12:52.020
participate in both of them.

191
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.350
So if the interval,

192
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:03.330
let's keep that up there for a minute.
Uh,

193
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.830
if the interval

194
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.753
<v 1>yeah.</v>

195
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.810
<v 0>Is Negative,</v>

196
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:12.920
what does that mean?

197
00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.970
The distance is less than,
uh,

198
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:19.580
the light travel time.

199
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.733
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

200
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.450
<v 0>So the Photon,</v>

201
00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:24.930
<v 1>yeah.</v>

202
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.870
<v 0>Uh,
is already past the second event.</v>

203
00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

204
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:38.090
<v 0>So if you were to emit a ray of light at a event,</v>

205
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.190
number one,
uh,
it would have passed,
uh,

206
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.420
the second event by the time,
uh,
by the time it occurred,

207
00:13:45.421 --> 00:13:50.190
the photon has already gone by.
Uh,
and similarly,

208
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:53.580
if the interval is positive,

209
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.433
um,

210
00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.860
then the light photon hasn't reached event to,

211
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:03.450
hasn't yet reached

212
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:12.350
you vent to.
Now this is important because this means that you can't

213
00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.440
communicate
from event one,

214
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:19.400
two event too.

215
00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.360
So if you're at event too,

216
00:14:26.361 --> 00:14:28.940
you don't know what happened at event one,

217
00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:33.920
because even if you'd sent out a signal radio,
radio signal or whatever,

218
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.640
uh,
it would not have reached you by the time event to takes place.

219
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.920
So you can't communicate from event to event to,
and similarly,
you can't travel

220
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:49.870
from event one and reach event too,

221
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:52.310
<v 1>because</v>

222
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.500
<v 0>you'd have to go faster than the speed of light to do it.</v>

223
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:56.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

224
00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:01.080
<v 0>These kinds of intervals,
these negative intervals,
these are called timelike,</v>

225
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.260
uh,
because the time term is larger than the distance turn.

226
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.800
And these kinds of intervals are called space,
like,

227
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:10.800
<v 1>okay.</v>

228
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.633
<v 0>Intervals.</v>

229
00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:12.870
<v 1>Okay.</v>

230
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.310
<v 0>And,
uh,</v>

231
00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.920
you can only travel or communicate over time,
like intervals.
Yes.

232
00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:23.343
Uh,

233
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:28.290
so there events or you can think of them as point in space time.

234
00:15:28.291 --> 00:15:32.880
So they have a particular position in space and a particular point in time.

235
00:15:32.881 --> 00:15:35.070
So they can be described by four numbers,

236
00:15:35.071 --> 00:15:38.850
three spacial coordinates and a time coordinator.
Uh,
they can be anything,

237
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:42.750
you know,
turning on a light,
uh,
doing,
uh,

238
00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.890
doing anything you want to do or receiving a photon,
whatever it,
whatever it is,

239
00:15:46.891 --> 00:15:47.770
but there,
uh,

240
00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:52.260
points in a four dimensional space time and therefore require four numbers to

241
00:15:52.261 --> 00:15:53.094
describe them.

242
00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:56.450
<v 1>Okay.</v>

243
00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:56.711
<v 0>And Do,</v>

244
00:15:56.711 --> 00:16:01.430
you can only get from one to another if they're separated by a time like that is

245
00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:04.460
to say a negative,
uh,
interval.

246
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.983
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

247
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:12.700
<v 0>Okay.
So this expression,
Joel,</v>

248
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.720
right down,
again,

249
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:26.630
this is called a metric.

250
00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:36.120
And the particular metric that I've written down here is the metric for flat

251
00:16:36.121 --> 00:16:40.050
space.
Because remember this is special relativity.
There's no masses,

252
00:16:40.051 --> 00:16:44.340
no curvature of space,
none of that stuff yet.
This is the metric for flat space.

253
00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:45.443
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

254
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.040
<v 0>With no mass present.</v>

255
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:53.550
And there are many other metrics possible.
Uh,

256
00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.500
anytime you add mass or do other things,
uh,
you get,
uh,

257
00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.230
different kinds of metrics,
more complicated than this.

258
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:05.350
So what's special about special relativity is that you use the metric

259
00:17:05.631 --> 00:17:09.740
appropriate for flat space as opposed to the many other different kinds of

260
00:17:09.741 --> 00:17:14.420
metrics that you can use in,
uh,
in general relativity,

261
00:17:14.421 --> 00:17:18.680
which has a much more general form for the metric.
Uh,
I should say,

262
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.560
uh,
you can also write this down.

263
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:26.090
You can write down the spatial terms here,
uh,
in,
uh,
uh,

264
00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.540
in polar coordinates.
Remember polar coordinates,
polar coordinates.

265
00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:32.230
You described a position in space instead of with Xyz.

266
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:34.430
You describe it with a radius,

267
00:17:34.431 --> 00:17:38.720
a distance from zero and some angles and it turns out that's convenient to do.

268
00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:43.250
So let me write this down in polar coordinates or in polar.

269
00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:44.520
<v 1>Okay.</v>

270
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.470
<v 0>Uh,</v>

271
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:46.423
<v 1>yeah,</v>

272
00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.850
<v 0>that's an r.
Let me write that explicitly.</v>

273
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:56.003
<v 1>Uh,</v>

274
00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.350
<v 0>this is,
uh,
an Omega,</v>

275
00:17:59.351 --> 00:18:03.370
that some angle and then the tea thing remains the same

276
00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:10.650
and I've pulled a little bit of a notational fast one on you here.
Uh,

277
00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.370
I've gone away from the deltas and I've written these down as d.

278
00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:18.790
This is the differential d,
those of you who have taken some calculus a,

279
00:18:18.791 --> 00:18:22.500
we'll remember this.
If this were a calculus based course,

280
00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:27.450
I would explain why I did that.
Uh,
but I'm not going to,
uh,
so,
uh,
just,

281
00:18:27.451 --> 00:18:30.390
just allow me this slight of hand here for technical reasons,

282
00:18:30.391 --> 00:18:31.860
these have to be differential.
Yes,

283
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:37.110
I do need a second angle term,
I should say.
Good point.
Uh,

284
00:18:37.111 --> 00:18:41.760
you need to ankles and a,
and a distance in,
in three space.
This,
uh,
this,

285
00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:46.170
uh,
uh,
capital Omega here is actually,
uh,
uh,

286
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:51.350
this Cap Omega squared is actually a sign theta d theta defy a,

287
00:18:53.221 --> 00:18:57.060
which is the correct form.
And so you could,
you could write out both terms here,

288
00:18:57.061 --> 00:18:59.640
but in fact this one isn't going to change,
but you're absolutely right.

289
00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:04.290
In principle,
you need two angles.
Okay.

290
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:09.870
Why have I done this?
Excellent question.
Uh,

291
00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:14.130
I asked myself a question at this point.
Where am I going?
Uh,

292
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:19.050
what I want to do now is write down a curve,
a different metric.

293
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:24.140
The metric that actually involves curved space and uh,

294
00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.680
the presence of a mass.
And this is something called the Schwartz Shield metric.

295
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.170
You remember Schwartz Shield,
he had a radius.

296
00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:32.523
<v 1>Uh,</v>

297
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:41.230
<v 0>and this is the appropriate metric for the presence of a single point to mass</v>

298
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:52.580
at the center of the Coordinate System at r equals zero.

299
00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.410
That's why I put it into polar coordinates because,
uh,

300
00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:02.680
the presence of the mass is going to change the space time as a function of

301
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:07.660
distance from a radial distance from where the masses.

302
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:11.080
And so it's much more convenient for the Schwab showed radius,
uh,

303
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.180
for the Schwartz showed metric to use this in polar coordinates.

304
00:20:14.181 --> 00:20:18.950
So here's the Schwartz show metric.
Uh,
D Tao squared.

305
00:20:18.951 --> 00:20:19.521
That's the,

306
00:20:19.521 --> 00:20:24.521
this is the interval is equal to d r over one minus R s over her.

307
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.110
So that's just like the,
just like the flat term,
except with something in the,

308
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.590
in the denominator there plus r squared,

309
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.400
the Omega squared,
that's just like the flat metric.
Uh,

310
00:20:42.401 --> 00:20:47.110
and then the,
uh,
whoops,
this had better be minus,
uh,
c squared,

311
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:52.260
one minus R s over r d t squared where our assets,

312
00:20:54.371 --> 00:20:59.110
this wardrobe,
a radius which we've had before,
which is two g m oversee square.

313
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:06.100
Okay.
So this is just like the flat metric with two exceptions.

314
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.950
It's got a term in the radio,
uh,

315
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.600
part of this one minus r s over our,
and it's got that same term,

316
00:21:13.601 --> 00:21:17.810
but this time in the numerator,
uh,
in the time,
uh,

317
00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:19.510
in the time term here.

318
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:25.640
Now what do you do with this,
uh,

319
00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:29.410
with such an equation?
Well,
we've done a,
in special relativity.

320
00:21:29.411 --> 00:21:30.730
We've dealt with these kinds of things.

321
00:21:30.731 --> 00:21:35.530
What you do is you start taking the limited cases.
You say,
okay,
what happens?

322
00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.250
Uh,

323
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.900
when it's getting really close to flat on the one hand and what's happening when

324
00:21:40.901 --> 00:21:44.260
it's getting very seriously relativistic on the other hand.

325
00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:48.070
So let's do that.
Uh,

326
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.880
if our s over our goes to zero,

327
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:57.970
then the metric turns into the flat metric.

328
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.610
Because if rs over R is zero,

329
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.450
this term disappears because it's one minus zero and it just cancels.

330
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.480
This term disappears and you recover the flat metric.

331
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.600
This happens in two cases.
Uh,

332
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:14.050
if the mask goes to zero,

333
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:18.880
then our s goes to zero and you recover the flat metric.

334
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:23.920
Or if our gets really big,

335
00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:29.290
then rs over our goes to zero.
And again,

336
00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:31.090
you recover the flat metric.

337
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:36.210
So in there are two situations where Schwab chill metric blends smoothly into,

338
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:42.160
uh,
the ordinary flat space.
One is if the mass is zero,

339
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.390
that's not surprising.
If the mass is zero,
then the then spacetime isn't curve.

340
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:51.370
Or alternatively,
if you're really,
really far away from the mass,
if r is much,

341
00:22:51.371 --> 00:22:54.500
much bigger than the Schwartz drilled radius,
you're way out there.
Uh,

342
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:57.760
there's no gravitational effect.
Spacetime remains flat.

343
00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:00.430
So these are the,

344
00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.420
this is the limiting case where you recover special relativity.

345
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:10.380
Now the other case is when our gets close to the Schwab chilled radius and

346
00:23:11.231 --> 00:23:12.064
approaches it.

347
00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:17.460
So then one minus R s over our approaches zero cause these two are going to get

348
00:23:22.121 --> 00:23:26.410
closer and closer together.
One minus one is zero.
What happens then?

349
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.200
So this is now first of all,
in physical terms,

350
00:23:29.201 --> 00:23:31.510
you're getting really close to the Schwab chilled radius.

351
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:36.100
So now what happens to the metric if you do that?
The uh,
uh,

352
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:41.140
the Dr term
gets very big

353
00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:44.800
cause it's got a zero in the denominator.

354
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:50.540
The DT term gets really small

355
00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.980
cause it's got that,
uh,
that thing that's going to zero in the numerator.

356
00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:01.210
Uh,
fine.
What does that mean?

357
00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:06.160
Well remember this is the negative term.
This is the positive terms.

358
00:24:06.161 --> 00:24:09.520
So the positive terms getting really,
really big,
the negative terms,

359
00:24:09.521 --> 00:24:13.620
getting really,
really small and that means that,
uh,

360
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.270
all intervals

361
00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:21.570
are gradually becoming space.
Like

362
00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:31.020
what do I mean by that?
Uh,
well,
the negative term is getting small.
The Pot,

363
00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.920
one of the positive terms is getting big.

364
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:37.600
So the sum of those tends to be positive.
It's becoming more and more positive.

365
00:24:37.601 --> 00:24:40.060
Positive.
Uh,
intervals are the space,

366
00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:44.680
like intervals and you can't communicate or travel across space like intervals.

367
00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.830
When you get all the way to the Schwab chilled radius,

368
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:52.180
this blows up completely becomes infinite.
This becomes zero.

369
00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.120
And there are no time like intervals.

370
00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:59.620
There are no time like intervals that cross the event horizon.

371
00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:02.650
That's why you can't get out.

372
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:07.660
This takes us back to the basic principle of black holes.
So,

373
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:12.100
uh,
cannot,
uh,
communicate.

374
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.860
<v 1>Okay?</v>

375
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.860
<v 0>Or travel over space like intervals.</v>

376
00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:29.580
And so you can't cross r equals let's watch shield radios.

377
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.790
<v 1>All right,</v>

378
00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.360
<v 0>let's see.
Let me write the thing down again here for you.</v>

379
00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:57.813
<v 1>Okay.</v>

380
00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:03.430
<v 0>So that's the metric we're worrying about here.
And now,
uh,</v>

381
00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:08.770
let's think about what happens inside the Schwab showed radius are less than our

382
00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:11.703
Schwab chill.

383
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:16.730
That means the Dr term becomes negative

384
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:23.960
because one minus R s over our,
uh,

385
00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.170
if rs is bigger than our,
then this term is,

386
00:26:27.171 --> 00:26:30.590
this term is greater than one and this whole thing is less than zero and the

387
00:26:30.591 --> 00:26:35.591
signs change and the Dt term becomes positive.

388
00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.730
So that means yes,

389
00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.740
this is the time term

390
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.510
where this one is the space like term cause it's positive.

391
00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:52.383
<v 1>Okay.</v>

392
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.770
<v 0>That's what I meant three,</v>

393
00:26:54.771 --> 00:26:59.360
four or five lectures ago when I said that inside,
uh,
the Schwab Shield radius,

394
00:26:59.361 --> 00:27:02.240
when you're inside the swatch would radius space and time reverse.

395
00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:06.340
It's a sign change in the metric.
That's what it means.
Uh,

396
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:10.400
and you can only travel,

397
00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.950
uh,
along negative intervals.

398
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:18.713
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

399
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:23.750
<v 0>That means you have to move in are the same way outside the Schwartz real</v>

400
00:27:24.251 --> 00:27:27.900
radius.
You have to move in t uh,
and uh,

401
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:30.990
but notice it's only the radial term.
This term hasn't changed.

402
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:34.980
You could go around in circles,
but whatever you do,

403
00:27:34.981 --> 00:27:39.810
you still have to move.
As it turns out toward the center of the thing in radius,

404
00:27:39.811 --> 00:27:42.960
in order to have a timeline interval.

405
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:45.390
And so a motion

406
00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:52.890
in our is required for,

407
00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.260
uh,
inside the Swat showed radius,

408
00:27:56.261 --> 00:28:01.261
whereas motion in t is required outside.

409
00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:05.223
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

410
00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.660
<v 0>So space and time reverse,</v>

411
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:19.580
all of which is very nice.
Uh,
but I've left out something,
uh,

412
00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:24.540
uh,
I've left something out,
which is the fact how inside the event horizon,

413
00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:28.410
how do you know that this is still the metric one could invent some function

414
00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:31.620
that looks just like this outside the Schwab showed radius,

415
00:28:31.621 --> 00:28:34.400
but then it looks like something else inside the structural radius.

416
00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.880
And because no communication across the swore chilled radius as possible,

417
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.530
you'd never be able to test it.

418
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:45.720
And so this is how one gets away with doing non testable,
uh,

419
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:49.530
physics.
You say,
well,
we're just going to assume that the metric hasn't changed.

420
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.990
Why should it change after all?
It's a,
it's the same equation.
Uh,
but uh,

421
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:57.390
but inside the SRA trialed radius,
you can't actually test this outside.

422
00:28:57.391 --> 00:29:01.740
The Schwartz showed radius.
You can test it because you see,
uh,
whether,
uh,

423
00:29:01.741 --> 00:29:05.550
objects behave as they ought to behave in a space that's curved in this

424
00:29:05.551 --> 00:29:09.940
particular way,
you know,
spacetime that's curved in this particular way.
Um,

425
00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:13.890
and so this is,
uh,
uh,

426
00:29:13.891 --> 00:29:16.490
what I meant by,
uh,

427
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:21.020
five classes would go by saying space and time reverse these two,
uh,

428
00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:25.440
quantities,
reverse their signs.
All right,

429
00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:31.110
that's as far as we can go because the next thing that one would want to do is

430
00:29:31.111 --> 00:29:36.111
you find out what the equation is for finding out how things move in these,

431
00:29:36.871 --> 00:29:39.010
in these,
uh,
curved space times.

432
00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:43.390
Basically you remember things go from one event to another in the shortest

433
00:29:43.391 --> 00:29:45.850
possible path.
That's the equivalent of a straight line.

434
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:50.020
That means if you integrate over D Tau,
it has to be minimized.

435
00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:53.350
So you minimize this integral that tells you how things move.

436
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:57.520
We're not going to do that,
uh,
sighs of relief,
um,

437
00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:02.590
and uh,
uh,
because,
uh,
for obvious reasons.
Um,

438
00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:06.760
so this is this,
this is as far as we can go just to write down the metric here.

439
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.650
So let me now pause,
uh,

440
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:14.410
four questions and then we're going to go back and talk about,
uh,
uh,

441
00:30:14.411 --> 00:30:17.190
astronomy about things in the sky that actually,
uh,

442
00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.750
exhibit these relativistic behaviors.
Yes,

443
00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:26.893
<v 1>sorry.</v>

444
00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:34.720
<v 0>Oh,
ah,
an interval.
So what I'm doing is I'm taking two events,</v>

445
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:39.430
each of which is one of these points in space time.
And I'm asking,

446
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.360
uh,
what is the interval between them of what is,

447
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:45.160
you could measure the distance between them.

448
00:30:45.161 --> 00:30:49.240
You could measure the time from one to one event to another,
but as it turns out,

449
00:30:49.241 --> 00:30:52.720
those aren't in variants.
And so there's this other thing,
the,

450
00:30:52.721 --> 00:30:56.140
the metric which is invariant.
And so that's a,

451
00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.520
that's a s a measure and invariant measure of how,
uh,

452
00:31:00.521 --> 00:31:03.130
of how separated these two events are.
So I've,

453
00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:08.320
I've chosen you take to events and you ask yourself,
are they separated by zero,

454
00:31:08.321 --> 00:31:12.160
a positive quantity or a negative quantity?
Whether whereby separation,
I mean,

455
00:31:12.161 --> 00:31:14.380
this curious combination of space

456
00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:15.373
<v 1>time.</v>

457
00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:23.030
<v 0>Yeah,
it's an intro level.
Think of thing.
Let me go back to the analogy.</v>

458
00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:27.530
I started with a,
here's in two spatial dimensions,

459
00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:29.160
x and y.
Uh,

460
00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:33.620
here are two points and depending on how I set the coordinate system up,

461
00:31:33.621 --> 00:31:34.670
the x distance,

462
00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:38.180
the x difference between them and the wide difference between them can change,

463
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:41.160
but the distance is always the same.
Uh,

464
00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:46.180
so now I've got two points with each,

465
00:31:46.761 --> 00:31:49.070
with an x,
Y,
Z and a t.

466
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:53.710
And depending on how I change my velocity are my coordinates,
uh,

467
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:58.430
the particular values of x,
Y,
Z and t can change.
But the,
uh,

468
00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:03.170
this Delta Tau a squared defined by,

469
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:05.980
I'm in flat space now,
right.

470
00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:07.353
<v 1>Uh,</v>

471
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:11.803
this

472
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:16.340
<v 0>separation,
this interval between those two points,</v>

473
00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:21.640
this is the invariant in the same way that the distance between two points

474
00:32:21.681 --> 00:32:23.750
doesn't change.
If you change the coordinate system,

475
00:32:23.751 --> 00:32:25.680
even though the x and y separations do,

476
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.480
it gives you no,
well,

477
00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:34.710
it combines these four things into one thing that doesn't change.

478
00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.113
<v 1>That's the point.</v>

479
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:39.833
<v 0>Yes.</v>

480
00:32:40.770 --> 00:32:43.440
<v 1>Um,
as the,</v>

481
00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:45.850
is the integral from zero,

482
00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:49.090
it basically to medicine appear simultaneous

483
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.120
<v 0>as,
as the,
yeah,
exactly.</v>

484
00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:54.723
<v 1>Wow.</v>

485
00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:00.230
<v 0>Well,
okay,</v>

486
00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:05.290
so there's two different ways things can appear simultaneously.

487
00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:10.250
One is if they are two different events in space time,

488
00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.170
uh,
and uh,

489
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:16.970
I had light travels from one and they're exactly separated by,
by,
uh,

490
00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:20.900
the amount of time between them as the same as the distance between them.

491
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:23.450
If you multiply by sees quick,
uh,

492
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:28.610
they can also appear simultaneously if they are the same point as each other.

493
00:33:28.930 --> 00:33:30.890
Uh,
and then everything goes to zero.

494
00:33:30.891 --> 00:33:35.190
And it's only in that second case that,
uh,
uh,

495
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:36.163
that it,

496
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:41.300
that the Newtonian concept of simultaneous kicks in simultaneous,

497
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:46.340
uh,
is usually taken to mean that the time separation is zero.

498
00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:49.520
Two things happen simultaneously when they happen at the same time.

499
00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:53.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

500
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:56.100
<v 0>The earth on earth that did the,
the,
uh,</v>

501
00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:58.350
the distances and the stamp,

502
00:33:58.351 --> 00:34:03.351
the velocities and the gravitational fields are never so strong that you have

503
00:34:03.421 --> 00:34:05.850
any trouble,
uh,
that,

504
00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:09.750
that the Delta t changes significantly depending on what your,

505
00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.600
what your point of view is.
So,
you know,

506
00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.520
our everyday life we have a strong concept of simultaneity.

507
00:34:14.521 --> 00:34:16.440
It's two things that happen at the same time.

508
00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:19.260
Turns out though that if you move it close to the speed,

509
00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:22.350
if you observe to events to be at the same time,

510
00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:24.570
and I'm moving at close to the speed of light,

511
00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:29.100
I don't observe those two events at the same time,
even though you do.
Uh,

512
00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:33.780
and so at that point you have to abandon the new Tony and concept that uh,

513
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:38.490
Delta t equals zero tells you the two events are simultaneous and the whole

514
00:34:38.491 --> 00:34:41.190
concept of simultaneity he takes on a different cash.

515
00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:47.540
Other questions?
Yes.
Uh,
okay.

516
00:34:47.541 --> 00:34:50.300
So these units can be,
uh,

517
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:54.080
can be any units of length you like provided the,
uh,

518
00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:59.350
any units of length you like provided the time units are uh,

519
00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.550
uh,
are related to it by sea.

520
00:35:01.551 --> 00:35:04.340
That is to say if your distance units are light years,

521
00:35:04.341 --> 00:35:09.050
your time units have to be years.
If you're distant units are meters,

522
00:35:09.290 --> 00:35:13.940
then your time units or some kind of meter light meters.
Second thing.

523
00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:16.040
Uh,
and so the only,
uh,

524
00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:20.390
the only restriction on the units you use is that the time and the space units

525
00:35:20.391 --> 00:35:25.070
have to be convertible into each other through c square or alternatively,

526
00:35:25.071 --> 00:35:28.700
another way of saying it is you use any units you like and as long as you

527
00:35:28.701 --> 00:35:31.490
expressed the speed of light in those units,

528
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:34.790
if you have a time unit in a space unit,
if you're in you,

529
00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:39.000
if you're measuring your,
your space in logs in your time in fortnights,

530
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.560
as long as you're a c as in furlongs per fortnight,
it's gonna come out.
Okay.

531
00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:45.530
<v 1>Okay.</v>

532
00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:47.270
<v 0>So as long as it's convertible,</v>

533
00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:51.990
<v 1>other questions?</v>

534
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:54.251
<v 0>Okay.</v>

535
00:35:54.251 --> 00:35:59.251
If you don't get all the details and nuances of what I,

536
00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:03.160
what I've said this period,
don't worry too much about it.
Uh,

537
00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:08.380
I just wanted to get the concept of the metric out there and show you how,

538
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.260
if you look at that equation,
uh,

539
00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:16.270
these concepts of space and time reversing and so forth have a kind of

540
00:36:16.271 --> 00:36:20.740
mathematical consequence as well as just,
you know,
spouting words.
Uh,

541
00:36:20.741 --> 00:36:24.460
and if you get sort of the basic outline of the argument,
that's,
that's fine.

542
00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:25.593
<v 1>Okay.</v>

543
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:29.370
<v 0>Okay.
Uh,</v>

544
00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:35.250
back to actual things in actual,
uh,

545
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.720
that actually exist.
Um,

546
00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:41.610
so what I want to talk about now is evidence

547
00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:47.700
for general relativity from

548
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:53.830
astronomical
objects,

549
00:36:53.831 --> 00:36:56.950
real black hole,
stuff like that.
Now,

550
00:36:56.951 --> 00:37:00.220
one of the curious things about this is that when Einstein thought all this

551
00:37:00.221 --> 00:37:04.930
stuff up,
he thought it up from basically these philosophical concerns about,

552
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:06.490
uh,
about mass,

553
00:37:06.491 --> 00:37:10.720
that the inertial mass turned out to always be equal to the gravitational mass.

554
00:37:10.721 --> 00:37:12.520
Why would that be?
Uh,

555
00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:17.910
and there wasn't when he thought it up a great body of evidence,

556
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:22.180
uh,
for grant of,
for his theory in the real world.

557
00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:26.260
This is in contrast to special relativity,
special relativity.
Uh,

558
00:37:26.261 --> 00:37:30.100
there were all these experiments that needed to be explained,
general relativity,

559
00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:33.790
uh,
very,
very little.
In fact,
when Einstein First,
uh,

560
00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:36.100
put forward the theory in 1917,

561
00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:40.630
there was only one thing that had ever been observed that actually showed an

562
00:37:40.631 --> 00:37:42.220
effect of general relativity.

563
00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:46.930
And that was the orbit of mercury a which you're reading about for this week's

564
00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:50.650
problem set.
So,
uh,

565
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:54.700
just going back a little bit,
in the 19th century,

566
00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:59.890
people had observed the orbits of planets in,
uh,
uh,

567
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.560
in great in great detail.

568
00:38:02.561 --> 00:38:06.190
And they found out that two of the planet we're moving,
uh,

569
00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:07.930
in ways they couldn't quite explain.

570
00:38:07.931 --> 00:38:11.540
There was very small deviations from the predictions,
uh,

571
00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:16.830
or a bird in particularly.
The orbit of Uranus was a little weird.
Uh,

572
00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:21.840
and that was then quickly explained by the presence of an unknown hitherto

573
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:25.210
unknown planet,

574
00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:31.000
which was also exerting a gravitational force on your anus and pulling it out of

575
00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.600
the orbit.
That it should have been by a very small amount,
uh,

576
00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:38.800
because the gravitational force of another planet is very small compared to that

577
00:38:38.801 --> 00:38:42.730
of the sun.
But by the middle of the 19th century,
they could measure such things,

578
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:45.520
uh,
and they therefore predicted,

579
00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:46.920
<v 1>okay,</v>

580
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:51.180
<v 0>the presence of this other planet,
uh,
of Neptune.</v>

581
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:54.330
And they calculated where it should be.

582
00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:59.780
And some guy went off and observed in that spot and found it predicted presence

583
00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:03.780
of,
of Neptune and,
uh,
discovered.

584
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:04.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

585
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:07.310
<v 0>Yet,
uh,
in the predicted place,</v>

586
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:14.170
big triumph.
Everybody as if they had had Nobel prizes back then,

587
00:39:14.171 --> 00:39:17.080
they would have wanted for this,
uh,
for sure.
Uh,

588
00:39:17.081 --> 00:39:20.650
and then there was a whole big kerfuffle because they couldn't decide whether

589
00:39:20.651 --> 00:39:24.570
the French guy had done it before the English guy or vice versa.
And,
uh,
uh,

590
00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:27.940
they argued with each other for decades about who gets the credit.

591
00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:33.010
But in scientific terms,
there was a prediction and the prediction was verified.

592
00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:35.140
Excellent News.
Uh,

593
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:39.550
now there was also a problem with the orbit of Mercury,

594
00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.110
also a perturbed from what you would expect.

595
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.860
And having had this big triumph in the outer solar system,
they figured,
well,

596
00:39:50.861 --> 00:39:55.390
we know how to deal with this.
Uh,
there's gotta be another planet in there.

597
00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:58.390
So they predict,
uh,

598
00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:02.530
the presence of a planet called Vulcan,

599
00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:05.270
uh,

600
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:09.470
which then disappears from the scientific literature until it's resurrected by

601
00:40:09.471 --> 00:40:12.420
star Trek.
Uh,
but Vulcan,
the,

602
00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:16.490
the concept of Vulcan was this was going to be a planet that's closer to the sun

603
00:40:16.491 --> 00:40:17.121
than mercury.

604
00:40:17.121 --> 00:40:21.230
That's why they haven't been able to find it because it's too near the sun to be

605
00:40:21.231 --> 00:40:23.870
easily observed.
Uh,
and,
uh,

606
00:40:23.871 --> 00:40:28.250
it's going to pull on mercury in such a way that it's going to explain the

607
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:30.710
problems with the orbit of mercury.

608
00:40:30.920 --> 00:40:34.760
And so they then look for Vulcan in the predicted place

609
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:38.060
and they find it

610
00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:45.500
and that somebody else finds it.
They find it many times,

611
00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.660
and each time it's different,
uh,

612
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:53.040
all different and it gradually becomes clear.
Uh,

613
00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:56.120
then everybody's fooling themselves,
uh,
that there is no,

614
00:40:56.330 --> 00:40:58.430
this is a really hard observation to make,
right?

615
00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:02.300
Because the thing is right near the sun.
Uh,
and,
uh,
uh,

616
00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:05.460
so it turns out that all of this is wrong.
Uh,

617
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:11.300
none of these observations or really any good,
uh,
uh,

618
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:15.860
it's not repeatable.
So,
uh,
not really.

619
00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:18.260
Uh,

620
00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:22.910
and so after some attempts to find Falcon and then they rule out the presence of

621
00:41:22.911 --> 00:41:24.290
fall pen and various places,

622
00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:27.170
so then the people calculating the orbit tough to go back and say,
well,

623
00:41:27.171 --> 00:41:28.130
it fucking isn't there.

624
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:33.050
Maybe there are two or three planets combining together to do the thing that

625
00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:36.800
originally wanted,
Volk it to do.
This gets sorted out of control after a while.

626
00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:40.280
And at a certain point,
people just kind of give up and they say,
well,

627
00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:44.780
it's a great big mystery about mercury.
Uh,
and after a while after that,

628
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:48.950
uh,
people kind of even stopped caring,
uh,
because,
you know,

629
00:41:48.951 --> 00:41:50.510
we know Newton's laws work.

630
00:41:50.511 --> 00:41:55.310
This is just some weirdness about mercury that we don't understand.
Uh,
and then,

631
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:59.060
uh,
when Einstein,

632
00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.013
<v 1>yeah.</v>

633
00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:06.710
<v 0>Uh,
uh,
creates his new theory of gravity,</v>

634
00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:07.923
<v 1>okay.</v>

635
00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:15.880
<v 0>He then computes in the new theory Mercury's orbit.</v>

636
00:42:18.070 --> 00:42:18.770
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

637
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:22.910
<v 0>And he now gets something that agrees with the observations</v>

638
00:42:27.550 --> 00:42:30.310
without the need for a new planet.

639
00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:40.090
And so what happened was Mercury's orbit is a little different from the

640
00:42:40.091 --> 00:42:42.130
Newtonian prediction.
Uh,

641
00:42:42.131 --> 00:42:45.820
the general relativity prediction is a little bit different in just the same way

642
00:42:45.821 --> 00:42:50.370
to explain this problem that people have been trying to solve for 50 years on

643
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:53.800
successfully.
Uh,
and,
uh,

644
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:55.063
<v 1>yeah,</v>

645
00:42:56.930 --> 00:43:00.920
<v 0>so this was,
uh,
this was the first verification,</v>

646
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:04.520
empirical verification of General Relativity.
And if you think about it,

647
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:08.930
you would expect that Mercury will be the place you would find this out.
Uh,

648
00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.000
for Mercury,

649
00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:13.753
<v 1>uh,</v>

650
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.190
<v 0>r s over our,</v>

651
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:19.790
this is the Schwartz chilled radius of the sun because that's what's doing the

652
00:43:19.791 --> 00:43:24.050
gravity.
Tating is the biggest in the solar system,

653
00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:28.620
uh,

654
00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:32.610
because the are the distance from mercury to the sun is the smallest of any of

655
00:43:32.611 --> 00:43:35.820
the planets in the solar system.
So this,
uh,
uh,

656
00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.180
and so the relativistic effects,
the Gr,

657
00:43:39.210 --> 00:43:44.150
the general relativity effect,
uh,
are,
uh,

658
00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:45.870
relatively large.

659
00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:48.853
<v 1>But</v>

660
00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:53.040
<v 0>you know,
this is still a really small number.
This is three kilometers.</v>

661
00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:56.100
The swatch of radius of the sun.
Mercury is way out there somewhere.

662
00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:58.440
So even though this is the most,

663
00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:01.470
this is the biggest relativistic effect in the solar system,

664
00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:05.020
it still isn't that huge.
Uh,
let me,
uh,

665
00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:08.400
just remind you what this effect is.
Here's the sun.

666
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:14.270
Mercury's going around the sun and it's going around in a slightly elliptical

667
00:44:14.761 --> 00:44:18.600
orbit.
I'm going to draw a very elliptical orbit here,

668
00:44:18.601 --> 00:44:20.490
but it's really not that big.

669
00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:24.480
And there's a point in the orbit where it is closest to the sun.

670
00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:29.810
That point is called the Para helion Perry for close Helio's for Sun.

671
00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:32.150
<v 1>Yeah.
Of</v>

672
00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:35.960
<v 0>Mercury.
And in the new Tony,
in theory,</v>

673
00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:37.710
you should have exactly the same more,

674
00:44:37.711 --> 00:44:41.900
but every time you should come back and the Para helion should be in the same

675
00:44:41.901 --> 00:44:46.190
place.
In each successive orbit.
The orbit doesn't move or doesn't change.

676
00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:50.390
But in general relativity,
the Para helion moves.

677
00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:55.340
So after a while,
uh,
the Para helion will be here,
the whole orbit.

678
00:44:55.341 --> 00:45:00.330
We'll kind of tip this way
and it'll look like this.

679
00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.480
Uh,
so this is the Para helion later.

680
00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.233
<v 1>Okay.</v>

681
00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:13.400
<v 0>And it looks like that.
And uh,
the ankle,</v>

682
00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.940
which the Para helion makes with the sun has changed.

683
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:21.970
This angle here is called the angle pair of heels and this precesses.

684
00:45:22.341 --> 00:45:24.200
So this is called the precession

685
00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:27.960
of the Para helion.

686
00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:35.700
And it's measured in some angle per time because of the question is how long

687
00:45:35.711 --> 00:45:39.610
does it take for the Paris Elian to process across some ankle.

688
00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:44.560
And the key number for mercury is 43.
Arc seconds.

689
00:45:44.561 --> 00:45:47.620
Remember arc seconds.
Those are small angles per century,

690
00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.290
a really small
movement,

691
00:45:57.291 --> 00:46:01.460
but something that can be measured and,
and had been measured.
And,
uh,

692
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:05.180
it's not surprising that this is small because the relativistic effects are

693
00:46:05.181 --> 00:46:08.300
going to be small because the swatch old radius of the sun is really small

694
00:46:08.301 --> 00:46:12.290
compared to the size of the orbit of mercury.
But this was,

695
00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.490
uh,
this was observed,
uh,

696
00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:19.490
before Einstein made his theory.
Nobody understood it.

697
00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:24.050
Einstein came up with his theory of turned out,
it predicted a,

698
00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:28.070
a precession of the Para helion.
And in a way that Newton didn't,

699
00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:32.360
and it turned out to work out precisely.
So that was good.
Uh,

700
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:35.180
and at the time,
Einstein published the theory.

701
00:46:35.181 --> 00:46:38.600
This was the only piece of evidence that it was correct.

702
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:44.600
Pretty small,
uh,
uh,
empirical verification.

703
00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:50.300
And so,
uh,
let's just write down,

704
00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:56.180
uh,
the fable here.
This is,

705
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:57.110
uh,

706
00:46:57.110 --> 00:47:02.110
Einstein and the precession of the Para helion.

707
00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:08.750
And there are two versions of the moral,
sometimes in textbooks,
you know,

708
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:11.780
uh,
they,
they make a big deal out of this.
They say,
oh,

709
00:47:11.781 --> 00:47:13.700
there was this terrible problem with mercury.

710
00:47:13.701 --> 00:47:16.130
And then Einstein came along with his great new theory,

711
00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:20.690
solve that problem in the same way that they say there was this terrible problem

712
00:47:20.691 --> 00:47:23.210
with the speed of light being constant from all frames.

713
00:47:23.211 --> 00:47:26.540
And Einstein came along with special relativity and solve that problem.

714
00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:31.560
That's a misreading of,
of history.
This was a byproduct of Einstein,

715
00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:34.780
wasn't that there was a problem with,
uh,

716
00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:39.700
the data and he went out to try and fix the theory to,
to conform with the data.

717
00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:44.500
Uh,
there was very little data.
So the,
the,
the moral here is,
uh,

718
00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:49.180
um,
aesthetic,
uh,

719
00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:52.150
considerations,
aesthetic,

720
00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:55.210
perhaps you want to call this philosophical

721
00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:02.820
considerations can lead to a good new theory because he didn't really do it to

722
00:48:07.331 --> 00:48:10.690
explain the data.
Uh,
this is however,

723
00:48:10.691 --> 00:48:13.930
the only time I can think of where this actually happened,
this way,

724
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:18.670
every other major advance in science came about because the observers are the

725
00:48:18.671 --> 00:48:23.440
experimentation or the experimenters had a problem,
uh,
but not Gr,

726
00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:28.330
uh,
only for general relativity.

727
00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:32.080
Now subsequent to that,

728
00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:35.950
between 1917 when this theory was promulgated,

729
00:48:35.951 --> 00:48:40.330
and now there have been,
uh,
a variety,

730
00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:47.520
a variety of tests of general relativity using astronomical objects,

731
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:52.690
you always have to use astronomical or almost always have to use a astronomical

732
00:48:52.691 --> 00:48:56.560
objects to test this because you need really strong gravitational fields and

733
00:48:56.561 --> 00:49:00.040
it's hard to produce a really strong gravitational field in the laboratory.

734
00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:02.890
You're kind of limited to what the earth provides you with.

735
00:49:03.070 --> 00:49:06.370
And that isn't such a strong gravitational field.
Uh,
we,

736
00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:11.460
we computed at some point the Schwartzwald radius of the earth are over our

737
00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.450
Schwab Childers,
the relevant quantity,

738
00:49:13.451 --> 00:49:16.240
and it's really small from the Earth's gravitational field.

739
00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:17.680
So it's hard to see these things.

740
00:49:17.681 --> 00:49:21.550
So all these tests tend to be astronomical in nature since then,

741
00:49:21.551 --> 00:49:26.200
a variety of tests of Gr.
And,
and the punchline is that it passes all of them.

742
00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:32.470
Gr is still a good theory.
There's no contradictory data.
Uh,

743
00:49:32.471 --> 00:49:36.810
but the tests still aren't as strong as you might have hoped they would be.

744
00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:41.230
And we'll talk about,
uh,
some of those,
uh,
on Thursday.
