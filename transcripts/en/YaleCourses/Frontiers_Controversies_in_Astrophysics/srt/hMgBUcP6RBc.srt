1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,090
Last time my, uh, I wrote down
the Schwartz Shield metric, uh,

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,370
which was the sort of culmination of
the theoretical part of the, uh, uh,

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,920
uh,
of this section of the course.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,440
And I realized as I was talking to
some of you afterwards about, uh,

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,610
uh, about some of the implications
of this that, uh, the way I,

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,790
one of the ways in which I wrote it
down might've been a little confusing.

7
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:30,110
So let me write it down again.
Uh, and I'll say a couple things.

8
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,930
And what I'm going to do is
I'm going to write it down, uh,

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,430
with a little r instead of a capital r.

10
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,900
And I'll tell you why in just a minute.
Obviously it doesn't matter.

11
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:46,750
I've just changed the notation slightly.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,280
And the reason I want to do this is
because I want to emphasize that this are

13
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,210
the little r Wood I've now written down
as a little r in this equation is not

14
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,730
the radius of the object are,

15
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,070
is just a coordinator.

16
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:14,983
Yeah.

17
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,750
It, uh, it can be anything. It's
not the radius of the object, uh,

18
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,380
for which the mass is giving
you the swatch drilled radius.

19
00:01:24,381 --> 00:01:28,510
The Schwartz wrote radius is ups
is a very specific ratings. Uh,

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,240
R sub s is equal to two
g m oversee squared.

21
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:39,080
So that's a specific number or is the
little r here is just to coordinate and so

22
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:42,380
is uh,
fi and theta,

23
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:47,210
which combined into this thing
which I've called Omega and t. Uh,

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,800
and so, uh, if you have an object

25
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:58,120
of mass am and radius,

26
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,840
I'll give a,
I'll call that a r sub zero,

27
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:05,590
just to make sure that you understand
that this is the radius of the object.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,290
The radius of the object
doesn't come into this metric.

29
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,950
The mass does because the mass, uh, uh,

30
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:20,820
turns into the Schwab radius and that's
part of, that's part of the equation.

31
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:25,230
But the radius of the object doesn't
matter. And so if you then ask,

32
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:29,970
well what is a black hole? A black
hole is something in which, uh,

33
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,030
the radius of the object is less
than the Schwartz Shield radius.

34
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,260
Because if that's true,

35
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,700
then there is some coordinate are some
little are where a little R is equal to r

36
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:50,130
s and then if you go up into in
into these equations here, very,

37
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:54,000
these very strange things happen when
little r is equal to rs. Yes. Question.

38
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,360
Oh, you're right. You're right. It has
to be the other way around. I'm sorry

39
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,120
this has to be squared. You're
right on both counts. Good. Uh,

40
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,200
s over our rs over our,
yes,

41
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,340
it better be that way because
our s over our in uh, in,

42
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,680
in the normal part of spaces less
than one. So thank you very much.

43
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:18,514
Sorry about that.

44
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,923
MMM.

45
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,220
Okay. I think we're all, I think we're all
right. Are we all right? Yeah. Good. Uh,

46
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:27,900
okay,

47
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,160
so there is some r where r is equal to
rs and then these very bizarre things

48
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:36,540
start to happen.
If our zero,

49
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:41,040
the radius of the actual object is
bigger than a true our trilled radius,

50
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,570
then that isn't true.

51
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,780
There's no r where R is equal to r s then,

52
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:49,610
okay.

53
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,190
No are equal to rs.

54
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:57,191
Now you might think that somewhere inside
the object there would be a little R,

55
00:03:58,021 --> 00:04:00,670
which is equal to the Schwartz
drilled radius. But that isn't a,

56
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,790
that turns out not to be right
either because the relevant m

57
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,100
the relevant mass. Oh, sure.

58
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:13,103
Uh,

59
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,170
oh yeah.

60
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,340
Okay. So yeah, let me get this back.

61
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,590
The relevant mass, uh, is the mass

62
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:29,750
okay.

63
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:33,840
Inside
are,

64
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,580
so if you're,
uh,

65
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,210
if you've got some mass and
like this and you're outside,

66
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,230
if you're here then the
whole of the mass counts.

67
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,140
But if you're sitting inside this thing,

68
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:49,500
then the only mass that
counts is this mass here.

69
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,763
Uh,

70
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,010
and so for our,

71
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,220
for coordinates,
for positions inside the object,

72
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,640
then the relevant mass that you put into
the equation is less than the mass of

73
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,560
the whole object.

74
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,550
And the consequence of that is that as
you go further and further inside the

75
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:25,610
thing, the mass becomes less and less. Uh,

76
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,960
and the Schwab chilled radius
becomes less and less. And so it, uh,

77
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,990
if the total size of the object is
greater than the Schwab chilled radius,

78
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,220
then there is no position,

79
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,623
uh,

80
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,091
inside the thing,

81
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:46,420
which is less than the Schwartz drilled
radius because the relevant mass

82
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:47,560
decreases and soldiers,

83
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,300
the Schwartz would radius as you go in
toward the center of the object. So,

84
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,310
uh, I just wanted to, uh,
to make sure you understood,

85
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,510
uh, that the, the key to
using this metric is that the,

86
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,570
the, this, our term in it
tells you where you are.

87
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,850
It has nothing to do with
the size of the object,

88
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:12,500
and you become a black hole when the
size of the object is smaller than the

89
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:15,500
Schwab chilled radius.
Because under those circumstances,

90
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:19,250
there's some position or set of positions,
uh,

91
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:23,030
where you can be inside the Schwab,
chilled a radius,

92
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:26,690
and therefore all of these very
exotic effects start to happen.

93
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,570
Questions on this

94
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,360
or have I just baffled you further?

95
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,290
Okay.

96
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:41,080
Well, we'll see. Sorry. Oh, no. Yes.

97
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:45,440
This is the radius of the
object, son. His son has a,

98
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:48,380
has a.in the middle. Not that you
could tell with my handwriting, but uh,

99
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,220
okay. I don't know whether that
was helpful or not, but, uh,

100
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,450
I felt the need to say yes
please. Oh, this right here.

101
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,270
Yeah. So, uh, uh,

102
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,100
the situation is that what is the relevant
m to put into this equation? This,

103
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:16,010
this is true by the way,
in Newtonian physics also,

104
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,530
if you're inside an object,

105
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,550
then the mass outside of your position,

106
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:28,170
this stuff doesn't count toward
the M and you only want to count,

107
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:33,270
uh,
the mass inside of where you are.

108
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,590
Yeah. So this whole circle
is an object object, uh,

109
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,560
with,
uh,

110
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,310
mass and some with some
mass in some radius.

111
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,920
But now you're asking the question,

112
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,030
what happens if you're
somewhere inside this thing?

113
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,220
Yes. No. The dot. Well,

114
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:01,420
the dotted line could be anything.
You're at some position inside and this,

115
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,910
the dotted line is,
uh,

116
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:08,470
the radius at which you are at
which your particular position?

117
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:14,320
No, it's just, it's just wherever
you are inside the thing,

118
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,840
less mass counts than you think it's going
to because it's only the stuff inside

119
00:08:19,841 --> 00:08:21,670
your own radius that counts toward,

120
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,180
toward the metric or toward
the gravitational force.

121
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:30,040
In the Newtonian thing you
can be at whatever point you
choose to be inside here,

122
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,820
you can draw this same thing.
And the,

123
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,070
the point of this is that if you are
now down in here where you thought the

124
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:42,070
Schwartz Shield radius was going to be
for the whole of this mass, in fact,

125
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:45,910
the Schwartz showed radius is still
going to be inside your position because

126
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,250
much less mass will count toward it.

127
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,220
This isn't helping. I can tell by
the look on your face. Um, okay.

128
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,140
Let me try again.
Let me try again.

129
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,230
Okay, here's, here's an object, okay?

130
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,410
And this object has r has a radius bigger
than neutral Nutro Archbold radius,

131
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,790
and it's got some mass. Okay, so now
I'm going to draw in dotted lines.

132
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,810
It's Schwartz Shield radius
that's inside here. Okay?

133
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,650
Now supposing you're inside this object,

134
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,340
supposing you're living here,
uh,

135
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,080
then at that point, you, I,

136
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:34,140
I draw this sort of interior radius here.
And,

137
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,450
uh, if I'm at this point,
then I ask what is the,

138
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:44,960
the Schwartz Shield radius
that goes into the metric

139
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,440
for something that's sitting
inside for person x here?

140
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,430
And the answer to that is it's actually
smaller than the Schwartz showed radius

141
00:09:57,431 --> 00:10:02,431
of the entire object because less mass
counts only this mass counts towards the

142
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:04,910
Schwab trilled radio.

143
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:09,911
So there's some part of the object
whose mass no longer counts because it's

144
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,530
outside your position.

145
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:15,340
And so as I move in here
to some interior point,

146
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,150
the Schwartzwald radius that is
appropriate for me to use become smaller.

147
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,090
Does that make more sense?
Ah,

148
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,820
so if I was a black, if it
was a black hole, right? Okay.

149
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:30,460
So now let's do the opposite case.
Good question

150
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,420
is less than the Schwab chilled radius.

151
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:39,421
So now here's my object and here's
the Schwartz chilled radius.

152
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,940
That's the difference,
right? And therefore, uh, uh,

153
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,630
and the consequence of this,
by the way,

154
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:52,920
is that this whole object sinks
down to a point because remember,

155
00:10:52,921 --> 00:10:56,220
things inside the Schwab showed radius
have to contract down to a point.

156
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,370
So I can't be part way through it,
no matter what I do.

157
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:14,990
Dan, you know, if I'm outside this, uh,
this tiny little thing, if I'm here,

158
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,560
I have the same short showed radius
because all of the masses interior to my

159
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:19,394
position.

160
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,660
So the key thing is,

161
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,640
is the objects smaller or bigger
than its own? Schwab, chilled radius,

162
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:37,040
all the mass is going to be
closer. All yeah, all, well,

163
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,630
all the math,
if the,

164
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,660
if the radius of the object is
smaller than a truck showed radius,

165
00:11:41,661 --> 00:11:46,661
then all the masses inside the Schwartz
drilled radius and any point in our

166
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:48,470
universe where,
you know,

167
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:53,890
and so all are greater than
our s is out somewhere.

168
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,350
And,
and it doesn't matter where you are,

169
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:59,770
all that mass counts because it's all
inside the Schwartzwald radius anyway.

170
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,230
And then when you get to this point,

171
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,470
you have this magic moment where our
equals r s and everything blows up.

172
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,103
Right.

173
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,220
And that can't happen here because as
you move in in the middle of the object,

174
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:28,080
the Schwartz showed radius strengths
down away from you as you get in because

175
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31,800
less and less mass counts counts
towards it. Therefore it gets smaller.

176
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:38,290
Yes. Would it be possible
to have an optic that

177
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,240
there,
there would be a point at which you do it?

178
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,220
Okay.

179
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,220
So could you have some incredible density
gradient where you're actually gaining

180
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:52,260
more, uh, uh,

181
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,930
you're actually catching up to the
Schwab chilled radius as you go in,

182
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,760
in principle,
yes.

183
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,020
But if you work out what that
density gradient would have to be,

184
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:05,350
it would be incredibly, uh,
it would be incredibly steep.

185
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:09,850
Remember there was a problem set at
some point where we discovered that, uh,

186
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:12,580
the last mass,
there isn't a black hole,

187
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,300
the denser it has to be in order to
be inside each war, chilled radius.

188
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:21,290
So as you're losing mass,
as you get down, uh, uh,

189
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,203
in here,

190
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,270
the amount by which it has to be denser
on the inside goes up really sharply.

191
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:32,070
Uh, but yes, such a thing can be
imagined, imagined, for example, uh,

192
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,150
a black hole with an atmosphere.
Imagine there's some orange,

193
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:40,000
some just gas floating around out here.
If you think of that as one object,

194
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,190
then when you're outside the gas,

195
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,400
if you think of the outer edge of the
gas is the edge of the object, then, uh,

196
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,660
that's not a black hole. And if you
come on, you, you know, if you go down,

197
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,940
sink down into the atmosphere,
eventually you'll find it.

198
00:13:51,941 --> 00:13:54,200
So that's an incredibly steep,
uh,

199
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,830
density change because you've gone
from an atmosphere to some object.

200
00:13:57,831 --> 00:14:01,150
So in principle, that's
possible, uh, in, uh,

201
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:04,030
any kind of real object
that's holding itself up,

202
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,360
probably not because the density
gradient would have to be so severe.

203
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,360
Yes.
How would this work?

204
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,540
How does it work for non spherical
objects? Excellent. Uh, okay. So,

205
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,060
uh,
let's see.

206
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,310
What happens is, uh, if you have
a non spherical at first of all,

207
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:28,740
the gravitational forces are
sufficiently strong near a,

208
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:32,210
if you're anything close to a black hole
that you're likely to end up spherical.

209
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,360
The only way you don't is if
you're spinning because then,

210
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,000
uh, then you know, you, you,
you bulge out at the center, uh,

211
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:45,940
spinning black holes exist. They
have a different metric and the, uh,

212
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,470
uh,
uh,

213
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:50,930
the angular term becomes important because
you're spinning around and there's,

214
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,150
and it's a different metric and the shape
of the event horizon where R is equal

215
00:14:56,151 --> 00:15:00,080
to r s or the equivalent in this
other metric is non spherical.

216
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,910
And so you can have nonspiritual event
horizons if the thing is spinning because

217
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:09,220
that has the effect of making the
mass distribution different. Uh,

218
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:13,790
and there as this is called occur
black hole, it has occur metric k,

219
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:18,620
e r r a and that's a different metric
and it's got a whole other set of terms

220
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,490
that have to do with the row, with the
rotational, the angular component. Uh,

221
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,360
but again, the same thing happens
when you get to some place.

222
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:28,400
All the terms blow up.
Uh,

223
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:31,460
but it's a non spherical
surface where that occurs.

224
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,720
You have to do it in cylindrical
coordinates. It becomes a mess.

225
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,340
Not that it isn't a mess already.
Other questions?

226
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,520
All right.
Um,

227
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,520
let me go back to the effects of,
uh,

228
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:59,560
of general relativity. Uh, we've
already done one of these. The,

229
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,810
so what I'm going to talk
about is the Post Newtonian

230
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:12,020
gravitational
effect.

231
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:17,590
So these are things where it just barely
starts to deviate away from what the

232
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:23,210
predictions of Newton's
laws would be. So, uh,

233
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,740
just to, uh, just to go back,
if you take that metric and you,

234
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,590
uh,
and you kind of expand it in,

235
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:34,960
in small quantities
where the, where the, uh,

236
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:38,600
Schwab short radius is much,
much smaller than wherever you are.

237
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,860
And you take the first
term of the expansion, uh,

238
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,220
mathematically it turns into the
same things as Newton's laws. Uh,

239
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,300
and so when you're,

240
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:51,740
when you're out there in more or less
flat space or close to flat space,

241
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,630
uh, then Newton's laws still apply because
the expansion of the metric gives you

242
00:16:56,631 --> 00:16:58,340
the,
it gives you the exact same result.

243
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,360
As the gravitational forces become larger,

244
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,410
you start to get a post Newtonian terms
and things start to be a little bit

245
00:17:06,411 --> 00:17:10,220
different from Newton. Uh, and
we've already had one of these. Uh,

246
00:17:10,221 --> 00:17:15,221
so post Newtonian effect number one
is the precession of the Para Helion,

247
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:23,000
where unlike the prediction for Newton,

248
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:27,770
the orbit doesn't exactly repeat. It
sort of moves on a little bit each time.

249
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:31,670
And you get one of these nice sort
of spiral graph patterns, uh, as,

250
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:34,130
as the orbit graduate
as an elliptical orbit.

251
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:38,540
Gradually precesses boot gradually
moves around. So that was the first one.

252
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:44,060
Um, and that was the first one
that was seeing, that was seen, uh,

253
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,020
in mercury,

254
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:48,890
which is the planet you would expect to
see such a thing because it's closest to

255
00:17:48,891 --> 00:17:52,540
the, uh, and therefore our s over ards,

256
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,590
the largest number for mercury, uh, uh,

257
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,090
for any planet in the solar
system. So, uh, mercury.

258
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,033
Yeah,

259
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,111
no,

260
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:07,111
it actually turns out to have been known
before Einstein actually worked out the

261
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:11,940
general relativity. Okay. So now
post Newtonian effect number two

262
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,320
is the deflection of light.

263
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,190
The whole idea remember,
is that there's the,

264
00:18:24,191 --> 00:18:28,680
is that gravity works cause he curved
space and objects moving along this curve

265
00:18:28,681 --> 00:18:32,670
space appear to have curved
trajectories. That's true of light. Also,

266
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,370
light is also moving
across this curve space.

267
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,610
So there's a prediction
in general relativity, uh,

268
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:43,670
that if you shine light
near and a massive object,

269
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,610
it's the path that that light
will take. It's curved, uh,

270
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:53,160
does if the light being gravitational,
he attracted by this object. So,

271
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,180
um,
let's see here.

272
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,370
Imagine the following situation here are
you, you're, you're observing something.

273
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,130
Here's a star.
Uh,

274
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,820
and the path that light
takes to this star,

275
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,900
uh, from the star to your eye
as some kind of straight line.

276
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,270
And so that's where you
perceive the start to be. Now,

277
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:19,800
supposing that along that
between you and this star,

278
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,530
uh,
there's,

279
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,013
yeah,

280
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:29,350
some object. So here's a,
here's an object with mass m.

281
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,180
So a massive object. Now, uh,

282
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,450
because the path is going to curve,
uh,

283
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,840
the path of the light takes from the
start to your eye is going to now look

284
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,240
something like this

285
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,910
and it's deflected by
the presence of the mass,

286
00:19:47,911 --> 00:19:51,600
which curves the space that had 10.
That means you think,

287
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,200
because you're interpreting this as if
the light is coming straight towards you,

288
00:19:55,530 --> 00:20:00,350
you think the star is here
or it appears to be, uh,

289
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,970
there because you say,
all right, what is the,

290
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,450
what is the angle at which the
light is coming into my eye?

291
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:09,690
It's coming from there and
you don't realize that the,

292
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,440
that the star is actually over there
and the light has gone up toward the

293
00:20:13,441 --> 00:20:15,420
ceiling and bent deck down to your eye.

294
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,060
So it's as if I'm looking up there
and seeing the exit side, uh,

295
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,700
because the light from the exit sign
has gone up to the ceiling being bent

296
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:25,890
around by some black hole or something up,

297
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,600
up to up at the top of the classroom
and come back down to my eye. Yeah.

298
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,960
On the other side of
the, ah, it is possible.

299
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:40,830
Yes, it is possible. Uh,
in this particular case,

300
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:45,000
probably not because there wouldn't be
enough band in order to get it in here.

301
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:48,730
So like going this way, for
example, let me take another color

302
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,670
before this gets too complicated,

303
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:55,600
like coming this way would bend like
that and it miss your eye. However,

304
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,740
there are situations in which you
see two images of the same object,

305
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:04,360
one from each side. These are
called gravitational lenses.
Uh, many, many images, uh,

306
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,900
in principle,
if it's lined up exactly right,

307
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:12,040
imagine that it's perfectly
aligned. Uh, then,

308
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,650
uh,
you see this way,

309
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:18,610
you see that way and you see out of
the paper and you can see a whole ring.

310
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,250
This has actually been observed,
not the whole ring, but,

311
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:25,390
but large parts of the ring because
it's an, it's never perfectly aligned.

312
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,490
Uh, but, uh, you can see
these things. These are called
Einstein Einstein's ranks,

313
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,140
and you can actually see them. Uh, you
can see these kinds of multiple images,

314
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:40,330
uh, in cases where, uh,

315
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:45,010
this is a very distant galaxy or quasar.

316
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:50,260
Quasars are, are, uh, uh, uh, very bright,

317
00:21:50,261 --> 00:21:52,150
very small extra galactic objects.

318
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,470
And this is an intervening
galaxy or galaxy cluster.

319
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,880
And you can see these multiple images.
I'll bring some pictures in next time.

320
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:03,400
They're very, they're, they're
amazing looking things. Uh,

321
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,870
it's often true that you can see
four images that comes about when the

322
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:10,660
intervening mass is not spherical.
Uh,

323
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:14,650
and so you get weird deflections
and they're multiple directions.

324
00:22:14,651 --> 00:22:17,590
You see the same object,
a very spectacular thing.

325
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,580
These were discovered only recently.
Uh, but it turns out that there's,

326
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,290
that you can observe this effect even
in our own solar system because what you

327
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:31,060
can do, I'll bring in some
pictures of gravitational lenses.

328
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:33,610
Those are, those are
amazing things. Uh, and uh,

329
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:37,870
what also happens is if you're looking
at something big like a galaxy that has a

330
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:41,440
shape, it distorts the shape. It's
stretches the whole thing out.

331
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,280
You get these amazing pictures.
All right? In any case, in our own,

332
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,930
in our own solar system,

333
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,750
you see this in the following way.
Here's The sun,

334
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,590
and here's a star right behind the song.
Uh,

335
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:04,890
and the light from the
star comes like this.

336
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:09,750
And so you think the stories here.
So if you look at, uh, at a star,

337
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,290
when it's right next to the sun,
right at the edge of the sun,

338
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,560
it seems to be in a different position
relative to stars further relative to

339
00:23:18,571 --> 00:23:22,170
other stars up here.
Here's another star, uh,

340
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,950
than it would if you looked at it at
night when the sun wasn't in the way.

341
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,670
Yes. How do you do daytime? Excellent
question. I'm getting to that.

342
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,530
Uh, okay. So, but the principle is
supposedly the sun were dark. Okay.

343
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,640
Uh,

344
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,640
look at star behind the sun
or right next to the sun.

345
00:23:44,431 --> 00:23:47,360
Really? You can't through
the sun. I'm not that crazy.

346
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,900
A star behind son.
Uh,

347
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,240
and it appears

348
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,720
to be in a different place position

349
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,400
then when observed,

350
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,300
uh, at night without the sun in
the way. Okay. So how do you,

351
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,220
how do you do astronomy during the
daytime? That's a good question. Eclipses,

352
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,360
yes. You wait until there's a solar
eclipse and then you do your observation.

353
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,713
Uh,

354
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:26,690
do this by observing

355
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,540
during an eclipse.

356
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:36,040
And if you do this,
the position,

357
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,780
the change in position of the star,
uh,

358
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,830
if it's right at the edge of the
sun and you've now blocked the sun,

359
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:48,510
cause here's the moon, right?
And the light from the sun
doesn't come through. Uh,

360
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:53,690
this change in position that's an
ankle is around one arc second.

361
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:58,080
And that, that's a positional
change. Who can observe,

362
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:02,820
remember the size of the
apparent size of a star.

363
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,010
When you look at it,
it's about one arc second.

364
00:25:05,011 --> 00:25:09,320
So it seems like it's shifted
a significant amount. Uh,

365
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,460
and so you go,
you take a,

366
00:25:11,461 --> 00:25:16,461
you take a picture of the sky of the stars
behind the sun during a total eclipse

367
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:20,370
of the sun. Now the problem with
this is a practical problem. Uh,

368
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,140
total eclipses of the sun happen only
for very short amounts of time. And,

369
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,880
uh,
only occasionally and only in a small,

370
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,490
over a small portion of
the earth at any one time.

371
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:37,470
How many people have seen an eclipse
of the sun? Pretty spectacular thing,

372
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,340
Huh? Uh, but you know, you
have to travel to get there.

373
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:45,840
It doesn't come to you. So
here's what happened. In 1917,

374
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,760
Einstein publishes,
uh,

375
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,830
his theory of general relativity.

376
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:59,130
And then in 1919,
there's going to be an eclipse in Brazil.

377
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:01,120
I think it was,
uh,

378
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:05,370
eclipse in Brazil. And, uh,

379
00:26:05,371 --> 00:26:08,760
it seems like a good idea that you
should actually go and test this theory,

380
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:12,750
which has made a very specific
prediction about what, uh,

381
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:17,190
what ought to be going on with these,
uh, with these stars. So Eddington,

382
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:19,980
we've heard of him before.
He's the guy who trashed his student,

383
00:26:19,981 --> 00:26:24,300
Chandra Sacar some years later. Uh, but
at the time he was young, up and coming,

384
00:26:24,301 --> 00:26:28,470
British scientist, uh,
mountain expedition, uh,

385
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,720
to Brazil to test this theory

386
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,160
to Brazil. And it works. Goes down there.

387
00:26:40,161 --> 00:26:42,950
He takes these pictures.
It does just what Einstein,

388
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:48,870
and this is the event that makes
Einstein into a great international,

389
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:53,520
uh, figure there. This is front
page headlines around the world.

390
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:57,150
And part of the reason why it
was, is look at these dates. Uh,

391
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,700
Einstein is a German scientist.

392
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,930
This is the middle of World War One A.
And so in the middle of World War One,

393
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:07,800
the German side to seize later thought
of as a Jewish scientist, but that, uh,

394
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,710
but at the time, uh, Hitler
was not yet on the scene.

395
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:12,780
And so Einstein was thought
of as a German scientist.

396
00:27:12,781 --> 00:27:15,720
So this German scientists
publishes a grand,

397
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,500
bizarre new theory of the
universe right after the war,

398
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:24,060
the Brits Mountain operation to go
and check and see if this is right.

399
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:25,440
And it turns out to be correct.

400
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,300
So this is now right after World War
one in the era when everybody thought,

401
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:32,970
well, we're never going to have a
war again. There's going to be peace,

402
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:37,380
a peace and justice and brotherhood
throughout the world for the rest of time.

403
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,840
And as part of this,
the British,

404
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:44,160
a mountain expedition to confirm
a German theory of science.

405
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:46,650
And this is regarded
as a huge sign of the,

406
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,790
a great new future that we're moving
into of international cooperation.

407
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,710
And a consequence of this,

408
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:57,660
this is front page news all over the
world and it makes Einstein famous.

409
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,560
This is what makes Einstein
famous. So, uh, uh,

410
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:06,770
the fable here is the
1919 eclipse expedition.

411
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,470
And the moral that was drawn at the time,
uh,

412
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,390
is the great international, uh,
is how science is this wonderful,

413
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,850
uh,
international,

414
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,530
maybe even universal,
a quest.

415
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,670
Uh, and in retrospect, what it is,

416
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:38,280
it's a great demonstration
of, uh, uh, you know,

417
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:41,880
how scientists opposed to work
new theory makes a prediction.

418
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,920
You go out and measure the effect
and it works. Uh, so this is, uh,

419
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,730
uh, uh, science works as advertised,

420
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,560
except, you know, maybe
it doesn't because, uh,

421
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,060
subsequently in, in, in
subsequent years, people

422
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,640
looked back at the apparatus
that Eddington and his
team had put together and

423
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:09,474
said,
you know,

424
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:14,220
you can't actually make measurements
that accurate with this stuff.

425
00:29:14,221 --> 00:29:18,090
So how were they able to make this
measurement? And oddly enough,

426
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,240
for about 50 years,
the photographic plates,

427
00:29:21,241 --> 00:29:25,080
what they'd done was taking photographs
at the sky had disappeared. Uh,

428
00:29:25,081 --> 00:29:28,650
and so nobody could go back and check
the original data at some point.

429
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:29,371
Subsequently,

430
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:33,960
that kind of reappeared in saw
just recently actually inside,

431
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,250
uh,

432
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,090
the personal effects of a
British astronomer who had
gone to live in Chile and

433
00:29:39,091 --> 00:29:42,820
nobody quite knows how he got ahold of
them. Uh, and I actually have to say,

434
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:45,850
I'm not sure what the outcome of this is,

435
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:50,410
whether people have actually gone back and
tried to measure this again. Uh, so, uh,

436
00:29:50,411 --> 00:29:51,760
and at the time,
you know,

437
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:56,790
Eddington who in in his subsequent life
demonstrated a real propensity for,

438
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,060
uh, believing his own theories,
if you know what I mean,

439
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:04,870
which in which served him poorly when
he was dealing with Chandra Saker,

440
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:09,100
who was thinking of other things
Eddington had said before he went on the

441
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:12,890
expedition that he was absolutely
certain this was going to work. Uh,

442
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:17,740
because he had studied Einstein's theory
and had come to believe it because it

443
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:21,070
was so beautiful and elegant.
And so, uh, there's a famous,

444
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:25,060
there's a famous story where somebody
said, well, Mr Addington, what will, uh,

445
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,190
or said to somebody
else on the expedition,

446
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:30,790
what will adding to do if it comes
out wrong? And he said, well, addict,

447
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,830
we'll just go in say,
uh,

448
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:37,831
and so there's a little bit of
suspicion to attach to this particular,

449
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,860
uh, experiment. However,
subsequent to that,

450
00:30:41,861 --> 00:30:46,780
this has been measured repeatedly,
many times during many eclipses. And,

451
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,590
uh, it's very clear that
this works. And as I said,

452
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:55,390
there's now evidence from
other astronomical objects
for the deflection of light.

453
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:00,370
All of which confirms, uh,
Einstein's theory. Yes.

454
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,390
What is the second line?
Say? Uh, let's see. Uh,

455
00:31:04,391 --> 00:31:08,200
eclipse expedition scientist and
international universal quest,

456
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:12,690
uh, science works as
advertised. Maybe. Uh,

457
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,430
that's what I was trying to write down.

458
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,350
So that's the second post Newtonian test.

459
00:31:20,351 --> 00:31:25,270
And the fact that it works in 1919
is what makes people really believe

460
00:31:25,271 --> 00:31:29,130
relativity. And what makes people
believe that Einstein's, this, this, uh,

461
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,260
intense genius.
Okay.

462
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:37,000
There are a couple of other posts,
Newtonian effect.

463
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:41,980
So here's now a post
Newtonian effect number three,

464
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,420
and this is something called
the gravitational red shift.

465
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,100
You've heard of a red shift,
redshift and blue shifts.

466
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,130
They come about because of the doppler
shift. Something moves towards you.

467
00:32:00,131 --> 00:32:03,250
It's like gets shifted to the blue.
Something moves away from you,

468
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:04,900
it's like get shifted to the red.

469
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,190
Turns out the wavelengths
of light also change,

470
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,413
um,

471
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,500
due to gravity or due to being
emitted in a curved space time.

472
00:32:16,841 --> 00:32:20,830
If you want to use the
relativistic formulation,
basically, here's how it works.

473
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,150
Uh, you have some object
with radius r, uh,

474
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,000
mass m and you have a light source
on the surface of that object. Uh,

475
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,530
and you look at it from a distance.

476
00:32:32,531 --> 00:32:37,120
You're out here at infinity watching
this light and, uh, the light,

477
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,900
if you emit green light, uh,
by the time it reaches you,

478
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:47,110
it'll have shifted into the
rep and there's an equation.

479
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:52,640
Let me write down the equation.
So this is Delta Lambda.

480
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,060
Oops,
that one's not working anymore.

481
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:01,370
Delta Lambda over lambda zero.
That's, that's the shift in light.

482
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,850
And remember that the doppler shift
has some equation here. We'll,

483
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:08,870
here's the equation, uh, for,

484
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,083
uh,

485
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,990
this shift due to the gravitation
of an object are s over our,

486
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,680
uh,

487
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:23,680
where this is the distance
to the given mass,

488
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,040
uh, or, uh, if you're emitting
light from the surface of an object,

489
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:34,600
the distance to the masses, the distance
to the center of the object. Uh,

490
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:39,740
so in this particular case, it would be
the radius of the object, uh, minus one.

491
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:45,680
So you can see that if there is no mass,
uh,

492
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,980
then the swatch showed radius is zero,
and this is one minus one,

493
00:33:48,981 --> 00:33:52,430
and there's no shift. Okay?
Now, why does this happen?

494
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,130
This has to happen.
Uh,

495
00:33:55,370 --> 00:34:00,370
imagine that you're standing
on the surface of an object
and you throw an object

496
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,910
up into the air. I have an object
here. Uh, I'm going to do this.

497
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,870
What will happen as I throw it
up into the air, it's going to,

498
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,320
it's going to slow down.

499
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:13,250
If I throw it faster than the escape
velocity and I don't have a ceiling and

500
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:16,220
stuff, then it'll go, it'll
keep going away forever,

501
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,650
but it will nevertheless slow down.
Uh,

502
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,280
if I throw it up slower
than the escape velocity,

503
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:27,200
then it's going to rise to some height,
stop turning around and fall back. Right?

504
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:30,920
So that's what, that's what happens
with an object. Why is this happening?

505
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,120
The reason it happens is
because, uh, as it moves,

506
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:37,130
as it tries to move away from the earth,

507
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:41,780
it has to lose energy because it's
pushing its way out of the gravitational

508
00:34:41,781 --> 00:34:42,920
field.
Uh,

509
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:48,730
and so it gradually slows down because
it's kinetic energy decreases as it goes

510
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:52,130
further away to balance the
change in the potential energy.

511
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:54,380
For those of you who
remember high school physics,

512
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,160
it balances the change in potential
energy though the total energy is zero.

513
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:01,780
And so the kinetic energy
has to slow down, uh,

514
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,840
and whether it slows down
enough to stop it or not,

515
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,560
depends on whether it's moving faster
than its escape velocity or not.

516
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:15,440
Supposing I do this with a flashlight
and instead of throwing a key chain up in

517
00:35:15,441 --> 00:35:15,771
the air,

518
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:19,340
I throw a photon up in the air and the
photon starts out at the speed of light.

519
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,110
Now,
uh,

520
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,620
that too has to lose energy
and it moves away from,

521
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,830
from the earth. But light, as we know,

522
00:35:30,831 --> 00:35:35,450
always travels at the speed of light. It
doesn't slow down. It can't slow down.

523
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,480
So what it has to do is it to
lose energy in some other way.

524
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,800
And the trick is that
the energy of a photon,

525
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:47,800
yeah,

526
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,620
is equal to a couple of constants.

527
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,830
H Times see over the wavelets.

528
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:56,710
So as the energy gets less,

529
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,800
the wavelength gets longer,
has to get bigger.

530
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,730
And so what is happening here is as you
shine light off of gravitating object,

531
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,550
as it gets further and further away
from the object, it loses energy,

532
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,960
but it loses energy,

533
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:17,070
not by slowing down as an
ordinary massive objects would,

534
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,900
but by changing its wavelength.

535
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,190
And now go back and look
at this equation again.

536
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:29,390
Supposing you're shining your
flashlight from, uh, the,

537
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,270
from the event horizon of a black hole,

538
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,060
from a something where the,

539
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:38,660
the distance to the object is
equal to the Schwab chilled radius.

540
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,670
Then you get down to the lambda equals
infinity and you've read shifted your way

541
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:46,310
out to an infinitely large wavelength.

542
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,880
The consequence of that is that the
energy of the light is equal to zero.

543
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:54,950
And so this is how, uh, how it happens.

544
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,640
That light can't escape from
a black hole because you know,

545
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:02,900
if you have the new Tony Envision of the
escape philosophy in mind, then goes up,

546
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:03,291
stops,

547
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:07,940
turns around and comes back
and you imagine shining a
flashlight from inside the

548
00:37:07,941 --> 00:37:11,630
event horizon of a black hole.
You imagine that the light would go up,

549
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:15,230
stop turnaround and fall back,
but like doesn't do that.

550
00:37:15,231 --> 00:37:18,620
Cause light always goes at the speed
of light. So what happens instead?

551
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,480
Is it red shift itself out
of existence altogether? Uh,

552
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:28,430
and so that's the way a light is
prevented from leaving a black hole.

553
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:32,660
Because if you shine from
either inside or, uh, uh,

554
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:37,010
at the event horizon, it'll red
shift itself to infinity. Yeah,

555
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,690
still makes perfect sense.

556
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,270
Uh, okay. So, and then there is a,

557
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:51,560
there is a Newtonian version of this.
You can imagine how you expand this, uh,

558
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:55,100
this thing. But this particular
equation is relativistic.

559
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:01,090
Uh, oh. The other thing is that
of course in Newtonian physics,

560
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,670
there's no reason for
enlightened not to slow down.

561
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:05,660
Okay.

562
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,090
This business, that light always
goes at the speed of light,

563
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,640
regardless of the observer is a
relativistic effect. So, you know,

564
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,750
if you take a photon and throw it
in the air in a Newtonian concept,

565
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:17,300
there's no reason it can't slow
down and turn around and come back.

566
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,780
Yes.
Yeah.

567
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,750
Delta Lambda over Lambda
Delta Lambda overlapped as

568
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,720
this.
Okay.

569
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,420
So this is speed of light.
Uh,

570
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,170
and this is another famous
constant called Planck's constant,

571
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,780
uh,
weren't,

572
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,040
I don't think we're going to use that
equation for anything in particular, but,

573
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,660
but it's,
it's a couple of constants.

574
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:56,050
So basically the energy is
proportional to one over lambda.

575
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,870
Yeah.
Other questions?

576
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,970
Okay. Uh, if you turn it around,

577
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,580
if you sit on the surface of,
I don't know,

578
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:14,580
a neutron star or something
and look at distant star light,

579
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,240
that light will pick up energy
as it comes towards you.

580
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:22,530
And so if you sit on up gravitating
object and look at a distance like distant

581
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:23,040
light,

582
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,580
that light will actually be blue shifted
because it will gain energy falling

583
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:29,640
down towards you. Uh, and so, uh,

584
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,320
while this is always referred to
as the gravitational redshift,

585
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,270
cause we're always imagining that we're
some distant observer in a flat space

586
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:39,270
looking at some gravitating
object in principle,

587
00:39:39,271 --> 00:39:42,240
if you could live on a neutron
star, a, all the stars,

588
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:46,200
all the stars would look bluer than
they do to us because of this effect.

589
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,630
So it works both ways. This, by the way,

590
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,790
has now been tested

591
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,860
in the laboratory.
Here's how you do it. Uh,

592
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,140
you set up,

593
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:06,170
you sit on top of a ladder and you look
at light coming from the surface and uh,

594
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,670
coming up towards you. And then
you have somebody, you have some,

595
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,700
some confederate or graduate
student or something, uh,

596
00:40:14,701 --> 00:40:18,880
who sits on the ground and looks
at light coming sideways, uh,

597
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,370
and you determined that the wavelength
detected here is slightly larger than the

598
00:40:23,371 --> 00:40:24,870
wavelength detected here.

599
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:31,920
That's a really small effect because the
Earth's gravitational field, you know,

600
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:36,240
if you do this little calculation and
you're trying to figure out our ass over

601
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:40,350
our for the surface of the earth,
uh, it's a really, really small,

602
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:42,810
small difference from one.
Nevertheless,

603
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,230
because you're in the laboratory and we
know how to measure the wavelengths of

604
00:40:46,231 --> 00:40:50,910
light with incredible accuracy, uh, this
can, this effect can actually be measured,

605
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,510
uh, in, in the lab and has been,

606
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:57,720
yes,
if you're on a black hole or whatever,

607
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,600
shining a light awkward and it,
instead of doing the arc thing just

608
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,170
stretches out and weeks out
of existence at the top,

609
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,090
then went back into the systems.

610
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:13,020
Well, it can't fall back, right? It can't,
it can't fall back because he can't stop,

611
00:41:13,021 --> 00:41:14,190
turn around and come back

612
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,440
out of existence up here.

613
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,480
Well, notice what happened. Uh,

614
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,470
supposing you go from,
uh,

615
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,120
from the event horizon only to
slightly above the event horizon. Uh,

616
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,820
the difference in,
uh,

617
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,690
in the wavelength you see is this
quantity at the event horizon minus this

618
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:39,500
quantity a little bit above the event
horizon because it's still going to be red

619
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:42,110
shifted.
But this is infinite if the event horizon,

620
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,910
so by the time it moves even a tiny bit
off the event horizon has already gone.

621
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,270
Okay.

622
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:52,650
Yeah. It's because this goes, this
term becomes infinitely large.

623
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:55,310
Uh, oh, but I should say, uh,

624
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:00,010
this brings up a good
point. Supposing, uh,

625
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:04,500
supposing you're here and it's not
a black hole, so it's not going to,

626
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:07,980
it's not going to be disastrous,
but you're observing it.

627
00:42:07,981 --> 00:42:12,720
Not An infinity but close. Uh,
so here's this is that, uh,

628
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:17,610
some are, and this is it r one
a little bit further away. Uh,

629
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:23,060
so what you would observe here is Delta
Lambda over over lambda is equal to a

630
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:33,560
Delta Lambda at our one minus delta.

631
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,480
Let me write this so that there's
some hope of reading it. Um,

632
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,830
so this gives you,
uh,

633
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,860
the Delta Lambda you observe at our one,
uh,

634
00:42:45,861 --> 00:42:50,861
over lambda is equal to Delta Lambda
at our one calculated by that for me,

635
00:42:51,581 --> 00:42:55,220
a minus Delta Lambda at our,

636
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:02,800
uh, because it red shifts a
little bit from here to here.

637
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,710
It would red shift more
from here out to infinity.

638
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,910
And so the way you calculate that as
you calculate red shift from here to

639
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:14,590
infinity minus redshift from
here to infinity, uh, aunt,

640
00:43:14,591 --> 00:43:18,760
since for something that is
at, uh, the event horizon,

641
00:43:18,761 --> 00:43:22,130
the red shift from there to infinity
to infinity is infinite. Uh,

642
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:26,350
even if you're observing it just a
little bit higher, uh, it's already gone.

643
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:33,810
Does that make sense?
How are we doing other questions?

644
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,753
Yes.

645
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:47,940
Oh, the photons. Remember there's
a relationship between the fo the,

646
00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:51,710
the whole way wave particle
duality works for photon.

647
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,280
There's a relationship between the energy
of the photon and the wavelength that

648
00:43:55,281 --> 00:43:57,590
was this equals HC over lambda thing.

649
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:00,650
So as the wavelength becomes infinite,

650
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:05,030
the energy in that photon goes to zero.
So it's still a photon.

651
00:44:05,031 --> 00:44:08,390
But if you've got a photon with zero
energy and you're not going to notice it,

652
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:13,540
um, yes, you know,

653
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,910
use the gravitational field.

654
00:44:15,911 --> 00:44:20,860
It was like the mercury or whatever
miss slingshot probes is an outer space.

655
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:21,610
Could light,

656
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:26,380
like pick up energy by
going around massive object.

657
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,080
Well, it pays like picks up energy as it
falls towards a massive object. That's,

658
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:34,320
that's the,
the inverse gravitational redshift.

659
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,000
Do you sit on the gravitating object?

660
00:44:36,001 --> 00:44:39,060
You watched light coming at you
from a distance. So it does that.

661
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,380
That slingshot effect only works if
you add energy to the thing that kick

662
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:46,560
yourself back out of orbit
at just the right moment.

663
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:51,930
You can't do that with light because
you can't give it extra. Uh, uh, uh,

664
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:56,460
you can't give it an extra velocity kick
at any moment to, to, to push it back up.

665
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,940
But it is true that if you sit
and you can do this, uh, you can,

666
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:05,910
you can do this experiment backwards,
right? You have your light source up here,

667
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:10,170
uh, and you observe it from down here
and then you'll see a blue shift. It

668
00:45:14,370 --> 00:45:19,100
other questions.
How are we doing?

669
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:23,250
Okay. Uh, let me mention one last, uh,

670
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:29,660
uh, post Newtonian effect.
This is post Newtonian a fact.

671
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:31,640
Uh,
number four,

672
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:37,270
and this is the existence
of gravitational waves.

673
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:45,200
Uh,
and the way this works is these over here,

674
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,410
remember the, the, the,

675
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:52,580
the bed sheet and the basketball over
here from a few days ago. All right?

676
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,530
Now imagine that that basketball,

677
00:45:54,531 --> 00:45:58,590
which is some massive object is
moving back and forth. Um, the,

678
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,320
it's orbiting some other thing on that
bed sheet. What will happen? Well,

679
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:04,850
the bed sheet, we'll, we'll,

680
00:46:04,851 --> 00:46:09,200
we'll ripple in different ways as
the thing moves around. And this, uh,

681
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,640
creates,
uh,

682
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:15,650
essentially a wave of distortions
of spacetime. The propagates,

683
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:20,820
uh, at, uh, propagates outward as it
turns out at the speed of light. So, uh,

684
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:24,980
the way this works is, uh, as a mass,

685
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,700
uh,
moves back and forth,

686
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,940
perhaps because it's an orbit
or for some other reason,

687
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,410
it generates ripples

688
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:40,410
in space time.

689
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,530
These propagate outward

690
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:53,030
at the speed of light. Uh, and we'll
talk later maybe about how one, uh,

691
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:56,480
what it means to have a ripple in
space time and how one might detect it.

692
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,570
But there's a more immediate effect,

693
00:46:59,571 --> 00:47:02,180
which is that the energy

694
00:47:03,910 --> 00:47:07,000
in these so called gravitational waves,

695
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:16,380
they carry energy with them and the
energy comes from is extracted from the

696
00:47:16,931 --> 00:47:21,931
orbit of the object that's
moving back and forth.

697
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:28,140
So the orbit gradually loses energy
and that means the orbit gets smaller

698
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,070
gradually.
So the orbit gets gradually smaller.

699
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,100
Uh,

700
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:45,100
and so in the Newtonian approximation
thinks stay in orbit and they're perfectly

701
00:47:45,411 --> 00:47:49,160
stable forever and ever, and they just
go orbiting around and around and around.

702
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,740
But in general, relativity, there's a,

703
00:47:51,741 --> 00:47:56,741
if there's a gradual slow loss of energy
and objects will gradually spiral in.

704
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,550
Now this happens really slowly.

705
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:07,570
It has not been detected in the
solar system. That is to say,

706
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:09,550
even the orbit of mercury.
Uh,

707
00:48:09,551 --> 00:48:13,570
we can't measure it's orbital period
accurately enough to see this slow down.

708
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:18,190
Certainly all the planets in the solar
system have been happily going in their

709
00:48:18,191 --> 00:48:20,830
orbits for four and a half billion years,
uh,

710
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:25,420
with no sign of this
effect. But you can, uh,

711
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:30,490
see us see this in certain
kinds of binary stars,

712
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:35,140
stars with which happened
to have very short orbits.

713
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:42,280
And in particular, uh, there's
something called the, uh,

714
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:45,740
binary, Paul Sahre, Paul, sorry,

715
00:48:45,741 --> 00:48:49,540
is a kind of neutron star, uh, and, uh,

716
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:53,650
these gravitational wave effects,
the gradual decrease in the orbit,

717
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:58,810
uh, has been observed in binary
pulsars. And we'll talk about that,

718
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:00,490
I guess a next time.
