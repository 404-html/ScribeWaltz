1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,730
Welcome to part three of the course.
Uh, this is going to be about cosmology.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:10,740
One of the most amazing thing that's
happened over the past half century or so

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,830
is that cosmology, which is, uh,

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,700
the study of the universe as a whole,
uh,

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,860
has become a scientific subject.
Uh,

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,450
and something that one can say something
about in scientific terms rather than

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,110
merely philosophical
terms. Uh, in recent years,

8
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,970
in the past 10 years or so,
uh,

9
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,630
there's been a kind of a
revolution in cosmology, uh,

10
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,700
which has come about because of the
discovery that the vast majority of the

11
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:41,880
universe is made out of stuff,
uh,

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,270
that we have no idea what it is. So, uh,

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,460
the discovery is we have no idea
what the universe is made of. Uh,

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,600
and that actually, you know,
it doesn't sound so good. Uh,

15
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:57,630
it sounds like this is a big
failure of science somehow,

16
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,060
but scientists are clever. So we
describe it differently. What we,

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,090
what we claim is that what has happened
is that we have discovered dark energy,

18
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,300
dark energy. What is that? We
don't have a clue. Uh, but, uh,

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,080
it's most of the universe and we've
discovered that it exists. Uh,

20
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:18,090
and so that's kind of
where we are right now.

21
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:20,310
And what I want to do over the next,
uh,

22
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,460
four or five weeks is talk about
the discovery of dark energy, uh,

23
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,170
how that was done.
And now that we know that it's there,

24
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,730
but we don't know what it is, uh,
what people intend to do about it. Uh,

25
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,670
and, uh, this is,

26
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:40,671
I should say only a relatively
small fraction of modern cosmology.

27
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,040
Uh, if you, uh, want to know about, uh,

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:48,060
many of the other interesting things
that are going on in cosmology,

29
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:52,050
you have to take a whole course
or several courses on this topic.

30
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,880
Such courses exist.
Uh,

31
00:01:53,881 --> 00:01:58,881
I recommend Astro one 70 or two 20 if
you find yourself interested in this kind

32
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:03,930
of thing. But nevertheless,
this one particular discovery,

33
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:07,470
and in fact what I'm going to be
focusing on is not just dark energy,

34
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,090
but one particular way, uh,
that dark energy, the first way.

35
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,520
There are now other
indications that it exists.

36
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,510
One particular way in which
dark energy has been discovered.

37
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:21,980
And so it's a fairly narrow focus,
uh, that I'll be taken care of.

38
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:24,780
But that will be,
that will enable us to get a,

39
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,410
into some depth about how
this discovery was made.

40
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,030
So let me let you in on the
secret before we even begin.

41
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,900
Dark energy is something that you
can't see that's sort of it's name. Uh,

42
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,410
we've done this twice already, right? Uh,

43
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,270
we've discovered planets
around other stars, uh,

44
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,730
that you couldn't see the planets. How
do you do that? You look at the star,

45
00:02:47,731 --> 00:02:51,370
the motion of the star. We've discovered
the existence of black holes, uh,

46
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,210
which of course you can't see.
How do you do that?

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,130
You look at the motion of some star
that is influenced by the existence,

48
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,350
the black hole. So what are we
going to do about dark energy? Well,

49
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:05,080
this isn't a hard to extrapolate a,

50
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,830
what we're going to do is we're going
to look at the motion of things that we

51
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:13,240
can see and infer the presence
of dark energy. And of course,

52
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,240
how do we look at the motion?
We look at doppler shifts. Uh,

53
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:19,770
that will be another
recurring theme. Uh, and, uh,

54
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:24,810
so the plan of action here is actually
not so different from something we've

55
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:26,980
done a couple of times before,

56
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:31,720
although the contacts and the
implications and the particular details.

57
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,260
Uh, needless to say, our, uh, okay.

58
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,730
So let's go back in time,
uh,

59
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,240
almost 90 years back to 1920,

60
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,760
1920.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So it's opposing one word to give a
course in frontiers and controversies in

62
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:54,700
astrophysics in the year 1920.
Uh,

63
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,870
what would one have been talking
about frontiers and controversies?

64
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,170
The big issue, uh, at least in
terms of, uh, uh, cosmology,

65
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,910
uh, was the question of the
so called spiral nebulae.

66
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,880
These had been discovered
over the previous few decades
after the invention of

67
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:21,170
photography, uh, allowed pictures
of the sky to be created.

68
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,170
And as people took pictures of the sky,

69
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:28,640
what they discovered was all scattered
all over the sky or these little spiral

70
00:04:28,641 --> 00:04:32,960
clouds, the so called spiral
nebulae. What are these things?

71
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:36,410
They wandered and in particular,
where are these things?

72
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,170
And there were two basic hypotheses.

73
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:44,090
One was that these are sort of clouds,

74
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,730
uh,
shining clouds of gas.

75
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:51,360
These were known to exist in other kinds
of shapes, shapes. So these are, uh,

76
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:55,220
clouds a of some kind of glowing gas,

77
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,773
uh,

78
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,790
and that they are part of our,

79
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:08,260
so called galaxy galaxy comes
from the Greek word for milk.

80
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,760
It's basically Greek for Milky Way,

81
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:16,220
the Milky Way as this band of,
uh, stars across the sky. Uh,

82
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,330
it looks like just a white street. You
can't see it in the city with city lights.

83
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,860
Uh, you know, if you've never
seen this, go somewhere dark,

84
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,360
wait till the moon goes down, get your
eyes adapted and look for the Milky Way.

85
00:05:29,361 --> 00:05:32,570
It's really very spectacular. Uh,
if you really want to do this right,

86
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:34,620
do it in the southern hemisphere.
Um,

87
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,040
because the center of our galaxy is down
there. It's quite spectacular. Uh, anyway,

88
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,970
uh, it had been known since Galileo's
time, but what the Milky Way really was,

89
00:05:43,971 --> 00:05:48,560
was a band of stars. And so that there's
this huge bunch of stars out there,

90
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,120
uh, so faint, so packed
together. We see it just as he
continuous band of light. Uh,

91
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:56,930
and so all these stars, that's our
galaxy. Uh, and the question was,

92
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,610
these spiral nebulae might be little
clouds of something or other scattered

93
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,970
around our galaxy. The alternative, uh,

94
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,430
less popular at the time,

95
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:12,431
but perhaps more spectacular is that
these spiral nebulae are galaxies

96
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:17,180
themselves. Our whole galaxies of
stars, different from our own galaxy.

97
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:20,330
These were sometimes referred
to as island universes.

98
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,740
So the Milky Way is our own galaxy.

99
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:30,690
And each one of these tiny little spiral
things is a galaxy itself located much,

100
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:34,680
much further away obviously than any of
the stars that we can see. And you can,

101
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:39,660
you can see that this is a question of
some important in particular to how beat

102
00:06:39,661 --> 00:06:43,500
you think the universe is.
If all of these, uh, uh,

103
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,730
spiral nebulae are part of our own galaxy
than maybe what the universe is, is, uh,

104
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,830
is one galaxy.
Uh,

105
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,850
and at that time it was already starting
to be known how big the galaxy was and

106
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:58,710
so forth. Uh, but if each
one of them's its own galaxy,

107
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,910
then, uh, obviously the
entire universe much be much,

108
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,820
much bigger because it contains thousands,

109
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:09,270
perhaps millions of individual galaxies.

110
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,210
Each of them more or less like our own.

111
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,490
So we know what the answer's going to
turn out to be. Uh, this is correct.

112
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,190
But they didn't know
that in 1920 and in fact,

113
00:07:26,191 --> 00:07:30,210
they staged what was called
the great debate, uh,

114
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,070
in 1920 between a very famous
astronomer named Harlow Shapley,

115
00:07:35,071 --> 00:07:38,470
who was at Harvard, and he, uh,

116
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,520
maintained that the a spiral nebulae
must be part of our own galaxy.

117
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,720
Uh, and so he had many
good reasons to think this.

118
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,030
There was a lot of evidence that,
uh,

119
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,870
these spiral nebulae couldn't
be that far away. Uh,

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,490
they must be really quite nearby.

121
00:07:56,491 --> 00:08:00,570
And so Shapley had in the
true Harvard manner, uh,

122
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:05,230
all of the right arguments
and was completely wrong. Uh,

123
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,750
and, uh, his opponent, a man
named Curtis educated at Yale,

124
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:13,440
but at that point were working somewhere
else, turned out to be entirely right.

125
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,503
Uh, but, uh,

126
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,700
but totally lost the debate because
he just didn't have that much evidence

127
00:08:17,701 --> 00:08:22,410
backing him up. Uh, so the intuition
of the Yale man comes through. Uh,

128
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:26,940
so this is a famous incident
in the history of science.

129
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,440
Uh, it garnered enormous
attention at the time. Remember,

130
00:08:31,441 --> 00:08:36,441
this is a year after the
eclipse expedition has
verified Einstein's theory of

131
00:08:37,261 --> 00:08:38,160
general relativity.

132
00:08:38,161 --> 00:08:41,620
So people are pretty excited about
modern science at the time. Uh,

133
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,010
and this was reported
widely in the press. So, uh,

134
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,020
this is another one of our sort
of science fables here. Uh,

135
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,370
the great debate

136
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:57,240
and one version of the moral.
This story might be a,

137
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,180
you can have all the right
arguments and still be wrong.

138
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,890
Have many a good argument.

139
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,510
Okay.

140
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,970
Uh,
and still be wrong.

141
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,030
Uh, as Mr Shapley, uh,

142
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,960
turned out to be interestingly at the
time in 1920, they thought, you know,

143
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:21,690
it's going to take us a long time to, you
know, really get to the truth of this.

144
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:23,190
And that turned out not to be the case.

145
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:26,820
Within just a few years after
the debate had taken place.

146
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,030
This problem was totally solved.
And the man who solved it, uh,

147
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:35,970
was, uh, perhaps the greatest, uh,

148
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,810
observational astronomer
of the 20th century, uh,

149
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,350
a man named Edwin Hubble after whom
a telescope was subsequently named.

150
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,450
Uh,
and what is,

151
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,310
what helped solve this was
simply better equipment. Uh,

152
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,620
and in fact, starting kind of a trend
that has continued for a century.

153
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:03,420
Now what happened was, so a Hubble was
out in California where there are nice,

154
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:04,990
clear skies and,
uh,

155
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,160
persuaded a and a rich man to give
a lot of money to build a really big

156
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,670
telescope. Uh, this was a hundred inch
telescope. That's the diameter of the, uh,

157
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,470
uh, uh, uh, the diameter
of the, uh, mirror.

158
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,560
This is actually still in use.
Uh,

159
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,830
although the site is no good cause
it's way too near to the lights of San

160
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:29,730
Francisco. But, um, uh, he
took this brand new telescope,

161
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:34,110
he looked at the spiral nebulae and he
did the same thing to the spiral nebulae

162
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:37,260
that Galileo had done to
the, uh, to the Milky Way.

163
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:42,261
He resolved it into individual stars
and he could see the individual stars in

164
00:10:42,901 --> 00:10:47,590
these spiral nebulae and discovered in
the nearest stuff, thumb, uh, that, um,

165
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,130
uh,
that they were made up of stars.

166
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:53,490
And then you notice that the stars that
were making them up were incredibly

167
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:57,750
faint. And that even the brightest stars
in these things were incredibly faint.

168
00:10:57,751 --> 00:11:02,160
And so he inferred the distance to
these things by assuming that, you know,

169
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,550
they're kind of ordinary stars, like any
other kinds of stars except they're way,

170
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:08,490
way fainter, and therefore
they must be much further away.

171
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:13,790
And this was compelling evidence that
these spiral nebulae really were island

172
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,260
galaxy island universes,
galaxies like our own. And, uh,

173
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,670
the key thing to do that is to have a
telescope powerful enough to resolve, uh,

174
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,980
some of the nearby examples
into individual stars.

175
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:31,200
So there are many galaxies.

176
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,670
And this was known

177
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,380
shortly after the great debate took place,

178
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,730
and that made the universe very much
larger than people had previous leaks

179
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,960
suspected because there are
all these galaxies around.

180
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,770
So Hubble was the great
expert at observing galaxies.

181
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,230
And so the next thing he decided,
he would look at you guys, okay,

182
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:56,960
now we know these things are galaxies.
Uh, let's check out there. You know,

183
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,630
he took doppler shift measurements.

184
00:11:58,631 --> 00:12:02,100
He's trying to figure out
the motions of galaxies. Um,

185
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:12,730
and so he discovered a very strange thing,
namely,

186
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,950
that they are all going away from us.

187
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:19,900
Every galaxy he measured was
red shifted. Uh, and so by,

188
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,870
by the usual doppler shift
interpretation of these things,

189
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,910
they must all be moving away from us.

190
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,740
And Hubble went further and he created
one of the most famous diagrams in all of

191
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,920
astronomy, uh, in which
he plots red shift,

192
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,380
uh,
which is to say Z,

193
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,800
which is to say a radial velocity
divided by the speed of light,

194
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,910
at least in the Newtonian approximation,

195
00:12:53,911 --> 00:12:56,550
which he was working in a versus distance.

196
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,380
So he figured out how far away
these galaxies are. We're,

197
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,530
he measured their red shift.
Uh,

198
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,260
and what he discovered is that these
things were very tightly correlated.

199
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:12,820
So if you plot each galaxy, measure
distance in a retro for each galaxy,

200
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:16,720
for a large number of galaxies, what
you find is that they line up like this.

201
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,320
This is the so called huddle diagram.

202
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:33,210
And it's basically the thing we're going
to be talking about for the next five

203
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:39,151
weeks or so is huddled diagrams
and what you can infer from them.

204
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,890
Uh, and, uh,

205
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,510
the huddle diagram can be sort
of summed up a in an equation.

206
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,210
If this is a straight line,

207
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:54,390
then it must be true that the velocity
of a given galaxy is equal to a constant,

208
00:13:55,721 --> 00:13:59,830
which was given the letter h for the
Hubble constant times the distance.

209
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,760
This is Hubble's constant

210
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,770
and uh,
and,

211
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,300
and that just basically says in
Algebra what this says pictorially,

212
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,360
uh, that there, uh, that these things
line up in a straight line. Uh,

213
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,370
the Hubble constant is an
extremely important number. Uh,

214
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:27,660
you measure it by creating these huddle
diagrams and just measuring the slope of

215
00:14:27,661 --> 00:14:29,780
the line. Uh, and the, uh,

216
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:33,870
primary scientific purpose of
the Hubble Space Telescope,

217
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:39,050
the largest and most expensive science
project ever created was to get an

218
00:14:39,151 --> 00:14:40,860
accurate measurement
of the Hubble constant.

219
00:14:40,861 --> 00:14:43,950
So all these beautiful pictures
you see are byproduct. Uh,

220
00:14:43,951 --> 00:14:47,100
the purpose of the thing was to
measure the Hubble constant accurately.

221
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:51,200
There had been for many years a dispute
over what the correct value was.

222
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:55,490
This was resolved by the space telescope
and other things within the past decade.

223
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,810
Uh, and this was a big success. We
now know what the Hubble constant is.

224
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,530
It's measured in somewhat
weird unit. Uh, it's, uh,

225
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,240
70 or so kilometers per second,
per mega parsec.

226
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,140
All right, now let's pause
there for just a moment. Uh,

227
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:17,490
you could see why they use this
peculiar unit, uh, because you want it,

228
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,120
they're measuring velocity
in kilometers per second,

229
00:15:20,121 --> 00:15:23,850
and they're measuring distance in
mega parsecs. Mega of course, uh,

230
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,150
doesn't just mean big.
It's a technical term.

231
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:29,300
It means a million means
10 to the six parsecs

232
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,380
a parsec, you will remember it's
about three light years, uh,

233
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:41,420
or three times 10 to the 16 meters or
three times 10 to the 13 kilometers.

234
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:45,750
Uh,

235
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,400
and so for each mega parsec
that it given galaxy as a way.

236
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:52,890
And notice now we've changed
our units from parsecs,

237
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:55,380
which we use for stars two mega parsecs.

238
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,210
That's basically the change in the scale
of the universe that came about when

239
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:03,840
people realize that the spiral
nebulae were galaxies. Uh,

240
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:06,210
so now you have to talk
about mega parsecs. In fact,

241
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:09,600
now we also talk from time to time,
I've got about Giga parsecs,

242
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:11,870
which are billions of parsecs.
Um,

243
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:16,740
for each mega parsec that
a galaxy is away from us,

244
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:21,000
it moves 70 kilometers per
second more away from us.

245
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:23,810
So something that's 10 kiloparsecs away,
uh,

246
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,520
ought to be moving 700
kilometers per second.

247
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,870
Something that's a hundred mega parsecs
away would be moving 7,000 kilometers a

248
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:32,610
second, uh, away from us.

249
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,940
And that's just an expression of what
this relationship is. Humble by the way.

250
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:39,750
Got this quite wrong. Uh, he, he, he,

251
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:43,140
he correctly a line to the mall up.
Uh,

252
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,920
but his value for the Hubble constant
turned out to be about 500 in these units,

253
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:51,390
which was quite wrong. Uh, and we'll
talk about that a why that was, uh,

254
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,630
later on. But now, but by now
with the Hubble Space Telescope,

255
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:59,040
we totally know this. Uh, and
that's a, an important result. Now,

256
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:00,540
this is,

257
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,280
this diagram and this relationship are
basically the key to what we're going to

258
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:07,740
be talking about. And so, uh, in fact,

259
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:10,500
this relates to the fact that there's,

260
00:17:10,501 --> 00:17:12,810
this linear relationship
tells you several things.

261
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,180
It tells you that the
universe is expanding.

262
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,713
Sure.

263
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,930
Uh,
and,

264
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,610
and because of that, it
tells you that the, uh,

265
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:30,470
indirectly there's other evidence that
has to be brought to bear as well that

266
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:34,460
the big bang exist. So this is
the basis of Big Bang cosmology.

267
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,130
I don't want to talk about that right now.

268
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,500
We'll talk about the big bang on Tuesday.

269
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:41,650
We'll have a whole big
question and answer sessions.

270
00:17:41,651 --> 00:17:45,110
So bring all your questions
about the big bang and cosmology.

271
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:47,540
We'll do that all up on Tuesday.
Uh,

272
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:51,480
what I want to talk about
now is much more mundane. Uh,

273
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,740
namely how do you measure these points?
How do you do this?

274
00:17:55,741 --> 00:18:00,660
How do you create this diagram? This
diagram has these fabulous implications.

275
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:05,230
Uh, but in order to understand what's
going on, you'd better know, uh,

276
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,100
how you get the diagram
in the first place. Now,

277
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,990
part of it's clear, the x axis, uh,

278
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,840
we understand fairly well measuring,

279
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,010
okay

280
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,480
radio velocity,

281
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,163
okay.

282
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,850
Uh, that's easy. That's
just the doppler shift.

283
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:33,800
So that comes directly out of a particular
kind of measurement that you can

284
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,130
readily readily do.
Uh,

285
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,730
the y axis is the biggest problem
in all of astronomy. Namely,

286
00:18:40,731 --> 00:18:44,180
how do you measure the distance to
something? And if you think about it,

287
00:18:44,181 --> 00:18:47,600
that's what this great
debate was all about. Uh,

288
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,820
some people thought that the distances
to these spiral nebulae where a few

289
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:56,270
hundred or maybe a few thousand parsecs
other people's thought they were

290
00:18:56,271 --> 00:19:00,590
millions of parsecs away and it
wasn't clear, which was right.

291
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:02,330
And if you think about
looking up into the sky,

292
00:19:02,331 --> 00:19:06,320
looking at stars in the
sky at night, uh, it's, uh,

293
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,580
you can see where there's a problem. You
look up there, you see a bunch of stars,

294
00:19:10,581 --> 00:19:13,880
and suddenly one of them shoots across
the [inaudible] guide to shooting star.

295
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,850
Uh, they don't, except for
the motion across the sky.

296
00:19:16,851 --> 00:19:21,440
They don't look that difference. And yet
some of the, the, the fixed stars are,

297
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:25,070
uh, hundreds of light
years away. The planets,

298
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,960
which looked much the same to the
naked eye are, uh, you know, uh, uh,

299
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,640
a million times closer and that shooting
stars in the top of the atmosphere, uh,

300
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,800
and it's very hard to tell,
uh,

301
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:39,680
what the distances when you're
just kind of look up there.

302
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:42,950
And so distance is hard.

303
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:55,180
And that's, uh, basically, uh,

304
00:19:55,181 --> 00:19:58,390
the problem I want to talk about
for the rest of today's class.

305
00:19:58,391 --> 00:20:00,010
How do you measure distances?
Yes.

306
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,220
You said,
how do we know what the original,

307
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,200
oh, so how do you know what
the original wavelength was?

308
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,350
You make the assumption that,
uh,

309
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:16,490
atomic physics and chemistry are the
same in the distant galaxies as they are

310
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:17,120
here,

311
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,830
and therefore hydrogen should emit lines
at the same frequency as they do in the

312
00:20:21,831 --> 00:20:23,220
atmosphere. Now, uh,

313
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,230
one of the things you can do if you
don't like what the cosmological

314
00:20:27,231 --> 00:20:31,100
implications of things is you can say,
well, rather than interpreting this as,

315
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,310
as cosmology, let's just say that
in distant portions of the universe,

316
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:38,190
physics is different. If
you go down that road, uh,

317
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,610
you can get any answer you want.
Uh,

318
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,960
and this has been seriously
discussed from time to time. Um,

319
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:52,030
right?
So how do you measure distance?

320
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,893
That's the key.

321
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:01,791
Well,

322
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:06,791
there's one and only one kind of direct
where you could imagine doing this.

323
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:12,110
Here's The sun,
here's the earth going around the sun.

324
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:17,400
Uh, earth. Uh, here is, uh,

325
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,280
a nearby star

326
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,440
and here are a bunch of other
much further away stars.

327
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:29,920
They were all scattered around the
sky and you observe this nearby star,

328
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:35,300
uh, during the course of the year. As the
year goes on, you observe it repeatedly.

329
00:21:35,301 --> 00:21:40,190
You observe it from here, for example.
Uh, and when you observe it from here,

330
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,490
it's in this direction.
Whoops, it's in this direction.

331
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,700
And therefore it appears to be in that
position relative to the other stars.

332
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:54,200
Whereas when you observe
it here, uh, it's,

333
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:57,590
uh, in a little bit of a different
position with respect to the other stars.

334
00:21:57,591 --> 00:21:58,610
It looks like it's here.

335
00:21:58,611 --> 00:22:02,360
And so if you observe this star
repeatedly over the course of the year,

336
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:05,990
it appears to move back and forth against
the background of the other stars.

337
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:06,893
Yeah,

338
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:12,430
this is a triangle. A, we know
what to do about triangles.

339
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,150
You can measure this angle,
uh,

340
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,180
because that's just the angular separation
of the two apparent positions of this

341
00:22:22,181 --> 00:22:25,480
star in the sky.
We know this distance.

342
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:29,680
That's one astronomical unit because
this is the earth going around the sun.

343
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,930
Uh, and then what we want to know
is the distance to this star d,

344
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,980
uh, let's call that d one. And we
know the equation for this already.

345
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:43,310
We've done this before. This is
Alpha equals [inaudible] over d one,

346
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,060
uh,
where uh,

347
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:50,800
d two in this case is exactly
one astronomical unit.

348
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:56,100
And you may recall that if you measure
this in arc seconds and you measure this

349
00:22:57,371 --> 00:23:02,320
in parsecs and you measure this in a,
you a,

350
00:23:02,321 --> 00:23:07,030
you get a consistent set
of answers. Uh, and so, uh,

351
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:08,561
uh,

352
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:13,561
one the way it works out is
one over Alpha in arc seconds

353
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,540
equals the distance in parsecs.

354
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:24,040
And the reason that works is because d
two by this method is always equal to one

355
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:27,150
astronomical unit. If you
try this on Jupiter, uh,

356
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,580
you have to account for the fact
that Jupiter's further away, uh,

357
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,740
this is called the parallax method.

358
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,950
It's common in surveying.
You know,

359
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:40,080
you look at the same thing
from two different places.

360
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:43,800
You can figure out distances by,
uh, basically trigonometry here.

361
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:47,750
This is it called the parallax
method. Uh, and a parsec.

362
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:52,930
This is the definition of
a parsec is one parallax.

363
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,700
Second, it's a contraction
because you measure an arc second,

364
00:23:58,701 --> 00:24:02,690
and the distance, uh, is one part second.
That is the definition of a parsec.

365
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,830
That's why we use parsec is a distance
measurement because it comes naturally

366
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,800
out of this parallax method.
Uh,

367
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:12,770
and so that's a fairly direct
geometric method. And you know,

368
00:24:12,771 --> 00:24:14,270
this is a surveying technique.

369
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:17,240
This is how this is a straight
forward way of getting the distance.

370
00:24:17,241 --> 00:24:20,840
And the problem with this is that it only
works on things that are really nearby

371
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,220
because we can measure, you know, uh,

372
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,870
maybe a hundredth of an arc
second change in position, uh,

373
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,430
but no better than that.

374
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:33,230
And so you can only get measurements
of distances in this way out to a few

375
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,063
hundred parsecs

376
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,980
works to kind of maximum given
our current instrumentation,

377
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,120
uh,
of a few hundred parsecs.

378
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,853
Yeah,

379
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,630
but the center of our Galaxy
is 8,000 parsecs away.

380
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,520
These other galaxies are mega parsecs
away. We can't be measuring one,

381
00:24:56,521 --> 00:25:00,720
1000000th of an arc second, at least
not at the moment in terms of parallax.

382
00:25:00,721 --> 00:25:05,650
So this only works for the very
nearest stars. And that's why, uh,

383
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,730
there was all this confusion about
the spiral nebulae because you know,

384
00:25:08,731 --> 00:25:11,940
if they were 500 parsecs away,
you'd never be able to tell.

385
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,680
So most other distance measurement methods
of distance are some form of what's

386
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,460
called the standard candle method.

387
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,740
So here's how the standard candle method
works. Uh, it's a three step process,

388
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:41,790
uh, part one, uh, you look
at something, you know,

389
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,440
how bright something is,

390
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:49,360
the bright something is,

391
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:54,040
this is basically a version of what
Hubble did when he figured out that the

392
00:25:54,041 --> 00:25:55,630
spiral nebulae must be very,

393
00:25:55,631 --> 00:25:58,780
very distant and must therefore
be island university's,

394
00:25:58,781 --> 00:26:01,930
you know how bright something
is. In the case of Hubble, uh,

395
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,420
he's looking at the brightest
stars in the galaxy.

396
00:26:04,421 --> 00:26:07,540
She figures they're about as bright as
the brightest stars in our own galaxy.

397
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:12,340
So he knows how bright they
are. A part two, you measure,

398
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,730
uh, how bright, uh,

399
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,770
the object locks

400
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,040
take a picture of it or you count photons
or whatever it is that you do and you

401
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:28,770
figure out how bright it looks.
Uh,

402
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:33,420
and obviously it first something of a
given brightness. The further away it is,

403
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:36,090
the fainter it looks.
And we know exactly how that works.

404
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,020
It's a distance squared thing. If
it's twice as far away, it's a fourth.

405
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:43,110
It's a fourth as bright.
If it's three times far further,

406
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,030
it's one ninth that's bright. It goes
as one over the distance square. Uh,

407
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,530
this is a well known fact. Uh, you can,

408
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:53,400
you can try this out with light
bulbs at home. Uh, and uh,

409
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:57,660
so if you know how bright it is and
you measure how bright it, uh, uh,

410
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:00,600
it appears to be,
then you can compute the distance.

411
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:12,680
Okay. Uh, and this is why it's
called a standard candle. Oh yeah.

412
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:16,790
So, uh, the way this is, how do you
know this? That's the big question.

413
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:19,700
How do you know how bright the
thing is in the first place? Uh,

414
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:24,020
and the answer is usually that is it
that you're looking at something which is

415
00:27:24,021 --> 00:27:29,021
an example of a class of objects
like stars or bright stars.

416
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:36,050
Uh, who's a brightness is no,

417
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,440
that's why you use the
term standard candle.

418
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:48,120
Cause here's a bunch of things.
They're all the same brightness.

419
00:27:48,121 --> 00:27:50,340
They all have the same
standard candle power.

420
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:54,000
Some of them look fainter than others.
The ones that look fainter,

421
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:55,530
obviously you have to be further away.

422
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,470
And if you know the true brightness
of this class of objects,

423
00:27:58,471 --> 00:28:02,120
you can figure out how far
away any example of it is, uh,

424
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,920
have to standard candles.
Uh,

425
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:11,770
and the problem with this is this phrase
here as you can pretty clearly see if

426
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:19,820
you get it wrong,

427
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:24,590
if you make the wrong assumption
about how bright these objects are,

428
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:28,190
you're going to screw this up completely.
And that's what Hubble did.

429
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,770
A Hubble was looking at a, a
particular kind of bright star, uh,

430
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:37,670
and which he thought he knew how
bright it was and he was wrong. Uh,

431
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,630
and uh,

432
00:28:38,631 --> 00:28:43,130
so he got the wrong Hubble constant now
because he used the same kind of start

433
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,390
in all his galaxies.

434
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,200
He got it the same amount wrong
for all these different galaxies.

435
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:52,880
So they still lined up, they just
lined up along the wrong track. Um,

436
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:56,840
so it was still true that something
that he thought was twice as far away as

437
00:28:56,841 --> 00:28:59,930
something else was in fact twice
as far away as something else.

438
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,750
He just got both of those
numbers wrong by the same factor.

439
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,900
Okay. Uh, this brings us to the, uh,

440
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,760
awkward question of how
do you measure brightness.

441
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:22,110
And now we have to talk about one of the,
uh,

442
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:27,790
great impediments to learning astronomy.
Uh, namely the magnitude scale,

443
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,340
astronomers count brightness

444
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,640
upside down and logarithmically

445
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,040
and I am now obliged by my membership
in the astronomical community to inflict

446
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:46,390
this upon you. Uh, saw the magnitude
scale. This is how we measure brightness.

447
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,370
It's upside down in
logarithmic and to the key,

448
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:54,700
a numerical relationship, uh, that, uh,

449
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,320
works.
It looks like this.

450
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,360
If you subtract the magnitude
of one object from another,

451
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,350
uh,

452
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:07,350
that equals minus five halves times the
log of the ratio of the brightnesses.

453
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,630
Don't panic. Uh, alright.

454
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,200
The magic word here is help sheet,
uh,

455
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:22,090
which will be posted later this
afternoon. Uh, so this is a key equation.

456
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:26,500
So let me, let me just define the
terms. Uh, this is the magnitude

457
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,970
of an object of, of two
different objects. Uh,

458
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,510
and this is the brightness.

459
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:35,880
Okay.

460
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,660
Of the two objects whereby brightness,
I mean, something sensible,

461
00:30:39,661 --> 00:30:43,870
like how many photons per second, uh,
do you get from them or, or, or, or,

462
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:48,270
or some other kind of a true
measure of how bright they are.

463
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,490
Uh, now, uh,

464
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:54,720
this is a somewhat awkward equation
because it's a relative equation.

465
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:58,050
It doesn't tell you what the magnitude
of either one of these things is.

466
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,820
What it tells you is,
uh,

467
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,630
the magnitude of one compared to another.

468
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,060
So in order to figure out
the magnitude of something,

469
00:31:06,061 --> 00:31:08,860
you have to know the magnitude
of something else. Uh,

470
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:13,260
and so you need one other piece of
information to have this be useful,

471
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,060
which is that they have defined a
particular star to have magnitude zero.

472
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,100
Uh,
the star Vega

473
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,780
is defined,
uh,

474
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,690
to have magnitude

475
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,160
zero. Uh, and so if
you start with thinker,

476
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:37,900
you could figure out the magnitude
of any other, uh, given object.

477
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,873
Uh,

478
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:46,030
and, uh, uh, I actually,

479
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:49,580
this is now causing trouble because it
turns out that in the far infrared Vega

480
00:31:49,581 --> 00:31:51,190
is variable.
Uh,

481
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:56,020
and that's kind of unfortunate for the
basis of the whole magnitude system to

482
00:31:56,021 --> 00:32:00,610
turn out, to be variable. Uh, but
they've coped with that in various ways.

483
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:05,590
All right, let me pause and remind you
of some things about Logarithms, uh,

484
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,920
which you may have forgotten.
What's the definition here?

485
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:12,850
The logarithm of 10 to
the x is equal to x.

486
00:32:12,851 --> 00:32:17,260
That's the definition of
a logarithm. Uh, so, uh,

487
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,250
for example,
uh,

488
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:24,570
the logarithm of three times 10 to the
two a is equal to the logarithm of 10 to

489
00:32:28,301 --> 00:32:29,290
the one half.

490
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:34,291
That's three times 10 to the two is
equal to the logarithm of 10 to the 2.5.

491
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,620
Because when you multiply to the x by 10
to the why you get 10 to the x plus y,

492
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:47,280
uh, which is equal to two and
a half. That's an example.

493
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,930
More examples on the help
sheet, uh, just in general,

494
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:57,260
the logarithm of tent city x times
10 to the y is equal to x plus y.

495
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,090
Because when you add those
together, that's how it works. Uh,

496
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,240
the logarithm of 10 to the x divided
by 10 to the Y is equal to x minus y.

497
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,560
Again, because of the way, uh,
logarithms multiplied together, uh,

498
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:20,490
and the Logarithm, uh, let's see,

499
00:33:20,491 --> 00:33:25,491
10 to the x rays to the nth
power is equal to m times x.

500
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:33,380
This by the way, is why logarithms
are so incredibly useful. Uh,

501
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:37,050
you should always do all your
arithmetic and logarithms. Uh,

502
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,160
you should just automatically convert
everything in your head into logarithm.

503
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,430
In fact, in the days before calculators,
this is how people used to do arithmetic.

504
00:33:44,431 --> 00:33:46,940
This is how slide rules
work, I should say. Uh,

505
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,460
they mark the thing off logarithmically
and then you're moving back and forth.

506
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,290
Uh, and people, you know,

507
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:55,830
if you memorize like 10 logarithms
of a few convenient numbers,

508
00:33:55,831 --> 00:34:00,660
you can do all sorts of calculations in
your head because multiplication turns

509
00:34:00,661 --> 00:34:03,420
into edition, which is
much, much easier to do.

510
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,960
And so if you can convert things
into logarithms in your head,

511
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:10,200
then all you have to do is
add numbers. That's easy. Uh,

512
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:13,650
similarly taking something to
the amp power, for example,

513
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:18,570
taking the square root of a number or
taking the cube of a number or something

514
00:34:18,571 --> 00:34:21,060
like that reduces down to multiplication.
Uh,

515
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:24,150
it's hard to take a square
root of a number in your head,

516
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:26,400
but it's easy to divide a number by two,

517
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:29,040
which is the equivalent
of taking a square root.

518
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:32,340
So if you're thinking in Logarithms,
all you gotta do is divide it by two,

519
00:34:32,341 --> 00:34:35,990
and you can amaze your friends by
doing square roots in your head. Uh,

520
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:40,050
if your friends are the kinds of people
who are amazed by that kind of thing. Uh,

521
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:44,850
mine are, uh, and, uh, so I
recommend this to you. You know,

522
00:34:44,851 --> 00:34:48,150
if you have to prove that you've
learned something at college, uh,

523
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,710
spend a half hour memorizing 10,
10 different logarithms.

524
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:55,860
Did that just blow people's mind by
taking square roots on bets? Uh, okay.

525
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,903
Uh,

526
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:04,590
or you can do problem sets
in astronomy one 60, uh,

527
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:09,270
for example, uh, Sirius, the star Sirius,

528
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:14,190
which is the brightest star in the
sky, uh, is about three times brighter,

529
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,100
uh,
van Vega.

530
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,310
So what's its magnitude?

531
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,930
What's its magnitude? Well, uh,
let's write down the equation.

532
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:38,990
Magnitude of serious minus the magnitude
of Vega is equal to minus five halves.

533
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,210
Log of the brightness of serious
divided by the brightness of Vega. Now,

534
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,253
uh,
uh,

535
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:51,290
anytime you see three times brighter
or 20 times fainter or any thing,

536
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:55,380
uh, of that kind, what you're
really talking about is a ratio.

537
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,650
If serious is three
times brighter than Vega,

538
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:03,030
that means the brightness
of serious divided by the
brightness of Vega is three.

539
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,710
That's what that statement means. Uh,
and so we can just plug it right in.

540
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:11,970
Five halves, log of three, uh,

541
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,380
cause cause a serious is three
times brighter than Vegas.

542
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:20,370
So that ratio is equal to three.
What's the log of three? One half.

543
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,750
Thank you very much. Uh, this
is equal to minus five halves.

544
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:29,670
Log of 10 to the one half.
You will remember that the
square root of 10 is three.

545
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:34,470
Uh, so, uh, three is also equal to
Pi. But for, for for Logarithms,

546
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:38,700
uh, the important thing is the three
is equal to the square root of 10.

547
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:44,270
And so this is minus five halves
times one half a minus five fourths.

548
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:50,430
Now the magnitude of Vega,
we know that zero,

549
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:56,190
so the magnitude of serious is
equal to minus five fourths.

550
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:02,110
This is what I mean by the fact
that the scale is upside down. Uh,

551
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,680
the brighter the star is, the, the lower,

552
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,140
or if it goes through zero more negative,

553
00:37:08,141 --> 00:37:12,070
the number becomes minus
one is a brighter star,

554
00:37:12,071 --> 00:37:16,780
then zero zero is a brighter star,
then two, two is a brighter star,

555
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:21,730
then five and so forth. Uh,
and so low numbers are bright.

556
00:37:21,731 --> 00:37:25,300
The magnitude of the sun
obviously extremely bright.

557
00:37:25,301 --> 00:37:29,560
When we look at it turns out
to be minus 26 and a half. Uh,

558
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,940
and uh,
uh,

559
00:37:30,941 --> 00:37:35,260
the magnitude of the faintest star that
can be seen with the Hubble telescope is

560
00:37:35,261 --> 00:37:40,180
about plus 30. So, which is incredibly
faint. Uh, and that by the way,

561
00:37:40,181 --> 00:37:40,781
is why again,

562
00:37:40,781 --> 00:37:45,130
why logarithms are such good news because
the entire range of things we can see

563
00:37:45,131 --> 00:37:47,770
in this guy goes from minus 26 to plus 30.

564
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:51,940
Those are numbers you can get
your mind around. Uh, in fact,

565
00:37:51,941 --> 00:37:56,560
the difference in brightness between
those things is a number that I can't even

566
00:37:56,561 --> 00:37:59,380
pronounce. Uh, and uh, uh,

567
00:37:59,381 --> 00:38:03,400
so much easier to deal with magnitudes.
All right.

568
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,930
Now
that has to do with how bright things are,

569
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:15,840
how bright things, how bright
things appear to be, or how
bright they are. But, uh,

570
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,380
remember what we're trying to do,

571
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:22,240
we're trying to compare
how bright something is
intrinsically to how bright it

572
00:38:22,241 --> 00:38:27,190
looks. And this gets you into the question
of there are actually two kinds of

573
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:30,310
magnitude.
The intrinsic brightness of an object,

574
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,850
uh,
is something called absolute magnitude,

575
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,540
whereas the observed brightness

576
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,440
is referred to as apparent magnitude.

577
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:56,470
And now the astronomers screw you up again
because we have different symbols for

578
00:38:56,471 --> 00:39:00,640
the apparent brightness, apparent
magnitude, and the absolute magnitude,

579
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:04,450
the absolute magnitude is
given a simple capital m

580
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:10,630
and the apparent magnitude
is given the simple small m.

581
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,530
And the problem is that you can't actually
tell the difference between those two

582
00:39:14,531 --> 00:39:19,280
in my handwriting, uh, and
probably yours as well. Uh, so, uh,

583
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:23,860
this leads to untold confusion,
but that's the way life is. Uh,

584
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,880
and the relationship between these
two has to relate to distance. Okay.

585
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:32,290
Before we get there,
the definition of absolute magnitude

586
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:42,290
magnitude, you'll notice that in the
previous comparison of serious to vague,

587
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:44,120
I was talking about apparent magnitude,

588
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:49,420
how bright it looks in the Scott absolute
absolute magnitude is defined as the

589
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,010
apparent magnitude.

590
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,400
If the object in question,

591
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:02,320
we're exactly 10 parsecs away.

592
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,480
So the sun has an absent, an
apparent magnitude, as I said before,

593
00:40:09,481 --> 00:40:13,050
minus 26 and a half. But it's
actually not that bright of a star.

594
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,680
If you took the son out to
a distance of 10 parsecs,

595
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,270
its magnitude would be
4.7, uh, so, which is, uh,

596
00:40:21,271 --> 00:40:24,900
among the fainter stars you
could see in the sky. Uh,

597
00:40:24,901 --> 00:40:28,830
and so the absolute
magnitude of the sun is 4.7,

598
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,880
even though it's apparent magnitude
is minus 26 and a half. Uh,

599
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:37,100
so it turns out, for example,
that the star Sirius, uh,

600
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,700
is about three parsecs away.
And so,

601
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,220
uh, oh, I haven't told you
an important thing yet.

602
00:40:44,221 --> 00:40:46,770
We'll come back to this in a second.
The problem set problem.

603
00:40:46,771 --> 00:40:50,760
Obviously he's going to be uh, how, what
is the absolute magnitude of serious,

604
00:40:50,761 --> 00:40:54,270
but I, but I have to write down
the formula first. Little m,

605
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,370
that's the apparent magnitude

606
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:03,150
minus big m. That's the
absolute magnitude, uh,

607
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:08,220
is equal to five times the
logarithm of the distance over 10.

608
00:41:10,421 --> 00:41:11,254
Parsecs.

609
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:16,540
Now notice what happens if
the distance is equal to 10.

610
00:41:16,541 --> 00:41:21,280
Parsecs then you've got the log of one.
What's the log of one?

611
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:22,510
Zero.

612
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:27,510
Thank you very much because this is the
log of 10 to the zero log of 10 to the

613
00:41:27,761 --> 00:41:28,930
zero is zero.

614
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,800
And so if the log of this thing is zero,

615
00:41:32,801 --> 00:41:36,830
then right hand side is zero.
So at a distance of 10, parsecs,

616
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,450
the apparent magnitude is equal to the
absolute magnitude cause m minus M is

617
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:45,350
zero, which is exactly what the
definition was. So that works.

618
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:50,990
So example, serious. Uh, so how far, uh,

619
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:52,280
so what is

620
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,960
the absolute magnitude of serious?

621
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,020
All right, here we go. Uh,

622
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,200
the apparent magnitude we figured out
just a minute ago is minus five fourths

623
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,050
minus the absolute magnitude,

624
00:42:11,051 --> 00:42:16,051
which is what we're trying to figure out
a five times the log of three over 10,

625
00:42:18,011 --> 00:42:21,320
which is a third,
uh,

626
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,400
which is equal to five times
the log of 10 to the minus one,

627
00:42:26,681 --> 00:42:31,210
half a three is 10 to the one half,

628
00:42:31,211 --> 00:42:33,250
one over three is 10
to the minus one half,

629
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,970
which is minus five halves.

630
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:41,770
But that five comes from here. The
minus a half comes from here. Uh,

631
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:45,910
so m is equal to five halves.

632
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,100
Um,
let's see.

633
00:42:48,101 --> 00:42:52,270
Minus five fourths is
equal to five fourths.

634
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,400
Uh,
and that is the absolute magnitude.

635
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:06,190
I'm sorry. Oh, oh, you
want me to do okay? Sure.

636
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:11,050
So we okay to here.
So,

637
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:15,840
oh a. Okay, fine. Um, luck.

638
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,730
This is actually an important point.
Log of a third.

639
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,110
That's what we're going to try and do.

640
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:25,690
A is equal to log of one over 10 to the
one half a one over one over 10 to the n

641
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:36,190
is equal to 10 to the minus.
And that's the key thing.

642
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:40,540
And so this is the log of
10 to the minus one half.

643
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:47,070
That then means that five times the log
of a third is equal to five times minus

644
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,850
a half is equal to minus five halves.

645
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:54,303
Yes.

646
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,090
Uh, there are no unit. Yeah.
Magnitude tutor. Just numbers.

647
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,470
Yeah.
Yes.

648
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:11,320
Ah,
well what I did w sorry,

649
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:13,930
I skipped a step to start from that.

650
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:18,730
Minus five fourths minus M is
equal to minus five halves.

651
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,920
So I multiply both sides by negative one.

652
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,020
Can I subtract five
fourths from both sides?

653
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,320
You got to keep the minus side straight
to the easiest way to make mistakes.

654
00:44:34,321 --> 00:44:37,480
And this is to get the thing upside down
and lose track of where your minus sign

655
00:44:37,481 --> 00:44:41,160
talk, which is really easy to do
because the whole scale is backwards.

656
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,420
So you know, minus five
fourths is bright, uh,

657
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:49,770
whereas five fourths is faint and so your
one is constantly getting these things

658
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:53,190
upside down. Be careful, uh,

659
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:55,680
look at your answers
to see it makes sense.

660
00:44:55,860 --> 00:45:00,750
If some incredibly think galaxy turns
out to have a magnitude of minus 50,

661
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:05,280
that's almost certainly wrong because
that's much brighter than the sun. Uh,

662
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:11,580
all right, so now, uh,
now we can actually do a,

663
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:16,590
the standard candle method. Here's
the, here's the key problem.

664
00:45:17,310 --> 00:45:18,143
Uh,

665
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:24,260
if you observe a star
like serious and you,

666
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:27,931
I don't know,

667
00:45:27,931 --> 00:45:32,010
you take it spectrum more or some alien
comes down and tells you this stars just

668
00:45:32,011 --> 00:45:34,470
like serious or,
or however you work this out.

669
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:38,610
If you observe a star
like serious and measure,

670
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,580
it's apparent magnitude.

671
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:43,690
Okay

672
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:46,330
to be 8.75,

673
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:48,700
how far away is it?

674
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:57,190
And now we're back to where we were 20
minutes ago before I started all this

675
00:45:57,191 --> 00:45:58,090
nonsense.
Namely,

676
00:45:58,091 --> 00:46:01,480
we're trying to measure the distance of
something which was the whole purpose as

677
00:46:01,481 --> 00:46:03,220
you may recall.
Uh,

678
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:09,760
so how far away is it? Uh, let's see.

679
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:15,140
Em minus M is equal to five log d over 10.

680
00:46:15,931 --> 00:46:17,850
Parsecs.
Uh,

681
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
the apparent magnitude is
8.75 a the absolute magnitude.

682
00:46:23,371 --> 00:46:25,170
We just figured out his five fourths.

683
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:28,470
1.25 is equal to five,

684
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:30,900
log d over 10.

685
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:34,620
Parsecs and you'll notice I've chosen my
numbers carefully because this is gonna

686
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:36,300
work out well.
Uh,

687
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:41,600
this is 7.5 and I'm going to divide both
sides by five 7.5 over five is equal to

688
00:46:44,941 --> 00:46:49,941
the log of d over 10 parsecs or 1.5
is equal to the log of d over 10.

689
00:46:53,611 --> 00:46:57,990
Parsecs. Now what do I do? Yeah,

690
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:02,460
exactly. You have to take 10
to the power of both sides. Uh,

691
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:07,380
whenever you're stuck with
log of something and you
don't want the log of the

692
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:09,720
something you want the
actual something itself,

693
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:14,780
what you gotta do is 10 to the 1.5 is
equal to 10 to the log d over 10 parsecs

694
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:22,110
10 to the log of anything is equal to
itself. So this is d over 10 parsecs.

695
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:25,390
Uh,
and thus

696
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,850
it's 10 to the 1.5 30.
Yes,

697
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:35,970
10 to the 1.5 is equal to 10 to the one
times 10 to the half is equal to three

698
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:39,550
times 10 to the one is 30.

699
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:44,820
So 30 is equal to d over 10
parsecs add D is equal to 300.

700
00:47:46,331 --> 00:47:50,530
Parsecs.
And for the person who asked about units,

701
00:47:50,531 --> 00:47:54,160
which was a very good question.
This is where the units come back.

702
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:58,960
It's because there's this 10 parsecs
embedded inside the equation.

703
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,960
And so the unit of length comes back here.

704
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,320
And so that's how you measure distance.

705
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:11,510
You know how bright something is probably
by having looked at some other more

706
00:48:11,511 --> 00:48:16,340
nearby example, uh, you
measure how bright it looks,

707
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:21,260
you compare those two things and
out pops the distance. So, uh,

708
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:25,490
this is done usually in the form of
what's called the distance ladder,

709
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,070
which we will talk about
much more in section.

710
00:48:30,071 --> 00:48:33,210
So you'll get many more
opportunities to do this nearby.

711
00:48:33,211 --> 00:48:38,211
Stars you measured the distance and
parallax from the parallax method.

712
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,310
Okay?

713
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:48,310
Then you find examples of similar stars.

714
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:54,050
Uh, you know, you measure,

715
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:58,360
uh,
the apparent magnitude,

716
00:48:59,150 --> 00:48:59,460
okay?

717
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,520
You assume,
uh,

718
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:06,540
the absolute magnitude to be the same
as the absolute magnitude for things you

719
00:49:06,541 --> 00:49:11,280
already know. The distance to you
assume the absolute magnitude. Uh,

720
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,390
Andrew compute

721
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,413
the distance.

722
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,990
This then gets you new.
Uh,

723
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:24,490
this tells you that you learned
from this the absolute magnitudes of

724
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,970
magnitudes of brighter things,

725
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:36,240
not just stars, but whole galaxies,
supernovae, all sorts of things,

726
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:39,390
brighter things which you can
then measure further away.

727
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:46,820
And just to conclude,

728
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:52,420
you can see pretty clearly that this
method is fraught with potential problems

729
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:57,050
because every time you go through this,

730
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:09,120
you know,
that's a swear word in science,

731
00:50:09,121 --> 00:50:14,121
you're making an assumption and
that assumption can lead you astray.

732
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:19,260
And so the whole history
of cosmology since 1925,

733
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,310
using that work, uh, assuming, uh,

734
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:26,970
the absolute magnitude of things for which
you're trying to measure the distance,

735
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:31,790
so you can put them on the Hubble diagram
so that you can deduce the rate of the

736
00:50:31,791 --> 00:50:35,850
expansion of the universe.
And thus its age and ultimate fate a.

737
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:40,700
So it all rests on this little point
embedded inside the standard candle,

738
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:45,500
a which will be discussed at great length.
Okay.

739
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,540
That's it for today.
