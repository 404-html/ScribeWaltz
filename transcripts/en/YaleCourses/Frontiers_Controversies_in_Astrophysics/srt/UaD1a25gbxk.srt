1
00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:02,830
Okay.
Uh,

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:09,080
we're talking about the origin
and fate of the universe. And, uh,

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,650
let me remind you of the story so far.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:12,923
Uh,

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,900
yeah.
Um,

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,100
and they're basically two sets of
observations that are important here.

7
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:29,940
One is,

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,083
uh,

9
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,260
the existence of the Hubble diagram,
uh,

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,910
and Hubble's law,

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,230
which is the observational relationship
between distance and velocity for

12
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:45,820
galaxies.
Uh,

13
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:50,470
and this leads you to the
idea of a universal expansion.

14
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,330
And the other is what
we discussed last time,

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,970
his time, uh, that, um,

16
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,890
if you look back into the
past, if you observe, uh, with,

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,420
uh, a large, at a large distance,

18
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:14,790
that is to say a large look back time.

19
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,623
Okay.

20
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:22,780
Uh, what you discover is, uh, that
things were different in the past.

21
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,083
Yeah.

22
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,290
The universe as a whole,
uh, look somewhat, uh,

23
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:37,200
somewhat different and in
particular, uh, was, uh,

24
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:41,910
significantly denser, which is
exactly what you would predict if a,

25
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,730
the universe was expanding.

26
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,000
And these two things,

27
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,000
these two observational facts
put together are really, uh,

28
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,640
what lead to,
uh,

29
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,740
the idea of a universe
with a big bang cosmology.

30
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,820
And this is great,
uh,

31
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,020
because you can then use this assumption
that everything is governed by this

32
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:17,310
scale factor of the universe
and the scale factor starts, uh,

33
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,770
either at zero or very close to
zero and gets bigger with time.

34
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,210
And you could use that concept to
do all sorts of wonderful things.

35
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,790
You can describe the past.
Uh,

36
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,630
and in particular,
uh,

37
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,790
one of the things we did last time was to
calculate the age of the universe from,

38
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,320
from the observations of the Hubble
constant. And you can predict the future

39
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,560
and the future depends on,
uh,

40
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,160
how the expansion of the
scale factor changes.

41
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:56,190
If the scale factor just continues
to expand at its current rate,

42
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,010
the universe will continue to expand,
uh,

43
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,830
and gradually get sparser and sparser
and colder and colder and more and more

44
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:04,030
boring.
Uh,

45
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,620
but it's not expected that the scale
that the expansion rate stays the same.

46
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,830
It's expected that the expansion
rate will change. And in particular,

47
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:15,550
it's expected that the expansion
rate will slow down. Why?

48
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,400
Because there's matter in
the universe and matter, uh,

49
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,970
exerts gravity and gravity tends
to pull things back together again.

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,230
And so this is where we
ended up, uh, last time. Uh,

51
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,290
if you assume that gravity
is the dominant force,

52
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:39,640
that is to say that any changes in the
expansion rate of the universe will be

53
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:40,690
due to gravity,

54
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,310
then you can derive this critical
density can we did last time,

55
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,610
which is a quantity equal to three h
squared over eight Pi g h you measure the

56
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:57,460
other things are just constant and you
can calculate what this quantity is.

57
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,750
Now at this point,

58
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:02,830
let me write down a piece
of astronomical jargon,

59
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,570
which I didn't do last
time. Uh, it, the dance,

60
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:11,860
the actual density of the universe
divided by this critical density,

61
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,020
uh, is given a letter of
its own. This is give,

62
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,290
this is written down as a capitol Omega.

63
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,510
So Omega is uh, the true, ah, the
actual density of the universe,

64
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:28,180
whatever that turns out to be
divided by the critical density.

65
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,140
And then you can describe the future of
the universe depending on what Omega is.

66
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,540
If Omega is greater than one,

67
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,860
that means that the density is
greater than the critical density. Uh,

68
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,160
and this leads to re collapse.
And the big crutch.

69
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,860
Whereas if Omega is less than one,
uh,

70
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:49,450
the universe expands forever.

71
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,810
Somebody asked what happens if
Omega is exactly equal to one? Uh,

72
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:05,370
in that case, there's no big crunch.
The universe expands forever,

73
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,000
but the expansion rate, ask them
topically approaches zero. Uh,

74
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:13,170
but of course in real life it's very hard
to get something that's exactly some,

75
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,670
any physical quantity to be precisely
equal to any theoretical value.

76
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,910
Um, and so with this in mind, uh,

77
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,130
if then becomes very important to
actually go out and measure the average

78
00:05:26,131 --> 00:05:30,990
density of the universe, uh, because uh,
then you could divide it by this critical,

79
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,270
uh,
density.

80
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,570
We've already measured h so we know
what this quantity is and then you could

81
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:41,100
figure out what's going to happen.
So the goal here is to determine,

82
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,280
uh,
the density of the universe.

83
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,010
And conceptually,
this isn't such a hard thing to do.

84
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,900
You go out and measure mass of
everything. You can see, uh,

85
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,790
you try and do it over a large volume
because what you want to avoid,

86
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,840
the mistake you want to
avoid is to, uh, measure, uh,

87
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,920
the density of a piece of the universe
that doesn't represent the overall

88
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:17,400
average. If we measured the density
of material in this room, uh,

89
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,740
it would be,
uh,

90
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,790
something like 27 orders of magnitude
bigger than the critical density.

91
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,550
And if we assumed that the universe,
we're just like this room,

92
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,570
obviously it would, we collapse. In fact,
it would have recollapsed long ago. Uh,

93
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,730
but, uh, we don't do that because
of course most of the universities,

94
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,960
not like this room, most of the
universities empty. So you say, well,

95
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:40,110
we better include a lot of stars,
uh, and the empty spaces between the,

96
00:06:40,111 --> 00:06:43,970
but even that's a mistake because you're
measuring stars in our own galaxy.

97
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,990
So you say,
well,

98
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,640
we better include lots of galaxies and
the empty space spaces between them.

99
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,230
Uh, that still doesn't work for a while
because there are clusters of galaxies,

100
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,990
there are clusters of clusters
of galaxies. And so, uh,

101
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:03,070
you have to go really quite far out
before you have a fair sample of what the

102
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:06,410
average conditions in the university,
like buddy a principal.

103
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:08,240
That's certainly possible to do.

104
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,050
You just keep measuring things further
and further and further away until you

105
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:14,510
get to a point where if
you increase the distance,

106
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,560
where as you increase the distance,
that density doesn't change anymore.

107
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:22,700
So you're out to the park, uh, where
you've really achieved the average.

108
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:25,880
How do you know you've achieved the
average when you look out twice as far and

109
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:29,960
you get the same answer. Uh,
and so, uh, in principle,

110
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:33,020
the way you do this is
you add up all the mass,

111
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,270
uh, in some, uh,

112
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:43,390
a sizable chunk of the
universe in a sufficiently

113
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,660
large chunk of the universe.

114
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:50,800
Yeah.

115
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,180
Were sufficiently largest,
sufficiently large to average over,

116
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,710
uh, uh, any local perturbations. Uh,

117
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:02,410
so you add up all the math
and you divide by the volume,

118
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,720
you divide by the volume that
that, uh, uh, mass occupies.

119
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:13,610
And so obviously you have to identify all
the different kinds of mass. Uh, and uh,

120
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:17,090
you have to make sure that
whatever volume you've taken,

121
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:20,800
you found all the mass in it. You add
it all up, you divide by volume, uh,

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,750
you determine that gives
you a value for density.

123
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,980
You divide by the critical density and
you know what's going to happen, uh,

124
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,260
to the universe. Okay. Uh,

125
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,350
now how do you find the mass of things

126
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,710
determining mass?
Well,

127
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,740
one way you could do it is you can
just go out and measure how bright yes,

128
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:51,350
go ahead.
Oh,

129
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,070
put this back for a second.
Top Park.

130
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,740
Bottom part. What do you, yeah.

131
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:02,290
Yeah.

132
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,670
So you determine the density of the
universe by adding up the mass divided by

133
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:11,500
the volume. Uh, and then the question
becomes how do you determine the mass?

134
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:12,903
Uh,

135
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,860
and uh, one way you can
do it is you, uh, uh,

136
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,880
you look at how bright
things are and up the light.

137
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,980
You see,
and then you assume,

138
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,303
uh,

139
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,740
some value for the amount
of mass it takes to, uh,

140
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,740
create a certain amount of lice light.

141
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,370
So that's assuming what's
called a mass to light ratio.

142
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,340
Uh, and so you can do that.
You know, if it's the sun,

143
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,350
then one solar mass produces one
solar luminosity. If all stars,

144
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:58,410
if all objects are exactly like the sun,
then everything would be like that.

145
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,210
It turns out that isn't the case.
Uh,

146
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:05,150
but you can take local samples of stars
and figure out what the average last

147
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:06,660
delight ratio is.
A.

148
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:10,650
And if you have some value that you're
happy with of mass delight ratio,

149
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,550
then you multiply the amount of
light by the mass to like ratio.

150
00:10:14,551 --> 00:10:15,720
And this gives you a mass,

151
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,080
uh,
sorry.

152
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,440
Uh, well, what do you mean by light? Is
the, do you need to adjust for distance?

153
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:29,350
Uh, what you mean by light
is the intrinsic light.

154
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,720
You mean the equivalent
of the absolute magnitude,

155
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:34,060
which takes the distance into account.

156
00:10:34,061 --> 00:10:38,710
So what you need to ask is not
how bright it looks. Uh, but, uh,

157
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,310
it's intrinsic brightness in this
particular case. Yes. So you do,

158
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,320
you do need to account for the distance.

159
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,890
And so you need to be thinking about
absolute magnitude rather than apparent

160
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:50,710
magnitude. Yes. Uh, but,

161
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,520
and that's one of the problems that's
hard to do. The other problem of course,

162
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,490
is this awkward word here,
uh,

163
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,810
which is the kind of thing that makes
people nervous because you could get that

164
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:09,520
wrong if you're looking at a one kind of
star and it's actually some other kind

165
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:13,110
of Starwood, which happens to be
much more massive but dimmer, uh,

166
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,600
like a white dwarfs or something
like that, then you're going to,

167
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,780
then you're going to make a mess of this.
So there's an alternative method, uh,

168
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:25,540
which you may already have considered
because we've done it in both of the

169
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:29,830
previous parts of this class,
which is, uh, you measure

170
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,303
orbits

171
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,440
and you do the same thing we did with
in part one and part two of the class.

172
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,540
You find some star in the distant
portion of a galaxy orbiting around the

173
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,570
galaxy. You're figuring out
how fast the thing is going.

174
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:51,010
You figure out how far the thing
is going, use Kepler's laws, uh,

175
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,110
and you, uh, determine, uh, the mass

176
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,780
from orbital theory,
from Kepler's laws basically.

177
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,220
And in particular,
you know,

178
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:08,970
v squared is equal to g m over a.

179
00:12:08,971 --> 00:12:13,550
And so you can measure this
from the doppler shift. Uh,

180
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:17,480
you can determine this. Uh,
basically in the case of galaxies,

181
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:21,830
galaxies are big objects. You can
physically measure, uh, the, uh,

182
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,700
angular separation on the guide.

183
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,870
Use the small angle formula if you
know the distance to determine this.

184
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:31,700
So this can also be measured, uh,
and therefore this can be calculated.

185
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:36,930
Okay.

186
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,490
And so you go and do that for a whole
bunch of galaxies and this has been done.

187
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,000
And let me,
let me give you some examples here.

188
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:49,170
Let me actually write down some numbers
and do and do some calculations.

189
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,020
Supposing you have a galaxy,

190
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,530
a add a distance of

191
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,570
20 mega parsecs,
uh,

192
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,940
and supposing it has an apparent magnitude

193
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,860
of something like 14.

194
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,290
Yeah.

195
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,120
These are kind of typical numbers for,
uh,

196
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,850
galaxies in a nearby galaxy. Clusters
in printed, there's a particular,

197
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
the nearest big galaxy cluster to to
us is a cluster in the constellation of

198
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:27,830
Virgo,
known as the Virgo cluster.

199
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,610
If you want to know about the Virgo
cluster asks you crowd who is devoting his

200
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:35,450
life to the study of this object,
uh, and the galaxies within it.

201
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:38,600
But these are sort of quasi
typical numbers, uh, uh,

202
00:13:38,601 --> 00:13:42,240
adjusted slightly because
it's actually 17 mega parsec.

203
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:46,220
She's just kind of a pain.
Uh, all right. So, uh,

204
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,320
what do you know about the mass?

205
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:53,120
What can you determine about the
mass of such and such a galaxy?

206
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,950
Well, Oh, and let me warn you before we
even begin to, of course, astronomers,

207
00:13:57,951 --> 00:13:59,450
it played you a dirty trick,

208
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:04,510
namely that the symbol we
use for magnitude is m a,

209
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,300
the symbol we use for mass is also an a.

210
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,390
So you've got to keep those clear
in your mind. Uh, all right.

211
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,020
So what do we know
about this? We know, uh,

212
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,610
the relationship between a parent
and absolute magnitude. Naza,

213
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,980
I said just a minute ago.

214
00:14:18,981 --> 00:14:22,940
It's the absolute magnitude that
we need to know in order to, uh,

215
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,470
actually determine anything.

216
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,840
M minus M is equal to five log d over 10.

217
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:35,930
Parsecs. So, uh, let's figure
out the right hand side first.

218
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:40,550
That's five blog. Uh, two
times 10 to the seven.

219
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,160
That's 20 mega parsecs, one
mega parsecs 10 to the six, uh,

220
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,760
over 10. That's five log, uh,

221
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,690
two times 10 to six. Now what
do I do about that? Let's see,

222
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,730
that's a five times log of 10 to the six.

223
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,330
That's pretty
straightforward. Uh, plus, uh,

224
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,050
the log of two because uh, uh,

225
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:11,010
if you add logs, then you multiply
the thing inside the parentheses.

226
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:14,700
So log of two plus log of 10 to the six
is equal to log of two times 10 to the

227
00:15:14,701 --> 00:15:17,130
six block of 10 to the six is six,

228
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:20,190
log of two is 0.3.

229
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,740
It's just a useful number to know.
Uh,

230
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:27,830
the log of two is around 0.3.

231
00:15:27,831 --> 00:15:32,030
The lag of three is around 0.5.
The log of five is around 0.7.

232
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,940
Uh, you could look it up. Uh,

233
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,710
and so this is equal to five times 6.3,

234
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,430
five times six is 35 times
0.3 is one and a half.

235
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:46,460
So this is 31.5.
Uh,

236
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,450
let me caution you at this point.
Uh,

237
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,090
so let me give you a
little side note here. Uh,

238
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:58,580
do not approximate

239
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,740
magnitudes.

240
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,460
Why not?
I mean,

241
00:16:08,461 --> 00:16:12,960
we approximate everything else in this
course magnitudes are a logarithmic

242
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:14,750
quantity, right? Uh,

243
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:20,060
and so you don't approximate magnitude
for the same reason that you don't,

244
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,360
uh, that you're don't
approximate the exponent.

245
00:16:24,361 --> 00:16:28,320
You can't say 10 to the seven
is equal to 10 to the six.

246
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,930
You can say seven equals six,

247
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,370
but you can't say 10 to the seven is
equal to 10 to the six because uh,

248
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,050
that's a factor of 10 difference.

249
00:16:37,051 --> 00:16:40,890
Where's the difference between seven and
six is, is just a little more than 10%.

250
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,870
Similarly, this 0.3, uh,

251
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,760
you would have been tempted to get rid of
it, right? Because who cares about, uh,

252
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,970
about the difference between six and 6.3,

253
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,030
but in fact it comes
out of this log of two.

254
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,470
And so 0.3 in the log is
actually a factor of two.

255
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,690
Uh, and so you gotta, you
gotta not approximate the
exponent. This is important.

256
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,510
Yes. We should also try to be more
precise when we're dealing with attitudes.

257
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,490
Well, yes, that's thing, I guess
that's saying the same thing.

258
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:14,910
Should you be more precise? That means you
shouldn't approximate. Yeah. So I guess,

259
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:19,800
uh, uh, uh, but um, uh, but it's,

260
00:17:19,801 --> 00:17:24,470
it's, it's for the same reason that
you don't approximate the exponent. Uh,

261
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,210
and it's also true that uh,

262
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,050
the numbers are easier to work with
because it turns out that you add the

263
00:17:31,051 --> 00:17:34,230
brother the multiplying the most of
the time, so it's not such a bad thing.

264
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,370
Anyway, here we are at
31.5. Uh, so what do we got?

265
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,750
We've got,
uh,

266
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:45,360
m minus M is equal to 31.5.

267
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:50,150
This M was stated in the problem to be 14.
Uh,

268
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,250
so 14 minus 31.5 equals m.

269
00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:00,120
Uh,
so m is equal to minus 17 and a half.

270
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,183
Okay.

271
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:10,120
Okay. Uh, that's not such a bad
number. We can work with that.

272
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,480
Uh, now what are we, so now we
know the absolute magnitude.

273
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:14,800
We know how bright the thing is.

274
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,120
So now we can figure out how many
times brighter than the sun it is.

275
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,590
Why is that a useful thing?

276
00:18:20,591 --> 00:18:24,340
Because if you then make the assumption
that the mass to like ratio is the same

277
00:18:24,341 --> 00:18:27,820
as the sun, that this galaxy
consists entirely of sunlight stars,

278
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,930
then you can determine how massive
it is. So let's do that. Uh,

279
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,100
how many sons?
Uh,

280
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,590
and this is the other magnitude
equation. This is a, you know,

281
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,640
m one minus m two is equal to,
uh,

282
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:50,670
for two different objects is equal to
minus five halves log of the brightness of

283
00:18:53,051 --> 00:18:56,290
one over the brightness
of the other. Uh, and now,

284
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,420
but I think I wanted in the other form,

285
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,720
I think I wanted in the form 10 to the
minus oh 0.4 or 10 to the minus two

286
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:05,044
fifths,

287
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:10,110
a m one minus m two is
equal to B one over B two.

288
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:17,100
This is the exact same equation as
you'll recall. Uh, just, uh, uh,

289
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,220
having been getting rid of the log,
taking everything, taking everything,

290
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:24,820
putting it on to the 10 to
the something power. Uh,

291
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:28,060
the reason I wanted in this form
is that this is the answer I want.

292
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:32,110
I want be one. [inaudible].
I want one to be the galaxy.

293
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,380
I want to to be the son.

294
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,730
So then I've got 10 to
the minus two fifths,

295
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:44,260
and then the galaxy is minus 17 and a
half. That's the absolute magnitude.

296
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:49,030
Uh,
the sun is minus the son is five,

297
00:19:49,031 --> 00:19:50,710
has an absolute magnitude of five,

298
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:54,880
and that's going to give me the brightness
of the galaxy over the brightness of

299
00:19:54,881 --> 00:19:56,040
the sun.
Uh,

300
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,480
that's 10 to the minus two
fifths of 22 and a half.

301
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,430
Uh, let's see the minuses cancel
out. So that's a plus. Actually.

302
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,550
Two fifths times 20, two
and a half. Well, let's see.

303
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:14,440
Two Times 22 and a half is 45.
A fifth of 45 is nine.

304
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,540
So this is equal to 10 to the nine.

305
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,420
So this galaxy is a billion
times brighter than the sun,

306
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,490
10 to the nine times brighter
than the sun. So, uh,

307
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,310
if it were made out of sunlight stars,

308
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,140
it would have a mass of a
billion solar masses. So mass,

309
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:37,540
uh, would equal 10 to the
nine times the mass of the sun

310
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,360
if all sunlight

311
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,483
stars.

312
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,600
But it turns out that galaxies
to be somewhat dimmer than
the sun per unit mass.

313
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,190
Uh, most stars are a little
bit less massive than the sun,

314
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:58,750
but a lot less bright. Uh, this is
just the way stars' turn out to be a.

315
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,080
And so typical mass delight ratios of,

316
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:06,110
of populations of stars tend to be on
the order of 10 or something like that,

317
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,680
times the Sun. So, uh,

318
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,190
probably it needs to be more massive

319
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,720
cause typical stars are
fainter than the sun.

320
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:19,043
Typically

321
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:22,740
stars are fainter.

322
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:23,960
Okay.

323
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,920
Ah, so you could guess
and say mass maybe should

324
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,923
B,

325
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:33,140
I dunno, 10 times greater than
that, 10 to the 10 solar masses.

326
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,740
And you could see why this
particular line of reasoning, uh,

327
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,760
starts to get pretty dubious because that
I picked this number completely out of

328
00:21:43,921 --> 00:21:47,370
the air. Uh, there's actually
some modest basis for it,

329
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:51,340
but you could pick other numbers. Uh,
you could argue about this endlessly. Uh,

330
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:54,360
and you wouldn't get very far.
Why should it be 10 times the Sun?

331
00:21:54,361 --> 00:21:58,010
Maybe it's a hundred, maybe
it's a thousand. Maybe
it's less than the sun. Uh,

332
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,650
how would you really know?
Uh,

333
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:03,750
and so let's go back and
do the other approach,

334
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,720
namely, uh, figure out, uh,

335
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:11,130
it's mass from orbits of things around it.
So let's look at it.

336
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:15,550
The supposing it's an edge on galaxy.
Here's the center of the Galaxy, uh,

337
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,930
or, and uh, actually let's
look at it from the top.

338
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:22,740
So here is a nice spiral
galaxy of some kind.

339
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:26,940
Here's the center of the spiral galaxy.
Here's some star way out on the edge.

340
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:31,620
Uh, that star is moving around the
center of the galaxy. It has to be,

341
00:22:31,621 --> 00:22:34,770
or it's going to fall in. So it's
orbiting around the center of the Galaxy,

342
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,750
presumably in some circular orbit.
Your down here looking at this thing,

343
00:22:39,751 --> 00:22:43,200
and of course you can measure the
velocity of that star by the doppler shift

344
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:45,330
because it's moving away from you.
Uh,

345
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,990
and so one can measure this velocity.
Uh,

346
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,500
you can measure this distance,
uh,

347
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:57,530
that would be the equivalent of a in
our formulas because it's the distance

348
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:00,170
between the orbiting
object and the center, uh,

349
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,240
stars are much less massive than galaxies.

350
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:05,520
So we don't have to worry
about the motion of the galaxy.

351
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,630
And you can use a familiar
equation, namely, uh,

352
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,490
v squared equals g m over a.
So now let's give this some numbers.

353
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,623
Uh,

354
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:20,810
typical velocities of things orbiting
around the galaxy turned out to be

355
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:25,881
something like 200 kilometers a second
or two times 10 to the five meters per

356
00:23:26,461 --> 00:23:31,080
second. Uh, and, uh, the size
of a typical galaxy, you know,

357
00:23:31,081 --> 00:23:35,580
out to where it stops being
easy to see stars is, oh,

358
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,790
I don't know what number did I take here?
Uh,

359
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,280
doop doop,
doop doop,

360
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,050
yeah,
let's call it 20 kiloparsecs,

361
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,860
which is two times 10 to the four.
Uh,

362
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,850
parsecs and a parsec is three
times 10 to the 16 meters.

363
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,250
So this is six times 10 to the 20 meters.

364
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,300
So now let's calculate amp

365
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,290
n Equals v squared,
a over g,

366
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,153
uh,

367
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,990
two times 10 to the five squared,
uh,

368
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,890
six times 10 to the 20th,
uh,

369
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:20,850
over seven times 10 to the minus 11.
Get rid of those.

370
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,113
Uh,

371
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,010
let's see,
that's four times

372
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,890
10 to the 30,

373
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,140
over 10 to the minus 11,

374
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,400
four times 10 to the 41.
This isn't kilograms,

375
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:37,450
okay?

376
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,980
One solar mass,

377
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,440
okay?

378
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,360
You'll recall is two times 10 to the 30.
So this mass

379
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:48,870
in units of the Sun,

380
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,460
four times 10 to the 41
over two times 10 to the 30,

381
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:58,410
which is something like two
times 10 to the 11 solar masses.

382
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:06,310
And now we have a problem, right? You,

383
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,920
you probably don't remember what the
answer to the previous version of this

384
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:10,640
problem was,

385
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,640
where we did it with light that
came out to a magnitude of,

386
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:17,643
uh,

387
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:22,010
uh, the brightness was about
10 to the nine times the sun.

388
00:25:22,011 --> 00:25:24,500
Maybe the mass is 10 to
the 10 times the Sun.

389
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:27,770
But now we've just calculated it
in this other more reliable way.

390
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:29,390
And it's two times 10 to the 11.

391
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,400
It's 20 times more massive
than you thought it was going
to be. Given how bright,

392
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,660
uh, how bright the light from
this thing was. Yes. Question.

393
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,570
This is the massive, the galaxy. Yes.

394
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:43,763
Okay.

395
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,170
Now before I go on,

396
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,350
let me just point out those of you who
have taken a look at the problem set,

397
00:25:48,351 --> 00:25:51,980
what I've just done here, this
calculation I've just done is problem.

398
00:25:51,981 --> 00:25:56,510
One of the problem set except done
backwards, uh, in on the problem set,

399
00:25:56,511 --> 00:26:00,590
what I did is I told you what the Mat,
what the density was,

400
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,460
what the critical density
was, and then, uh,

401
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:08,150
you had to derive characteristics
of the galaxy from that.

402
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,220
Here I've told you what the galaxies are
like. Uh, we figured out, uh, how big,

403
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:18,110
uh, how massive they are. Uh,
if we divide by the volume, uh,

404
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,680
we'll get a density. So we're doing the
same problem backwards, I should say.

405
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,110
The numbers I've chosen
here are different.

406
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:29,060
So you can't know the answer to the
problem set by looking at the premises of

407
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,550
these particular things. But the, uh, uh,

408
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,110
what I'm doing is the exact same set of
calculations, only done a done backwards.

409
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,200
Uh, so, uh, that may
or may not be helpful,

410
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:44,340
but let's pause here for a
moment because this is now

411
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,110
we're now up to,
we're making progress.

412
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,330
We're now up to frontiers
and controversies circa 1985.

413
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:03,010
You remember in 1920,

414
00:27:03,011 --> 00:27:06,100
they were worried about whether the
spiral nebulae we're actually galaxies in

415
00:27:06,101 --> 00:27:10,780
1950. They were worried about maybe the
steady state was the correct response.

416
00:27:10,781 --> 00:27:14,910
And by the time 1985 rolls around,
the big issue is okay.

417
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,430
Uh,
uh hmm.

418
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,850
Mass is determined by orbital rotation.
Uh,

419
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,970
so what's your Mike called?
Dynamical masses.

420
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,830
That is to say determined

421
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,653
bye

422
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,890
orbits of things around galaxies,

423
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,530
orbits around galaxies.

424
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,300
And also I should take galaxy clusters.
Uh,

425
00:27:46,301 --> 00:27:51,100
you can have galaxies orbiting around
each other and, and galaxies, uh,

426
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,170
orbiting around whole clusters of galaxies
in the same thing is true and Gal.

427
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:58,210
So around galaxies and galaxy clusters,

428
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,993
uh,

429
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,000
are much bigger

430
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:11,710
then you expect from the light.

431
00:28:11,711 --> 00:28:16,600
They give off and therefore, uh,

432
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,281
by a thought,

433
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:21,690
a factor of 10 by
approximately a factor of 10.

434
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,580
So there's 10 times more mass than you
can account for by adding up all the

435
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:31,220
stars. Now there's mass in other
forms of that stars. There's also a,

436
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,230
um, uh, there's also
dust. There's also gas.

437
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:39,060
These are things you can detect in other
ways. You add them all up, uh, and,

438
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,000
uh,
you're still off by about a factor of 10,

439
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,890
so there's 10 times more bass than
you have any way of accounting for it.

440
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,340
This is the so called dark matter problem.

441
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:57,130
So this is Ron tears in
controversies in 1985. Uh,

442
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,000
there's all this dark matter.

443
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:03,140
Most of the matter in galaxies is
in some form that we can't detect.

444
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,570
It's dark matter.
And what is it

445
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,140
now, unlike frontiers in
controversies in 1920 and 1950,

446
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:17,340
this is one that we haven't solved
yet. So I don't know the answer. Uh,

447
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,780
for a quarter of a century, people have
been busily trying to figure this out. Uh,

448
00:29:21,781 --> 00:29:26,730
there's still no good answer. And 10
years ago when I taught this course, uh,

449
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:31,620
what this question of what is the dark
matter was a big focus of this part of

450
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:36,400
the course. And now I'm
going to, uh, uh, uh,

451
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:39,840
talk about it only in, in this
class, only in one lecture,

452
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,770
because we got way bigger problems either
than this, uh, that's saying a lot. Uh,

453
00:29:44,771 --> 00:29:48,730
I've just told you that we don't know
what 90% of the mass in the universe is,

454
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,410
and then we've got bigger problems
than that. Uh, so, uh, it's, uh,

455
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,750
things are getting a little murky here,
uh,

456
00:29:55,751 --> 00:30:00,040
and not just because the
matter is dark. Um, okay.

457
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,580
So what,
let's all,

458
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,950
but let me pause a little bit on dark
matter cause it's an interesting problem.

459
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,820
Uh, and what, uh, W as I say, we
have no idea what this stuff is.

460
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:13,240
What are the possibilities?
So here's a hypothesis.

461
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,613
Uh,

462
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:21,110
hypothesis number one is
that what this stuff is is,

463
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:22,730
uh,
some,

464
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,670
yeah,

465
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:26,580
kind of unknown.

466
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,310
A subatomic particle.

467
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,053
Yeah.

468
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,520
Uh,
and it has to have two characteristics.

469
00:30:37,521 --> 00:30:41,590
This subatomic particle for it to
work out, it has to have mass. Uh,

470
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:45,590
that's pretty basic. If you're using it
to explain that you can't have photons,

471
00:30:45,591 --> 00:30:49,790
right? Oh, Todd's don't carry any
mass. Uh, it has to have mass,

472
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,020
but it has to, uh, not
interact with light,

473
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,990
no interaction

474
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,950
with
like

475
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,050
if it absorbs light,

476
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:07,100
it would be opaque and we would know it
was there because galaxies behind this

477
00:31:07,101 --> 00:31:12,010
stuff would look dim. A alternatively,
if it gives off light, uh,

478
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:15,360
then we'd see it. Uh, and so, uh, it,

479
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:20,110
it has to not interact with light or
interact with light only very weekly. Uh,

480
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:23,840
and so these are given
the name, uh, generically,

481
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:28,070
weekly interactive,
inter active,

482
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,600
massive.

483
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:30,760
Yeah,

484
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,840
particles
or whips.

485
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,720
So here's the hypothesis. The
Universe is 90% wimps. Uh,

486
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,310
this is not such a crazy idea as it,

487
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:47,370
that might at first seem there are known
subatomic particles that have these

488
00:31:47,651 --> 00:31:50,080
properties.
There's something called the Neutrino.

489
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:54,040
There are trillions of them going
through this room every second. Uh,

490
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:58,660
they have mass, uh, and they don't
interact very much with anything.

491
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:03,280
They are known to exist from particle
or a particle accelerator experiment.

492
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:07,090
And they have been detected from
celestial sources. Now we know that the,

493
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:11,380
for various reasons that the dark matter
doesn't consist of neutrinos, uh, uh,

494
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:14,570
but there could be many
other kinds of particles, uh,

495
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:18,510
with these kinds of characteristics.
And indeed, some are predicted, uh,

496
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,740
by carp particle theories. Uh, as
I say, wimps, it been detected.

497
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,770
The SNORRI wimps have not been detected,
but neutrinos have been detected.

498
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,720
Here's how they do it. It's kind
of an amazing experiment. Uh,

499
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,740
they took a mine shaft and in South
Dakota and filled it with cleaning fluid.

500
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:39,800
And the reason they did that
was that every so often, uh,

501
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,140
neutrinos don't interact with,
with light,

502
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:46,400
but they do interact
occasionally with chlorine atoms.

503
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,170
And the effect of a neutrino banging
into a chlorine atom is to turn it into

504
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:55,370
Argon. Uh, and so this
happens a there, as I say,

505
00:32:55,371 --> 00:33:00,020
trillions of neutrinos flow through this
mine every second, once a day or so,

506
00:33:00,021 --> 00:33:03,920
one of them will hit a chlorine atom.
Just write, create an Argon, Adam.

507
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,830
So here's what you do. You fill
your mind shaft with cleaning fluid,

508
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:09,110
a large fraction of which is chlorine.
Uh,

509
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:12,800
and to count the Argon atoms
that bubble off the top. Uh,

510
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:17,660
and this has been successful. Uh, they
detected neutrinos emitted from the sun.

511
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:21,580
The Sun is all stars
that, that have, uh, uh,

512
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,820
nuclear reactions going on in the emit
neutrinos as part of the output of these

513
00:33:25,821 --> 00:33:26,870
nuclear reactions.

514
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:32,180
And then they had a problem because they
had predicted how many neutrinos you

515
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:35,060
ought to see from the sun and
an experiment of this kind.

516
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:38,690
And they didn't see enough of them.
They only saw a third of them.

517
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:42,350
And it turns out. And then there was a
big debate for a long time. This is is,

518
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:47,351
so this is frontiers and controversies
circa about 1975 a there was a big debate

519
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:49,910
for a while.
Where are all the solar neutrinos?

520
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,750
Is it possible that we don't understand
nuclear reactions in the sun?

521
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,610
Is it possible that we don't
understand the chemistry of our,

522
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,760
of chlorine or Argon? After all?
You're counting individual argon atoms.

523
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:04,730
So that's a kind of a difficult test.
A No,

524
00:34:04,731 --> 00:34:08,450
it turned out that what was going on
was we didn't understand neutrinos.

525
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:13,160
And it turns out there are three kinds
of neutrinos and neutrinos a switch back

526
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:14,750
and forth between these different kinds,

527
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:18,820
and you could only detect one kind of
by the chlorine. And so you only did to,

528
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,071
and,

529
00:34:19,071 --> 00:34:23,710
and so they were all emitted from the sun
as if they were the kind you could, uh,

530
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:26,210
in the form that you would
have been able to detect them.

531
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,230
But as they traveled from the sun
to us, uh, some fraction of them,

532
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,230
a flip back and forth between all
these other, other kinds of new,

533
00:34:33,231 --> 00:34:35,120
I ended up only with
about a third of them.

534
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:38,880
So it was a big piece of particle
physics. It was discovered. Uh,

535
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,570
we have also detected by now,
uh,

536
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,330
neutrinos coming from
supernova explosion. So, uh,

537
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,130
there 2011 of them,
I think were detected all at once.

538
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,250
And if you're detecting
things sort of once per day,

539
00:34:52,251 --> 00:34:57,080
and then you suddenly detect 11 of them
over the course of a few minutes, uh,

540
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:59,970
you've seen something exciting
occur. And that was, uh,

541
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,940
a no is now known to be this,

542
00:35:01,941 --> 00:35:06,680
this supernova explosion that occurred
in a neighboring galaxy. Uh, and,

543
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,490
uh, so there are a bunch
of, so by analogy with that,

544
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:13,670
people are looking for the whips that
make up the dark matter. If it turns,

545
00:35:13,671 --> 00:35:15,290
if all this dark matters in Wimps,

546
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,380
there are lots and lots and lots of
these things and they're going through us

547
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:19,214
every second.

548
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,230
So there are a whole bunch of experiments
with the same basic characteristics.

549
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:29,000
You have a huge vat of something
and something is supposed to happen

550
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:33,730
occasionally when one of these wimps
hits whatever's in the VAT. Uh,

551
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:35,940
so the Japanese have, uh, uh,

552
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:40,260
sort of a cubic mile of distilled water
and they're looking for little light

553
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:44,850
flashes when the Neutrino runs into
the watermark and they busted all their

554
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:45,421
detectors.

555
00:35:45,421 --> 00:35:48,990
Recently they had a sort of earthquake
and it was bad for the little light

556
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:51,030
detectors they had put on
the inside of these things.

557
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,730
But there are a lot of such a experiment.

558
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,990
Dan Mckinsey here in the
physics department is a, is
a big player in one of them.

559
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:58,360
Uh,

560
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:03,360
and the hope is that you will see the
interaction between one of these whims of

561
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,970
which there must be an
incredibly large number, uh,

562
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,280
with something this has so far failed.
Uh,

563
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:13,890
so there is no direct evidence from wimps.
Uh,

564
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:17,190
the other hope I should say is that
every time you build a bigger collider,

565
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,700
you make new kinds of subatomic particles
and that they'll eventually make

566
00:36:20,701 --> 00:36:23,040
something that looks
like it could be a wimp.

567
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:27,180
And that hasn't been
happened either. Uh, so, uh,

568
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:31,080
no detections yet,
no direct,

569
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,210
uh,
detections,

570
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:36,603
uh,

571
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,430
with considerable efforts,
you know,

572
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:41,310
this is going to turn out to be
90% of the mass in the universe.

573
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:45,000
So you would like to detect it because if
you do, they'll give you a Nobel prize.

574
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,980
Uh, all right, that's one hypothesis.
There's another hypothesis.

575
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,370
So here's hypothesis number two.

576
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,770
It's just,
you know,

577
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:04,840
dark chunks of something that doesn't
glow ordinary matter, uh, chunks.

578
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:09,940
Oh yes, yes, yes. All of that.

579
00:37:09,941 --> 00:37:13,090
We don't know what it is.
And so nothing has yet been ruled out.

580
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:17,260
What happens is that they, you know, they
continued to conduct these experiments.

581
00:37:17,261 --> 00:37:20,530
So you can rule out wimps with certain
kinds of characteristics because you

582
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:22,180
would have detected them.
Similarly,

583
00:37:22,181 --> 00:37:25,060
you can rule out some of these
other things with certain
characteristics because

584
00:37:25,061 --> 00:37:26,790
you would have noticed they were there.
Uh,

585
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,250
but both of these hypotheses are
still more or less viable, uh,

586
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:35,080
chunks of ordinary matter,
uh, that just don't glow,

587
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:39,970
that don't emit light.
Now there's some limitations,

588
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:43,520
can't they?
These chunks can't be too small

589
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,980
because if what you've got
are, are tiny, you know,

590
00:37:47,981 --> 00:37:52,920
micron size particles,
uh, we call that dust. Uh,

591
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:56,320
and it basically, that's what it
is. It would just be dust. Uh,

592
00:37:56,321 --> 00:38:01,321
the problem with dust is dust in large
quantities is opaque and you can't see

593
00:38:01,421 --> 00:38:05,050
through it and therefore you
would know it was there, uh,

594
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,200
because it obscures the
light of things behind it.

595
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:11,020
And indeed we see cosmic
dust this way all the time.

596
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:14,980
It's just there isn't nearly enough
of it to account for any substantial

597
00:38:14,981 --> 00:38:19,690
fraction of the dark
matter. So dust, uh, would,

598
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:25,060
uh, be observed because it, uh,

599
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,760
by obscuring light.

600
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,650
And it also tends to glow

601
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,920
in the infrared.

602
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,670
Uh, and so we know that
dust exists, but we can fit,

603
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,720
we can count how much of it there is
because it obscures light and it makes its

604
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:44,950
presence known in other ways.

605
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,970
It's also true that these chunks of
ordinary matter can't be too big.

606
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:55,640
They can't be the size of whole galaxies
or even a substantial fraction of a

607
00:38:55,641 --> 00:39:00,580
galaxy. You can take all your dark matter
and put it into one lump per galaxy,

608
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,840
or even a hundred lumps per galaxy.

609
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:07,640
Because if they were very large masses,

610
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,950
uh, you'd see it because it
would, uh, it would disrupt,

611
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,820
uh,
the orbits of stars around the galaxy.

612
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,500
So if there was some
huge unknown, uh, mass,

613
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:28,050
you'd see things orbiting around
it. And in fact, we do, uh,

614
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,580
we see the supermassive black holes
in the centers of galaxies and we know

615
00:39:31,581 --> 00:39:35,900
they're there cause we see stars
orbiting around them. Uh, just like, uh,

616
00:39:35,901 --> 00:39:40,460
the problem on, on, on the last midterm,
uh, and so it can't be too small.

617
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,910
It can't be too big.
Uh,

618
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:47,140
but you could perhaps have
sort of a bunch of star mast,

619
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:53,780
so you could have,
sorry to have a bunch of star mast,

620
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,190
uh,

621
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:59,780
or planet mass dark things in a,

622
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:02,660
it would have to be for various
technical reasons that I won't go into.

623
00:40:02,661 --> 00:40:04,880
It has to be in the
outer parts of galaxies,

624
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,970
in the Halos of galaxies.

625
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,910
So that in principle is possible.

626
00:40:10,911 --> 00:40:13,220
We wouldn't have any direct
way of detecting them.

627
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:17,930
These things are called
a massive astrophysical,

628
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:24,510
uh,
compact halo object.

629
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,890
Yeah.
Some people get it a massive,

630
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:33,010
because they have to carry mass
astrophysical cause they're not particles

631
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:35,980
compact. Because if they
were big you, you know,

632
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:39,400
they block light and you'd see them halo
because that's the part of the galaxy

633
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:42,880
there in a, these are machos. Right.

634
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,400
And so the alternative to whips
his machos. Uh, and so, uh,

635
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:51,500
the alternative explanation is that
90% of the university's Machos, uh,

636
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,370
there have,

637
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:56,590
there's been a very clever experiment
carried out to try and find these things.

638
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:00,610
Uh, here's how you do it. You
do it with gravitational lenses,

639
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,100
Lansing macho searches.

640
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,750
Remember Gravitational lensing.

641
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:20,340
This is this business
that mass bends light. Uh,

642
00:41:20,341 --> 00:41:25,290
so here you are, you're looking
at some star, and in between UN,

643
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:29,640
the star is a macho of some kind.
So here's the macho.

644
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:35,480
You can't see the macho, but
presence of the Macho, uh,

645
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:40,310
changes the direction of the light.
So it comes into you like this,

646
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,920
and it basically acts like a lens.

647
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,490
And in particular,
the way it acts,

648
00:41:47,491 --> 00:41:51,840
like the lens in the case
of machos lending stars,

649
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,330
uh,
is it makes it brighter,

650
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:01,110
makes the star brighter.
Uh,

651
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:04,840
now in order for this to work, the
alignment has to be essentially perfect.

652
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:07,930
All of these objects are moving around,
you know,

653
00:42:07,931 --> 00:42:12,040
they're orbiting the galaxy and stuff.
So the alignment,

654
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,560
uh,

655
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,560
hold for a few weeks typically.

656
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,550
So what you'll see is you'll see this
star become much brighter and it can

657
00:42:24,551 --> 00:42:25,690
really become much brighter.

658
00:42:25,691 --> 00:42:29,380
We're talking tens to hundreds of times
brighter than it would ordinarily was.

659
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,480
This lasts for a few weeks in, then it
goes away. These have been observed.

660
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,730
These Lenzing events have been observed,

661
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,990
planting event observed.

662
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:46,000
Uh,
but there are too few of them.

663
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:52,490
Uh,
to explain the dark matter.

664
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,220
Now,
there are still ways out.

665
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,240
Let's see if you have
particularly low mass macho.

666
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:00,710
So things the mass,

667
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,880
supposing the whole universe is filled
with things about the massive earth. Uh,

668
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,050
those won't cause,
uh,

669
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:11,000
Tho those cause a lensing events
that might be too small to see.

670
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:12,290
Alternatively,

671
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:16,340
supposing you have things that are many
thousands of times the mass of a star,

672
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,860
uh, but not big enough to totally
disrupt a galactic whore pit. Uh,

673
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:24,900
then there are much, many fewer of
them for a given amount of mass and,

674
00:43:24,901 --> 00:43:28,710
and there aren't enough macho events
that you would have expected to see and

675
00:43:28,711 --> 00:43:30,080
he's substantial number of them.

676
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:34,940
So there's still a way around the result
of these experiments if you want to

677
00:43:34,941 --> 00:43:39,470
believe in machos. Uh, but it's
getting very tough. Uh, so, uh,

678
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,660
so no macho,
no wimps detected so far.

679
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:49,240
No Machos
uh,

680
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:54,540
you could still postulate kinds of wimps
and kinds of machos that might explain

681
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:59,400
the dark matter. Uh, but it's getting
kind of tough. Most people I think, uh,

682
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,600
believe in, in, in wimps.

683
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,950
Most people tend to believe in this.
Uh,

684
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,470
but as far as I can tell,
uh,

685
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:13,500
that's because the particle physicists
keep coming up with new candidate wimps

686
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:18,610
that might exist, but we haven't
quite been able to see so far. Uh,

687
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,540
uh, and so there's, uh,

688
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:24,640
a theoretical basis for the
existence of these things.

689
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:28,900
Whereas with these machos if you
ask the astronomers, well, fine,

690
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:32,850
so you want to have 90%
of the be in little earth,

691
00:44:32,851 --> 00:44:36,330
like things just floating around
with no star. How did they,

692
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,670
how did that happen?
How did these come into being a,

693
00:44:39,770 --> 00:44:41,670
we really have no answer at all for that.

694
00:44:41,671 --> 00:44:44,510
So there's no theoretical
basis for any of the,

695
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,590
of the still allowed categories
of machos. Uh, and so,

696
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,950
uh, at the moment people tend
to believe wimps over machos,

697
00:44:52,951 --> 00:44:55,260
although there is no direct
evidence for either. Yes.

698
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:56,183
Yeah.

699
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,380
The Universe is made of little
riff like objects and a,

700
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,930
wouldn't that mean 90% of the
universe was made of metal?

701
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:08,720
Oh, uh, earth, earth, Sa Earth
mass objects is what I meant.

702
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,720
I don't care what it's made out
of. Uh, yeah, maybe they're,

703
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,940
maybe they're a little earths.
Earth sized balls of hydrogen. Ah,

704
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,370
that would be fine too. Uh,
except how do you get them, uh,

705
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,890
we know something about how balls
of, of, of, of hydrogen fault,

706
00:45:21,891 --> 00:45:26,330
what form and what they become. They
turn into stars. Uh, this is well known.

707
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:30,680
Uh, and one of the popular
kinds of machos was just very,

708
00:45:30,681 --> 00:45:33,530
very dim stars. And this
is one of the things, uh,

709
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,300
that this space telescope
helped to rule out, uh,

710
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:39,860
because it can see really faint
objects and they weren't there. Uh,

711
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:43,790
and so no wimps, no machos. Uh,

712
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:48,470
and um, uh, and so we
don't know what's going on.

713
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,530
That was a digression.
Uh,

714
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:56,820
and what I digressed
from was the fact that,

715
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:58,103
uh,

716
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:03,230
this galaxy that we had measured
the mass of turned out to be,

717
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,080
uh,

718
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:09,080
two times 10 to the 11 solar masses or
around four times 10 to the 41 kilograms.

719
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,810
If you have these things,
uh,

720
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,940
one such galaxy,
every,

721
00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:25,950
I dunno,
two mega parsecs or so what,

722
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:30,690
uh, the density of the universe. Remember,

723
00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:33,900
that's where we started of the universe.

724
00:46:33,901 --> 00:46:38,280
So now let's finish this
calculation. Uh, let's see. Uh,

725
00:46:38,281 --> 00:46:41,430
the density is equal to mass over volume,

726
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:45,060
four times 10 to the 41,
uh,

727
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,690
from observing these orbits. Uh, and uh,

728
00:46:48,691 --> 00:46:53,010
the volume down here is going to
be two mega parsecs cubed. Uh,

729
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:58,011
that's two times 10 to
the six times to uh,

730
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,670
sorry, times three times 10
to the 16. That's one. Parsec.

731
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:06,510
Uh,
so this is six times 10 to the 22.

732
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:11,840
I want to cubit six cube six times
six is 36 times another six is 200.

733
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:20,090
So that's 200 times 10 to the
66 or two times 10 to the 68.

734
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,500
So then the density of the universe,

735
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:29,300
four times 10 to the 41 over,
uh,

736
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:32,580
two times 10 to the 68,
uh,

737
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,720
that's equal to two times 10 to the
minus 27 kilograms per meter cubed.

738
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:41,200
Uh,

739
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:45,970
and in that a real
critical can be calculated.

740
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,890
Turns out to be,
uh,

741
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:52,210
as you'll discover on the problem set
six times 10 to the minus 27 in these

742
00:47:52,211 --> 00:47:54,670
universe, in these units, uh,

743
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,750
row overrode critical is
equal to about one third.

744
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,420
So if you buy that,

745
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:06,480
the universe is going to
keep expanding because Omega,

746
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:11,510
uh, the ratio of the, uh, density
to the critical densities,

747
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:13,030
only about a third of,

748
00:48:13,031 --> 00:48:17,410
but the problem is we've got all this
dark matter around and what we're doing is

749
00:48:17,411 --> 00:48:18,790
we're adding up galaxies.

750
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,780
How do you know that there isn't a whole
bunch of dark matter where there aren't

751
00:48:22,781 --> 00:48:25,900
galaxies and where there's
nothing to see orbiting around it.

752
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:30,970
You have no idea what this stuff is. And
indeed, most of the wimp kinds of ideas,

753
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:35,620
uh, sort of postulate some kind of dark
matter that kind of pervades the universe

754
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:39,940
until you'd expect there to be somewhat
more of it than you can see in any given

755
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:43,400
galaxy. Uh, well, somewhat
more than a third, uh,

756
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:47,480
get you into dangerous
territory. Uh, namely near one a,

757
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,410
which is the thing we're trying to
distinguish whether this number is greater

758
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:53,710
than one or not.
And so you need a new approach.

759
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:58,810
This isn't going to get you the answer.
And so, uh, there is a different approach,

760
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:00,040
uh,
and fats,

761
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:05,070
what we'll talk about a next time and
that will finally bring us up to frontiers

762
00:49:05,561 --> 00:49:07,870
and controversies in the 21st century.
