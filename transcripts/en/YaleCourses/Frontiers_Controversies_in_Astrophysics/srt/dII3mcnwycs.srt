1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:01,813
Okay.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,833
Uh,

3
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,330
the subject is special relativity

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:13,150
and right at the end of the last class,

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,150
uh,

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,150
I had written down this factor gamma and
gamma is the key thing which tells you

7
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:22,810
how relativistic,

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,290
uh,

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,123
you are.

10
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,800
Gamma is equal to one over the
square root of one minus V squared.

11
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:31,120
Oversee squared.

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:31,900
Uh,

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,210
and we talked about this
factor a little bit.

14
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,090
Uh,

15
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,370
if the oversea is equal to
zero or approaches zero,

16
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,490
then gamma obviously is one.

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,590
And when gamma's one,

18
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,060
that's the Newtonian case,

19
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:48,310
then everything is just
like Newton's laws said.

20
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,483
Okay.

21
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:52,820
Uh,

22
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,810
on the other hand,

23
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:55,970
as v oversee goes to,

24
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,920
goes to one.

25
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,010
That is to say as the velocity
approaches the speed of light,

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,280
this gamma factor goes to infinity
because one minus one in the denominator,

27
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:07,940
that's your own the denominator.

28
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:10,010
So the thing has to go to infinity.

29
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,900
And then all these bizarre relativistic
effects start taking place.

30
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,240
And the one we talked about in particular,

31
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,140
uh,

32
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:26,140
came about from an example
of how this gamma is used,

33
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:28,550
namely that the relativistic mass,

34
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,353
uh,

35
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:33,110
is equal to gamma times.

36
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,400
The rest mass,

37
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:35,960
which is the Newtonian mass.

38
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,900
And obviously if dammit equals one,

39
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:44,510
then then the Newtonian
mass is equal to the,

40
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,140
then,

41
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,780
then the mass is equal to the
Newtonian mass and you're,

42
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:49,790
you're a Newton's laws
and everything is fine.

43
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:50,900
Uh,

44
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,100
when the velocity,

45
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,330
uh,

46
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,780
approaches the speed of light,

47
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,830
then this total relativistic
mass goes to infinity.

48
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,490
Uh,

49
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,670
the consequence of which is that
you can no longer accelerate

50
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,680
regardless of how much,

51
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:07,850
uh,

52
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:12,080
so no more acceleration regardless
of how much force is applied because,

53
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:12,680
uh,

54
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,010
force equals mass times acceleration.

55
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,900
And if the mass is infinite,

56
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:20,870
then any amount of force will
not give you an acceleration.

57
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,300
And acceleration is
the change in velocity.

58
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:28,570
And so the consequence of this is that
you can't go faster than the speed of

59
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:30,194
light.

60
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:37,700
Uh,

61
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,370
it's also another side
consequence of this.

62
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,743
Sorry.

63
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:42,500
Yeah,

64
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:42,950
it was,

65
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,101
oh,

66
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:43,491
excellent.

67
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:43,740
Yes.

68
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,573
Ascott

69
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,221
v okay.

70
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:51,680
V Is the velocity that
something is traveling.

71
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,410
There's no escape philosophy
here at the moment.

72
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,633
Um,

73
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,160
there are all kinds of
different V's floating around,

74
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:59,470
so it's important to keep them straight.

75
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,150
Yeah.

76
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,481
Can't,

77
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:05,320
you can't go faster than
the speed of light aside.

78
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,290
A comment from this is that photons,

79
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,360
particles of light,

80
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:13,270
which obviously by definition
do go at the speed of light,

81
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,950
have to have a zero rest mass.

82
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,020
Uh,

83
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,340
because otherwise they'd have,

84
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,190
they'd end up having infinite
mass and infinite energy,

85
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:24,790
which isn't,

86
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,470
which isn't a physical.

87
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:27,090
So,

88
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,400
uh,

89
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,350
photons which go at the speed of light,

90
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,010
uh,

91
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,080
for which gamma is therefore infinite,

92
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,250
have to have em,

93
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:33,671
this,

94
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,220
this little m zero here equal to zero.

95
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,850
So you have zero times infinity
and that can equal a finite number.

96
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:41,260
Otherwise they'd have infinite,

97
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,520
uh,

98
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:42,910
energy.

99
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,743
Yes.

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,640
If we're talking about
the wow factor or like

101
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,240
at the moment what I'm talking
about is velocity as a,

102
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,350
uh,

103
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,161
as a speed.

104
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:56,290
So I'm talking about the
magnitude of the velocity.

105
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,650
And you can tell actually that that's
the case because it comes in as the,

106
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,120
as the velocity squared.

107
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,710
So even if it's a vector,

108
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,640
when you square it,

109
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:05,050
that gives you a scalar quantity.

110
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,313
Okay.

111
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,260
So let me go on from,

112
00:04:12,261 --> 00:04:13,930
from here and uh,

113
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,740
talk about an intermediate case.

114
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:17,600
We've talked about V equals zero.

115
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,720
We've talked about vehic.

116
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:19,554
We'll see.

117
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:19,910
Uh,

118
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,530
let me talk about an intermediate case
and the particular intermediate case,

119
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:26,450
and this'll show up on your problem set.

120
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:28,880
This is the thing we
didn't get to on Thursday,

121
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,973
uh,

122
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,220
is what's called the post
Newtonian approximation.

123
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,713
Yeah.

124
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,410
This is when you're just a
tiny little bit relativistic.

125
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,680
So v oversee or more properly v squared
over c squared is small but not zero.

126
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,090
And here a little mathematical concept
that may have flashed before your eyes

127
00:04:59,311 --> 00:05:02,190
when you were in 11th grade
or something comes in,

128
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:03,700
which is the series expansion.

129
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,110
Uh,

130
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,210
we won't do the mathematics of this,

131
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:06,480
but,

132
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,313
but here it is,

133
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,280
uh,

134
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,430
if you take one plus epsilon,

135
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,550
and I should say epsilon is a,

136
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:14,681
uh,

137
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:17,610
used by mathematicians
to mean something small,

138
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,060
famous mathematician named Erdish
used to refer to children as epsilons.

139
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,570
Uh,

140
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,790
that seems to be carrying
it a little bit too far.

141
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:28,630
Uh,

142
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,081
but,

143
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:29,261
uh,

144
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:30,970
this is how mathematicians think.

145
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,140
So epsilon,

146
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:32,974
in this case,

147
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,510
it is something that's much,

148
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:36,510
much less than one a.

149
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,500
And if you take one plus epsilon,

150
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:41,110
so that's a number that's
slightly greater than one.

151
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:42,370
Uh,

152
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,240
and uh,

153
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:44,460
you take it to the anthropology,

154
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,240
you can then expand this,

155
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:46,820
uh,

156
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,970
as a series and the series goes like this,

157
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,150
one plus n times epsilon
plus a bunch of other terms,

158
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,040
each of which is multiplied
by a higher power of epsilon.

159
00:05:58,041 --> 00:06:02,840
So there's a term in epsilon squared and
there's a terminal epsilon cube and so

160
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:03,320
forth.

161
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,790
And this is an infinite series.

162
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,673
Uh,

163
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,970
but the thing is if epsilon small
than epsilon squared is even smaller.

164
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:15,020
So if Epsilon's already small and,

165
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,490
and times epsilon is pretty small,

166
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:21,190
then epsilon squared is far smaller
than that epsilon cube yet smaller and

167
00:06:21,191 --> 00:06:21,710
these,

168
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,050
uh,

169
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:22,900
are negligible.

170
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,150
And so the approximation is

171
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,240
okay.

172
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,240
One plus epsilon to the nth power is
approximately equal to one plus an epsilon

173
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,550
if epsilon is much,

174
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:39,510
much less than one.

175
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,443
Okay.

176
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,910
So here's what we're going to do.

177
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,950
We're going to use this series
expansion and we're going to generate a

178
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,130
expressions for some things
in particular the mass,

179
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:57,131
but some other things too where the
one is the Newtonian term and the thing

180
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:00,140
represented by this and epsilon,

181
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:05,090
which is much smaller is a correction
to the Newtonian term and is the first

182
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,520
sign that things are
becoming relativistic.

183
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,060
So this is in this context going to be
a Newtonian term and this is the post

184
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,910
knew Tony and

185
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,500
approximation.

186
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,303
Okay.

187
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,240
Uh,

188
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,600
oh.

189
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,290
So let's,

190
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:25,530
uh,

191
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,760
let's just do an example.

192
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:27,843
Um,

193
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,220
uh,

194
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,590
let's,

195
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,000
uh,

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,800
let's think about the motion of the earth,

197
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,150
the Earth's orbit around
the Sun Earth orbit.

198
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,631
Uh,

199
00:07:36,631 --> 00:07:40,830
you may recall from the last section of
the class how fast the earth moves to

200
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:43,860
about three times 10 to
the four meters per second,

201
00:07:43,861 --> 00:07:45,390
30 kilometers a second.

202
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,153
Hey,

203
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,960
the speed of light is three times
10 to the eight meters per second.

204
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,231
Uh,

205
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:55,250
and so,

206
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,203
uh,

207
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:01,450
v squared oversee squared is equal
to three times 10 to the four,

208
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,830
over three times 10 to the eight
squared is 10 to the minus eight.

209
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,990
And so that quantity,

210
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,590
which is going to turn out to be the post
Newtonian effect is one part intentive

211
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,120
the eight for the Earth's orbit.

212
00:08:20,121 --> 00:08:22,490
And so pretty small considering,

213
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:22,880
uh,

214
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,830
that we think that nine is equal to 10.

215
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:25,970
Uh,

216
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:29,360
something in the eighth decimal place
isn't going to do a lot of damage,

217
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:31,850
so it's not a particularly relativistic,

218
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:32,570
uh,

219
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,403
situation.

220
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,210
All right,

221
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:37,640
so now I want to go back and I want,

222
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:38,451
that's just an aside.

223
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:43,310
I want to go back and apply
this approximation to gamma.

224
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,890
Gamma is equal to one
over one minus V squared.

225
00:08:48,891 --> 00:08:49,760
Oversee squared,

226
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:51,650
the whole thing to the one half power,

227
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,100
that one minus v squared over
square to the minus one half power.

228
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,210
I got to get a better pen.

229
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,170
Sorry about that.

230
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:03,041
Uh,

231
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:04,600
and now this can be expanded.

232
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,090
This can be expanded in
just this kind of way.

233
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,350
Uh,

234
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,730
the first term is one,

235
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:10,660
uh,

236
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,120
Epsilon is minus v squared,

237
00:09:13,121 --> 00:09:14,110
oversee squared.

238
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,730
N is minus a half minus
times a minus is a positive.

239
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,760
So this is plus one half v squared
over c squared plus additional terms,

240
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:27,970
the first of which is v squared.

241
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,130
Over c squared squared,

242
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,920
which in the case of the earth
would be 10 to the minus 16.

243
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:35,650
So it would be a vastly smaller still.

244
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:36,670
So we ignore that.

245
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,463
Okay.

246
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,440
And so that,

247
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:40,751
uh,

248
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:43,870
and so you can substitute this for gamma,

249
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,421
uh,

250
00:09:44,421 --> 00:09:46,600
in situations where v is kind of small.

251
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,090
For example,

252
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,420
let's go back to this mass.

253
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,813
Uh,

254
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:54,970
equation.

255
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,740
One plus one,

256
00:10:02,741 --> 00:10:04,120
half v squared.

257
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,320
Oversee Square.

258
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,570
This is the total mass.

259
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:07,990
Now,

260
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,201
oh,

261
00:10:08,201 --> 00:10:09,880
let's separate these terms out.

262
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,170
M Zero,

263
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:12,730
that's the Newtonian term.

264
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,840
And now here's a post
Newtonian approximation,

265
00:10:16,841 --> 00:10:21,250
one half m Zero v squared
divided by c square.

266
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,663
Okay.

267
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,080
High school physics experts.

268
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:30,940
Do you recognize this term?

269
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,850
Kinetic energy?

270
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,440
Absolutely right?

271
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,320
This is from high school physics.

272
00:10:38,321 --> 00:10:40,060
The kinetic energy.

273
00:10:40,061 --> 00:10:41,710
That is to say the energy,

274
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,430
uh,

275
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:45,220
in the motion of this object.

276
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,110
So what is this whole term?

277
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,870
This whole term is the kinetic energy.

278
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:56,070
So M is equal to the Newtonian rest mass
plus the kinetic energy divided by c

279
00:10:57,581 --> 00:10:58,414
squared.

280
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:59,051
Now,

281
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:02,830
you'll recall that he oversee
squared is equal to an,

282
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,770
so this is the mass equivalent,

283
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:07,843
okay.

284
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,140
Of the kinetic energy.

285
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,210
So given this nice relativistic idea
that mass and energy are interchangeable.

286
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,380
Well here it is.

287
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,530
Here's the kinetic energy
expressed in terms of mass.

288
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,430
Uh,

289
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:27,430
and so this little equation and
equals am not gamma has a variety of

290
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:30,110
consequences.

291
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:34,760
When v Oversea v squared oversee
squared really goes to zero,

292
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,830
then it's just Newton.

293
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,780
It just says mass equals mass.

294
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,260
Uh,

295
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,490
because gamma is equal to two one and
that expresses an important Newtonian

296
00:11:43,491 --> 00:11:47,660
concept that the mass of something is
an intrinsic property of that object,

297
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,130
which doesn't change,

298
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,200
which is how things are in Newton,

299
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:53,150
but not how things are relativistically.

300
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:53,710
Uh,

301
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:58,660
in the other extreme where v squared
over c squared approaches one,

302
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:01,480
this equation expresses
the fact that light,

303
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,883
uh,

304
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,230
the speed of light as
this is the speed limit.

305
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:13,550
And in the Post Newtonian case where V
squared over ski squared is small but not

306
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:14,384
zero,

307
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,280
this is same expression,

308
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,890
expresses the fact that equals MC squared.

309
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,000
Yeah.

310
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,170
So all three of these concepts
come out of the same equation.

311
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,130
It's this kind of thing,

312
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,850
uh,

313
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:33,330
that makes physicists say things like,

314
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,050
uh,

315
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,160
the theory of relativity.

316
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:36,630
It's incredibly beautiful.

317
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,953
Uh,

318
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,180
it's hard to know.

319
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,430
I realize it's hard to
know what that means.

320
00:12:41,431 --> 00:12:41,701
You know,

321
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:43,800
what makes a piece of
mathematics beautiful.

322
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,400
Uh,

323
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,400
and it's kind of when you get a situation
like this where a simple mathematical

324
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:53,670
concept sort of spawns all kinds
of new and unexpected ideas,

325
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:57,720
depending on how you look at it and that
they all kind of come together as one.

326
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,360
I have this vivid memory
in graduate school.

327
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,250
I was sitting in a class,

328
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,611
you know,

329
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:04,800
and the professor was doing
the thing that professors do.

330
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:07,530
He was writing down all kinds of
miscellaneous information really,

331
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:08,364
really fast,

332
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:08,880
uh,

333
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,480
from,

334
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:09,930
uh,

335
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:11,880
relativity theory and nuclear physics.

336
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:13,650
All sorts of stuff was
going up on the board.

337
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,430
I was doing the thing that students do
where you desperately try and write it

338
00:13:17,431 --> 00:13:20,160
all down so that you can then go back
and figure out what the hell he was

339
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:21,210
talking about later.

340
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,170
Uh,

341
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:25,860
and suddenly in the midst of
this rather typical class,

342
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:26,700
uh,

343
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,110
I realized what was happening that in
about 20 minutes he was going to put all

344
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,180
this stuff together and prove Chandra,

345
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:33,961
say cars limit.

346
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:37,020
We talked about Chandra
cars limit a week or so ago.

347
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:41,910
That's the limit whereby a white dwarf
can't be bigger than 1.4 times the mass

348
00:13:41,911 --> 00:13:44,190
of the sun or it continues to collapse.

349
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,220
And I suddenly saw where
all this was going.

350
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:49,500
I sort of wrote down in my notebook,

351
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:54,300
Chandra and underlined it and put my
pencil down and then I just watched for 20

352
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:54,690
minutes.

353
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,530
It was great.

354
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,260
It was the only thing
I can compare it to is,

355
00:13:58,261 --> 00:13:58,590
is,

356
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,580
is listening to,

357
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:04,020
to a great piece of music because it
kind of unfolds in time and you see where

358
00:14:04,021 --> 00:14:04,880
it's going and,

359
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:06,120
and it's just a great feeling.

360
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:06,630
So,

361
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,080
uh,

362
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,080
don't be condescending to the physics
majors when they're working like hell on

363
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:16,560
those problem sets late on a Thursday
night because they have access to realms

364
00:14:16,561 --> 00:14:17,850
of aesthetic experience,

365
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,250
uh,

366
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,380
that you can only imagine.

367
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,663
Uh,

368
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,860
but perhaps it's true.

369
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,460
It's true.

370
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,293
I promise.

371
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,050
Uh,

372
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,900
but you have to work hard to
get there and ask questions.

373
00:14:27,901 --> 00:14:28,650
And so,

374
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,011
uh,

375
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:29,731
at this point,

376
00:14:29,731 --> 00:14:31,260
let's do the question thing.

377
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,220
Uh,

378
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:37,170
here's what I'd like to do a
talk to the people around you.

379
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,270
Introduce yourself to
the people around you.

380
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:40,110
Groups of two,

381
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:41,940
three or four will do fine.

382
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:42,720
Uh,

383
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,470
and uh,

384
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,330
come up in consultation with your
neighbors with a question to ask.

385
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:48,481
Now,

386
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:51,950
this could either be a
question of something that
you guys don't about what I've

387
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:56,150
said or something where
the question if answered,

388
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,870
would deepen your understanding
beyond what I've said.

389
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,460
So take a couple minutes,

390
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:01,940
uh,

391
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,960
talk to your neighbors,

392
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:03,830
make a friend,

393
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,200
think of a question and,

394
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:06,411
uh,

395
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:09,120
in a couple minutes time
we'll regroup and a,

396
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,230
I'll answer some of the questions if
you're particular question doesn't end up

397
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:13,040
being answered,

398
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,460
you know,

399
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,700
handed in at the end so that I
know what you were thinking of.

400
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,540
Uh,

401
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,171
and uh,

402
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:19,730
and so definitely write them down.

403
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,361
Uh,

404
00:15:20,361 --> 00:15:20,931
and we'll,

405
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:21,171
we'll,

406
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:22,010
we'll try this out.

407
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:22,521
Let's see.

408
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:23,540
Let's see how this goes.

409
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,460
So introduce yourself to your neighbors,

410
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:25,840
uh,

411
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,990
and come up with a question.

412
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,060
And when you have it,

413
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,210
put your hand up and ask it
will come around and ask.

414
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,520
All right,

415
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,650
I've now heard the same question twice.

416
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:37,190
Uh,

417
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,180
so let me answer it and then we'll,

418
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:39,880
uh,

419
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,400
uh,

420
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,390
ask for other things.

421
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,630
The same question which has been asked
in a couple of different ways is what is

422
00:15:46,941 --> 00:15:47,774
mass?

423
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,590
That's an excellent question because it's
awfully hard to parse what's going on,

424
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,530
uh,

425
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:59,060
with this m nod and this other kind of
m and stuff if you don't know what the

426
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:00,080
concept means.

427
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:00,831
So that's a,

428
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:02,060
that's a really good question.

429
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,480
What mass mass is defined.

430
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,860
You can think of it this way.

431
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,100
What is mass?

432
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,813
Uh,

433
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,100
mass is defined as from this
equation in a certain sense.

434
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,900
F equals m a,

435
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:28,140
it tells you for a given object how
hard it is to move or more precisely how

436
00:16:29,471 --> 00:16:31,060
hard it is to accelerate.

437
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,340
So higher mass,

438
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,383
okay.

439
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,290
Requires greater force

440
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,823
to,

441
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,310
uh,

442
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,050
accelerate by a certain amount.

443
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,243
It

444
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,220
a property of an object and it tells
you how much it resists being pushed

445
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,054
around.

446
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:54,660
Uh,

447
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,170
it's sometimes referred
to as inertial mass.

448
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,460
For this reason,

449
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:02,470
it's,

450
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:02,660
it's,

451
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,180
it's an expression of
the object's inertia,

452
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:07,700
how much it resists being accelerated.

453
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:08,840
Uh,

454
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,700
and so in Newtonian physics,

455
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,670
this is purely a property
of the object itself.

456
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,713
You can say,

457
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:14,970
uh,

458
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:19,790
if you've got a basketball or if you
got a car or something that the car has

459
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:21,650
more mass than the basketball.

460
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,490
Why?

461
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,040
Because if I go to,

462
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:24,910
I have a basketball,

463
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,580
I don't,

464
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,190
uh,

465
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:26,660
alright.

466
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,310
Car a car has the lectern
has more mass than the,

467
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,480
uh,

468
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,520
than the little piece of cardboard here.

469
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,200
Cause if I apply force to the cardboard,

470
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:37,034
I can move it.

471
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,220
And if I apply the same amount of force
to the lecture and I move it a whole lot

472
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:41,054
less.

473
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,030
And so what is the difference
between those two things?

474
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,590
Since the force applied is the same.

475
00:17:45,591 --> 00:17:47,900
The difference is that this
one has a whole lot more mass.

476
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,310
And in Newtonian physics,

477
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:52,860
the mass is a property of the object.

478
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,590
In Einsteinian physics,

479
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,210
there is something that's the property
of the object that it's rest mass.

480
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,860
But the inertial mass,

481
00:18:01,861 --> 00:18:05,880
the amount by which it resists
being pushed is also a property,

482
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,440
not just of the rest mass,

483
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:08,640
but also if it's motion.

484
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,570
So that if this thing were moving at a
large fraction of the speed of light and

485
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:13,404
I applied,

486
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:13,830
uh,

487
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,120
some kind of forced to it,

488
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:18,090
it wouldn't move nearly
as much as it does.

489
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:18,451
Oh,

490
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:21,570
it wouldn't change it's motion nearly
as much as it does when it's standing

491
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:22,404
still.

492
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:23,783
And so,

493
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,793
uh,

494
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,440
uh,

495
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,440
mass is the inertial mass of the thing
varies depending on how fast it's moving.

496
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,060
So that's uh,

497
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:33,690
uh,

498
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,820
that's an important question,

499
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,390
uh,

500
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,530
for understanding this.

501
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,603
Uh,

502
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,600
let's see.

503
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,433
Yes.

504
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,600
Um,

505
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,050
so does that mean that your
honor scanning in motion,

506
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,460
you're going to have
the same effect on it?

507
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:46,801
No,

508
00:18:46,801 --> 00:18:50,910
you're not going to have the same effect
on it because if the object in motion

509
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,490
is going to have a little
extra piece to its mass.

510
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,243
Okay.

511
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,981
Very,

512
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:56,880
very small effect.

513
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:57,540
In fact,

514
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,700
if you try this on the earth itself,

515
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:01,770
which is moving at 30 kilometers a second,

516
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,410
that effect is going to be
one part in 10 to the eight.

517
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,870
So that's what we
calculated before where we,

518
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,723
uh,

519
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,623
where was it?

520
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,633
Uh,

521
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,880
yeah.

522
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,713
Here it is.

523
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,730
That's this purple part here.

524
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,130
You Calculate v squared over c squared.

525
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:21,540
That's 10 to the minus eight.

526
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,370
So it's a different,

527
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,670
if something moving even as
fast as 30 kilometers a second,

528
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:27,660
which is pretty fast,

529
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,920
this difference is only going to be
actually one half of one part in 10 to the

530
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:32,600
eight.

531
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:32,760
Uh,

532
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,720
so it's,

533
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,140
uh,

534
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,520
it's a hard thing to see.

535
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:40,550
Now the place you can see this stuff is
in particle accelerators because there

536
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:45,210
you can take subatomic particles and
accelerate them to very close to the speed

537
00:19:45,211 --> 00:19:48,240
of light and then you see
these very dramatic effect.

538
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:50,963
Yes,

539
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,163
yes,

540
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,123
yes,

541
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,023
that's correct.

542
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,840
You cannot stop something that's going
at the speed of light because the force

543
00:20:04,841 --> 00:20:06,250
you'd need to accelerate it,

544
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:10,150
which could either be making it
faster or slower would be infinite.

545
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:10,840
Uh,

546
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:15,840
but that's why photons don't
have any rest mass at all.

547
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,200
That statement that you made only
applies to something which has none,

548
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:20,860
zero,

549
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,450
greater than zero rest mass,

550
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,330
and they never go to the
speed of light could,

551
00:20:25,331 --> 00:20:26,710
you can't get them that fast.

552
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,340
You need an infinite amount of
force to get it to go that fast.

553
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,140
Photons are a different story.

554
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,150
And of course if you stop a photon,

555
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:37,690
it disappears because if it's
going less than the speed of light,

556
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:42,190
then it's got no energy because it's
a finite gamma times zero rest mass.

557
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,493
Yes.

558
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,393
All right.

559
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,220
The weird time stuff

560
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,170
you always hear about.

561
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,103
Excellent.

562
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,740
Uh,

563
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,190
yeah.

564
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,580
Okay.

565
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,140
A couple of other Lawrence transformations
time is equal to gamma times,

566
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:57,790
times zero a,

567
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,290
this is time dilation.

568
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,000
The faster you go,

569
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,210
the slower your clock works.

570
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,590
This is the origin of all that nice
science fiction where you get on a rocket

571
00:21:08,591 --> 00:21:08,801
ship,

572
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,120
you go close to the speed of light,

573
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:10,781
it go somewhere,

574
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:11,400
your turnaround,

575
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,233
you've come back.

576
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:12,880
Uh,

577
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,920
your clocks are running slow,

578
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:18,040
so it only takes a year and
your time and you come back in.

579
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:18,551
Everybody,

580
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:18,731
you know,

581
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:19,990
it's a hundred years have passed,

582
00:21:19,991 --> 00:21:21,460
all your friends are dead and so forth.

583
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:21,930
Uh,

584
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,480
so that's a whole science fiction thing.

585
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,070
There's also lake contraction
that looks like this.

586
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,363
Uh,

587
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,673
take the pen,

588
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,570
put it in motion,

589
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,100
uh,

590
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,190
make that motion at some substantial
fraction of the speed of light.

591
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,063
It gets shorter.

592
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,033
Amazing.

593
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,023
Uh,

594
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,450
we'll talk more about
this in a little while.

595
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:49,960
Okay.

596
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,280
Yeah,

597
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,470
yeah,

598
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,770
yeah.

599
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:52,000
These are these,

600
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,040
these things with the gamma's in them.

601
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,490
They're collectively known as
the Lorentz transformations.

602
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,611
Uh,

603
00:21:58,611 --> 00:21:59,740
that's just a name.

604
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,053
Uh,

605
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,073
and,

606
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,713
okay.

607
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:10,350
And these are the ways in
which basic properties,

608
00:22:10,351 --> 00:22:12,990
space time mass change,

609
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:13,530
uh,

610
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,363
with philosophy.

611
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,240
Yeah.

612
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,240
So with the equation equals m not get
times gamma am not if the intrinsic math,

613
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,350
yes.

614
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:26,681
No,

615
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:26,861
no,

616
00:22:26,861 --> 00:22:27,320
no.

617
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,210
M M not,

618
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,073
yes.

619
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,250
Let me think.

620
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:30,731
Am Not,

621
00:22:30,731 --> 00:22:33,850
is the intrinsic mass
m is the inertial mass.

622
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:34,810
Okay.

623
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,240
That's a way of thinking about it.

624
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:41,260
So if something's traveling at a very
small would mean that B squared overseas

625
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,020
guard was close to zero.

626
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:45,470
Yes.

627
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,690
Which means that the inertial
mass be close to them.

628
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,813
No.

629
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:49,683
Uh,

630
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,850
if it goes,

631
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,010
so you were right up to the very end.

632
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:55,600
Remember how this works.

633
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,860
Gamma is equal to one over the
square root of one minus p squared.

634
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:00,730
Oversee squid.

635
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:03,130
If v oversee goes to zero,

636
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,450
gamma goes to one.

637
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,040
And in that case,

638
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:11,041
the inertial mass is equal
to the intrinsic mass.

639
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,163
Okay.

640
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,650
And if it's going faster than the
inertial mass is bigger than the intrinsic

641
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:17,860
mass,

642
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,800
the intrinsic mass is usually
referred to as the rest mass.

643
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,250
Ah,

644
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,280
that's the second term
of the series expansion.

645
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:33,510
One over one minus V squared overseas
squared to the one half power expands to

646
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:39,520
be one plus one half v squared.

647
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:41,380
Oversee squared plus other terms.

648
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,030
Here's the first term,

649
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:47,660
that's the rest mass because we're going
to multiply this by amp and this is

650
00:23:47,661 --> 00:23:52,661
then the kinetic energy
divided by c square.

651
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,520
It's the second term.

652
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,760
Uh,

653
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,150
yeah,

654
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,650
the rest mass doesn't change.

655
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,870
If v squared over c squared goes to zero,

656
00:24:02,871 --> 00:24:05,060
what happens is the kinetic
energy goes to zero,

657
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,680
which is exactly what you want it to do.

658
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,200
Yes.

659
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,033
Um,

660
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,820
how does,

661
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,653
uh,

662
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,733
how has momentum,

663
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,520
how has momentum could serve
when something's relativistic?

664
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,540
Excellent.

665
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:22,240
There is an equation of
relativistic momentum,

666
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,320
uh,

667
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,090
and it's that thing that's conserved,

668
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,240
which is different from am times times
ve because ve behaves differently and m

669
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:36,670
behaves differently and you can work
out exactly where all the gamma's go in

670
00:24:36,671 --> 00:24:36,971
that.

671
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:38,890
And I don't remember it
off the top of my head,

672
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:41,590
but there is a quantity that is conserved,

673
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,970
but it doesn't look quite the same as
the new Tony and quantity in the limit

674
00:24:45,971 --> 00:24:47,920
where the velocity is small,

675
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:52,690
it reduces down the first term
of that series is m times v.

676
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,780
Oh yeah.

677
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:55,943
Yes sir.

678
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,113
Would you define

679
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,233
acceleration?

680
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,020
How then do you define for us?

681
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,410
Yeah.

682
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:03,711
Okay.

683
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:04,670
So this gets a little,

684
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,110
this gets a little bit circular,

685
00:25:06,111 --> 00:25:06,650
right?

686
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,483
Uh,

687
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,481
okay.

688
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:09,470
Force force,

689
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,360
you can define it either way.

690
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:15,170
Forces the thing that it
forces the ability to do work.

691
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,060
That's the technical definition.

692
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,403
Uh,

693
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,860
force ability,

694
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,610
uh,

695
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,460
to do work.

696
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,790
And then work also has
a technical definition.

697
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:32,450
The problem with these things is you
kind of do act in term if you're just

698
00:25:32,451 --> 00:25:33,980
defined them all the
way around the circle,

699
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:36,580
they do tend to come back and
bite themselves in detail.

700
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,060
Uh,

701
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:37,970
I agree with that.

702
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:38,720
Uh,

703
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,200
but,

704
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,790
uh,

705
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,623
uh,

706
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:41,970
uh,

707
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,910
forces also related to energy.

708
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,270
You know,

709
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,940
how much energy is required
to exert a certain force.

710
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:47,774
So all these things,

711
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,340
all these things interrelate.

712
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:49,820
Uh,

713
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,420
but it is definitely true that there's
a circularity to the definitions if you

714
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:54,680
follow them all the way around.

715
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,370
So if you keep asking
that kind of question,

716
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,660
I'm going to go around until I
get back where I started from.

717
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,603
Yes.

718
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:12,410
Why is the speed of like constant in all
frames of reference that's problem to,

719
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:13,430
of your problem set?

720
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:14,720
Uh,

721
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,770
and uh,

722
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,281
I'll come,

723
00:26:16,281 --> 00:26:16,521
I'll,

724
00:26:16,521 --> 00:26:17,354
I'll say a few.

725
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,310
That's an insufficient answer,

726
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:20,120
but I'll,

727
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,421
uh,

728
00:26:20,421 --> 00:26:22,910
I'll come back and say a little
bit more about that in a minute.

729
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,080
Uh,

730
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,913
yes.

731
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,550
Um,

732
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,890
we were just a little bit confused
with the original transformation,

733
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,920
how in most cases that
transforms to equals MC squared.

734
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,510
Um,

735
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,120
could you show that?

736
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:36,660
Yeah.

737
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,000
So let's go back and take
another look at that.

738
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,050
All right.

739
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,460
So here's what I'm going to do.

740
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:48,151
First of all,

741
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:52,830
I'm going to take gamma this
quantity and I'm going to expand it.

742
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,830
This is equal to gamma and
now I'm going to expand it.

743
00:26:55,831 --> 00:26:59,490
That gives me one plus a half
p squared overseas quick.

744
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,013
Um,

745
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,301
let's see.

746
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:04,780
What have I done with my,

747
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:05,540
uh,

748
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,800
the pieces of paper are
getting out of order here.

749
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:08,760
Ah,

750
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,593
here it is.

751
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,910
So inertial mass is equal to
the rest mass times gamma.

752
00:27:14,911 --> 00:27:18,120
So now I'm going to substitute
in this approximation for gamma.

753
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,380
And then I'm going to multiply
m zero through both terms.

754
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,430
So this is,

755
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,110
so the inertial mass is equal to the
Newtonian mass plus a term that looks like

756
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:28,944
this.

757
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,843
Uh,

758
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,410
m one half MV squared is in,

759
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,410
uh,

760
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,300
in Newtonian terms of the
kinetic energy and I and it,

761
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,580
and it appears here divided by c squared.

762
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,860
And so a way you can write this is that
the inertial mass is equal to the rest

763
00:27:46,861 --> 00:27:51,861
mass plus the Connecticut can the
kinetic energy divided by c squared.

764
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:57,680
And that is an example of the fact that
energy divided by c squared is an ex,

765
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,230
is another way of expressing mass.

766
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:06,780
Why?

767
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,740
Why is it not a prominent energy overseas
and literally Algebraic that Rbm am

768
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,593
not,

769
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,220
oh,

770
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,050
which am are you talking about?

771
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,660
Yeah,

772
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,080
yeah,

773
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,420
yeah.

774
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:20,290
It's not here and it's em over here.

775
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,020
And so if somebody asks,

776
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,600
actually you're the now the second
person who's asked this question.

777
00:28:25,601 --> 00:28:27,220
So I better answer it explicitly.

778
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:27,990
Uh,

779
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,650
W I answered the question,

780
00:28:29,651 --> 00:28:30,490
what is mass?

781
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,320
Uh,

782
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,200
what's energy?

783
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,303
Uh,

784
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:36,760
e equals m c squared.

785
00:28:36,761 --> 00:28:37,930
So what do I mean by this?

786
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,210
A M this is the,

787
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,170
uh,

788
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,490
inertial mass.

789
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:45,903
So,

790
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,863
uh,

791
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,210
that's m which is equal to,

792
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,201
in this case,

793
00:28:50,201 --> 00:28:52,990
Amnon plus kinetic energy,

794
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,730
oversee squared.

795
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,560
And notice the difference here,

796
00:28:56,561 --> 00:28:58,300
this is one kind of energy.

797
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:01,120
This is kinetic energy.

798
00:29:01,121 --> 00:29:03,190
That's the energy in,

799
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,393
uh,

800
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:06,820
that's the energy contained in the motion.

801
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:12,540
Another way you could write this
is the arrest energy over c square.

802
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:17,920
So He,

803
00:29:17,921 --> 00:29:22,921
here is the total energy and there are
two kinds of energies being expressed

804
00:29:23,081 --> 00:29:23,261
here.

805
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:28,261
There's a rest energy divided by c squared
and there's a kinetic energy divided

806
00:29:28,361 --> 00:29:29,081
by c squared.

807
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:31,900
But in the new Tony in case you think
of them as two completely different

808
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:32,500
things,

809
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,150
whereas in the relativistic case,

810
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,970
there do two manifestations
of the same thing.

811
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,130
And they add to make the inertial mass,

812
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,203
yes

813
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,800
today or a fraction of,

814
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,730
of see what something needs to
be traveling on earth for us to,

815
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,840
for there to be a perceptible.

816
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,070
Okay.

817
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:55,070
So how fast you have to go to have
a perceptible relativistic effect.

818
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,060
That depends how good your instrument are.

819
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,190
If you,

820
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,960
if you've got something
that can perceive a,

821
00:30:00,961 --> 00:30:05,850
that can measure a velocity or an energy
or a mass to eight decimal places,

822
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,830
then it doesn't have to go so fast.

823
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,930
If you have something that's a fairly
crude than it has to go much faster.

824
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:13,650
Uh,

825
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,900
but I should say special relativity,

826
00:30:15,901 --> 00:30:19,980
these Lorentz transformation have been
measured upside down and backwards in

827
00:30:19,981 --> 00:30:20,071
the,

828
00:30:20,071 --> 00:30:20,940
in the laboratory,

829
00:30:20,941 --> 00:30:22,110
this works too many,

830
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,400
many decimal places.

831
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,140
Uh,

832
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,420
uh,

833
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,350
here's an example.

834
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,190
If you take subatomic
particles that are unstable,

835
00:30:29,191 --> 00:30:29,970
that decay,

836
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,080
they have a half life.

837
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:33,600
So half of them will decay
in 10 seconds or something,

838
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:37,410
and you take those particles and you
accelerate them to a large fraction of the

839
00:30:37,411 --> 00:30:38,244
speed of light.

840
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,590
It takes much longer for them to decay.

841
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:41,760
Uh,

842
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,820
because they're going so
fast in their time clock,

843
00:30:44,821 --> 00:30:45,654
slow down.

844
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,120
A one manifestation of this is,

845
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,610
uh,

846
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:52,440
there is this kind of unstable particle
that's created at the top of the

847
00:30:52,441 --> 00:30:52,891
atmosphere.

848
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:54,180
These things are called nuance.

849
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,160
What happens is cosmic rays come in,

850
00:30:56,161 --> 00:30:57,690
they plast the top of the atmosphere.

851
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:59,040
They make these mew on things.

852
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,480
The mew ons propagate close to the
speed of light and they arrive at Earth.

853
00:31:03,481 --> 00:31:06,330
And you can measure if you have
a little [inaudible] detector,

854
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:07,800
nevermind what the heck have you on is.

855
00:31:07,801 --> 00:31:11,520
But imagine that you have something that
could detect it on earth and you see a

856
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:13,920
whole bunch of these things
caused by cosmic rays.

857
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:14,850
Uh,

858
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,900
but if you ask how long did it take them
to get from the top of the atmosphere

859
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:21,120
down to where your mew on detector is,

860
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:21,961
it's much,

861
00:31:21,961 --> 00:31:23,850
much longer than their decay time.

862
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:25,890
So you really shouldn't
see any of them at all.

863
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,180
But you do see them.

864
00:31:27,181 --> 00:31:29,670
And the reason is because they're
going a close to the speed of light.

865
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:30,690
Uh,

866
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:31,770
and so this is,

867
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,150
uh,

868
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:35,700
these effects are observed and measured.

869
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,850
Two great accuracy in,

870
00:31:37,851 --> 00:31:41,070
in the laboratory and in
astrophysical situations,

871
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,713
yes,

872
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,430
faster than the speed of light.

873
00:31:50,431 --> 00:31:50,570
Well,

874
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,130
you'd have,

875
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:51,470
uh,

876
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,410
you'd have super infinite mass.

877
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,191
Uh,

878
00:31:54,191 --> 00:31:54,941
this would be this,

879
00:31:54,941 --> 00:31:55,271
this,

880
00:31:55,271 --> 00:31:56,230
this would not be good.

881
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,413
Uh,

882
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:58,870
well,

883
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,260
okay,

884
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,280
so let us imagine what
the equations would,

885
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,143
would do.

886
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:04,491
What,

887
00:32:04,491 --> 00:32:07,060
what happened is as you go
faster than the speed of light,

888
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:09,760
if you try and slow down
toward the speed of light,

889
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,260
you'd have to have the same problem.

890
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:12,160
Uh,

891
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,800
that is to say would take you're
more and more effort to slow down,

892
00:32:14,801 --> 00:32:16,180
to close to the speed of light.

893
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,150
And the consequence of this is that
if you're fastened speed of light,

894
00:32:19,151 --> 00:32:22,370
you can't slow down to the speed of
light or slower than that height.

895
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,280
There are hypothetical particles.

896
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,320
This doesn't exist in the real world,

897
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:28,330
but they're hypothetical
particles that do this.

898
00:32:28,331 --> 00:32:29,500
These are called [inaudible].

899
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,430
Uh,

900
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:34,060
they have the odd effect that
they go backwards in time,

901
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:34,630
uh,

902
00:32:34,630 --> 00:32:35,261
because again,

903
00:32:35,261 --> 00:32:36,880
if you believe the equations,

904
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:37,983
uh,

905
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:40,910
right time dilation,

906
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,313
uh,

907
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:47,300
t equals gamma times t naught.

908
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:52,160
Now look at Gamma Square root of
one minus v squared over c square.

909
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,630
So this is awkward.

910
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:54,440
Uh,

911
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,240
if v is bigger than C,

912
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,660
this is a square root of a negative
number that becomes imaginary,

913
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,251
right?

914
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:03,470
Square root of n square
root of a negative number,

915
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,610
a hard to do.

916
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:05,090
Uh,

917
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,350
so this becomes imaginary.

918
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:09,680
So your time access becomes imaginary
and all sorts of very bad things start to

919
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:10,514
happen to you.

920
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:11,403
Uh,

921
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,313
yeah.

922
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,453
Yes.

923
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:16,150
So as your mass increases with philosophy,

924
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,320
the particle or the entity have
a greater gravitational effect.

925
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,000
Ah,

926
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,180
just to have a greater
gravitational effect.

927
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,680
Excellent question.

928
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,470
That's the next lecture.

929
00:33:27,471 --> 00:33:29,060
Cause that's general relativity.

930
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,120
And what you're doing is you're assuming
that Newtonian gravity is correct,

931
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:34,881
Newtonian,

932
00:33:34,881 --> 00:33:35,900
Newtonian gravity.

933
00:33:35,901 --> 00:33:38,720
Gravity is a force
proportional to the mass.

934
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,980
Turns out,

935
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,310
and this is one of the things that
led Einstein to his theory of general

936
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:44,144
relativity.

937
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,210
Turns out that relativistically it's that,

938
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:47,660
uh,

939
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,210
gravity should not be
thought of as a force at all.

940
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,471
Uh,

941
00:33:51,471 --> 00:33:53,630
and there's a whole different
way of thinking about it.

942
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:53,900
And,

943
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,490
and your question has to be in
a kind of Zahn sands unasked.

944
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,593
Uh,

945
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,261
we'll,

946
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:00,980
we'll get to that.

947
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,141
We,

948
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:01,370
we,

949
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:01,851
we will,

950
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:02,601
we will get to that.

951
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:03,850
But the point is that in,

952
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:05,240
in relativistic theory,

953
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,160
gravity is not a force anymore.

954
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:09,620
And so the question doesn't
arise in quite the same way.

955
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,053
Yes.

956
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,443
Sorry,

957
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,120
you were mentioning that energy here.

958
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,520
Total energy [inaudible] equal to

959
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:24,391
yeah,

960
00:34:24,391 --> 00:34:29,391
he is equal to m not oversee
squared plus k e yeah.

961
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,031
You have to put,

962
00:34:32,031 --> 00:34:34,000
you have to get the c
squared in the right place.

963
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,690
That's basically a unit
conversion overseas.

964
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,383
Uh,

965
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,583
no

966
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,850
is equal to uh,

967
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,253
uh,

968
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,270
c squared,

969
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,010
m not plus k.

970
00:34:49,011 --> 00:34:50,150
E.

971
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,090
Basically what I've done
is I've multiplied this
equation by csquared on both

972
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:53,924
sides.

973
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,683
Yes.

974
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,200
What,

975
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,033
what is,

976
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:08,870
what is,

977
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,490
what are the implications
for like what time is it?

978
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:13,711
Well,

979
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,720
this is the right,

980
00:35:15,721 --> 00:35:20,721
so what are the implications for what
time is this is the big stumbling block

981
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,120
from a philosophical point
of view to all of this stuff.

982
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:26,760
Turns out time isn't absolute.

983
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:27,660
Uh,

984
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,500
that is to say,

985
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,070
uh,

986
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,640
one has the feeling as we go
through our everyday life that,

987
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,210
you know,

988
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:37,050
my watch and your Ma Watch or kind of
measuring more or less the same thing.

989
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,610
The extent that there are accurate,

990
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,150
uh,

991
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:39,601
to do so.

992
00:35:39,601 --> 00:35:41,280
So if we have identical,

993
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:45,540
perfectly accurate watches and we go
about our daily life and come back,

994
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:48,300
they're going to read the same time at
the end if they read the same time at the

995
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:48,930
beginning,

996
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,630
because time moves the same
way for me as it does for you.

997
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,220
This turns out to be false.

998
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,340
And so time is not an absolute,

999
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,690
an absolute quantity.

1000
00:35:57,691 --> 00:35:58,441
Neither is,

1001
00:35:58,441 --> 00:35:59,970
neither is space for that matter,

1002
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:01,320
cause length changes also,

1003
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,220
uh,

1004
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,420
this is quite disturbing.

1005
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,111
Uh,

1006
00:36:04,111 --> 00:36:08,220
and the reason it's so disturbing to
us is our brains have evolved in a

1007
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:10,470
situation where we're
always moving really,

1008
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:13,110
really slowly compared
to the speed of light.

1009
00:36:13,111 --> 00:36:16,200
And therefore you don't have to worry
about this stuff in everyday life down to

1010
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:18,660
some factor of 10 to the minus 12.

1011
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:19,830
Uh,

1012
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,730
and uh,

1013
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,571
but nevertheless,

1014
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:23,130
it turns out to be true that time.

1015
00:36:23,131 --> 00:36:25,470
Time does not take off in an absolute way.

1016
00:36:25,471 --> 00:36:29,640
And this is why people get so freaked out
by this stuff because it seems counter

1017
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:31,020
to everyday experience.

1018
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,040
Uh,

1019
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,630
but it can be measured and,

1020
00:36:33,631 --> 00:36:34,500
and it turns out,

1021
00:36:34,501 --> 00:36:35,580
and it turns out to be true.

1022
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,500
So the Newtonian case,

1023
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,750
what we're used to in
the way our brains work,

1024
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:45,110
it turns out to be only an approximation
of the way things things really are.

1025
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,710
There are other things that are
conserved no matter how fast you go.

1026
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,480
And we can get to that at some,

1027
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,231
at some point,

1028
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:53,310
but time isn't one of them.

1029
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,443
Yes.

1030
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,010
Why is the speed of
light this magic number?

1031
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,113
Uh,

1032
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,590
okay.

1033
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:06,430
So,

1034
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,933
uh,

1035
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,690
the fact that there is a magic number,

1036
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,160
uh,

1037
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,160
comes out of this kind of equation because
when this quantity is equal to one,

1038
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,690
bad things start to happen
and all the equations blow up.

1039
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:30,080
The fact that it is the speed of light
that happens to be that in that equation

1040
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:32,010
is because light,

1041
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:32,850
uh,

1042
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,850
consists of particles with zero rest
mass and a particle at zero rest mass has

1043
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:43,560
to have this thing go to infinity
or it doesn't exist at all.

1044
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,383
Why?

1045
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:48,880
Why,

1046
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,241
why?

1047
00:37:49,241 --> 00:37:51,820
Why is the world this way that I know.

1048
00:37:51,821 --> 00:37:52,361
Seriously,

1049
00:37:52,361 --> 00:37:53,290
that's what you're asking.

1050
00:37:53,291 --> 00:37:54,310
And it's a good question.

1051
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,630
And I can't answer it.

1052
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:56,440
Uh,

1053
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:56,771
you know,

1054
00:37:56,771 --> 00:37:58,840
because this is where
physics turns into it.

1055
00:37:58,841 --> 00:37:59,351
Seriously.

1056
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:01,300
This is where physics turns into theology.

1057
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,380
Uh,

1058
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,030
you can't all the,

1059
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:06,940
all you can say from scientists
that this is the way it works.

1060
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,310
You can't answer the why question.

1061
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:10,450
Uh,

1062
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:13,660
you gotta talk to my colleagues in
some other department about that one.

1063
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,351
I'm sorry,

1064
00:38:14,351 --> 00:38:14,831
because it's,

1065
00:38:14,831 --> 00:38:18,130
it's the question one would
really like to know the answer to,

1066
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:18,710
right?

1067
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:18,970
Uh,

1068
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:19,990
but that one I can't,

1069
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:20,621
I can't,

1070
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:22,420
I can't cope with yes.

1071
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,240
Enters the black hole
across the event horizon.

1072
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,950
I've heard that oftentimes.

1073
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,093
Ah,

1074
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:34,870
okay.

1075
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:35,980
So the question

1076
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,520
is,

1077
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:36,940
uh,

1078
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,360
can like go into orbit around
a black hole basically.

1079
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:41,710
And the answer is yes,

1080
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:42,490
it can.

1081
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,010
And then the next part
of the question was,

1082
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:45,730
uh,

1083
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,130
how does that work if it
doesn't have any mass?

1084
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,130
You're asking the same question he did
over there because what keeps it in orbit

1085
00:38:52,131 --> 00:38:52,964
is gravity.

1086
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:57,280
And if you reject the view
that gravity is a force,

1087
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:01,120
then that question
doesn't become important.

1088
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:02,660
And,

1089
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,310
and we'll,

1090
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:03,761
as I say,

1091
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:04,960
we'll talk about that later.

1092
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,160
So that again is a question that pops up
because you're thinking of gravity is a

1093
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:09,994
force.

1094
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:12,843
Yes.

1095
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,230
Not to say why is it is why it is,

1096
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,073
but

1097
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,030
how is it derived?

1098
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,420
Ah,

1099
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,253
okay.

1100
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:21,520
Uh,

1101
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,353
so let me,

1102
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:22,670
uh,

1103
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,503
let me,

1104
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:23,990
uh,

1105
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:28,250
go on with the presentation in the last
couple of minutes of the class here.

1106
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,210
Here's,

1107
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:31,730
so let me ask your question
in a different way.

1108
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:35,090
Here's what a pro,

1109
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,130
why did Einstein think this up?

1110
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,870
What a crazy ass thing to do,

1111
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:39,650
right?

1112
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,221
Why not?

1113
00:39:40,221 --> 00:39:40,491
You know,

1114
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:43,310
there's little discrepancies
when things are moving at the,

1115
00:39:43,311 --> 00:39:44,180
at a high speeds,

1116
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:45,170
but who the heck cares?

1117
00:39:45,171 --> 00:39:46,760
It's hard to measure things at high speed.

1118
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,470
Why not just stick with Newton,

1119
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:50,960
which has done very well for
two and a half centuries.

1120
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,200
Here was the problem and
the late 19th century,

1121
00:39:54,201 --> 00:39:56,000
there were a whole series of experiments,

1122
00:39:56,330 --> 00:40:00,680
all of which one way or another
had the same consequence,

1123
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:02,090
namely that light.

1124
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,410
The speed of light,

1125
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,533
uh,

1126
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:11,610
is the same in all for all observers.

1127
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,773
Okay?

1128
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,320
Uh,

1129
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,210
that's extraordinarily weird.

1130
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,870
It's not obvious immediately
why that's so weird,

1131
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:24,261
but,

1132
00:40:24,261 --> 00:40:25,460
but let me try and explain it.

1133
00:40:25,461 --> 00:40:26,180
Here's,

1134
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,020
here's a guy,

1135
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:28,123
and uh,

1136
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,070
let's say he's a baseball
pitcher and he's throwing a ball.

1137
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,280
So here's the ball and it's
moving this way at some velocity,

1138
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:38,360
which we'll call v one and you're
down here or over here somewhere,

1139
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,440
it doesn't really matter.

1140
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:44,600
You're down here and you've got a radar
gun and you measure the velocity of that

1141
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,350
baseball.

1142
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,430
How fast is it going?

1143
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:46,940
Well,

1144
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:50,210
if he throws it at v one and
you're at rest with respect to him,

1145
00:40:50,211 --> 00:40:51,280
then you measure [inaudible].

1146
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:56,270
Now supposing we put our picture
on top of a moving train,

1147
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:57,980
all right?

1148
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,230
And the train is moving
at some other velocity.

1149
00:41:00,231 --> 00:41:01,064
V Two.

1150
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,333
Uh,

1151
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,150
so the guys on top of the train,

1152
00:41:06,151 --> 00:41:07,560
he throws it a hundred miles an hour.

1153
00:41:07,561 --> 00:41:09,630
The trains moving at a
hundred miles an hour.

1154
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,570
You're standing next to the
track with your radar gun,

1155
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,150
how fast you measure
that baseball to move.

1156
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:15,960
Well,

1157
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,670
you measure a total velocity,

1158
00:41:17,671 --> 00:41:22,671
which is the sum of the velocity of the
baseball with respect to the train and

1159
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,770
the train with respect to you.

1160
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:27,143
Okay,

1161
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,590
that seems pretty clear.

1162
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,060
But now supposing this guy,

1163
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,460
instead of throwing a baseball,

1164
00:41:34,461 --> 00:41:35,540
he's got a flashlight,

1165
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,090
so he's got some lights for us,

1166
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,780
some light source and the light is moving
at the speed of light because that's

1167
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:43,070
the speed that like moves.

1168
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:43,671
Uh,

1169
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:44,630
and uh,

1170
00:41:44,631 --> 00:41:48,290
and you've got sub device down here
which measures how fast that light moves

1171
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:53,291
along and he's standing at rest with you
and you measure the speed of light and

1172
00:41:53,541 --> 00:41:54,650
it comes out to be c,

1173
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,230
not surprisingly the same speed of light.

1174
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,760
Now let's put the guy on the train.

1175
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:02,420
Here he is moving at v two or any V.

1176
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:07,970
You would expect that the speed of light
that this guy measures down here would

1177
00:42:07,971 --> 00:42:09,800
be c Plus v two,

1178
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:10,910
right?

1179
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,480
Because it would be the speed of light
with respect from the flashlight with

1180
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:18,320
respect to the train plus the speed
of the train with respect to you,

1181
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:22,580
you would expect it to be
c Plus v two but it isn't.

1182
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,880
It's C v Total equals c not c Plus v two

1183
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,380
very weird.

1184
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,320
The speed of light is the same.

1185
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:40,070
No matter how fast you're
moving relative to the source.

1186
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,160
You could be moving at 99% of the speed
of light toward a light source and it

1187
00:42:45,921 --> 00:42:50,120
would not be coming at you at
1.99 times the speed of light.

1188
00:42:50,121 --> 00:42:52,610
It would be coming towards
you at the speed of light.

1189
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:57,230
You could have a friend who's standing
still and you would both measure the same

1190
00:42:57,231 --> 00:42:58,250
speed of that light,

1191
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,340
even though you're moving really
fast compared to your friends.

1192
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,930
Very strange.

1193
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,180
And there were a whole
series of experiments,

1194
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:05,600
uh,

1195
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,450
the most famous of which is something
called the Michelson Morley experiment,

1196
00:43:08,451 --> 00:43:12,620
which one way or another
demonstrated that this was the case,

1197
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,300
what to do.

1198
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:17,690
And what Einstein did was he said,

1199
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,710
hmm,

1200
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:20,983
okay.

1201
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:21,830
Uh,

1202
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:22,940
various things were tried,

1203
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:24,260
the experiments were wrong,

1204
00:43:24,261 --> 00:43:25,910
the equations were slightly screwy.

1205
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:26,720
Who knows?

1206
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:26,930
Uh,

1207
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:27,860
but I'd started talking,

1208
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,400
I'd stage great genius was to
take this seriously and to say,

1209
00:43:31,401 --> 00:43:31,910
okay,

1210
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:35,240
something is really screwed
up with philosophies.

1211
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,470
What is velocity?

1212
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,800
Velocity is space over time,

1213
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,930
miles per hour.

1214
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:46,310
Therefore,

1215
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,503
uh,

1216
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,960
so space and time are messed up when
you get close to the speed of light.

1217
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:56,221
Now,

1218
00:43:56,221 --> 00:43:56,730
of course,

1219
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,160
it also has to be true that
when you're going slowly,

1220
00:43:59,480 --> 00:43:59,790
uh,

1221
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:02,940
the original Newtonian result is recover.

1222
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,380
So this is your problem set.

1223
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:12,070
I have written down the relativistic
formula for the addition of velocities and

1224
00:44:12,951 --> 00:44:17,951
your problem set is going to be to use
that series expansion to demonstrate that

1225
00:44:18,081 --> 00:44:20,180
in the Newtonian limits you get this.

1226
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:22,220
And in the,

1227
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:22,750
uh,

1228
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:23,150
uh,

1229
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:26,870
limit where one or the other of those
velocities is the speed of light.

1230
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:27,650
Uh,

1231
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:28,483
you get this,

1232
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:30,440
uh,

1233
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:30,960
so,

1234
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,200
uh,

1235
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,330
you'll see the Algebra
is actually not so bad.

1236
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,110
Uh,

1237
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:39,110
and that's what prompted Einstein to go
on this whole rampage generating all of

1238
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:43,410
these gamma's and so forth
was the experimental evidence,

1239
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:44,370
uh,

1240
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:44,940
that,

1241
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:45,100
uh,

1242
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,280
there's a serious problem with velocities.

1243
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:48,630
Okay,

1244
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:49,260
we got to stop.
