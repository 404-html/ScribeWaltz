1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We've been talking about the type one
a supernova and the data that they

2
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:07,600
provide,

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,561
uh,

4
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:11,110
about the expansion and as it turns out,

5
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,790
acceleration of the universe.

6
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,350
And so one way to,

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:18,670
to summarize all that information
is that what we have found out.

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,190
We now know that,

9
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,083
uh,

10
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,020
the universe is accelerating,

11
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:27,790
not just expanding,

12
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:28,840
but accelerating.

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,560
And that acceleration comes about because
of some kind of dark energy or to turn

14
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:39,910
it around the label we give to whatever
is calling that is dark energy.

15
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,630
And,

16
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:40,990
uh,

17
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:44,110
this sometimes gets
summarized by this quantity,

18
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,250
uh,

19
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,030
which is the energy
density of the dark energy,

20
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:49,391
uh,

21
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:52,180
relative to the critical
density of the universe.

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:56,590
And the fact that it's accelerating
means that this quantity must be greater

23
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,450
than this other quantity,

24
00:00:58,451 --> 00:00:59,500
the density of matter,

25
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:01,570
cause the matter tends
to pull things together.

26
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,733
And so,

27
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,250
uh,

28
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,380
we know not only that it's accelerating,

29
00:01:05,381 --> 00:01:10,030
we know something about how much it is
accelerating and that tells us how much

30
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,170
bigger this,

31
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,163
uh,

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:12,581
uh,

33
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:15,190
the dark energy density is
than the matter density.

34
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:15,910
Uh,

35
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:20,910
and we kind of know by how much and
we kind of know how much bigger.

36
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:25,893
Uh,

37
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,680
yes,

38
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,880
he is the head,

39
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,573
uh,

40
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,913
the dark energy,

41
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,330
the dark matter density.

42
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,623
Um,

43
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,560
but somebody point,

44
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,040
somebody actually asked the question,

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,020
uh,

46
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,450
that,

47
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:38,751
you know,

48
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:39,471
I keep saying,

49
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:40,190
well,

50
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:40,670
uh,

51
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,630
this is like,

52
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,380
this is like three quarters
and this is like one quarter.

53
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,453
Uh,

54
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,080
if you add a bunch of manor,

55
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,270
couldn't you just add
a bunch of dark energy?

56
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,270
Also had an top,

57
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:52,580
uh,

58
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,470
with the same amount of acceleration.

59
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:56,900
So a comparable universe
and the answer's yes.

60
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:57,700
You could.

61
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:57,920
Uh,

62
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,920
there's nothing in the supernova data
that prohibits this from being 0.5 and

63
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:04,670
this from being one,

64
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,570
uh,

65
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,570
as long as this is sufficiently greater
than that by the amount necessary to

66
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:13,010
give rise to the observed acceleration.

67
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,520
And so if you plot these two
quantities against each other,

68
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,880
so here's a kind of zero,

69
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,021
zero.

70
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:25,400
Actually this can be negative,

71
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:26,234
but let's not,

72
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,830
let's not go there.

73
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,933
Uh,

74
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,953
one,

75
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,793
one,

76
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:31,663
uh,

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,950
what you find out is that,

78
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,083
uh,

79
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,120
there's a kind of a loud region
that's sort of looks like this.

80
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,563
Okay.

81
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,540
Allowed by the Supernova data.

82
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,430
Notice.

83
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,750
This is a,

84
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:51,350
I'm assuming throughout that the,

85
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,520
that the dark energy really
is the cosmological constant.

86
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm not thinking about the big rip
scenarios at the moment because that would

87
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:59,230
add a third dimension,

88
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,861
this plot.

89
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:01,180
And I don't want to do that just yet.

90
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,290
Um,

91
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,290
so assume this is all assuming the dark
energy is the cosmological constant,

92
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,450
but that's certainly a place to start.

93
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:14,620
There's no reason not to do that.

94
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,460
And so,

95
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:15,700
uh,

96
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,820
I've been kind of consistently claiming a,

97
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:21,790
as we've been talking about the course
that the real answer is somewhere like

98
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,624
here,

99
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,883
yeah.

100
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,620
That it's about 0.3 on the matter side,

101
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,630
0.25 and about three quarters,

102
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:29,141
two thirds,

103
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:31,420
three quarters on the dark energy side.

104
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,110
Uh,

105
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,100
but in fact,

106
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:33,934
you could go,

107
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:34,963
uh,

108
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,820
as far as the Supernova care,

109
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,780
you could have no matter at all and just
a little dark energy or you could have

110
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:45,280
a lot of matter and a huge amount of
dark energy and you'd get the same amount

111
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:48,610
of acceleration and therefore satisfy
the observational constraints.

112
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,711
But in fact,

113
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:52,330
it turns out we know more than this.

114
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,900
And,

115
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,170
uh,

116
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,700
because there are other constraints
on cosmology besides the supernovae.

117
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,980
And I have to tell you at this point that,

118
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,250
uh,

119
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,083
this course,

120
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,240
the way I've presented it is a little
bit lopsided because the other ways of

121
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:07,660
constraining,

122
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,260
uh,

123
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,770
these two quantities are just
as important as the supernovae.

124
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,810
And I'm going to do
them all in one lecture.

125
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,550
Uh,

126
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,580
and this is kind of in the spirit of the
philosophy of this course where we try

127
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:21,730
and understand a few things in
depth rather than many things,

128
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:22,420
uh,

129
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,260
in breadth.

130
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:23,590
But,

131
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,751
uh,

132
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:25,270
I'm going to talk about to,

133
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:25,990
uh,

134
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,890
to other,

135
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,280
uh,

136
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,710
kinds of constraints on cosmology today,

137
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,910
which are in fact justice important to
modern cosmology is the supernovae are,

138
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:35,350
I liked the supernovae first of all,

139
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:37,990
because they were the first
evidence of dark energy.

140
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,620
I still think they're the best
enter evidence of dark energy,

141
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:46,540
but it's also true that I think they're
in some ways the easiest to understand

142
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,440
that's not quite right.

143
00:04:47,441 --> 00:04:47,830
What it,

144
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:52,830
what I mean is that you don't need a whole
bunch of physics to understand what's

145
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:54,161
going on.

146
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:54,850
Cause it's just,

147
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,530
it's just expansion.

148
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,700
The expansion of the,

149
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:58,481
of the universe,

150
00:04:58,481 --> 00:04:59,920
whereas some of these other things,

151
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:00,320
uh,

152
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,270
as you will see,

153
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:01,850
uh,

154
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,840
there's a moment where
I'm going to have to say,

155
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:08,020
and then there's a whole bunch of
complicated physics and then you get the

156
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:08,500
result.

157
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,570
And so it's less satisfying to,

158
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,640
to teach and perhaps
to learn and of course,

159
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:12,850
like,

160
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,031
yes,

161
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:13,270
but,

162
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,520
but equally important
for modern cosmology.

163
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,930
And what that,

164
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,230
uh,

165
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:22,210
what these other things do is they
pick out where in the allowed region,

166
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,120
regional,

167
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,550
loud from the supernovae,

168
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,031
uh,

169
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:26,420
the real universe actually.

170
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:27,254
Yes.

171
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,300
Okay.

172
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:28,960
So,

173
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,350
uh,

174
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:33,640
with the understanding that either of
the two things I'm about to talk about,

175
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,540
could have been five weeks of this course.

176
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,670
Let's move in and I'll try and explain
in brief what these things tell us about

177
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:43,181
the universe.

178
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:45,670
The first is the cosmic
microwave background.

179
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,600
This we've encountered before,

180
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,350
uh,

181
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,820
this was one of the proofs that
the big bang really is the really,

182
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,150
as opposed to the steady state.

183
00:05:59,510 --> 00:05:59,930
And,

184
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,111
uh,

185
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:02,060
I don't know if you remember
what we said about that.

186
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,110
So let me remind you,

187
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,060
uh,

188
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,220
recall what was going on.

189
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,110
You're looking back in
time as you look far away.

190
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,640
So as you look back,

191
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,280
things are denser and hotter,

192
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,870
and if you look back far enough,

193
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,730
they get really hot.

194
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,390
Uh,

195
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,910
so let us imagine we're
looking at a red shift,

196
00:06:23,911 --> 00:06:27,390
not have one or 0.8 or
something like that,

197
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,430
but at a red shift of 3000,

198
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,260
uh,

199
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,230
so this is when the
universe was three 10,000.

200
00:06:34,231 --> 00:06:38,130
The scale factor of the university
3000 times smaller than it is today.

201
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,870
At that time,

202
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:40,650
uh,

203
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,760
the temperature,

204
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:47,020
the average temperature of the universe
about 10,000 degrees turns out that's an

205
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:52,170
interesting number because 10,000 degrees
is how hot it has to be for hydrogen

206
00:06:52,171 --> 00:06:53,040
to ionize.

207
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,840
Ionization,

208
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,920
you'll remember is when the electrons
disassociate with the protons and then you

209
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:03,160
just have a whole bunch of
charged particles moving around.

210
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,000
Uh,

211
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,410
and it turns out I,

212
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:06,910
so before that,

213
00:07:06,911 --> 00:07:08,500
when the temperature's higher than this,

214
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,370
you imagined that the entire universe
is basically filled with all this ionize

215
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:13,204
hydrogen.

216
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,450
Uh,

217
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:18,450
one of the features of ionized hydrogen
or deed charged particles generally is

218
00:07:18,461 --> 00:07:20,260
that they tend to be opaque.

219
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:23,110
Photons don't propagate
well through these things.

220
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:25,720
And photons propagate well
through neutral materials,

221
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:27,310
but not well through charge materials.

222
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,210
So,

223
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:28,990
uh,

224
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,270
before that,

225
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,920
the universe was opaque.

226
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,920
It's like looking at
the surface of a star.

227
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:40,510
Big Wall of opaque gas.

228
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:41,590
You can't see any further.

229
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,110
So I can't look back
any further than that.

230
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:44,770
Uh,

231
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,910
but if you look in any direction
and you're looking far enough away,

232
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:53,560
you want to see a big wall
of 10,000 degree hydrogen.

233
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,460
Uh,

234
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,181
and in fact,

235
00:07:55,181 --> 00:07:59,590
we know what a wall of 10,000 degree
hydrogen looks like because there are,

236
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,650
there are stars who
surfaces are 10,000 degrees.

237
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,480
Uh,

238
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,890
and the sun's a little a
little cooler than that,

239
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:07,640
but there are many stars
that are 10,000 trees.

240
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:09,070
So this should look like,

241
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,960
so in any direction you look,

242
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,690
you should see

243
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,220
something that looks
like the surface of the,

244
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,323
of a star,

245
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,693
uh,

246
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:26,090
a hot I and ISED hydrogen,

247
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,850
and this looks like the surface of a star

248
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,390
and we know that that's wrong,

249
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,060
right?

250
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,220
Uh,

251
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,400
you left to go outside,

252
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,590
look up in some direction.

253
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,220
Uh,

254
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,360
if this were really true,

255
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:39,900
right,

256
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,250
then anywhere you look,

257
00:08:41,251 --> 00:08:42,420
you would see the surface of this,

258
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:42,691
of,

259
00:08:42,691 --> 00:08:42,931
of,

260
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:45,840
of a star that's hotter and
brighter than the sun and salt.

261
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:48,960
The whole of the sky would look
like the surface of the sun,

262
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:49,800
only hotter.

263
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,431
Uh,

264
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:52,320
and obviously that isn't the case.

265
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,770
Uh,

266
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,480
and the reason that that's not the case
is you have to remember how red shifted

267
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:58,170
this is,

268
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,960
it's red shifted by a factor of 3000.

269
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,290
So the light is three has wavelengths
that's 3000 times longer than the like we

270
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:07,871
see from stars.

271
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:09,330
So let's work that out.

272
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:09,990
Uh,

273
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,990
you'll recall a lambda that
you observe is equal to lamp,

274
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,460
admitted plus Delta Lambda,

275
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,803
uh,

276
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,620
or is equal to lambda,

277
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,330
uh,

278
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,330
emitted a one plus xe because xe
is Delta Lambda overlapped it.

279
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:29,544
He made it.

280
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,690
Uh,

281
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,690
and so this is equal to the
wave length emitted times 3001.

282
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,720
Right?

283
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,441
Here's the one.

284
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:38,550
Here's the 3000.

285
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,800
We'll call that three
times 10 to the three.

286
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,660
And if the wavelength,

287
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:44,900
15 minute is a nice optical wavelength,

288
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,640
like five times 10 to
the minus seven meters,

289
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:48,120
uh,

290
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,130
that looks green or yellow,

291
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,181
uh,

292
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:52,890
times 3000,

293
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,060
that's a 15 times 10 to the minus four.

294
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,320
That's around one millimeter
wavelengths of a millimeter.

295
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:01,501
Now,

296
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:03,720
wavelengths of the millimeter
you don't see with your eye.

297
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,870
These are more or less
what we call micro waves.

298
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,000
So the prediction really is
that in any direction you look,

299
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,230
you see,

300
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,393
uh,

301
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,571
a whole,

302
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:22,680
but you see what would have been
something that looks like the surface of a

303
00:10:22,681 --> 00:10:23,011
star,

304
00:10:23,011 --> 00:10:26,430
except it's red shifted so far that all
you can see is microwaves instead of

305
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:27,780
ordinary optical light.

306
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,460
This is true.

307
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,950
This has been verified,

308
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,290
a verified observationally
at first in the 1960s.

309
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,521
Uh,

310
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:39,510
and this is true,

311
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:40,811
uh,

312
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:45,811
there is a cosmic microwave background,

313
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:49,950
uh,

314
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,300
in any direction.

315
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,160
Take a microwave detector,

316
00:10:56,161 --> 00:10:56,581
radio,

317
00:10:56,581 --> 00:10:58,290
telescope and pointed in any direction.

318
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,180
You see this stuff
coming from the universe.

319
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,570
And this was taken when
it was first discovered,

320
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:04,650
uh,

321
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,483
as,

322
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,653
uh,

323
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,930
evidence for the Big Bang
and against the steady state

324
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,110
because,

325
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,370
uh,

326
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,780
it was predicted by the big bank because
you assume that the universe was much,

327
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:20,680
much hotter and much,

328
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:21,910
much denser in the past,

329
00:11:21,911 --> 00:11:25,240
which is what you need in order to create
this stuff and that buy enough time.

330
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:25,931
You're seeing it now,

331
00:11:25,931 --> 00:11:26,800
it's all red shifted.

332
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:27,970
Okay.

333
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:28,721
So that's fine.

334
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:29,620
As far as it goes,

335
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:33,700
one of the features of the
cosmic microwave background
turns out to be that it's

336
00:11:33,701 --> 00:11:34,810
very smooth.

337
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,860
Uh,

338
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,840
and you expect that to be true.

339
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,150
Yeah.

340
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,600
Uh,

341
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,440
because you expect to see the
exact same thing in any direction.

342
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:48,540
It doesn't matter if you go back in
time looking that way or back in time

343
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,440
looking that way.

344
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,680
You expect the universe to be denser
and hotter in the past in about the same

345
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:53,921
way.

346
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,221
And so,

347
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:55,054
sure enough,

348
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,390
uh,

349
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,830
the cosmic microwave background,

350
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:58,510
it's pretty much the same everywhere.

351
00:11:58,511 --> 00:12:01,540
You look the same everywhere.

352
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,261
Uh,

353
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:07,450
and as further experiments were done,

354
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,520
it really is very smooth.

355
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:09,850
And it,

356
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,510
you came,

357
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:10,571
uh,

358
00:12:10,571 --> 00:12:11,290
started to,

359
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,170
to the,

360
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,570
the smoothness of this started to become
a little embarrassing because it can't

361
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:17,201
be you.

362
00:12:17,201 --> 00:12:19,210
You don't want it to be perfectly smooth,

363
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,260
absolutely,

364
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,970
absolutely,

365
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,260
totally identical in all directions
because the universe at the moment is not

366
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:27,094
perfectly smooth.

367
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,970
We've got planets,

368
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:28,571
we got people,

369
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:29,500
we got galaxies,

370
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,660
then we got big spaces
where there's nothing.

371
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,930
And so if the universe at the time of
the cosmic microwave background is going

372
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:39,100
to evolve into our own universe,

373
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:43,480
now there must be some little
perturbations that are gonna grow up to be

374
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:44,830
galaxies later on.

375
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,190
Uh,

376
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,630
if it were perfectly smooth,

377
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:47,200
then,

378
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,650
uh,

379
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,810
it would have to be perfectly smooth now,

380
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,360
and that's manifestly not the case.

381
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,673
So,

382
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,010
uh,

383
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:54,910
but you still,

384
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:59,911
you suspect that there must
be some irregularities,

385
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:03,280
uh,

386
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,230
because the universe now
is clearly a irregular,

387
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,840
yeah,

388
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,050
yeah.

389
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,750
In the sense that there are,

390
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,590
it contains objects of various kinds.

391
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,370
And so in the 1990s,

392
00:13:19,371 --> 00:13:21,380
it turns out you can see
microwaves from the ground,

393
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:22,910
but it's better to do it from space.

394
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,361
Uh,

395
00:13:23,361 --> 00:13:24,620
and saw in the 1990s,

396
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:27,800
they launched a satellite called Colby.

397
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,060
This is the cosmic background.

398
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,200
Explorer

399
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,170
is this a satellite,

400
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,180
uh,

401
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:46,180
launched in the early 1990s and Kolby
finally found the variations in the cosmic

402
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:50,390
microwave background

403
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,500
and they were very small,

404
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,430
uh,

405
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:57,190
ten one part in 100,000,

406
00:13:57,191 --> 00:14:00,010
so 10 to the minus five to one.

407
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:04,450
Now that contrast with the variations
we see in the current universe and the

408
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:05,350
current universe,

409
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:05,980
uh,

410
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,200
the variations in density can be,

411
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:08,990
uh,

412
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,730
uh,

413
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,240
uh,

414
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,250
30 orders of magnitude 10 to the 30.

415
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:12,611
Remember,

416
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:17,230
the average density of the universe
is something like 10 to the minus 27,

417
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,130
uh,

418
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:18,520
uh,

419
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,140
kilograms per cubic meter.

420
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,780
In here we've got 10 to
the three cubic kill,

421
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,643
uh,

422
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,390
kilograms per cubic meter.

423
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:26,590
That's the density of water,

424
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:27,424
for example.

425
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,420
And so the density of the universe
now varies by 10 to the 30.

426
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:31,790
Uh,

427
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,050
but then it only measures
varied by 10 to the minus five.

428
00:14:35,051 --> 00:14:35,670
So,

429
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:35,980
uh,

430
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,170
the sixth decimal place in the,

431
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,880
in the density was found to be variable
on the first five were always the same.

432
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,280
Now 10 to the 30.

433
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:45,761
Uh,

434
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:49,240
and so that seems like this university
is quite different from this universe,

435
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:52,070
but there are ways that structure grows.

436
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:54,020
And that's that I'll
come back to in a minute.

437
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:56,840
That's the second thing I want to
talk about is the growth of structure.

438
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:57,530
Uh,

439
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,840
but at least there was some variation.

440
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,290
People were very excited
about this because this again,

441
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:07,070
is a situation where something was
predicted and then you build a complicated

442
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:09,290
piece of apparatus and
you see what you predict,

443
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,980
and that's always a good thing to have
happen that gives you confidence that you

444
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:14,060
know what you're talking about.

445
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:14,690
Uh,

446
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,080
and,

447
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,230
uh,

448
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,250
in their excitement,

449
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:16,580
uh,

450
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,680
a number of scientists
became sort of overexcited.

451
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:22,850
There's a famous quote from
Stephen Hawking at the time,

452
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,780
he said,

453
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:23,991
uh,

454
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:25,160
about the Colby results.

455
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:25,521
He said,

456
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:27,560
it's like seeing the face of God.

457
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,920
This is a very dangerous
thing to say because,

458
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,490
you know,

459
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,090
most people in the world don't
understand how similes work.

460
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,511
Uh,

461
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:36,171
so he said,

462
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:37,260
it's like seeing the,

463
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:37,591
the,

464
00:15:37,591 --> 00:15:38,424
the face of God.

465
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:39,560
And this was reported.

466
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,360
Scientists sees God.

467
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,010
Uh,

468
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,200
so you have to watch what you say

469
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,691
and,

470
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:48,290
uh,

471
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:48,831
and you know,

472
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:51,620
the weekly world news got a hold
of this and then it was trouble.

473
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:52,763
Um,

474
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,331
all right.

475
00:15:53,331 --> 00:15:58,331
So they saw god by seeing the variations
in the cosmic microwave background,

476
00:15:58,971 --> 00:15:59,690
who knew?

477
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,523
Um,

478
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,170
all right now then,

479
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,063
uh,

480
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,750
so that was nice.

481
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,170
Uh,

482
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,550
but Colby was just the first crack at
this and while they saw variations,

483
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,110
uh,

484
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,860
they didn't see it very precisely.

485
00:16:12,861 --> 00:16:15,020
It was a pretty blurry imaging image.

486
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:15,560
So,

487
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:15,741
uh,

488
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:17,450
then there was another satellite,

489
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:18,621
uh,

490
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:20,000
still operating,

491
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:22,340
actually called w map.

492
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,100
AW map is the,

493
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,500
uh,

494
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,150
Wilkinson micro wave,

495
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:30,780
uh,

496
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,240
anisotropy

497
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,380
probe.

498
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,430
So anti sought,

499
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:36,931
drippy,

500
00:16:36,931 --> 00:16:39,640
it means irregularity a Wilkinson.

501
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:40,780
Dave Wilkinson was,

502
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:41,051
uh,

503
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:43,810
one of the pioneers of this
kind of radio astronomy,

504
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,290
uh,

505
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:48,880
and he was the leader of this project
until he died shortly before launch.

506
00:16:48,881 --> 00:16:50,470
And so then they named it after him.

507
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,490
Uh,

508
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,323
and uh,

509
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,310
then in 2003,

510
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,990
a w map,

511
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,321
uh,

512
00:16:56,321 --> 00:17:01,321
announced its result and they got a
much more precise map of the cosmic

513
00:17:06,551 --> 00:17:07,720
microwave background,

514
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:08,410
uh,

515
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:12,390
so precise that they could measure
the size of these irregularities.

516
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,413
Yes.

517
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,200
Not just how irregular they weren't,

518
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:18,280
but how big they were.

519
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,073
Okay.

520
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,950
And that it turns out,

521
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,510
gives you cosmological information.

522
00:17:27,511 --> 00:17:28,790
And I'll come back to that in a second,

523
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,070
but I want to start by showing
you some pictures here.

524
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,383
Um,

525
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,863
let's see.

526
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,280
Right,

527
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,840
this is the Colby results.

528
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,580
So let me explain what you're looking at.

529
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,000
What you're looking at is
a map of the entire sky.

530
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,240
They've projected it on to,

531
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:46,790
uh,

532
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,560
the sky in the way it works is,

533
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,573
uh,

534
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,220
uh,

535
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,810
this down the middle here.

536
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:52,610
That's the,

537
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,070
uh,

538
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,900
that's the plain of the galaxy.

539
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:56,700
That's where the Milky Way is going to be.

540
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,630
And then any position on
the sky maps onto this oval.

541
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:03,570
And so this is a common way
of expressing the whole Scott.

542
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:04,740
Now this,

543
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,100
uh,

544
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,700
this is actually kind of
the raw data where red,

545
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:09,930
I can't remember which way it goes.

546
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:14,040
I think red is slightly denser
or actually slightly hotter.

547
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,270
There's the way they measure it,

548
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:15,620
uh,

549
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,920
and blue is slightly cooler.

550
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,020
So there's this kind of Yin Yang,

551
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,760
a pattern here.

552
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:24,450
And that's because we're moving in
some direction through the universe.

553
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,290
And so,

554
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:25,710
uh,

555
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:29,580
if you look at the micro of background
in the direction we're moving,

556
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,330
uh,

557
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:31,310
then it,

558
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,400
uh,

559
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,200
then it's a little bit blue shifted,

560
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,210
which makes it look a little bit hotter.

561
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,690
Whereas where if you look back
where we're coming from a,

562
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,850
that's a little bit a red shifted,

563
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:43,050
so it looks a little cooler.

564
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,650
And so we're moving in this
direction away from here.

565
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,220
And,

566
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,460
uh,

567
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,690
that effect,

568
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,050
this very small effect of our
own motion through the universe,

569
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:52,650
uh,

570
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:54,150
turns out to dominate,

571
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:54,930
uh,

572
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,390
the,

573
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:55,560
uh,

574
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,690
irregularities and the
cosmic microwave background.

575
00:18:57,691 --> 00:18:58,051
But of course,

576
00:18:58,051 --> 00:18:59,460
that's not what we care about.

577
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,180
Uh,

578
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,670
we want to see what the
background itself is doing.

579
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,460
It's also true that that's
quite easy to remove,

580
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,030
uh,

581
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,840
because,

582
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,141
uh,

583
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:07,920
we know,

584
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,250
uh,

585
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,480
how fast we're moving.

586
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:09,751
Uh,

587
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:12,300
you can tell from this what
direction we're moving in.

588
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,500
I had to also how fast,

589
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,660
and you can just take
that out of the whole map,

590
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,230
uh,

591
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:16,471
and,

592
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:21,471
and adjust the map to be how we would
see it if we weren't moving anywhere that

593
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:22,650
looks like this.

594
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,500
And now there's a clear signal.

595
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:26,101
This is the,

596
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:28,080
this is the Milky Way here.

597
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:33,290
There are sources of microwaves that
aren't the cosmic microwave background.

598
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:35,850
There a objects in our own galaxy,

599
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:36,361
uh,

600
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:36,870
that,

601
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,140
uh,

602
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,790
he met lot of microwaves.

603
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:42,960
But the thing is that the spectrum of
the microwaves de mint is very different

604
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:46,200
from the spectrum of the
cosmic microwave background.

605
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,710
And so if you take not
just an image of this,

606
00:19:49,711 --> 00:19:50,544
but you take a,

607
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,690
an actual spectrum,

608
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,750
which they did a,

609
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:55,140
you can tell the difference
between things coming,

610
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,010
uh,

611
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,580
uh,

612
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,300
emission coming from the background and
emission coming from actual objects in

613
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:01,290
our own galaxy.

614
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:01,730
Uh,

615
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,720
and so you can take out the ones,

616
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:08,070
you can artificially digitally remove
the objects that have the spectrum

617
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,090
associated with a galactic objects.

618
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,180
And so you can do that.

619
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:14,670
You can take this out and
that's what you end up.

620
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,870
I should say that the scale
between red and blue changes,

621
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,380
uh,

622
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,950
by about a factor of 10 between
each one of these plots.

623
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:23,330
Uh,

624
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,980
and so the difference between
red and blue here is much,

625
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:28,470
much smaller than the difference
between red and blue up here.

626
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,191
Anyway,

627
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:31,980
this was the face of God
according to Hawking,

628
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:32,940
uh,

629
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,440
because it wasn't smooth.

630
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,880
And because you could,

631
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:38,190
after some exhaustive error analysis,

632
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,600
convince yourself that you really
believe that these pieces of the cosmic

633
00:20:42,601 --> 00:20:46,170
microwave background
are actually hotter and,

634
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:46,360
uh,

635
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,380
therefore dancer,

636
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,870
then these pieces of the
cosmic microwave background.

637
00:20:49,871 --> 00:20:51,100
So that was a big triumph.

638
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,610
And these irregularities
then grow up to be galaxies,

639
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:55,990
uh,

640
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,080
or groups of galaxies or
groups of groups of galaxies.

641
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,913
Cause you know,

642
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,060
they're pretty big.

643
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:01,781
They extend,

644
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:02,111
you know,

645
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:05,350
some significant fraction
across the whole universe.

646
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:05,950
Uh,

647
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,550
this is,

648
00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:06,880
you know,

649
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,670
a map of the whole universe cause
it's mapping the entire sky.

650
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,130
Uh,

651
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:12,490
so they're not going to grow
up to be individual galaxies,

652
00:21:12,491 --> 00:21:13,324
but they are,

653
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:13,840
uh,

654
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,720
going to grow up to be
irregularities in the universe.

655
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,530
Okay.

656
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:22,530
So now this is coping in the 1990s to
compare that to the WWE map result here

657
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:23,360
is,

658
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:23,570
uh,

659
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,403
on a different,

660
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,180
uh,

661
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,280
visualization color scheme.

662
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,380
A Cove beach,

663
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:28,840
uh,

664
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,890
w map changed colors on us so that you
wouldn't get confused between their

665
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,300
results in the Coby results.

666
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,160
So this is the Cobi map again,

667
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:36,581
uh,

668
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:36,890
in the,

669
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:41,890
and this is what w map saw and you can
see that it's seeing the same things,

670
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,030
uh,

671
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,920
this over density here.

672
00:21:44,921 --> 00:21:46,450
That's this stuff here,

673
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,740
this over here.

674
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:48,730
That's these,

675
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,121
uh,

676
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:50,860
only it's seeing it much,

677
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:51,101
much,

678
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,330
much more precisely.

679
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:52,931
Uh,

680
00:21:52,931 --> 00:21:53,441
and you know,

681
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:56,370
it's kind of the difference between a
Hubble space telescope image in a ground

682
00:21:56,371 --> 00:21:56,921
based image.

683
00:21:56,921 --> 00:21:57,850
It seeing the same thing,

684
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:59,320
but the resolution here is much,

685
00:21:59,321 --> 00:22:00,154
much higher.

686
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,540
And you can see that you might have a
chance of measuring the size of some of

687
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:09,370
these clumps in this image in a way
that you wouldn't be able to do in this

688
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:09,970
image here.

689
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:13,060
And so that was what w map was all about,

690
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:17,710
was actually measuring the sizes of these
little bumps in the cosmic microwave

691
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,430
background.

692
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,920
So why is that a good thing to do?

693
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:22,900
And here is where,

694
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:23,800
uh,

695
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,300
if I had five weeks,

696
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:26,500
I'd explain that to you,

697
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:27,191
but I don't,

698
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:28,060
so I won't.

699
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,330
So let me just say that from the sizes
you can get cosmological information.

700
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,820
I'm not going to tell you how that works.

701
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,240
Basically it comes about because,

702
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,040
uh,

703
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,873
uh,

704
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,271
if you,

705
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:49,900
if you,

706
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,380
uh,

707
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,070
you can feel what you find out from
this is that there are certain sizes,

708
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,570
the clumps like to be certain sizes and
there very few clumps that are other

709
00:22:58,571 --> 00:22:59,080
sizes.

710
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,700
So they're particularly favored
sizes and the favored sizes,

711
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:08,910
a turnout to relate to how old is at that
moment and what has been contained in

712
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,020
the universe up til then.

713
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:11,770
Uh,

714
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,670
but I won't go into that in any
more detail except to say that the,

715
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,000
uh,

716
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,630
the outcome of this is
that what you constrain,

717
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:24,580
what you find out from this is
what they refer to as Omega total,

718
00:23:24,581 --> 00:23:28,960
which is the sum of Omega
Lambda and Omega matter.

719
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,010
And this turns out to be equal to one,

720
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,250
to as close as they've
been able to measure it.

721
00:23:36,251 --> 00:23:38,800
It's about 10% by now one,

722
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,940
uh,

723
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,200
probably plus or minus,

724
00:23:41,201 --> 00:23:41,560
I don't know.

725
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,251
Oh 0.1.

726
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:43,960
It's maybe a little
better than that by now.

727
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,803
Few percent.

728
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,360
But now that's a very good thing to know
because remember what this looked like

729
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:51,800
from the supernovae alone,

730
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,910
the allowed region of the supercell.

731
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,070
Here's one and one.

732
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,490
And they are loud region of the
supernovae looks something like this.

733
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,730
The cosmic microwave background
has these two things equally one.

734
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:07,910
And so you force yourself to be on a
straight line that looks like that.

735
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:13,100
And so the two of these
experiments put together,

736
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,770
gives you a much better constraint,

737
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,160
um,

738
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,941
what's going on.

739
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:18,920
So this is from the microwave background

740
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,283
and now,

741
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,630
uh,

742
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,260
it's actually some kind of
region that looks like this.

743
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:32,530
And so now you've got an allowed region
that's much smaller than either of these

744
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:34,010
two experiments,

745
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:34,430
uh,

746
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,080
put together a individually.

747
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,053
Okay.

748
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,751
As I said,

749
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:46,190
there's a third constraint and this
comes about by the growth of structure

750
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:53,300
you have to get from these
tiny perturbations that
after great effort have been

751
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:58,080
seen in the cosmic microwave background,

752
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:00,870
those head better grow
up to be galaxies or,

753
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,530
uh,

754
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,030
groups of galaxies or something.

755
00:25:03,031 --> 00:25:03,864
So at,

756
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,290
uh,

757
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,510
at z equals 3000,

758
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,720
you have 10 to the minus
five perturbations,

759
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:11,700
uh,

760
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,370
at z equals zero.

761
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,080
You have 10 to the 30,

762
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,563
uh,

763
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,470
plus even greater than that,

764
00:25:19,471 --> 00:25:19,790
you know,

765
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,500
that basically a black
hole is infinitely dance.

766
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:23,100
So,

767
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,281
uh,

768
00:25:23,281 --> 00:25:26,160
I guess you could have
infinite perturbations if
you think about it from that

769
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:30,120
point of view and you've got
to get from one to the other.

770
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,730
So how does this work?

771
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,550
Supposing you have a slight over density,

772
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,680
well what happens?

773
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:47,260
The region that is over dance a little
dancer than the stuff around it has more

774
00:25:47,261 --> 00:25:48,094
gravity

775
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,590
than the surrounding regions.

776
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:58,060
And so it then pulls in material from
the neighboring areas because uh,

777
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,580
the gravitational force on
any particular piece of mass,

778
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:06,410
we'll pull it toward the place where
the matter is densest cause that's where

779
00:26:06,411 --> 00:26:07,400
the gravity is coming from,

780
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,310
polls in nearby material.

781
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,360
But of course that action makes it denser
cause it's just pulled in more stuff

782
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:22,810
from the nearby region is it
makes the other parts less dense.

783
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:23,920
Uh,

784
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,320
and so this is a runaway process.

785
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:30,530
Then the dancer regions are dancers still,

786
00:26:30,531 --> 00:26:31,670
they have yet more gravity.

787
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:33,380
They pull stuff in even faster.

788
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,480
And so you could start
with tiny perturbations and
they grow and grow and grow

789
00:26:38,481 --> 00:26:42,980
and grow until it becomes the difference
between a galaxy and not a galaxy or a

790
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,063
of galaxies.

791
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,930
Turns out that the con,

792
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:46,801
even on the,

793
00:26:46,801 --> 00:26:47,060
uh,

794
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,250
uh,

795
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,420
w map plot,

796
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:48,871
uh,

797
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:53,010
the kinds of perturbations we're
looking at are what's called large.

798
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,800
This leads to the large scale structure.

799
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,303
Yeah.

800
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,313
Which is,

801
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,010
uh,

802
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:06,010
distributions of galaxies of
galaxies and galaxy clusters.

803
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,680
So there's individual galaxies,

804
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,390
galaxies like to live in clusters.

805
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,820
Turns out the clusters
are grouped together.

806
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,890
That's the large scale structure.

807
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:20,760
Uh,

808
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,510
and,

809
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,080
uh,

810
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,480
you can pluck this by using,

811
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,350
uh,

812
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:25,860
uh,

813
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,750
by doing galaxy surveys.

814
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,870
A problem with the galaxy survey is how
do you know where it is in the third

815
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:34,351
dimension?

816
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:35,131
How do you know how far,

817
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:36,150
how far away it is?

818
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:36,721
A,

819
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:41,130
so you have position in the sky that
tells you to have the coordinates of the

820
00:27:41,131 --> 00:27:41,964
galaxy,

821
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,730
and then you measure its red shift

822
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,590
and you use the red shift,

823
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:49,220
uh,

824
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:53,440
in order to make a guess at how far away
it is just from using the Hubble loss.

825
00:27:53,441 --> 00:27:57,860
So instead of trying to determine the
distance in order to measure the value of

826
00:27:57,861 --> 00:27:59,360
the Hubble constant,

827
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,800
you assume a value of the Hubble constant.

828
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:02,990
Did you take from somewhere?

829
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:03,500
Uh,

830
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,940
and then if you measure,

831
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:05,600
uh,

832
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:05,960
uh,

833
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,500
then you can,

834
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,990
and once you've assumed the
value of the Hubble constant,

835
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:12,080
you can use redshift to tell you
what the distance is supposed to be.

836
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,410
And so then you get a
three d map of the sky,

837
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:19,860
uh,

838
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,060
and uh,

839
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,950
and that tells us what the structure is.

840
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:23,784
Now

841
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,940
you can then compare that to,

842
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:27,840
uh,

843
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,940
you can then simulate the growth

844
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,903
of,

845
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,133
uh,

846
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,090
growth of structure

847
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:36,950
by,

848
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,260
uh,

849
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,951
by computer.

850
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:42,360
You start with the cosmic microwave
background with what you know about the

851
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:43,770
cosmic microwave background.

852
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,520
Uh,

853
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,800
you apply the laws of gravity

854
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:49,611
ad.

855
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:52,680
You can also put in a little
dark energy if you feel like it,

856
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:52,981
to,

857
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:53,390
to,

858
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:53,670
uh,

859
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,820
change how the group,

860
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,750
and that actually does change how the
growth works as you might imagine.

861
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:02,280
But you can stick in any
cosmological parameters you want,

862
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:02,760
uh,

863
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,680
and just apply them for the,

864
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,450
for,

865
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:05,850
uh,

866
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:10,170
as the universe grows from
a red shift of 3002 to now.

867
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:10,830
Uh,

868
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:13,320
and then you determine

869
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,673
what,

870
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:16,430
uh,

871
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,970
the simulation looks like now,

872
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,450
where now is defined to be,

873
00:29:25,451 --> 00:29:25,721
you know,

874
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:28,090
13.7 billion years after you start,

875
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,050
uh,

876
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:29,950
and you ask,

877
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,390
does it look alike?

878
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,533
Look

879
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,340
the same as the observations.

880
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,933
Uh,

881
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,430
uh,

882
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:42,210
now

883
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,560
along the way,

884
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,640
when you're applying
gravity and all this stuff,

885
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,440
you have to assume,

886
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,260
uh,

887
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,640
cosmological parameters,

888
00:29:52,641 --> 00:29:54,830
how much dark energy there is,

889
00:29:54,831 --> 00:29:57,110
but especially how much,

890
00:29:58,730 --> 00:29:59,563
uh,

891
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:03,190
dark matter there is because
it's the matter that's pulling,

892
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:03,890
uh,

893
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,850
that's pulling these density
perturbations together,

894
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,470
how much dark matter and,

895
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,390
and some of its properties.

896
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,900
And so then what you do is you just run
your computer program a whole bunch of

897
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:22,100
times over and over again with
different amounts of dark energy,

898
00:30:22,101 --> 00:30:24,140
dark matter and stuff like that.

899
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:29,060
And you see which one of them of these
simulations produces a universe that

900
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:30,830
actually looks like the one we see.

901
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,023
So,

902
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:32,863
which,

903
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,230
uh,

904
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:35,580
input parameters,

905
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,000
uh,

906
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,370
ew,

907
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:39,760
ew.

908
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,960
The observations.

909
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,330
So this is in general how
computational science works.

910
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:46,871
This is how,

911
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:47,171
you know,

912
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:48,760
the big global warming models,

913
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:50,350
all these kinds of things work this way.

914
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:50,980
Uh,

915
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,880
you take a,

916
00:30:51,881 --> 00:30:53,680
you put in as much physics,

917
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:54,550
as much chemistry,

918
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:55,031
whatever.

919
00:30:55,031 --> 00:30:56,260
As you can understand,

920
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,210
you make a big computer simulation,

921
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,850
you pick a stet set of
starting conditions.

922
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:01,180
Uh,

923
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:01,781
in this case,

924
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:04,720
that's easy because you observe
the cosmic microwave background,

925
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:08,410
you run the thing for a while and
you ask does it look like real life?

926
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,510
And to the extent that
it looks like real life,

927
00:31:10,511 --> 00:31:14,530
you believe that you've put in all the
important physics and all the important

928
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:15,970
science into your simulation.

929
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:16,961
Then you ask,

930
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:17,710
all right,

931
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,010
uh,

932
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,660
given the results of this simulation,

933
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:19,841
the,

934
00:31:19,841 --> 00:31:21,610
that seems to represent real life,

935
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,020
what does it predict?

936
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:23,530
Uh,

937
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:23,621
you.

938
00:31:23,621 --> 00:31:24,580
So you can do things,

939
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:25,091
for example,

940
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:28,270
in the global warming Matsu add a whole
bunch of carbon to the atmosphere.

941
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:29,104
And then you ask,

942
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,260
well,

943
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,430
now what's going to happen?

944
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,151
Uh,

945
00:31:31,151 --> 00:31:31,870
and uh,

946
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:32,230
with,

947
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,340
with various results.

948
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:33,791
Uh,

949
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,690
and so this is a kind of example of,

950
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:40,120
of a general kind of science that is
now more and more frequently being done,

951
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:40,510
uh,

952
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:44,050
this kind of computational
simulation of reality,

953
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:47,410
which you then check in
some way against reality.

954
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,480
And then to the extent that it works,

955
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:54,430
you use it to predict reality
in other sets of circumstances.

956
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:56,291
Uh,

957
00:31:56,291 --> 00:32:00,040
so let me show you some of that.

958
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,823
All right.

959
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,310
Here's a map of the universe.

960
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:06,541
This is,

961
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:07,840
these are observations.

962
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,340
This is a famous,

963
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,000
uh,

964
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,280
uh,

965
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,440
redshift survey.

966
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:14,470
So what you've got is red
shift going up this way,

967
00:32:14,471 --> 00:32:18,490
or actually they plotted in velocity and
position on the sky in this direction.

968
00:32:18,491 --> 00:32:20,410
This is kind of a slice of the universe,

969
00:32:20,411 --> 00:32:24,760
so it's got no third dimension coming out
of the blackboard cause they just have

970
00:32:24,761 --> 00:32:25,300
music.

971
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,550
And you can see each.is a galaxy.

972
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,040
They are not distributed
randomly in this plot.

973
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:30,430
Uh,

974
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:30,761
this,

975
00:32:30,761 --> 00:32:31,060
uh,

976
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,050
little guy here,

977
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,520
uh,

978
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,150
is,

979
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:34,351
uh,

980
00:32:34,351 --> 00:32:35,890
obviously hugely over dance.

981
00:32:35,891 --> 00:32:39,410
There are also places they think
they're complete out to the edge here.

982
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,050
There are also places where
there are almost no galaxies.

983
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:43,180
These are called void.

984
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,020
There are walls and void.

985
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,471
Uh,

986
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:49,490
and then as they took more and more
slices to build up the third dimension,

987
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:49,940
uh,

988
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,310
they ended up having things
that look like death.

989
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,090
Uh,

990
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,640
and there are clear over densities at sir.

991
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,620
This was named the Great Wall.

992
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,131
Uh,

993
00:32:58,131 --> 00:33:02,180
there are clear over densities in some
places and clear under densities in

994
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:02,780
others.

995
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,890
And it turns out that the large scale
structure of the universe is sort of,

996
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,400
uh,

997
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,570
like a bubble.

998
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:09,710
Uh,

999
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,910
some soap bubbles.

1000
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:11,420
Uh,

1001
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,100
and so they've got walls.

1002
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:16,160
And then there are voids in the middle
of the walls and where those walls

1003
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:16,700
connect,

1004
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,470
or particularly dense clumps.

1005
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:19,560
Uh,

1006
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,550
now that way you can think about it is
that they're kind of these filaments

1007
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,653
things that,

1008
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,050
uh,

1009
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:28,160
go through space where they're
unusually large numbers of galaxies.

1010
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,660
So the most recent,

1011
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,140
uh,

1012
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,070
redshift survey,

1013
00:33:31,071 --> 00:33:32,030
which goes out much,

1014
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:34,070
much further than the
one I just showed you,

1015
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:37,370
that was the first that
one of goes out to here.

1016
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,330
But now they've,

1017
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:38,600
uh,

1018
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:38,961
the,

1019
00:33:38,961 --> 00:33:39,150
uh,

1020
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,730
to DF two degree field.

1021
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:41,440
This is a,

1022
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:41,740
uh,

1023
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,060
a telescope that can look at,

1024
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:47,990
measure the redshifts of galaxies within
two degrees of each other all at the

1025
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:48,651
same time.

1026
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:49,341
So you get many,

1027
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:49,970
many retrofits.

1028
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:53,180
I think they have close to maybe
a hundred thousand redshifts here.

1029
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,430
Each blue.is a galaxy.

1030
00:33:55,810 --> 00:33:57,350
And you can see this structure,

1031
00:33:57,351 --> 00:33:59,300
you can see the structure really cleanly,

1032
00:33:59,560 --> 00:33:59,750
uh,

1033
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:02,630
with these void areas surrounded by walls.

1034
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,790
And then when the walls
run into each other,

1035
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:07,040
they're particularly
dance clumps of galaxies.

1036
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:12,340
So that's the current structure of the
universe that we want our simulation to

1037
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:14,030
end up looking like.

1038
00:34:14,031 --> 00:34:14,864
Yes.

1039
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:16,790
Oh,

1040
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,330
because,

1041
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:17,541
uh,

1042
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:19,490
after around here,

1043
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,150
uh,

1044
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,560
they stop being complete.

1045
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,040
They just don't see all the galaxies
cause they're faint ones that they can't

1046
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:25,730
measure.

1047
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,121
Uh,

1048
00:34:26,121 --> 00:34:26,930
and so,

1049
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:27,410
uh,

1050
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:28,940
beyond about here,

1051
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,970
they're just not measuring all
the galaxies that are there.

1052
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:34,220
Okay.

1053
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,053
Uh,

1054
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,390
so now let me show you a simulation.

1055
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:40,763
Let's see.

1056
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:44,723
Come on.

1057
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,650
Here we go.

1058
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:47,060
All right,

1059
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,820
I'll come back and I'll tell you what
you're looking at it in just a second.

1060
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:54,230
But here is the evolution of the
universe as done by computer.

1061
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,543
Um,

1062
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,903
all right,

1063
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,680
so now let me look what,

1064
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,840
where are we starting from?

1065
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,730
The red shift is up here.

1066
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,361
Uh,

1067
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:05,840
and so we're going to go from a red shift
of about 30 when the universe was 30

1068
00:35:05,841 --> 00:35:08,540
times smaller than it is
to a redshift of zero,

1069
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:09,410
which is today.

1070
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,240
And we're going to look at this box.

1071
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:13,040
This is a little trunk of the universe.

1072
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,950
Each one of these dots is
supposed to be a galaxy.

1073
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,810
Now at a redshift of 30,

1074
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:19,040
they're not galaxies yet.

1075
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:21,140
They're just over densities of gas.

1076
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:21,740
Uh,

1077
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:25,010
now two things are going to happen
since a red shift of 30 by now.

1078
00:35:25,011 --> 00:35:27,560
One is that the box is going
to get 30 times bigger.

1079
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:29,570
The whole universe is going to expand.

1080
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:29,931
Uh,

1081
00:35:29,931 --> 00:35:32,090
and that is included in the simulation.

1082
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,630
But we're not going to include it when
we make the movie because it makes it

1083
00:35:35,631 --> 00:35:37,010
hard to see what's going on.

1084
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,010
And so if you remember
the coordinate system,

1085
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:41,940
uh,

1086
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,050
the way it works is there's the
scale factor times xyz position.

1087
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,970
We're taking the scale factor out.

1088
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,780
So this box is a single
part of the universe.

1089
00:35:51,781 --> 00:35:53,520
It's going to expand by a factor of 30,

1090
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:55,530
but you're not going to
see the expansion here.

1091
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:00,150
All you're going to see is the
motion with the motion in x,

1092
00:36:00,151 --> 00:36:00,451
y,

1093
00:36:00,451 --> 00:36:00,990
and z.

1094
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,280
Not the scale factor.

1095
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,810
As these things move toward each other.

1096
00:36:03,811 --> 00:36:05,340
Now as you start out,

1097
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,710
it looks like it's pretty
evenly distributed,

1098
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,611
but in fact,

1099
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:11,550
there are little
perturbations in the density.

1100
00:36:11,551 --> 00:36:15,030
And what will happen is the galaxies
will stream toward the perturbations.

1101
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,930
In the perturbations.

1102
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:16,650
We'll get,

1103
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,483
we'll get bigger.

1104
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,180
And the,

1105
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:18,660
and uh,

1106
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,370
keep track of red shift up here.

1107
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:24,660
The rate at which the red shift changes
varies with time because what we're

1108
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:26,340
actually counting here is not red shift,

1109
00:36:26,341 --> 00:36:31,170
but time steps and the
relationship between time and
redshift is a not obvious.

1110
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:31,660
So,

1111
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:31,890
uh,

1112
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,010
let us take another look at
the growth of structure here.

1113
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,740
See them all moving towards each other,

1114
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:38,790
uh,

1115
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,590
collecting in these filaments,

1116
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,680
abandoning whole regions,

1117
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:44,491
uh,

1118
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:45,510
into void.

1119
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,740
And then you end up,

1120
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:48,323
uh,

1121
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,480
well you end up back where you
started the way this film loop works.

1122
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:51,841
But,

1123
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:52,140
uh,

1124
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,470
let me show you a different
visualization of exactly the same data.

1125
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:55,861
You know,

1126
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:56,700
this is all in computer.

1127
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:57,690
You can do anything you want.

1128
00:36:57,691 --> 00:37:00,840
They make these great things where you
sort of fly through the universe while

1129
00:37:00,841 --> 00:37:01,890
it's evolving and stuff.

1130
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,390
And I don't think that's amusing,

1131
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:05,070
but I don't think it's very educational.

1132
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:05,580
Uh,

1133
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,780
one thing that is useful,

1134
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:11,460
they took that box and they just kept
rotating it as this film Luke Bryan around

1135
00:37:11,461 --> 00:37:11,551
it.

1136
00:37:11,551 --> 00:37:15,930
That's useful because you get to see
these structures from different angles and

1137
00:37:15,931 --> 00:37:17,820
I think it makes it easier to visualize.

1138
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:18,690
So let's try that.

1139
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:19,411
See,

1140
00:37:19,411 --> 00:37:22,140
it's the same simulation
except the boxes rotating.

1141
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,820
And so you'd get a better sense,

1142
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:24,630
I think,

1143
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,030
of what these structures
actually look like.

1144
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:29,970
We'll do it once more.

1145
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,990
Okay.

1146
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:35,740
As they collect into these filaments
and the filaments collect together.

1147
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:40,660
And so what you can do with the output
of something like this with what it is at

1148
00:37:40,661 --> 00:37:41,590
the very end,

1149
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:42,461
whoops,

1150
00:37:42,461 --> 00:37:44,890
I missed try it one more time.

1151
00:37:44,891 --> 00:37:47,860
Let me see if I can pause
before it gets four.

1152
00:37:47,861 --> 00:37:48,694
Regroups.

1153
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,350
All right,

1154
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,760
so here's a small red shift.

1155
00:37:54,761 --> 00:37:55,870
When you get to this point,

1156
00:37:55,871 --> 00:37:57,250
you can mathematically,

1157
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:59,260
there are mathematical ways of saying,

1158
00:37:59,410 --> 00:37:59,710
you know,

1159
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,600
how clumpy isn't a,

1160
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:03,160
how stringing isn't,

1161
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,400
and you can compare the results
of simulations of this kind with,

1162
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,150
uh,

1163
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,150
with actual observations
from the red shift surveys.

1164
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,520
And so in this particular case it worked.

1165
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:16,390
Uh,

1166
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:18,340
so let me go back to here.

1167
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:22,603
Yes.

1168
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,050
Oh,

1169
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:26,883
it's down here.

1170
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:33,850
Oops.

1171
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:34,600
There we go.

1172
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:34,960
There.

1173
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,730
That's where I want to be for the moment.

1174
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,973
Uh,

1175
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:43,150
and the consequence of these kinds
of things is it turns out that most,

1176
00:38:43,151 --> 00:38:43,961
as I said before,

1177
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:45,610
mostly what you constrain.

1178
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:46,720
Uh,

1179
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,290
and so you compare the simulations,

1180
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:51,630
okay.

1181
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,140
Uh,

1182
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,760
to redshift surveys.

1183
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,920
And the consequence of that is that
you constrain the amount and also to a

1184
00:39:02,771 --> 00:39:03,401
lesser extent,

1185
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:04,234
the type,

1186
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:04,480
uh,

1187
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,480
the behavior of dark matter because
it's the matter that's pulling things

1188
00:39:09,821 --> 00:39:10,654
together.

1189
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:13,870
And in a way you can think about
these little clumps in filament,

1190
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:17,120
that's places where the universe
has already stopped and contracted.

1191
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:18,820
So it had a little extra density.

1192
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,280
So it hit the show.

1193
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:21,910
It was beyond the critical density.

1194
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,680
So that little piece of the
universe stopped and turned around,

1195
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,090
even though the university as
a whole continues to expand.

1196
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,701
All right,

1197
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,534
so now

1198
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,301
why do we have,

1199
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:35,440
let's go back to the plot.

1200
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:39,933
Here's one.

1201
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,870
Here's one.

1202
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:41,621
Uh,

1203
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:44,050
and so we have the supernovae,

1204
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:44,770
uh,

1205
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:47,440
forcing you to be in this box here.

1206
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,860
We have the cosmic microwave background,

1207
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:56,100
forcing you to be in this box here
and now we're going to have a straight

1208
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:58,930
vertical line in this plot,

1209
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,070
uh,

1210
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:04,840
because we know how much dark matter
there is from the structure simulation.

1211
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:05,530
Now,

1212
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,880
there are two possibilities.

1213
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:08,830
Supposing it comes in here,

1214
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,010
this is a good answer

1215
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,260
because then everything is consistent.

1216
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,480
Alternatively,

1217
00:40:20,481 --> 00:40:20,931
however,

1218
00:40:20,931 --> 00:40:22,070
it could come in here,

1219
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:24,860
this would be awkward

1220
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,170
because if it came in there,

1221
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:33,230
there would be no answer that would
simultaneously satisfy all of these

1222
00:40:33,601 --> 00:40:34,434
constraints.

1223
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,730
Uh,

1224
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:40,730
and so then something is wrong either
with one of these determinations of the

1225
00:40:43,801 --> 00:40:46,410
cosmic parameters or with
the theory as a whole,

1226
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:52,070
could be other observational
badness or theoretical badness.

1227
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:53,191
Uh,

1228
00:40:53,191 --> 00:40:54,300
and remember one,

1229
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:54,631
you know,

1230
00:40:54,631 --> 00:40:56,340
we did assume a,

1231
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,930
in even making this plot,

1232
00:40:57,931 --> 00:41:01,020
you're assuming that you're dealing with,

1233
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,093
um,

1234
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:02,880
uh,

1235
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,880
that you're dealing with a cosmological
constant as the form of the dark energy.

1236
00:41:07,951 --> 00:41:09,570
And as we discussed last time,

1237
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,360
it's possible that it isn't constant,

1238
00:41:12,361 --> 00:41:13,260
that it's something else.

1239
00:41:13,261 --> 00:41:15,870
And so if you ended up with
these things didn't work,

1240
00:41:15,871 --> 00:41:17,100
you'd have to ask yourself,

1241
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,120
do I have any clue how the dark energy
works in the answer would be no.

1242
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,850
And you would kind of have to
abandon the cosmological constant.

1243
00:41:23,851 --> 00:41:27,000
I think that's the easiest
out if things don't work.

1244
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:27,780
Uh,

1245
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,613
because,

1246
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,250
uh,

1247
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:30,031
dark matter,

1248
00:41:30,031 --> 00:41:31,110
we don't know what it is,

1249
00:41:31,111 --> 00:41:32,820
but we do know what it does.

1250
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,110
It exerts gravity,

1251
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,210
pulls things together.

1252
00:41:35,211 --> 00:41:37,970
So no matter what the
answer to what it is,

1253
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,170
a gravity,

1254
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,870
it's gravity will still
be the same dark energy.

1255
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:43,550
Not only do we not know what it is,

1256
00:41:43,551 --> 00:41:46,880
we don't really know what it does
except that at the moment it's causing a

1257
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:48,290
certain amount of acceleration.

1258
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:48,801
Uh,

1259
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:49,550
and so,

1260
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:49,940
uh,

1261
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,850
if you were satisfied that all
the observations were right,

1262
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:55,970
you might also think that your
simulations have left out.

1263
00:41:55,971 --> 00:42:00,740
Something important that could easily
be that you don't fully understand how

1264
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,930
structure evolves from the,

1265
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:05,240
from a to z of 3000 to now.

1266
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:05,600
That's,

1267
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:05,900
you know,

1268
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,610
certainly true at some level.

1269
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,660
Uh,

1270
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,200
and,

1271
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,321
uh,

1272
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:11,150
so there are various ways
you could get out of it.

1273
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,230
Uh,

1274
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:12,800
but,

1275
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,011
uh,

1276
00:42:13,011 --> 00:42:17,480
the nice thing about it is
it's a test of cosmology

1277
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,500
basically.

1278
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,190
Uh,

1279
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,650
if you have one measurement,

1280
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:26,260
okay,

1281
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,210
of two variables,

1282
00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,860
the variables being the amount of dark
energy and the amount of dark matter

1283
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,260
that doesn't tell you that all that
does is it establishes a relationship

1284
00:42:40,261 --> 00:42:41,430
between the two variables.

1285
00:42:41,431 --> 00:42:43,380
It doesn't actually
measure either one of them.

1286
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,070
And so you get some allowed
region like this or this,

1287
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,280
but you don't actually make a measurement
if you have two measurements of two

1288
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,013
variables.

1289
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,290
Uh,

1290
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:59,030
if you think of it in
a mathematical sense,

1291
00:42:59,031 --> 00:43:01,130
this is two equations in two unknowns.

1292
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,420
This you can solve.

1293
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:07,630
So then you measure values
for uh oh in this case,

1294
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,011
oh,

1295
00:43:10,011 --> 00:43:11,690
Miguel lambda and Omega matter.

1296
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:13,640
Uh,

1297
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,421
and that's nice.

1298
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:14,991
Then you can,

1299
00:43:14,991 --> 00:43:15,290
you know,

1300
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:18,590
quote what the values are once
you've done this to however,

1301
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:21,110
whatever the precision of your
measurement turns out to be.

1302
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,080
If you have three measurements

1303
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,680
of two variables,

1304
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,440
that's a test of the theory

1305
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:38,520
because it is not guaranteed that
you'll get a consistent result.

1306
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:40,230
In general,

1307
00:43:40,231 --> 00:43:44,070
if you write down three lines
in a two dimensional space,

1308
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,030
you don't pick out a single point
because they don't all cross at the same

1309
00:43:48,031 --> 00:43:48,660
place.

1310
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,310
And so if they do a,

1311
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:54,270
then you've got a consistent result and
then you have tested the theory because

1312
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:54,660
a,

1313
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:57,960
your prediction is that all these
three lines cross at the same place.

1314
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,370
They don't have to do that.

1315
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,370
So if you measure something
and it works out that way,

1316
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:04,980
then you've tested the theory
and kind of come out on top.

1317
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,040
So,

1318
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:06,300
uh,

1319
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,320
let me end today's class
by showing you the answer.

1320
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,010
This is what we know about the universe.

1321
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,573
Uh,

1322
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:18,983
let's see,

1323
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,010
what have I done with my,

1324
00:44:23,011 --> 00:44:23,131
Oh,

1325
00:44:23,131 --> 00:44:23,964
there it is.

1326
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,800
This is the allowed region
of the Supernova and what
they've done using each of

1327
00:44:30,931 --> 00:44:31,764
the,

1328
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:32,310
uh,

1329
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,450
there's a sort of,

1330
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:34,343
uh,

1331
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,630
I think it's a,

1332
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,190
uh,

1333
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,710
a one sigma region.

1334
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:42,711
So there's a two thirds chance it'll live
inside here and a well over 90% chance

1335
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:46,140
that it lives inside the broader area.

1336
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,420
So the supernovae force you to be here,

1337
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:54,210
the cosmic microwave background for is
the green result and it forces you to be

1338
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:55,044
here.

1339
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:56,280
And then the clusters,

1340
00:44:56,340 --> 00:45:00,210
large scale clustering force
you to be here and they cross.

1341
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,250
So this is the big triumph.

1342
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:07,251
You've tested the j the
theory by measuring it in
three different ways for two

1343
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,340
parameters,

1344
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,080
namely,

1345
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:09,270
uh,

1346
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,450
the dark energy density and
the dark matter density.

1347
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:16,710
Now there are a couple other
interesting things to note on this plot.

1348
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,900
One is that in some cases the universe
expands forever and at some cases it re

1349
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:25,080
collapses and we're well
into the expansion region.

1350
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:27,120
There's also the question of the,

1351
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:27,800
uh,

1352
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,633
um,

1353
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,410
of the geometry of the universe.

1354
00:45:31,411 --> 00:45:35,000
The more stuff there is either
dark energy or dark matter,

1355
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,260
the more curved the university becomes.

1356
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,120
And so you can ask yourself,

1357
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:42,300
is the universe curved in such a
way that occurs back on itself?

1358
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:46,710
Is it basically flat giving you Euclidean
geometry or does it curve backwards

1359
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:47,940
and extend infinitely?

1360
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,790
And that these three situations here,

1361
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,100
if the sum is equal to one,

1362
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,500
then the universe is flat and Euclidean.

1363
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:56,401
Uh,

1364
00:45:56,401 --> 00:45:58,440
and so that separates these two.

1365
00:45:58,650 --> 00:45:59,410
Now it says,

1366
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:02,430
somebody pointed out a few classes ago,

1367
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,470
if you have too much dark energy,

1368
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:09,710
then you never cross zero and you never
have a big bag because the acceleration

1369
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:13,920
has been so great that you must've
started out coming down and been bent up

1370
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:14,910
toward where we are now.

1371
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,410
That's this region up here.

1372
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:17,573
No big bag.

1373
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,421
Uh,

1374
00:46:18,421 --> 00:46:21,090
and so we're well away from that as well.

1375
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:21,811
Uh,

1376
00:46:21,811 --> 00:46:26,811
and so this basically sums up what we
currently know about the expansion of the

1377
00:46:29,431 --> 00:46:29,941
universe.

1378
00:46:29,941 --> 00:46:31,620
That we have a constraint going this way,

1379
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:32,940
a constraint going this way,

1380
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,170
a constraint going this way.

1381
00:46:34,171 --> 00:46:36,470
And you can see why I say that in,

1382
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:38,640
in a kind of philosophical sense.

1383
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,850
All three of these measurements
are equally important,

1384
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:42,960
uh,

1385
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:47,100
because it's the fact that you've got
three of them that allows a test of the

1386
00:46:47,101 --> 00:46:47,790
theory.

1387
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:50,040
And we've talked a lot
about the supernovae.

1388
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,910
You could talk just as much about the
cosmic microwave background or about large

1389
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:56,700
scale clustering and the
comparison of simulations with,

1390
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:58,180
with redshift surveys.

1391
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:58,650
Uh,

1392
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,930
we obviously aren't going
to have time to do it,

1393
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:05,130
but this plot summarizes what
we know about the universe.

1394
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:05,970
Okay.

1395
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:06,450
Thanks.
