1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,040
Some things about this course.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,710
This is a course for non scientists.

3
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:05,220
Uh,

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,840
that portion of the,

5
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,220
uh,

6
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:08,053
enrollment,

7
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:09,300
uh,

8
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,160
policies is not a suggestion.

9
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:13,320
I really don't want science
majors in this class.

10
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:14,700
If you are a science major,

11
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,210
I'm going to notice because that's one
of the things that appears on the class

12
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:19,470
list what your major is.

13
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:19,951
Uh,

14
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:20,390
so,

15
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,670
uh,

16
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,000
uh,

17
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,390
don't,

18
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,250
don't take the course if
you're a science major.

19
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,900
Let me point out that,

20
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:25,080
uh,

21
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,441
pardon me,

22
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:26,370
that freshmen,

23
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,090
uh,

24
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,170
don't have a major.

25
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,330
So it doesn't matter if you
intend to be a science major,

26
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:32,730
if you're,

27
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,481
if you're a freshman,

28
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:34,770
if you are a science major,

29
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,090
uh,

30
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,870
I recommend astro to 10,

31
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,550
which is being given this term.

32
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,240
I have a,

33
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,720
a little handout on all the different
introductory astronomy courses,

34
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,100
uh,

35
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,790
at the front of the room
if you're interested.

36
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,983
Um,

37
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,303
let's see.

38
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,443
Uh,

39
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,610
it is also true that this
course is kind of intended,

40
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:54,180
uh,

41
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,380
for non science majors who have a
certain basic high school level,

42
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,480
a comfort with,

43
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:00,810
uh,

44
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,790
sort of 10th grade science and math.

45
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,330
If you're extremely phobic
about these kinds of things.

46
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:09,180
I would say that astronomy one 20,

47
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,430
while it has a similar level of math,

48
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:11,910
uh,

49
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,260
has a somewhat shallower learning
curve and a somewhat deeper safety net.

50
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:19,950
So if you're the kind of person who
breaks into a sweat when somebody writes

51
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:22,680
down in equal sign a checkout one 20,

52
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,843
um,

53
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,470
let's see.

54
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,303
Uh,

55
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:29,820
but that's not the biggest difference
between this class and one 20.

56
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:30,150
Uh,

57
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,920
I think the biggest difference is,

58
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:32,370
uh,

59
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,050
what the class is trying to do.

60
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:34,430
Uh,

61
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:38,520
astronomy one 20 and also one 10 and
on other courses in our department and

62
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:42,210
elsewhere in the university
are basically survey courses.

63
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,950
Most introductory science courses,

64
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,030
our survey courses,

65
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:47,580
they cover a fairly wide subject matter.

66
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,560
This isn't that what this
course is supposed to do is
we're going to talk about

67
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:54,570
three particular topics,

68
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,320
uh,

69
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,480
in very considerable detail,

70
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:03,260
enough detail so that by the end of
our discussion you'll understand what's

71
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:07,290
going on in current
research in this topic.

72
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:07,711
Uh,

73
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,610
antibody current,

74
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:10,080
I don't need this decade.

75
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:10,501
I mean,

76
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:11,334
this week,

77
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,210
uh,

78
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,430
astronomy is in a,

79
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,520
currently in a stage of,

80
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,170
of very rapid advancement.

81
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:16,771
Uh,

82
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:17,191
and,

83
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:17,311
uh,

84
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:20,520
one of the things that's happened every
time I've taught this course in the past

85
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,220
is that at some point during the semester,

86
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,850
someone will publish some piece of
research which changes some aspect of the

87
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:27,684
curriculum.

88
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,540
I'll come in waving some paper
and everything will be changed.

89
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,291
Uh,

90
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:31,951
and uh,

91
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,510
I can't guarantee that of course,

92
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:34,650
cause I can't predict the future,

93
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:36,210
but it's happened every time in the past.

94
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,920
So we really are trying to get you all
the way out to the frontiers of the

95
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:41,754
subject.

96
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,530
I think this is actually a better approach
for non science majors because after

97
00:02:46,531 --> 00:02:46,980
all,

98
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,960
we live in the Internet age.

99
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,260
Uh,

100
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,980
if you want to find out a bunch of
facts about some scientific topic,

101
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,200
uh,

102
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,770
you can go online and go
to Wikipedia or wherever.

103
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:57,060
Look these facts up.

104
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,710
That's not a big problem.

105
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,200
The problem comes when there are two
sets of facts which directly contradict

106
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:05,470
each other.

107
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:05,621
Uh,

108
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:07,840
this happens quite frequently in a,

109
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:10,030
in scientific topics these days,

110
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,890
particularly those with kind of
a political or moral overtones.

111
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:15,341
And you get,

112
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,560
you get facts that directly
contradict each other.

113
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,210
And what are you supposed
to do about that?

114
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,433
Um,

115
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:25,770
what I'm hoping is that by talking about
situations in which the fact at the

116
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:27,820
moment really aren't known yet,

117
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,450
you can develop some
skill in interpreting,

118
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,590
uh,

119
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,990
these kinds of contradictory
facts for yourself.

120
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,760
If you don't do that,

121
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:40,510
then the only alternative is to listen
to the experts argue with each other and

122
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:44,230
vote for whoever argues the loudest or,

123
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:44,920
uh,

124
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,970
looks the best when they're doing it or
has a degree from Harvard or whatever it

125
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:49,570
is.

126
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:49,931
Uh,

127
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:50,531
and uh,

128
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,970
you guys can do better than that.

129
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:52,780
Uh,

130
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,780
and so the hope is that by practicing
this kind of skill of evaluating science

131
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:01,540
when the answer isn't fully understood,

132
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,750
that you can develop skills that will
snatch you in good stead when you run into

133
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:12,151
scientific controversies in a political
context or legal context or just as

134
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,410
ordinary citizens in the
course of your lives.

135
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,143
Uh,

136
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,990
it also happens that the
three particular topics,

137
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:20,520
uh,

138
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,610
I think are of some,

139
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,090
uh,

140
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:25,030
some real interest in
importance in themselves.

141
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,110
Um,

142
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,800
and I'll get to the three topics
again in just a moment here,

143
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:33,190
but let me point out that this kind
of approach has a downside to it.

144
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,910
And this has been pointed out repeatedly
on course evaluations because we're

145
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:37,840
dealing with stuff,

146
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,350
uh,

147
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:40,900
which ultimately the answers
are not yet understood.

148
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,070
There's no textbook,

149
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,750
there can't be a textbook.

150
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,270
We haven't figured out what
to put in the textbooks yet.

151
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,190
And the problem with that is that that
makes the lectures very important because

152
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,840
that's the only information
you're going to get.

153
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:54,880
There's a whole bunch of
online readings and stuff,

154
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:56,410
but they tend to have a point of view.

155
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,071
Uh,

156
00:04:57,071 --> 00:05:00,220
and so it's really the lectures
that are the basis of the course.

157
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,450
The problem with that is that I've
chosen to give this course at the ungodly

158
00:05:04,451 --> 00:05:06,370
early hour of nine 30 in the morning,

159
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,800
and you guys aren't
going to have to show up.

160
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,281
Uh,

161
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:10,810
and so here's the deal.

162
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,920
I make a deal with you.

163
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,820
Your job is to get to class
by nine 30 in the morning.

164
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,910
My job is to keep you
awake once you're here.

165
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:19,930
Okay.

166
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,190
And so if we both succeed in
a cooperating in this sense,

167
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:24,731
uh,

168
00:05:24,731 --> 00:05:25,690
we'll probably,

169
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:26,950
we'll probably be okay.

170
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:27,251
But,

171
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:27,971
but seriously,

172
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:28,781
if you're a,

173
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:32,680
if you're anticipating regular
difficulties in getting to class,

174
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:36,520
this is not actually a great class to
take because there's no backup in the form

175
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:37,354
of a textbook.

176
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,340
All right?

177
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,880
Uh,

178
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,520
the particular topics
that are under discussion,

179
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:44,290
I've listed them here in green.

180
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,393
Um,

181
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,100
the first of them are extra solar planets,

182
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:51,310
by which I mean planets around
stars other than the sun.

183
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,800
It's well known that there are many,

184
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:54,970
many of these planets.

185
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:58,580
All you have to do is watch star
trek or something like that.

186
00:05:58,581 --> 00:05:59,091
And you'll,

187
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:00,020
you'll find many,

188
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:00,920
many examples.

189
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:04,760
And this has been a staple of science
fiction for quite a long time.

190
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,440
Oddly enough,

191
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,030
until 10 years ago,

192
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:10,370
there was absolutely no evidence for this.

193
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,600
We assumed that because the stars are
normal star and there are many other stars

194
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,480
of the sun is a normal star and there
are many other stars like the sun,

195
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,310
that there must be many planets,

196
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:19,930
uh,

197
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,690
of the same kind as the planet in our
own sort of the solar system circling

198
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:24,890
around all these other stars.

199
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,600
But until 1995,

200
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:29,450
there was not one bit of
evidence to support that idea.

201
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,610
Since 1995,

202
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:34,400
this has become a huge
growth industry and research.

203
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:35,870
And we now know of hunt,

204
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,550
literally hundreds of planet,

205
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,070
all of them discovered
in the last 10 years.

206
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,810
And so this is a situation in which what
10 years ago was science fiction has

207
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:46,100
become science fact.

208
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:46,670
And,

209
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:46,851
uh,

210
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:50,690
we're very rapidly trying to figure out
exactly what kinds of planets these are,

211
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:52,850
whether there are earth
like planets out there,

212
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:53,510
uh,

213
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,021
and,

214
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:54,111
uh,

215
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,960
that has some bearing on what
the science fiction people,

216
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,010
uh,

217
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,620
refer to when they say
as life as we know it.

218
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,280
Uh,

219
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,180
and so that's,

220
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:02,990
uh,

221
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,310
currently one of the,

222
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,530
one of the hottest topics in astronomy.

223
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,243
Uh,

224
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,430
the next topic is going to be black holes.

225
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,110
And this is a similar situation.

226
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:12,651
Uh,

227
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:13,071
15,

228
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:13,761
20 years ago,

229
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:18,350
black holes were sort of
poised precariously on the
boundary between theoretical

230
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,850
physics and science fiction.

231
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,210
Uh,

232
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,820
a boundary that is more
porous than you might believe.

233
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,630
Uh,

234
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,441
but again,

235
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:25,940
in the past 15 years or so,

236
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:29,960
this has been converted it to a standard
topic and observational astronomy.

237
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:30,921
There are dozens,

238
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,680
probably hundreds of objects we
can point to in this guy and say,

239
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:34,250
yes,

240
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,720
those things are black holes.

241
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,610
And so,

242
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:36,890
uh,

243
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,170
now the current topic of research is,

244
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:39,620
uh,

245
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:44,620
do these things that we are pretty sure
are black holes actually behave in the

246
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:49,520
incredibly bizarre science fictiony manner
that the theoretical physicists have

247
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:51,890
been talking about for
the past 30 or 40 years.

248
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,401
And so,

249
00:07:52,401 --> 00:07:57,401
to what extent are these very
exotic behaviors actually
manifested in real life?

250
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:58,851
Finally,

251
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:00,770
I want to talk a little
bit about cosmology.

252
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,200
Cosmology is the study of
the universe as a whole.

253
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,200
That's too big a topic
to go into in depth.

254
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:07,820
So I've picked one piece of it.

255
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,271
Uh,

256
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:09,950
the pick piece I've picked is,

257
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,143
uh,

258
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,590
the existence which was discovered in
the late 1990s of something called dark

259
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,340
energy.

260
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,960
Dark energy is a,

261
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,570
uh,

262
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:20,760
an all pervading antigravity.

263
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,250
It's a repulsive force,

264
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:22,640
uh,

265
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,760
that turns out to occupied
essentially all of the universe.

266
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And 75% or more of the entire mass energy
of the universe turns out to be in the

267
00:08:32,031 --> 00:08:34,130
form of this mysterious dark energy.

268
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:34,581
Uh,

269
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:34,840
the,

270
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,120
Eh,

271
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,190
the evidence for this comes largely,

272
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:40,970
but not entirely from observations
of a certain kind of Supernova.

273
00:08:40,971 --> 00:08:42,800
And so what I'm going to focus on is the,

274
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,310
uh,

275
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:47,690
observations of the supernovae and
how they demonstrated that in fact,

276
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:52,310
all ordinary matter and energy and
so forth is a tiny fraction of what's

277
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:53,630
actually going on in the universe.

278
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,730
And what's really happening out there
is something we totally don't begin to

279
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:57,564
understand.

280
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,051
Uh,

281
00:08:58,051 --> 00:08:58,650
and so,

282
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:58,801
uh,

283
00:08:58,801 --> 00:09:01,200
that will be the third
topic of the course.

284
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,540
These topics have something in common.

285
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:09,290
All of them involve observing something
that you can't actually see directly.

286
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,580
We don't see these planets directly,

287
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:11,940
uh,

288
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,770
because they're too
faint and too far away.

289
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,550
Uh,

290
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:18,000
we don't see black holes directly
by the definition of black hole.

291
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:20,250
You can't see these things directly.

292
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:20,701
And of course,

293
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:21,600
dark energy,

294
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,050
uh,

295
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:24,600
by its very name is also undetectable.

296
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:26,670
So how do we know that
these things are there?

297
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,740
And the answer is we know that they're
there because of their influence on other

298
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:36,570
objects that we can see and in particular
their gravitational influence on other

299
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:37,890
objects that we can see.

300
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,770
And so what binds these
three topics together?

301
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,071
Our,

302
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,030
first of all,

303
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:42,540
uh,

304
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,230
the fact that the observational techniques
to discover them or actually actually

305
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:47,580
quite similar to each other,

306
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,121
uh,

307
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:48,960
and second,

308
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,063
um,

309
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:50,940
that,

310
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,360
uh,

311
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,450
they all involve different
manifestations of gravity.

312
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,280
And so,

313
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:55,470
uh,

314
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:59,640
we'll be talking in the first part of
the course about a Newtonian gravity,

315
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,090
uh,

316
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,570
in the second part of the course when
we get to black holes that relativistic

317
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:04,141
gravity,

318
00:10:04,141 --> 00:10:05,190
general relativity,

319
00:10:05,191 --> 00:10:06,024
newtons,

320
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,020
Einstein's theory,

321
00:10:07,021 --> 00:10:08,670
which supplanted Newton's theory.

322
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:09,151
Uh,

323
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,190
and then by the time
we get to dark energy,

324
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:11,671
uh,

325
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:16,671
it may not even be correctly described
by Einstein's work and we may be in the

326
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,840
area of whole new kinds of physics that
the theorists haven't even thought about

327
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:22,430
yet.

328
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,670
And so there will be a progression to
more and more sophisticated theories of

329
00:10:26,671 --> 00:10:29,160
gravity underlying these observations.

330
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,923
Um,

331
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,400
okay.

332
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:32,760
Uh,

333
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,010
there's another feature that these,

334
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:35,310
uh,

335
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,660
topics have in common,

336
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,260
uh,

337
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,670
and that is that they can be
understood in some detail,

338
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,360
uh,

339
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,193
without,

340
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,033
uh,

341
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,800
without particularly
sophisticated mathematics.

342
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,490
Now,

343
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,280
let me pause here and say
some things about math.

344
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,383
Uh,

345
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,550
astronomy is a mathematical topic.

346
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,650
There will be math in this course.

347
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,730
There ought to be math in any astronomy
course or it isn't really an astronomy

348
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:00,061
course,

349
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:01,140
it's just a slideshow.

350
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,393
Um,

351
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,380
now the math in this course has been
kept at a deliberately low level.

352
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,890
That is to say the kinds of math we'll
be doing is stuff you did in ninth and

353
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:11,724
10th grade,

354
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:11,971
uh,

355
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,070
introductory high school Algebra,

356
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,420
high school geometry.

357
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:18,120
I think we take the sign of
an angle a couple of times,

358
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:19,200
but it almost bunny.

359
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,310
But in the one case,

360
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:21,900
it cancels out almost immediately.

361
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:23,640
So don't let that scare you.

362
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,673
Uh,

363
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,140
and it's the kind of thing that
you all did on the math sats.

364
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:29,580
And since you're all sitting in this room,

365
00:11:29,581 --> 00:11:30,630
you must have done okay.

366
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:31,230
Right?

367
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,063
Um,

368
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,930
having said that,

369
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:34,790
uh,

370
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:39,480
I have discovered that saying that is
misleading and the reason it's misleading

371
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,670
is cast your mind back to ninth grade.

372
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,980
Ninth grade math is hard.

373
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:44,761
Okay.

374
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:45,560
Remember,

375
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:45,910
uh,

376
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,990
in particular word problems are hard.

377
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:49,920
And uh,

378
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,970
you remember word problems.

379
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:52,980
This is where you drive from
here to Cleveland and you,

380
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,020
your tank up with gas and the
gas costs so much per gallon.

381
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:58,060
And the question is what is
your shoe size or something?

382
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:58,811
Uh,

383
00:11:58,811 --> 00:11:59,644
and uh,

384
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:03,910
you all but the way one approaches that
is through a co kind of common sense

385
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:04,301
approach,

386
00:12:04,301 --> 00:12:08,530
which involves the fact that many of us
have been in a car driving from city a

387
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:09,221
to city B,

388
00:12:09,221 --> 00:12:10,960
perhaps not Cleveland but somewhere else.

389
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,670
And so you have a kind of intuition to
fall back on when you do math problems

390
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:19,900
that are logically the same but applied
to astrophysical systems for which you

391
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:22,300
have absolutely no common sense,

392
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:22,780
uh,

393
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,770
to back you up,

394
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,700
then you have to reason purely from
the internal logic of the problem.

395
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,590
And that's hard to do.

396
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,300
It's a skill that can be learned.

397
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,070
It's a skill that's worth learning.

398
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,370
It's a skill that I'm sure many of
you already have to a large extent,

399
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:36,880
uh,

400
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,440
but it isn't an easy thing.

401
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,450
And so the fact that the level of the
math is low doesn't mean that the problems

402
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:44,284
are easy.

403
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,830
Uh,

404
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,401
and,

405
00:12:45,401 --> 00:12:46,234
uh,

406
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:46,511
uh,

407
00:12:46,511 --> 00:12:48,610
we do have a lot of help mechanisms,

408
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:50,320
which I'll describe perhaps on Thursday,

409
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:50,890
uh,

410
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,723
to keep you,

411
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,480
uh,

412
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,720
to keep you up to speed if you start
having trouble with these things.

413
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,303
Um,

414
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,001
okay,

415
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:00,160
so I should say something
about course requirements here.

416
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:00,994
Let's see.

417
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:01,360
Uh,

418
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,070
we have sections in this class.

419
00:13:03,071 --> 00:13:05,830
These sections are not just
problem solving sections.

420
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:07,270
These are actually required.

421
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:07,660
Uh,

422
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,910
the fact that we're dealing in topics,

423
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,451
uh,

424
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:13,840
for which the answer isn't fully
known means that one can actually have

425
00:13:13,841 --> 00:13:15,130
discussion sections,

426
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:16,450
unlike many science courses.

427
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:17,440
So we're going to do that.

428
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:17,891
Uh,

429
00:13:17,891 --> 00:13:19,250
and so the structure of the courses,

430
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,140
like a history course,

431
00:13:20,141 --> 00:13:22,480
two lectures a week plus required section,

432
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,000
and so 10% of your grade
comes from sections.

433
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,700
A large fraction of
that is just showing up.

434
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,210
Uh,

435
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,190
but they'll also be something in terms of,

436
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:30,670
you know,

437
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,000
uh,

438
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,950
saying something intelligent
once you get there.

439
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,023
Um,

440
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,650
that's 10% of the course,

441
00:13:35,651 --> 00:13:36,730
30% of the courses,

442
00:13:36,731 --> 00:13:37,511
problem sets.

443
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:39,250
We will have these things out once a week.

444
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:39,581
Uh,

445
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:42,670
the first problem set
will show up on Thursday.

446
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,600
And if you have any question about whether
this course is appropriate for you,

447
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:50,560
the right thing to do is to look at
that problem set and ask yourself,

448
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:51,341
is this reasonable?

449
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:53,050
I will say that,

450
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,251
uh,

451
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:55,690
students on their evaluations
have pointed out that it does.

452
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,070
The course does get harder.

453
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,100
It's not that the math
gets more complicated,

454
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,320
but the situations get more complicated.

455
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:02,990
And so,

456
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:03,280
uh,

457
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,310
if you have serious trouble
with the first problem set,

458
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:07,750
that's probably a warning sign.

459
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:08,201
As I say,

460
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:09,670
that will be handed out on Thursday.

461
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,031
Uh,

462
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:11,650
these things come about once a week.

463
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,880
It's 30% of the grade.

464
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,770
I'll say more about problem sets later.

465
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:15,410
Uh,

466
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,270
on Thursday,

467
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,640
30% comes from two midterm exams.

468
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:22,390
The way we do this is the one where
you get the better score counts 20%.

469
00:14:22,391 --> 00:14:23,081
The one that you get,

470
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:24,730
the worst score counts 10%.

471
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:28,030
So that gives you a little bit of a
break and then there'll be a final exam.

472
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:29,920
That's the last 30% of the class.

473
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,470
There's also an optional paper.

474
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,910
If you choose to do that,

475
00:14:33,911 --> 00:14:35,890
that will count 15% of your grade.

476
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,080
And what it will do is it will de wait,

477
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,260
whichever the worst of your 30% parts
of your grade are back down to 15%.

478
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,660
So,

479
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:44,950
uh,

480
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,700
if you're a word person
rather than a number person,

481
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,091
a,

482
00:14:49,091 --> 00:14:50,710
you get this opportunity to,

483
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,110
uh,

484
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,700
to augment your score.

485
00:14:52,701 --> 00:14:53,720
And d wait,

486
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:54,261
uh,

487
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:57,770
some other part of the class in
which you may have done less?

488
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,683
Well,

489
00:14:59,020 --> 00:14:59,630
uh,

490
00:14:59,630 --> 00:14:59,901
yeah,

491
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:02,000
all of this stuff is
on the classes server.

492
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,400
I should say that the uh,

493
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,940
syllabus that I've put out here is
just a direct copy off of what's on the

494
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:08,731
glasses servers.

495
00:15:08,731 --> 00:15:09,320
So,

496
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,710
uh,

497
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,790
feel free to,

498
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,300
uh,

499
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,021
to take that.

500
00:15:12,021 --> 00:15:14,990
But all the information and
actually more information,

501
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:15,680
uh,

502
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,311
is a,

503
00:15:16,311 --> 00:15:17,144
is online.

504
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,033
Okay.

505
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,470
Let me pause now and ask whether there
are questions about the course and the

506
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:25,640
course procedures.

507
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,253
Yes.

508
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,050
Some sort of notation that

509
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,160
could indicate that there is another,

510
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,120
uh,

511
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,370
another of these stress
at a different time.

512
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:44,770
Uh,

513
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,250
no,

514
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:45,461
no,

515
00:15:45,461 --> 00:15:46,870
this class is going to meet now.

516
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,770
Uh,

517
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,690
I'll have to check and see
what you were thinking of,

518
00:15:49,691 --> 00:15:52,480
but it may be that what that was
referring to was section times,

519
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:54,400
and actually this is something
that I haven't mentioned.

520
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,780
Sections are required.

521
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,400
They're all going to be on Mondays.

522
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,980
We're going to have a wide range of times,

523
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:03,340
all of them on Monday's from
1230 till I think eight at night.

524
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:03,880
Uh,

525
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,820
but you do have to sign up for a section.

526
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,910
Let me also say,

527
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,361
uh,

528
00:16:07,361 --> 00:16:07,750
I've,

529
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,650
I've mentioned here,

530
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,891
uh,

531
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:11,830
I don't think this is actually
looking at the number of people here.

532
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:13,750
I think we're going to be
able to accommodate everyone,

533
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:16,000
including including juniors and seniors.

534
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:16,360
Uh,

535
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,470
but I did set it up in such a way that
freshmen and sophomores get first crack.

536
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:20,930
Uh,

537
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,190
the way that's going to
work is this section,

538
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,020
the online section e
form opens up on Mondays,

539
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,173
Monday,

540
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:27,611
uh,

541
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:31,870
and juniors and seniors won't be allowed
to officially register for the class

542
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:32,920
until Tuesday.

543
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,920
So the freshmen and sophomores
get to fill up the sections first.

544
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:36,640
Uh,

545
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,750
my guess is again,

546
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:40,570
looking at the number of people here
today that we won't have any problem and

547
00:16:40,571 --> 00:16:42,040
that if you're a junior or a senior,

548
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:42,581
uh,

549
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:43,060
you'll,

550
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,830
you'll get in just fine.

551
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,053
Um,

552
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,171
and,

553
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:47,350
uh,

554
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,561
yeah.

555
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:49,540
And so we'll be picking
sections through the,

556
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,880
through what is now the standard
online sectioning thing,

557
00:16:51,881 --> 00:16:53,710
which is going to open
for business next Monday.

558
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,660
Uh,

559
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,110
I'll check the website and see if,

560
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:56,470
if,

561
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,330
if that's actually what you meant.

562
00:16:58,331 --> 00:16:58,811
But it may,

563
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:00,040
it may have been something else.

564
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,713
Other questions?

565
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,351
Oh,

566
00:17:02,351 --> 00:17:03,184
okay.

567
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,630
Other questions?

568
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,890
Let me in general just
encourage you to ask questions.

569
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:12,380
I know that that's hard to
do in a big lecture setting.

570
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:12,830
Uh,

571
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,560
but we have an advantage
over over other courses,

572
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:16,940
particularly science courses.

573
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,130
We're not trying to prepare you for
the astronomy part of the m cats.

574
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:21,770
Okay.

575
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,950
So we don't have to cover
a specific syllabus.

576
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,980
We're not even trying
to follow a textbook.

577
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:28,401
Uh,

578
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:30,800
and so we have a little more leeway than,

579
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,570
than is ordinarily true,

580
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,230
uh,

581
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:35,560
to ask questions and
going weird directions.

582
00:17:35,561 --> 00:17:36,980
So please feel free to do that.

583
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:37,491
Uh,

584
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:38,690
I reserve the right to,

585
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,310
to put a question off into,

586
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:41,170
into the future or,

587
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:41,251
or,

588
00:17:41,251 --> 00:17:41,570
or,

589
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:41,930
or,

590
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:42,121
you know,

591
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:43,430
to discussion section or something.

592
00:17:43,431 --> 00:17:44,570
But do by all means ask,

593
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:45,170
we have,

594
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,400
we have some freedom of action.

595
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,473
Yes.

596
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:50,180
An

597
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,140
early final.

598
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,540
Let me think about that.

599
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,320
Uh,

600
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,930
I prefer to avoid it because then
I have to invent another final.

601
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,780
The problem with that is trying
to make them come out even.

602
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:00,890
Uh,

603
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,940
I will say this,

604
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,920
that if I do an early final,

605
00:18:03,921 --> 00:18:06,320
I'm probably going to around
the side of making it hard.

606
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,280
Uh,

607
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,200
but it's very hard to
make them come out even.

608
00:18:09,201 --> 00:18:09,410
But,

609
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:09,710
but,

610
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,570
but let me think about that.

611
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,670
Other questions?

612
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:16,803
Yes.

613
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,380
Like discussing things or
is it going to be like,

614
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:21,811
uh,

615
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:22,750
it's going to be some of the,

616
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:25,410
so the question is what are the
discussion section is going to be like,

617
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:29,220
are there going to be discussion of the
problem of the problem sets or is it

618
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:31,650
going to be sort of general
discussion of the course material?

619
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:33,380
And the answer is both a,

620
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:37,650
I think there will both in
any given discussion section
that we'll probably both

621
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:42,090
be an opportunity to talk about the
previous problem set and to clarify things

622
00:18:42,091 --> 00:18:43,410
about the next problem set.

623
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:43,890
Uh,

624
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,530
and also some kind of activity
that sort of extends an advances,

625
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:48,720
uh,

626
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,250
what we've been talking about in class.

627
00:18:50,251 --> 00:18:52,080
So I'm hoping to do some of both.

628
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,930
If we veer too much in
either one direction,

629
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,530
uh,

630
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:56,940
that's probably not a good thing.

631
00:18:56,941 --> 00:18:59,970
There'll be other ways
of getting help as well.

632
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:00,370
Uh,

633
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,510
if you start to have trouble on the
problem sets are in the course generally.

634
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,340
I'll talk about those a
little bit on Thursday.

635
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,683
Yes sir.

636
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,130
How are problem sets
graded a very carefully.

637
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:11,880
Uh,

638
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,630
let's see.

639
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,410
Um,

640
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,330
I think we'll probably,

641
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,600
uh,

642
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,470
it'll probably be on a
kind of zero to 20 point,

643
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,250
uh,

644
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:20,700
uh,

645
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,391
scheduled but,

646
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:23,130
but let me say this about the problem set.

647
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,640
They're going to be two kinds
of things on the problem sets.

648
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,130
One are kind of quantitative
problems which have a right answer.

649
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:29,580
Uh,

650
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,210
those are relatively easy to grade
on some kind of a point scale.

651
00:19:33,211 --> 00:19:34,860
You give partial credit and so forth.

652
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,073
Uh,

653
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,440
but we will also,

654
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:41,250
because this is a course that's not
only about the specifics of this topic,

655
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:43,020
but also about science in general.

656
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:46,800
We're also going to have things that
look kind of like essay questions on the

657
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:47,634
problem sets.

658
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,530
Those are a little harder
to grade in this way,

659
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:50,311
but we've got a great,

660
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:52,440
I'm in the same way so that
we can add the points up.

661
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,580
Uh,

662
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,331
and uh,

663
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:56,970
I'll talk a little bit more
about how those are graded.

664
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:57,990
I will say one thing,

665
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:02,991
one thing that we do is we make sure that
each problem is graded by each problem

666
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:06,420
or essay is graded by one ta or by myself,

667
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,880
so that we don't have different people.

668
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,260
So that if you're in a section,

669
00:20:10,261 --> 00:20:11,370
it's not like your,

670
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:11,940
uh,

671
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,900
all the problem sets for that section
are all graded by your section leader and

672
00:20:15,901 --> 00:20:17,190
some other section leader grades,

673
00:20:17,191 --> 00:20:18,880
all the other problems because that,

674
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,970
that leads to imbalances of various kinds.

675
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:21,541
So we're,

676
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:22,270
we're,

677
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,620
we assign each problem to a
specific person for the whole class.

678
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,101
Uh,

679
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:27,340
but it's basically a,

680
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:29,130
a zero through 20 scale.

681
00:20:29,131 --> 00:20:33,360
Although what that means varies depending
on what kind of a problem it is.

682
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,160
I'll say a little bit more about that.

683
00:20:35,161 --> 00:20:36,060
I will also say,

684
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:36,461
uh,

685
00:20:36,461 --> 00:20:40,830
there's a rather detailed lateness policy
that's linked to the classes server.

686
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,850
Please read that.

687
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,361
Uh,

688
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:43,500
we're going to stick to it.

689
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,101
Uh,

690
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:47,160
and one of the features of that is
that there will be answer sheets.

691
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:47,440
Uh,

692
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,090
problem sets are typically due Thursday.

693
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:51,490
There'll be an answer sheet
up the following Tuesday.

694
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:51,881
Uh,

695
00:20:51,881 --> 00:20:55,600
so if you don't get it done
by five days after it to do a,

696
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:57,670
you're toast because
the answers are posted.

697
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,950
Other questions?

698
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,020
Great.

699
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,853
Let's start.

700
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:06,541
This is,

701
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:07,500
this is very cool.

702
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,513
Um,

703
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,503
all right.

704
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,010
This is going to be all kinds of fun.

705
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,103
Alright.

706
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,133
Uh,

707
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,873
planets,

708
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,440
planets around other stars,

709
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:21,670
but planets in general.

710
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,330
So let's start by talking
a little bit about orbits,

711
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,470
planetary orbit.

712
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,523
And

713
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,450
you probably know some of the story.

714
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,280
Originally in the old days,

715
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,510
people used to think that the earth
was the center of the universe.

716
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:48,040
So the earth was at the middle and
planets went around them in circles.

717
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,420
Oh,

718
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,600
that's not much of a circle,

719
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:50,470
but you know what I mean?

720
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,520
Uh,

721
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,010
and so everything was
circles around the earth.

722
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,180
Uh,

723
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,220
and that's what planet did,

724
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:57,760
uh,

725
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,080
where planets also included to
the way their way of thinking,

726
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,240
the sun and the moon as well.

727
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:05,283
Uh,

728
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,330
and so you had these
circles around the earth.

729
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:08,110
This is a,

730
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,770
this is what's called the geocentric
model earth at the middle,

731
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,670
and it's associated with the name
of a Greek astronomer named Ptolemy.

732
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,410
Uh,

733
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:20,380
and the problem with this
model is very simple,

734
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,393
namely,

735
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,530
that if you actually go out and observe
where the planets and the sun and the

736
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,070
moon are night after night after night,

737
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,600
it doesn't work very well.

738
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:29,381
Uh,

739
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,390
so this doesn't fit the observations,

740
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,270
doesn't fit observations.

741
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,071
So they said,

742
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:36,840
all right,

743
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,300
uh,

744
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,040
well maybe that doesn't
work all that well.

745
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:39,520
Uh,

746
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,320
so what we'll do is instead of imagining
that the planets are on circles around

747
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:44,860
the earth,

748
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,790
we'll imagine that there are circles on
circles around the earth and the planets

749
00:22:48,791 --> 00:22:49,624
go on those.

750
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,670
So,

751
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:50,980
uh,

752
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,350
when you add a kind of extra circle here,

753
00:22:53,351 --> 00:22:57,580
so the circle goes around the earth and
the planet goes around on that circle.

754
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,400
Uh,

755
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,850
the circles were called epicycles.

756
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:01,983
So,

757
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,033
uh,

758
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:08,250
add epicycles and uh,

759
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,900
what happened is they would
add an epicycle and then they,

760
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,580
then they go out and observe some more.

761
00:23:12,581 --> 00:23:14,520
And in particular the Arab astronomers,

762
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:15,311
a thousand years ago,

763
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:16,031
a thousand years ago,

764
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:18,010
the center of all science was,

765
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:18,490
uh,

766
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:18,820
uh,

767
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,320
was in,

768
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,120
uh,

769
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,390
I think the Arab countries,

770
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,560
they gave us all there.

771
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:24,880
All our star names by the way,

772
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:25,714
are in Arabic.

773
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,480
Uh,

774
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,940
so our mathematical
techniques such as Algebra a,

775
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,440
and that's all comes from the Arabs.

776
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,330
They knew what they were doing back then,

777
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:34,781
uh,

778
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:35,270
when,

779
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:35,560
uh,

780
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,510
the Europeans were kind of in squalor,

781
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:37,851
uh,

782
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:40,420
and they made these great observations
and every time they made more

783
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:41,260
observations,

784
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,363
uh,

785
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,150
uh,

786
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,620
it turned out it didn't fit.

787
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:46,280
So they had to add more epicycles.

788
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:50,990
So then they added one here and one
here and so on until you had circles and

789
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:52,520
circles and circles and circles,

790
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,250
uh,

791
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,330
in order to explain the observation.

792
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,713
And so,

793
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:57,940
uh,

794
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,510
add epicycles repeatedly.

795
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,021
Uh,

796
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:05,021
and this is kind of unsatisfying because
it's not a good thing where every time

797
00:24:05,031 --> 00:24:07,280
you get more or better observations,

798
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,620
you have to revise and extend your theory.

799
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,720
That's not such a great theory.

800
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:12,231
And in fact,

801
00:24:12,231 --> 00:24:15,890
the word epicycles has now become a
kind of a swear word in the scientific

802
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:16,640
community,

803
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:16,880
uh,

804
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:17,750
meaning a,

805
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,510
a sort of theory that
has become so complex.

806
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:22,750
It's just ridiculous and you
don't want to believe it anymore.

807
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,330
And so,

808
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:23,571
you know,

809
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:25,100
someone will come up with some really,

810
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:28,880
really seemingly sophisticated
but very complicated theory.

811
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,170
And if you don't like that,

812
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:30,650
you Jessica,

813
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:30,981
ah,

814
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:33,050
that's just epicycles to forget about it.

815
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,273
Um,

816
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:35,601
and,

817
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:35,721
uh,

818
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:37,580
so this has become a
little bit of a swear word.

819
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:39,470
Uh,

820
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,400
and it was unsatisfactory at the time.

821
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:44,990
All right.

822
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,310
Now let me pause for a moment and confess
that the story I've just told you,

823
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:52,760
which is the standard story
about Ptolemaic epicycles,

824
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,760
uh,

825
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,593
years.

826
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:55,340
Well,

827
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:59,210
it has what I think cold bear
would refer to as truthiness.

828
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,333
Uh,

829
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:00,780
it's,

830
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,250
it's a commonly told story
that people like to believe.

831
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,590
But if you talk to the
historians of science,

832
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,420
this isn't actually how it happened.

833
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,290
Uh,

834
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,340
and in fact,

835
00:25:10,341 --> 00:25:12,440
this idea of circles
and circles and circles,

836
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,420
that isn't the way epicycles work.

837
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,260
They had circles and it did get
more complicated every time they,

838
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,790
they fit the observations,

839
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,540
uh,

840
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,460
but not by adding more and more circles.

841
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,260
They would move the circle side to side.

842
00:25:24,261 --> 00:25:28,190
They would have things going at
variable speeds around the circle,

843
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:29,120
all sorts of things.

844
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:29,630
Uh,

845
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,260
but this,

846
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,240
this little picture that
I've just drawn here,

847
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:32,691
uh,

848
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:35,030
has a kind of truthiness to it.

849
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:35,570
Uh,

850
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:40,100
and I would say that this is a general
issue with the way scientists describe

851
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:41,390
how science works.

852
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,370
We tell these nice anecdotes,

853
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:43,881
uh,

854
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:45,620
and we put them in the textbooks to,

855
00:25:45,621 --> 00:25:48,620
in the little bars that go
down the side of the textbook,

856
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:49,130
you know,

857
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,760
where you get the head and shoulder shot
of the famous dead white male scientist

858
00:25:52,761 --> 00:25:53,540
and so forth.

859
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,081
Uh,

860
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:54,914
and uh,

861
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:55,251
uh,

862
00:25:55,251 --> 00:25:58,460
and then we tell these stories
and there's historians of science,

863
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,480
Hey,

864
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,940
this because it isn't
actually what happened.

865
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,991
Nevertheless,

866
00:26:02,991 --> 00:26:06,170
we persist in telling these stories and
I've been thinking about why that is.

867
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:06,640
Uh,

868
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,590
I think the way to,

869
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,570
to think about this is
what these stories are,

870
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:13,850
are fables and like any fable,

871
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,850
the point is not that the story is true.

872
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:22,090
The point is that it vividly illustrates
a moral which tells you how to behave

873
00:26:23,031 --> 00:26:24,560
or how not to behave.

874
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,220
Uh,

875
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,810
and they're useful for that reason.

876
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:29,600
You'll recall the famous fable
of the ant and the grasshopper,

877
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,080
right?

878
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,690
Grasshopper sings and plays
and dances all summer long.

879
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,160
The aunt is very industrious,

880
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:34,671
piles up,

881
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:35,840
food doesn't have any fun.

882
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,800
But then in the winter,

883
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:38,060
the grasshopper starves,

884
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:38,511
uh,

885
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:39,740
and the aunt does fine.

886
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,700
Uh,

887
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,980
and if an entomologist where
to come along and tape,

888
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,900
that's not how ants and
grasshoppers behave.

889
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:46,500
Uh,

890
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,230
you would correctly say that
he's missed the whole point.

891
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:54,270
And the point is that it's just a nice
story which illustrates a certain kinds

892
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:56,100
of behaviors and whether
they're good or bad.

893
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,690
So here's what I'm going to do.

894
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:59,250
I'm going to tell these stories,

895
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,570
but I'm going to label them fables
and I'm going to point out the morals

896
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:08,340
explicitly and the optional paper is going
to be to go and take any one of these

897
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:12,390
things and find out what really
happened and comment somewhat,

898
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:12,811
uh,

899
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:14,510
on the implications of what,

900
00:27:14,511 --> 00:27:15,510
of the real story.

901
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:15,961
For Science,

902
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:17,130
I should say that the biggest,

903
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:17,780
and uh,

904
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,240
and,

905
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:18,720
uh,

906
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,680
the biggest of these,

907
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,160
uh,

908
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,571
uh,

909
00:27:20,571 --> 00:27:24,090
of fables is probably the one about
Galileo and the Catholic Church,

910
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,080
right?

911
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,100
Where the Catholic Church,

912
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:26,200
oh,

913
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,180
presses the,

914
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:27,570
uh,

915
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:27,781
uh,

916
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:32,010
the pioneering scientist and the
scientist stands firm against this huge

917
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:36,150
impersonal bureaucracy in
the establishment trying to
squelch them and so forth.

918
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:36,541
Uh,

919
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:40,440
the truth of that is actually very subtle
and very interesting and I can't go

920
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:43,200
into it now among other things cause
I'm not a historian of science,

921
00:27:43,201 --> 00:27:44,730
I'm not the best person to talk about it.

922
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,230
But check that out sometime,

923
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:46,870
uh,

924
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,703
any,

925
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,930
any way,

926
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,740
uh,

927
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,740
for this particular set that this is
the fable of the Ptolemaic epicycles

928
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,330
epicycles

929
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,210
and the moral

930
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,140
yeah.

931
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,710
Is that simple theories are better

932
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,170
and you particularly don't like theories,

933
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:12,860
uh,

934
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,750
which get more and more complicated.

935
00:28:14,751 --> 00:28:16,960
The better and better your data become a,

936
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,740
I should say that the
word simple in there,

937
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,300
it turns out to have a technical meaning.

938
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:21,410
If you take a,

939
00:28:21,411 --> 00:28:22,970
if you take a statistics course,

940
00:28:22,971 --> 00:28:27,971
what I mean by simple is something that
has relatively few free parameters.

941
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,840
I'll just leave that at that.

942
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,700
You can go talk to the
statisticians about it.

943
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,193
Okay.

944
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,120
So if the,

945
00:28:35,121 --> 00:28:35,541
if the,

946
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:38,300
if your theory is getting
overwhelmed by epicycles,

947
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:41,750
then you'd better go out and come
up with some other better theory.

948
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,520
And so people tried to do that.

949
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:44,354
And the first,

950
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:44,960
uh,

951
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,220
step along the way was,

952
00:28:46,221 --> 00:28:46,551
of course,

953
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:47,540
Copernicus.

954
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,041
Copernicus,

955
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,600
as you probably recall,

956
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,050
uh,

957
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,260
decide that the geocentric model is wrong.

958
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:57,710
It things ought to be heliocentric
the sun in the middle.

959
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,070
So you put the sun in the
middle and everything,

960
00:29:01,071 --> 00:29:04,580
including the earth goes
in circles around the sun.

961
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,251
Uh,

962
00:29:07,251 --> 00:29:08,660
and this was revolutionary.

963
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,710
Uh,

964
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:10,370
and in fact,

965
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:15,000
the title of the book he published was
day Revolut Yoni boosts or Erbium Celeste

966
00:29:15,001 --> 00:29:15,500
drum,

967
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,730
which means of the,

968
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:21,170
of the revolutions in the sense of
revolving of the celestial spheres.

969
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:21,580
And,

970
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:25,610
and the use of that word
revolution is one of the things,

971
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,180
uh,

972
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,760
that pushed the word revolution
to its current meaning,

973
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,310
meaning overthrowing
authority in some ways.

974
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,440
Originally it just meant to revolve.

975
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,190
Uh,

976
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:34,641
but,

977
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:34,821
uh,

978
00:29:34,821 --> 00:29:39,230
this was so revolutionary that people
started to use the word and the other in

979
00:29:39,231 --> 00:29:40,064
the other way,

980
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,040
this actually as great a theory as you
might think because it's still needed.

981
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:47,140
Epicycles not as big,

982
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:49,150
not as many.

983
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,440
Uh,

984
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,440
but it didn't get rid of the problem with
epicycles and that didn't work itself

985
00:29:58,091 --> 00:30:00,190
out until a generation or two later.

986
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:00,820
Uh,

987
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,260
when Kepler came along,

988
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:07,290
Kepler was a famous astronomer and he
had in his possession because he stole

989
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:07,990
them.

990
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,440
Uh,

991
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:08,950
the,

992
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:09,610
uh,

993
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,000
uh,

994
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,930
the best naked I results of
that had ever been obtained,

995
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,711
uh,

996
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:15,370
of,

997
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,203
uh,

998
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,750
the motions of the planets
in particular Mars.

999
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,800
And He,

1000
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,550
uh,

1001
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:26,550
described these motions in
three laws of planetary motion

1002
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,640
and you can look them
all up in a textbook.

1003
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,180
Uh,

1004
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,090
in other kinds of courses we would
have you memorize these things,

1005
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,200
not going to do that.

1006
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:35,470
Uh,

1007
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:40,470
the key point here is that these are
not circles they're ellipses around the

1008
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:41,374
sun.

1009
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:41,970
Okay.

1010
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,470
That it turns out,

1011
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,010
uh,

1012
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,320
gives you a model for planetary orbits,

1013
00:30:46,321 --> 00:30:50,040
which when you take better and
better data doesn't change.

1014
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,090
There's still ellipses you don't need
little ellipses on top of these ellipses

1015
00:30:54,091 --> 00:30:56,310
to explain everything's that's going on.

1016
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,400
So this now has excellent
descriptive power.

1017
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,730
It really describes what's going on
and when you make further observations,

1018
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:08,290
it still describes what's going on.

1019
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,461
It has,

1020
00:31:09,461 --> 00:31:14,461
does not have any explanatory power in
the sense that if you say why you lips

1021
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,030
Kepler had no idea.

1022
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,530
That's just the way God made it.

1023
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,341
Uh,

1024
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:22,180
so it's not in any particular
way and explanation.

1025
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,413
Okay?

1026
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,810
For the explanation,

1027
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:29,020
you have to wait another generation
or two until we get Newton.

1028
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:32,630
Okay?

1029
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:35,840
Newton writes down three laws of his own,

1030
00:31:35,841 --> 00:31:38,240
but these are now three laws of motion,

1031
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,280
not planetary motion in particular.

1032
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:40,821
Uh,

1033
00:31:40,821 --> 00:31:41,391
and again,

1034
00:31:41,391 --> 00:31:44,210
one could write these down and memorize
them and learn them and that would be a

1035
00:31:44,211 --> 00:31:44,900
good thing.

1036
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,070
Let me write down one of them.

1037
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,840
The second law looks like this.

1038
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:52,880
F equals m a force equals
mass times acceleration.

1039
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:58,540
And I write this one down a simply to
point out that that equation is the entire

1040
00:32:00,021 --> 00:32:04,130
intellectual content of introductory
physics for physics majors.

1041
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,070
If you go take physics one 80,

1042
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:10,730
this is all that they do and
they spend the whole time,

1043
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:12,890
it turns out you don't
actually want acceleration.

1044
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:14,240
That doesn't tell you
what you want to know.

1045
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,830
What you want to know is the
trajectory where the object is,

1046
00:32:16,831 --> 00:32:17,840
is a function of time.

1047
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,150
Uh,

1048
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:21,440
those of you who have taken some
calculus may recall that if you take the

1049
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:24,530
acceleration and you
take an integral twice,

1050
00:32:24,531 --> 00:32:27,170
you'd come up with a position
as a function of time.

1051
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,310
So here's what,

1052
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:29,480
so in the next 30 seconds,

1053
00:32:29,481 --> 00:32:31,010
I'm going to explain physics one 82,

1054
00:32:31,011 --> 00:32:31,510
you,

1055
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:31,910
uh,

1056
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,600
you,

1057
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:32,821
you,

1058
00:32:32,821 --> 00:32:34,880
you substitute in some kind of a force.

1059
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,230
You divide by mass,

1060
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,290
you take two integral and that
gives you the trajectory of thing.

1061
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,310
That's all you need to know.

1062
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,000
Uh,

1063
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,631
technically,

1064
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:42,740
of course it's quite hard,

1065
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:43,121
but,

1066
00:32:43,121 --> 00:32:43,550
uh,

1067
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:43,760
uh,

1068
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,550
conceptually pretty straight forward.

1069
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:46,311
Uh,

1070
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:49,580
and one of the things that Newton
did with this equation was he took a

1071
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:50,930
particular force,

1072
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,850
namely the force of gravity,

1073
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,713
which he,

1074
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:53,990
uh,

1075
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,990
he also wrote down a law of gravity that
tells you for any given situation what

1076
00:32:59,121 --> 00:33:00,770
the force due to gravity is,

1077
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,730
substituted it in here and figured out
that what the motions of the planets

1078
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:05,920
ought to be a,

1079
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,420
and it turns out that he can direct,

1080
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,000
he could derive Kepler's laws,

1081
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,680
derives Kepler's laws.

1082
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,080
Very nice.

1083
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:19,071
Now,

1084
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:19,580
of course,

1085
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,450
in order to do this,

1086
00:33:20,451 --> 00:33:22,070
he has to invent calculus.

1087
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,170
So it takes a little while.

1088
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:24,770
Uh,

1089
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,850
he was great genius,

1090
00:33:25,851 --> 00:33:26,511
but even so,

1091
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:28,010
inventing calculus from scratch,

1092
00:33:28,011 --> 00:33:29,780
not something you would
want to attempt at home.

1093
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,590
Uh,

1094
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,480
and uh,

1095
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,240
uh,

1096
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,631
uh,

1097
00:33:32,631 --> 00:33:37,631
and that was basically the start of both
modern science and modern mathematics.

1098
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,280
So this is,

1099
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,850
this marks the start of science
in the following sense that,

1100
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:44,510
uh,

1101
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:47,330
Newton has to make a couple
assumptions along the way,

1102
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:49,850
sort of deep assumptions
about how the world works.

1103
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,120
One is that the universe is
governed by laws and in fact,

1104
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:57,710
by universal laws.

1105
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:03,160
And what I mean by universal in this
in this sense is that they apply

1106
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,070
everywhere,

1107
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:09,020
that the same law of gravity that resulted
in the top of my pen falling to the

1108
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:13,460
floor over there also is responsible
for the orbits of the planets and the

1109
00:34:13,461 --> 00:34:14,660
motions of the stars.

1110
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:16,850
This was a new idea.

1111
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,590
It's very familiar to us by now,

1112
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,090
but the idea that the planet's ought to
behave according to the same rules as

1113
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:23,270
stuffed down here on earth,

1114
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:23,870
uh,

1115
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,400
was a whole new concept.

1116
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,320
The other piece of the new concept is
that these laws are mathematical in

1117
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:31,154
nature.

1118
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:38,300
This is why science is hard
because it's hard for human beings.

1119
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:41,120
I think it's something to do with the
way our brains are wired to accept that

1120
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:41,954
this is true.

1121
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:42,620
Uh,

1122
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,500
it's very easy to imagine a
world in which that's not true.

1123
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,330
Go read any fantasy novel.

1124
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,170
Uh,

1125
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:52,670
any fantasy novel has a situation where
the hero or the villain by virtue of

1126
00:34:52,671 --> 00:34:56,660
their strength of character
influences the events around them.

1127
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:01,820
So that is a rule governed by laws perhaps
that are not mathematical in nature,

1128
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:05,780
but depend on the moral character
of the individuals involved.

1129
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,000
Every human culture has such stories,

1130
00:35:08,001 --> 00:35:08,834
including our own.

1131
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,490
It's very hard to get away from it.

1132
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:12,140
And the idea that,

1133
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:12,381
you know,

1134
00:35:12,381 --> 00:35:14,900
there's just this sort of
mathematical structure and that,

1135
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:15,320
uh,

1136
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,310
your moral stature has no
bearing on what's going to
happen is it's kind of hard

1137
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:20,140
to accept.

1138
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,450
Uh,

1139
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,840
fortunately people turn out to be pretty
good at math so we can actually solve

1140
00:35:23,841 --> 00:35:25,250
these problems and move forward.

1141
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,210
Uh,

1142
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:26,570
but,

1143
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:26,751
uh,

1144
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:27,380
it was,

1145
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,710
these two ideas were revolutionary
and they are the basis,

1146
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:31,550
uh,

1147
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:32,810
pretty much of all science.

1148
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,430
Okay.

1149
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:38,700
So then Newton's laws get you
elaborated on for several centuries.

1150
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,120
Uh,

1151
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,190
by the end of the 19th century,

1152
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:43,440
things are starting to
come apart a little bit.

1153
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:45,570
Uh,

1154
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:49,230
there are no problems that
show up with Newtonian physics.

1155
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,110
It's been a big success on the whole,

1156
00:35:53,111 --> 00:35:53,501
but now,

1157
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:54,460
now problems.

1158
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,310
And in the early 20th century,

1159
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,350
what happens is

1160
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,290
early 20th century,

1161
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:03,400
uh,

1162
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,630
what happens is two new laws
of physics are invented.

1163
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,830
These are given the names,

1164
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:10,090
quantum mechanics

1165
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,560
and general relativity.

1166
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:21,990
And the situation with these is they
don't overturn turn Newton's laws,

1167
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:23,860
they extend them.

1168
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,270
It turns out that in the,

1169
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:28,990
in those kinds of situations that Newton
was looking at both quantum mechanics

1170
00:36:28,991 --> 00:36:30,190
and general relativity,

1171
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:30,910
uh,

1172
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,690
reduce down to Newton's law.

1173
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:37,691
So you have a situation where here or
Newton's laws and laws of which Kepler's

1174
00:36:37,721 --> 00:36:39,310
laws are a tiny subset.

1175
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:40,240
Uh,

1176
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,550
and then general relativity.

1177
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:42,690
Yeah,

1178
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,800
I'm drawing a kind of Venn diagram here.

1179
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:45,983
Uh,

1180
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:46,870
okay.

1181
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:51,370
Is here relativity
occupying Newton's laws?

1182
00:36:51,371 --> 00:36:52,660
But that's some other stuff.

1183
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:56,950
Quantum mechanics looks kinda like this.

1184
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,000
Okay.

1185
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,010
Extends in a different direction.

1186
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,400
Uh,

1187
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,560
let me make these axes specific.

1188
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,290
I don't like Venn diagrams when they
don't tell you what you're actually

1189
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,060
plotting.

1190
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,330
A,

1191
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,480
this is mass.

1192
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,870
So heavy things are when
relativity kicks in,

1193
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,980
this is size.

1194
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:18,270
And so small things are when
quantum mechanics kicks in.

1195
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,590
But you can see the problem.

1196
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,630
We've got two big theories.

1197
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,920
You really want those theories to be
encompassed by one yet bigger theory.

1198
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,210
Uh,

1199
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:31,020
and that is the current
goal of theoretical physics
to try and find the one

1200
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,550
great theory that encompasses both
quantum mechanics and general relativity,

1201
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:37,860
which contradict each other
at various awkward ways,

1202
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:39,510
particularly in this region up here.

1203
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,583
This is called,

1204
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,250
uh,

1205
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:46,250
the theory of everything or t o e uh,

1206
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:50,910
and the best current guests as to what
kind of a theory that will be is that it

1207
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:52,470
will be some kind of string theory.

1208
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,820
I won't go into string theories.

1209
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:54,930
Now there's big,

1210
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:55,151
uh,

1211
00:37:55,151 --> 00:37:57,270
you can go read many
popular books on this.

1212
00:37:57,271 --> 00:37:58,140
It's very exciting.

1213
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,571
Uh,

1214
00:37:58,571 --> 00:38:02,100
there is currently no string theory
that really works out all that well,

1215
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:05,900
but the people who are studying this kind
of thing like to believe that's going

1216
00:38:05,901 --> 00:38:08,310
to work out sometime in the future.

1217
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:09,691
Okay.

1218
00:38:09,691 --> 00:38:10,524
This is good.

1219
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,210
We've gone in,

1220
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:12,840
uh,

1221
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:17,250
about 40 minutes from the start of
science to the theory of everything.

1222
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,243
So we're done.

1223
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,161
Uh,

1224
00:38:20,161 --> 00:38:21,510
everything else is a detail.

1225
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:25,740
And so the whole rest of the
course is filling in details.

1226
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:28,620
The first of which.

1227
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,990
So let's start on the details.

1228
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:38,080
The first of which I want to go and
catch one of Kepler's laws and I want to

1229
00:38:38,081 --> 00:38:42,970
write down the new Tonia modification

1230
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,170
of Kepler's.

1231
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:48,760
Whoops.

1232
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,390
Kepler's third law.

1233
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,390
And that is an equation
that looks like this.

1234
00:38:55,450 --> 00:39:00,450
A cubed is equal to g m P
squared over four Pi Square.

1235
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,410
All right,

1236
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,180
we're going to circle this and read.

1237
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,200
This is something you're going
to want to memorize a this,

1238
00:39:08,201 --> 00:39:12,670
it turns out to be a basis of a large
fraction of what we're going to do in this

1239
00:39:12,671 --> 00:39:12,941
course.

1240
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:14,200
So let me explain the symbols.

1241
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:18,970
A is the semi major access,

1242
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,493
major

1243
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,950
access of the elliptic
of an elliptical orbit

1244
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,190
lip tickle orbit.

1245
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:31,531
Remember,

1246
00:39:31,531 --> 00:39:33,030
these orbits are going to be ellipsis.

1247
00:39:33,031 --> 00:39:33,864
Here's an ellipse.

1248
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,660
The long what slide is the major access.

1249
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,700
The short side is the Meyer access.

1250
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:41,820
Half the major axis is uh,

1251
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:43,140
the semi major axis.

1252
00:39:43,141 --> 00:39:45,630
So this is a right here.

1253
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,510
P is the orbital period.

1254
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:56,870
How long it takes the planet or whatever
orbiting object you've got to go around

1255
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,343
one orbit.

1256
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:04,670
Am is the total mass of the two
things in orbit around each other

1257
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,720
of the orbiting

1258
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,660
bodies.

1259
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:14,280
And the existence of that am is why this
is Newton's modification in Kepler's

1260
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,390
law.

1261
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,460
It was always planets
going around the sun.

1262
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:18,990
So the mass was always the same.

1263
00:40:18,991 --> 00:40:20,280
The mass was that of the sun.

1264
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:20,851
Uh,

1265
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:21,960
and so it canceled out.

1266
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:22,650
But,

1267
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,340
uh,

1268
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,330
in general,

1269
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:24,631
uh,

1270
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:28,500
you can use the same equation to deal
with things orbiting the earth or things

1271
00:40:28,501 --> 00:40:30,870
orbiting the moon as long as
you put in the right mass there.

1272
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,810
G is a constant of nature.

1273
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:35,250
The gravitational constant.

1274
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:37,610
Yeah.

1275
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:41,150
And it equals some value
depending on what units you use.

1276
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,860
And we'll come back to that later.

1277
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,721
For us,

1278
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:47,150
for a Pi is this obscure number from,

1279
00:40:47,151 --> 00:40:47,640
uh,

1280
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,800
uh,

1281
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:51,170
from elementary mathematics 3.14,

1282
00:40:51,171 --> 00:40:51,711
one five,

1283
00:40:51,711 --> 00:40:51,950
nine,

1284
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,000
whatever the heck it is.

1285
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:53,781
Uh,

1286
00:40:53,781 --> 00:40:54,550
and uh,

1287
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:54,951
uh,

1288
00:40:54,951 --> 00:40:57,380
you can punch it in on your
calculator or whatever.

1289
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,480
So you can use this
equation to find things out.

1290
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,260
Uh,

1291
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,810
now these numbers tend to
be awkward to work with.

1292
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,780
The mass of the sun is some
huge number of kilograms.

1293
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,270
G is a very awkward number.

1294
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,130
Pi is always a mess.

1295
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,000
Uh,

1296
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,870
and uh,

1297
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,370
so but let me show you a trick.

1298
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:19,610
Consider the Earth's orbit around the sun,

1299
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,830
around Sun.

1300
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:23,810
Uh,

1301
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:28,810
the semi major axis of the Earth's
orbit of Earth's orbit is a very common,

1302
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,560
uh,

1303
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,760
unit in astronomy.

1304
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:36,920
And it's called an astronomical unit.

1305
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:42,170
It's a unit of length that's
tyrannical unit or a you,

1306
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,663
uh,

1307
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,360
the mass of the sun mass of the earth.

1308
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,930
Plus the sun is mostly the
mass of the sun of Sun is,

1309
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:51,410
uh,

1310
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,090
called a solar mass obviously.

1311
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:57,530
And it given this symbol and with
a little circle with a dot inside,

1312
00:41:57,531 --> 00:41:58,910
that's the symbol for the sun.

1313
00:41:59,630 --> 00:41:59,961
Uh,

1314
00:41:59,961 --> 00:42:02,330
and what's the orbital period of the Earth

1315
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,221
a year.

1316
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:05,120
Thank you very much.

1317
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,070
A period of earth.

1318
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,110
One year.

1319
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,580
That's what a year means.

1320
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:12,110
It takes a year for the,

1321
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:12,590
uh,

1322
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,010
uh,

1323
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,270
for the earth to go around the sun.

1324
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:19,540
So it must be the case that
one astronomical unit cubed
is equal to g times the

1325
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:25,280
mass of the Sun Times one year squared.

1326
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,530
That's p squared over four Pi Square.

1327
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,430
Now let me show you a trick.

1328
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:35,090
Take the general equation

1329
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,680
useful trig and divide by
this specific equation.

1330
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,550
So a cubed equals p squared,

1331
00:42:46,551 --> 00:42:48,650
g m over four Pi Square,

1332
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,350
and we're going to divide that by one.

1333
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:56,120
A U cubed equals a one year squared,

1334
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,250
g mass of the sun,

1335
00:42:58,280 --> 00:42:59,720
over four Pi squared.

1336
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,090
We can do this because
these two things are equal.

1337
00:43:02,091 --> 00:43:04,700
So we're dividing both sides of
the equation by the same amount.

1338
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,270
Uh,

1339
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:07,550
g cancels for Pi squared cancels.

1340
00:43:07,551 --> 00:43:08,384
That's very nice.

1341
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,310
We end up with a over one.

1342
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:15,311
A U cubed equals p over one year
squared am over the solar mass.

1343
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:23,470
The is just saying that quantity is
a in units of an astronomical unit.

1344
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:28,220
This quantity is p in units of a year.

1345
00:43:28,221 --> 00:43:29,480
If this is two years,

1346
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:31,130
then this number will come up to two.

1347
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:34,430
And this is m in units
of the mass of the sun.

1348
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:39,580
So you can say a cubed equals p squared
and providing you're dealing in units of

1349
00:43:40,101 --> 00:43:41,810
the massive size of the sun,

1350
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:43,521
uh,

1351
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:44,900
units of one year

1352
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:50,600
and unit of an ae you.

1353
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,970
So this is now much easier to work with.

1354
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,250
You've got rid of all
kinds of terrible things.

1355
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,390
So let me give you the first
numerical example of the course.

1356
00:43:59,391 --> 00:44:01,220
This will be the last thing we do today.

1357
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,110
Namely the orbit of Jupiter.

1358
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:10,610
Turns out the distance from Jupiter to
the sun is about five times the distance

1359
00:44:10,611 --> 00:44:11,600
of the earth to the sun.

1360
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,790
So a of Jupiter,

1361
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:19,970
he has approximately five times a a of
earth a of earth you'll recall is this

1362
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:21,590
one a you?

1363
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:23,300
So this is about five a year.

1364
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:25,880
So how does this equation workout?

1365
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:30,500
You get five cubed equals p squared.

1366
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:34,710
M M is the mass of the sun one solar mass.

1367
00:44:34,711 --> 00:44:38,730
And since Jupiter is going around the sun,

1368
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,660
uh,

1369
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,800
that's equal to one.

1370
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:45,980
So five Cube five times five is 25 a 25
times five is 125 so you ended up with

1371
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,700
125 equals p square.

1372
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:53,010
So you can answer the question.

1373
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:53,640
Now,

1374
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,880
what is the orbital period
of Jupiter in years?

1375
00:44:57,090 --> 00:45:02,090
Obviously that's going to equal the
square root of 125 here's another trick.

1376
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,000
What's the square root of 125 quickly

1377
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:08,700
good.

1378
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,060
Uh,

1379
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:09,930
more decibels.

1380
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,470
You could type it into your
calculator though and find out,

1381
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:14,461
but let me get,

1382
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:15,720
but let me make a suggestion.

1383
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,900
Don't take the square root of 125
take the square root of 121 instead.

1384
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:26,010
What's the square root
of 100 2111 much easier,

1385
00:45:26,011 --> 00:45:26,630
right?

1386
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:27,120
Uh,

1387
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,170
and notice that,

1388
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,310
notice this,

1389
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,520
a of Jupiter is approximately five.

1390
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:37,550
So five cubed is approximately 125 and
that's it's just as good to say a 121 is

1391
00:45:41,611 --> 00:45:42,840
equal to the square root,

1392
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,490
the square of the period
and p equals 11 years.

1393
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,220
That's the orbital period of Jupiter.

1394
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,030
All right,

1395
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:55,380
so now I'm aware that many of you are
shopping the course today and may not be

1396
00:45:55,381 --> 00:45:57,090
back for future lectures.

1397
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:01,230
And so I want for those people who have
decided against this that they'll do

1398
00:46:01,231 --> 00:46:03,090
something far more
worthwhile with their time.

1399
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:08,070
I want to leave you with something you
can carry through your life from your

1400
00:46:08,071 --> 00:46:12,210
brief experience with astronomy one
60 and that is the following piece of

1401
00:46:12,211 --> 00:46:13,044
advice.

1402
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:18,230
Don't take the square root of 125 take
the square root of 121 it's much easier.

1403
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,111
Uh,

1404
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:25,890
this is what the business people
call thinking outside the box.

1405
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:28,290
Don't do the stupid hard thing.

1406
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:31,260
Do the thing that is just as good,

1407
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,860
but requires some thought
first in order to make it easy.

1408
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,660
And so I will leave you with that.

1409
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:37,321
The rest of you,

1410
00:46:37,321 --> 00:46:38,610
I'll see you on Thursday morning.
