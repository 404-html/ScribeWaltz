1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,500
So we were talking last time about,

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,453
uh,

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,360
the planet,

4
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,920
the objects in the solar system.

5
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:10,220
And we'd gone through kind
of two of the three stages,

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,060
uh,

7
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:16,060
of the scientific method as it's applied
to observational science rather than

8
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:17,450
experimental science.

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,140
And the first thing was
just making observations,

10
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:22,430
finding a bunch of things.

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,050
And so I gave you a little slide show,

12
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:26,740
uh,

13
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,090
depicting some of the objects in our
solar system and after observations,

14
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:31,990
the next thing,

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,770
uh,

16
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:36,250
to do his classification last year.

17
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:38,350
Fication and,

18
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,741
uh,

19
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:40,180
we did some of that too.

20
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:45,181
And I divided all these objects that
had been discovered into six categories.

21
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:45,911
Uh,

22
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:47,350
and then once you've done that,

23
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:49,630
once you have some categories
that kind of makes sense.

24
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:50,200
Uh,

25
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,200
then the next thing is to interpret these
results and to try and explain where

26
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:57,160
these categories come from,

27
00:00:57,161 --> 00:00:58,090
how they arise,

28
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:58,811
and uh,

29
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:00,040
actually figure something out.

30
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:00,401
And,

31
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:00,820
uh,

32
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,420
I've,

33
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:01,900
uh,

34
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,910
described that his interpretation

35
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,690
and I want to offer you a little bit of
interpretation about what we found out

36
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:10,680
about the solar system.

37
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:11,310
Now,

38
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:11,760
uh,

39
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,190
I only want to explain,

40
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:14,850
uh,

41
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,860
some of the classifications.

42
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:19,770
This is actually a common thing to do
when you find a whole bunch of different

43
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:20,041
things,

44
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:22,620
and you've got 12 classes
in three subclasses,

45
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,550
in two exceptions,

46
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,270
uh,

47
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,980
you kind of want to explain the beak
features first and then worry about the

48
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:29,880
little things later.

49
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,960
This is commonly done.

50
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,380
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to talk about a old Lee,

51
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,190
the,

52
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:36,630
uh,

53
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,760
inner terrestrial planet.

54
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:40,740
Uh,

55
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,800
you'll recall that these are small,

56
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,930
rocky,

57
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,610
uh,

58
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,160
things in a relatively short orbit,

59
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:50,820
uh,

60
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,730
and uh,

61
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,410
and contrast them with the outer planets,

62
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:56,131
the Jovian,

63
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:57,600
the Jupiter like planet,

64
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,260
uh,

65
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,340
which are large and have not only rocks,

66
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:05,460
but also lots of ice and gas,

67
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,510
uh,

68
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,770
and these things,

69
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,550
uh,

70
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,810
are and wider orbits.

71
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,620
Uh,

72
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,620
but the orbits of both of these are
basically more or less circular,

73
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:17,220
not precisely circular.

74
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:18,210
They're actually elliptical,

75
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:18,450
but,

76
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,290
but quite close.

77
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,040
Uh,

78
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,020
and they're all in the same plane.

79
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,510
That is to say they're all
going around the same way.

80
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,200
Uh,

81
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,520
there's nothing that's going to,

82
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,030
whoops,

83
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,880
there's nothing that's going
this way instead of this way.

84
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,460
So there's circular and Co Planer.

85
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,420
Uh,

86
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:33,960
and,

87
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,320
uh,

88
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,950
let's try for an explanation
of those particular features.

89
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,111
Okay.

90
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:41,340
So this would be,

91
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,270
uh,

92
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,270
something like a theory
of planetary formation,

93
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,170
how the planets formed,

94
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:50,190
why they get that way.

95
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,280
This word theory is a serious problem.

96
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,000
Uh,

97
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,730
this is one of the foremost examples
of word that means something different.

98
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:01,900
When scientists use it,

99
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:03,340
then when normal people use it,

100
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,150
uh,

101
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,980
in scientific parlance,

102
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:08,440
a theory is something
which has a lot of support,

103
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:11,860
which explains a lot of
observed or experimental fact,

104
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,580
uh,

105
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,540
in everyday life.

106
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:13,901
Of course,

107
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:15,460
a theory mean to wild gas,

108
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,240
uh,

109
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,073
the difference.

110
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,010
So there's a pretty stark difference
between those two definitions.

111
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,320
Uh,

112
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,390
this gets our friends,

113
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:25,900
the evolutionary biologists and all kinds
of trouble because they keep talking

114
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,490
about the theory of evolution.

115
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,300
Uh,

116
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,300
and a certain segment of
society interprets that as
the wild gas of evolution.

117
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:35,950
And this creates various
kinds of difficulties.

118
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,840
The problem is there isn't another
word that one can readily use for what,

119
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:40,930
what the science,

120
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,530
uh,

121
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:42,520
definition of this.

122
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,110
You could use paradigm,

123
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:45,640
you could use scenario,

124
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,360
uh,

125
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,010
these are,

126
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,710
uh,

127
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,610
kind of ugly,

128
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,121
uh,

129
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:49,720
sorts of words.

130
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,040
So I think we're stuck with theory,

131
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,640
but I mean this in the sense of something
that explains a lot of facts rather

132
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:56,680
than in the sense of wild guess.

133
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,250
Okay.

134
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,083
So here we go.

135
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,620
Uh,

136
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,410
theory of planetary formation.

137
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:06,550
So the idea is that the planet form,

138
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,750
uh,

139
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,750
from a disc of material around the sun,

140
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,420
around the sun,

141
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,910
so the sun and the planet,

142
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:19,960
uh,

143
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,060
are created out of a collapsing cloud.

144
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:23,290
The cloud collapses.

145
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,040
Some parts of the cloud are rotating
that prevents them from collapsing.

146
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,210
And so you have a situation after a
while where you have a sort of star like

147
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:35,830
thing in the middle and then a
kind of disk of stuff around it.

148
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,251
Uh,

149
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:38,890
so this is a side view and in the top few,

150
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:40,720
all these things are in orbit here.

151
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,500
And,

152
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,333
uh,

153
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,760
uh,

154
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,300
this disc consists of basically
the same material as the sun,

155
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,370
which is to say lots of gas,

156
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,763
uh,

157
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,480
by which I mean hydrogen
and helium in particular.

158
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,200
Uh,

159
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,033
some,

160
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:54,850
uh,

161
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,301
ice,

162
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:56,770
of course when it's in a star,

163
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:57,730
it's all melted.

164
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,260
Uh,

165
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,880
but these are elements like carbon,

166
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,840
nitrogen,

167
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,673
oxygen,

168
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,150
that go into making isis.

169
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,250
And a little bit of a
heavier elements that could,

170
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:10,660
if you put them all together,

171
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,471
a form,

172
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:13,300
dust and rocks and things like that.

173
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,800
A little heavier,

174
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:15,730
uh,

175
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,563
element,

176
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,703
uh,

177
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,080
things like silicon and iron.

178
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,040
Uh,

179
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,280
so that's what the sun consists stuff.

180
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:23,890
Uh,

181
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:28,060
and so does this disc
orbiting around them.

182
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:28,894
What happens,

183
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,520
uh,

184
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,690
in the disk,

185
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,370
uh,

186
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,203
things,

187
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:35,260
uh,

188
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:38,440
gradually stick together.

189
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:44,140
So rather than having
individual atoms or molecules,

190
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:48,250
the molecules and atoms sort of run
into each other form dust grains,

191
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:49,240
the dust grains run,

192
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:51,130
or ice crystals or whatever.

193
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,410
Those run into each
other for bigger things.

194
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:57,470
And you gradually make a bigger things
as the little things collide with each

195
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:58,370
other and stick.

196
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,390
Uh,

197
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,260
so in the disc,

198
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:03,350
things gradually stick together
and become tiny little objects,

199
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:05,870
which are sometimes given
the name planetesimals.

200
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,773
Yeah.

201
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,350
Okay.

202
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,350
And then the planetesimals bump
into each other and stick a stick,

203
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,490
uh,

204
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,323
together,

205
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:18,441
uh,

206
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:20,780
until you've got a situation,

207
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,560
uh,

208
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,330
where in each region,

209
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,710
each CCO each orbit,

210
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,300
each distance from the sun.

211
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:26,601
Uh,

212
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:29,420
you've called last everything
into one large object.

213
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,140
Uh,

214
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:35,140
and so you end up with
one big object in each,

215
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,810
uh,

216
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:42,590
region by which I mean
distance from the sun,

217
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,800
distance from the star.

218
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,030
And this explains the orbits
because since it's Co,

219
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:55,150
since these large objects have been
created by running a lot of small objects

220
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:55,984
together,

221
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,530
uh,

222
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,010
the,

223
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:57,843
uh,

224
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,451
uh,

225
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:03,010
lip electricity of any of the elliptical
part of the orbit of any of these

226
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:06,400
things tend to cancel out because one of
these objects will be elliptical in one

227
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:09,160
direction or another will be
elliptical and another direction.

228
00:07:09,161 --> 00:07:10,360
If you put them all together,

229
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:13,630
they'll grab that orbit
will tend to be circular.

230
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,351
Similarly,

231
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,770
some of the objects will be going up
out of the plane of the solar system.

232
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,760
Some will be going down,

233
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:22,780
but you'll run them together and they'll
all end up with kind of a similar

234
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:24,550
circular co Planar orbits.

235
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:25,270
So,

236
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:25,690
uh,

237
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,340
makes uh,

238
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:30,150
approximately that's the approximate side.

239
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:30,984
Circular,

240
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,920
a Co planar orbits.

241
00:07:32,921 --> 00:07:35,590
So that's good cause that's one of
the things we're trying to explain.

242
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,360
And there is an expected difference
between how this works out in the inner

243
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:46,330
parts of the solar system and how it
works out in the outer parts of the solar

244
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:47,020
system.

245
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,640
In the inner solar system,

246
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,770
uh,

247
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,920
the ice and gas and,

248
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:56,820
uh,

249
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,130
the planetesimals,

250
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,240
uh,

251
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,240
evaporates and does not become part
of the planet that gets formed.

252
00:08:07,141 --> 00:08:10,320
And so the planet are only,

253
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:11,461
uh,

254
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:12,600
the rocky parts.

255
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:15,090
They actually hold on
to a little bit of the,

256
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:15,421
uh,

257
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:16,920
of the ice and gas button,

258
00:08:16,921 --> 00:08:17,790
but not very much.

259
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,690
Uh,

260
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,610
whereas in the outer solar system,

261
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,520
the ice is frozen and so
it behaves just like rocks.

262
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And so planet have rocks and ice.

263
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,720
This means that they're
substantially more massive.

264
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,440
And if they're sufficiently massive,

265
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,200
then they have enough
gravity to hold onto the gas.

266
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:46,034
Also,

267
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:48,680
uh,

268
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,980
two gas as well.

269
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,860
It's also true than in
the outer solar system.

270
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:54,730
There's more volume,

271
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:55,890
there's stuff than,

272
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:58,410
so there's more stuff to build the
planets out of in the first place.

273
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,843
Um,

274
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:00,870
okay.

275
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,710
And so this,

276
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,250
uh,

277
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,390
nicely explained the difference between
the inner solar system and the outer

278
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:07,020
solar system.

279
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,120
We build these things
up out of little chunks,

280
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:09,750
uh,

281
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,220
but in the inner solar system,

282
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:14,570
the temperature is high enough
that the chunks of ice evaporate.

283
00:09:14,571 --> 00:09:16,200
And so you can't build
them up out of that.

284
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:17,040
And so you get much,

285
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:18,600
much smaller things,

286
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,050
uh,

287
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,910
made almost entirely out of rocks.

288
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:24,390
In contrast to the outer solar
system where you have enough ice,

289
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,680
you build much bigger planets,

290
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:29,460
and in some cases you hang on
to a lot of the gas as well.

291
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,680
So this is interesting because it makes
a prediction about how other solar

292
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:35,970
systems ought to look,

293
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,550
namely that this difference between
inner planets and outer planets ought to

294
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:43,570
exist everywhere,

295
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:44,823
uh,

296
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,220
that,

297
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,520
uh,

298
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,840
planetary systems,

299
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,430
there should be a general feature because
there's nothing what I've said so far

300
00:09:51,431 --> 00:09:52,540
that unique to the sun.

301
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,530
So,

302
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:53,830
uh,

303
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,090
planetary systems,

304
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,080
uh,

305
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,760
should have,

306
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,030
uh,

307
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,450
uner rocky planets

308
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,010
and outer,

309
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,570
uh,

310
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,850
a Jupiter like planets,

311
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,390
uh,

312
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,610
sort of gas plus ice.

313
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,280
So I took planet much bigger.

314
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,320
And the dividing line between these two,

315
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,130
uh,

316
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,150
kinds of planet,

317
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,080
uh,

318
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,510
is determined by temperature.

319
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,380
Okay.

320
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,040
Because there'll be some temperature
where those ice things melt.

321
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,500
And uh,

322
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,890
therefore you don't expect it to be
at the same distance away from a star.

323
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:41,800
You expect it to be at the
place where the is the same.

324
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,401
Therefore,

325
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,080
if you have a very bright star,

326
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:44,980
Hot Star,

327
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:45,670
uh,

328
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,590
you'll have inner planets out further
from that star inner type terrestrial

329
00:10:50,591 --> 00:10:51,970
planets will go out further.

330
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,350
And if you have a very dim,

331
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:54,220
faint star,

332
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,380
a which doesn't generate as much heat,

333
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,210
the gas planets will,

334
00:10:58,211 --> 00:10:58,331
uh,

335
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:01,600
the dividing line between the gas planets
and the terrestrial planets will be

336
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:03,090
much closer in a,

337
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,470
so the dividing line is
determined by temperature,

338
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,130
uh,

339
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:07,930
Hanse by,

340
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,800
uh,

341
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,340
the,

342
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:09,880
uh,

343
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,900
luminosity,

344
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,180
the amount of energy given off,

345
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,200
uh,

346
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,370
of the star.

347
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,743
Yeah.

348
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,660
So now this tells us what
we're supposed to do next.

349
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,350
Uh,

350
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,183
namely,

351
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:22,670
uh,

352
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,410
go out and find a whole bunch of other
solar systems and verify this prediction.

353
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,710
Namely that if you've got
really bright hot star,

354
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,890
you ought to have rocks out
fairly far in the solar system.

355
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:35,150
Whereas if you have a dim star,

356
00:11:35,151 --> 00:11:37,370
you'll have Jupiter like
things coming in much closer.

357
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:38,803
Uh,

358
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,591
and uh,

359
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:42,300
so that's what I want to talk about was,

360
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:42,860
uh,

361
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,010
now is how people went about doing
this and what the results were.

362
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:48,140
And I'll tell you the
punchline in advance,

363
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:48,710
uh,

364
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,810
which is that this totally doesn't work,

365
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:57,670
but it's an obvious prediction from our
theory of planet formation that came

366
00:11:58,121 --> 00:11:58,920
about,

367
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,860
uh,

368
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,220
by an examination of what was
going on in our own solar system.

369
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,283
Okay.

370
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,380
So observing exoplanets,

371
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,730
how'd you find these things?

372
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:20,601
Uh,

373
00:12:20,601 --> 00:12:23,750
and you'll recall we started
down this track last,

374
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,350
uh,

375
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,490
in the last lecture.

376
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,210
Uh,

377
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:26,720
the,

378
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,110
uh,

379
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,260
key point here is that stars move to,

380
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:31,460
okay.

381
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,580
It's not just the planet
going around a star.

382
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:39,410
It's the planet and the star both go
around the center of mass of the system.

383
00:12:39,411 --> 00:12:40,520
And the stars moved too.

384
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,770
You can't see the planets independently.

385
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,450
And there was a little equation.

386
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,400
The velocity of the star times the mass
of the star is equal to the velocity of

387
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:51,740
the planet times the mass of the planet.

388
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,250
This is a,

389
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,660
basically an equation of momentum.

390
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,070
Uh,

391
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:03,070
the distance of the star to the center
of mass times its mass is equal to the

392
00:13:04,191 --> 00:13:08,150
distance of the planet to the center
of mass times the mass of the planet.

393
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,270
This is kind of a definition
of the center of mass.

394
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,220
And,

395
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:15,760
uh,

396
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,690
sometimes you don't want to deal with the
individual velocities or distances you

397
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:22,240
want to deal with the total
velocity or distances.

398
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:25,810
And so that's just defined where if
you want to talk about the total,

399
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:28,540
that's obviously just
d star Plus d planet.

400
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,020
Uh,

401
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,180
similarly for the total velocity

402
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,890
and the total mass.

403
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,103
Okay.

404
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:40,910
And that's just,

405
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,160
you know,

406
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,180
defining terms.

407
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:47,390
And then in order to relate
these distances to things
that have shown up in our

408
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,920
equations in Kepler's third law,

409
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,630
uh,

410
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,030
it's,

411
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,740
it's,

412
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,490
it's a true,

413
00:13:53,491 --> 00:13:57,390
that the maximum value
of the total distance,

414
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,960
that is to say the distance between these
things can vary because they can be in

415
00:14:00,961 --> 00:14:02,070
elliptical orbits.

416
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,070
Uh,

417
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,500
sometimes they're closer than others.

418
00:14:04,501 --> 00:14:07,710
And if you take the maximum
distance between them,

419
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,840
that's the maximum d total.

420
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:10,650
That's a,

421
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,380
that's the semi major access of the orbit.

422
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,073
Uh,

423
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,693
and,

424
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,510
uh,

425
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,390
now for nearly circular orbits

426
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,710
as the planet to turn out to be,

427
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,450
uh,

428
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,050
then d total is always the
same because if it's circular,

429
00:14:33,051 --> 00:14:34,780
the distance between them doesn't ferry.

430
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,630
Uh,

431
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,950
so then Dee,

432
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,760
uh,

433
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,650
Dee total is more or less equal to the
Sami major access because it's always the

434
00:14:42,651 --> 00:14:42,981
same,

435
00:14:42,981 --> 00:14:44,840
therefore it's always
near its own maximum.

436
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,440
Uh,

437
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,560
and then you can also say something
interesting about the velocity,

438
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,540
the velocity.

439
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,100
Well,

440
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,580
that's the definition of velocity.

441
00:14:53,581 --> 00:14:56,340
Velocity is miles per hour
or something like that.

442
00:14:56,341 --> 00:14:58,170
So it's distance per time.

443
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:08,130
And let's take a time period
of one orbital period.

444
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,450
And it asked the question,

445
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:12,450
how far does something
go in one orbital period?

446
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,490
While it goes all the
way around it's orbit.

447
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,270
Uh,

448
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:19,110
and you may recall from high
school geometry that if you know,

449
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,570
uh,

450
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:19,980
the,

451
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:22,200
the radius of a circle,

452
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:23,640
you also know its circumference.

453
00:15:23,641 --> 00:15:25,620
The circumference is the distance.

454
00:15:25,621 --> 00:15:28,980
It would have to travel that
to two Pi Times the radius.

455
00:15:28,981 --> 00:15:31,020
This is this basic fact from geometry.

456
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:31,591
Uh,

457
00:15:31,591 --> 00:15:36,591
and so that's two Pi Times the distance
in this case to send me major access.

458
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:37,920
Uh,

459
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,370
but this is only true for
nearly circular orbits.

460
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:46,371
And the reason is that in
highly elliptical orbits of
the velocity changes by a

461
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:49,410
substantial amount of moves
much faster when it's closer.

462
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,221
Uh,

463
00:15:50,221 --> 00:15:53,340
and so you can only really
define what the overall,

464
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,090
uh,

465
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,690
velocity of the thing is if you've
got a nearly circular orbit.

466
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:58,680
But in that case,

467
00:15:58,681 --> 00:15:59,910
as is true for planets,

468
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,331
uh,

469
00:16:00,331 --> 00:16:03,330
there's two Pi over p gives
you a value for velocity.

470
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:04,470
Now,

471
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,303
uh,

472
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,250
so we have another little equation here.

473
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:11,370
V Equals two pi a over p.

474
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,660
This is an important one.

475
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:13,983
Uh,

476
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,080
so you'll,

477
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,490
you'll want to remember that.

478
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,030
Um,

479
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,990
and I should say,

480
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:24,090
which kind of visa and A's.

481
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:26,250
Remember up here there's v Starr,

482
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,450
VPV total,

483
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:28,740
all these different kinds of things.

484
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,933
Uh,

485
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,920
what do I actually mean by that?

486
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:32,211
And,

487
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:32,760
and the,

488
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,110
it can mean any of them,

489
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:35,580
but it has to be consistent.

490
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,460
So if you're dealing with
the velocity of the star,

491
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,740
then a is equal to,

492
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,263
uh,

493
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,431
d star.

494
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:44,851
Remember,

495
00:16:44,851 --> 00:16:46,980
these are all nearly circular orbits.

496
00:16:46,981 --> 00:16:47,370
So,

497
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:47,840
uh,

498
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,010
uh,

499
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,260
d isn't going to change.

500
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,070
Uh,

501
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:50,940
and if you've,

502
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,300
if you're dealing with a v of the planet,

503
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,300
then a is equal to d of the planet.

504
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,880
And that is approximately
equal to d total,

505
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,193
uh,

506
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,690
because the,

507
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,380
uh,

508
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:05,650
uh,

509
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,240
the mass of the planet is so low that
almost all the motion in the system comes

510
00:17:10,241 --> 00:17:11,074
from the planet.

511
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:11,980
So,

512
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,221
uh,

513
00:17:12,221 --> 00:17:14,500
you can also deal with a v total,

514
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,600
which is equal to v planet.

515
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:17,913
MMM.

516
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,593
And so,

517
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:19,840
uh,

518
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,040
all these things go together,

519
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,200
but if you're worried about
the velocity of the star,

520
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:27,460
you have to be careful because
it's not a of the orbit as a whole.

521
00:17:27,461 --> 00:17:29,650
It's just the tiny piece of the orbit,

522
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:30,430
uh,

523
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:30,880
that,

524
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,810
uh,

525
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:32,200
uh,

526
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,940
that involves the motion of the star.

527
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:36,963
Okay.

528
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,753
Uh,

529
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,530
let's do an example.

530
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,160
How fast does the Earth move?

531
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,540
Uh,

532
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:57,450
v equals two pi a over P,

533
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,170
uh,

534
00:17:58,170 --> 00:17:58,381
well,

535
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:01,110
we know a is equal to
one astronomical unit.

536
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:03,180
P is equal to one year,

537
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,600
uh,

538
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,770
for the Earth's orbit.

539
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,670
And so,

540
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:05,861
uh,

541
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:09,480
the velocity of the earth is two
Pi astronomical units per year.

542
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,610
Pretty straight forward.

543
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,180
Uh,

544
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,350
but not very informative
because we don't have a,

545
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,830
a feeling for what,

546
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,340
for measuring velocities and
astronomical units per year.

547
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:20,700
Uh,

548
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,070
there's a joke in a,

549
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,720
uh,

550
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:22,950
uh,

551
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,510
kind of physics joke that you convert all
velocities into furlongs per fortnight

552
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,500
just to be annoying.

553
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:29,663
Uh,

554
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,780
but let's not do that.

555
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:34,020
Let's convert it instead into meters per
second because then we have a hope of

556
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:35,400
understanding what's going on.

557
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,420
Uh,

558
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:41,420
v is equal to two Pi one astronomical
unit is 1.5 times 10 to the 11 meters a

559
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,400
and a year is three times
10 to the seven seconds.

560
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,150
Uh,

561
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,830
Pi divided by three is one,

562
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,030
uh,

563
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,280
two times 1.5 is three,

564
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:56,070
10 to the 11 divided by 10 to the seven.

565
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,370
11 minus seven is tend to is four.

566
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,410
So this is 10 to the
four meters per second.

567
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:03,510
That's 30 kilometers per second.

568
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,350
So we move right along
as we go around the sun.

569
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:09,240
Uh,

570
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,190
if you did this for Jupiter,

571
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:12,330
uh,

572
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,430
plugged in the various values for Jupiter,

573
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:16,320
I won't actually do that calculation.

574
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,154
You can do it on,

575
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:17,971
on your own.

576
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:21,120
You're discover the Jupiter moves
about half as fast as the earth.

577
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,330
So it goes around 15
kilometers per second.

578
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,010
That's 1.5 times 10 to the
four meters per second.

579
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,740
So now we can ask the question,

580
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:36,600
how fast does the sun move in
response to the orbit of the,

581
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,260
uh,

582
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,681
uh,

583
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:38,640
of these planets?

584
00:19:38,641 --> 00:19:39,474
So,

585
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:39,901
uh,

586
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:44,901
how fast is the solar
motion induced by Jupiter?

587
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:52,890
Okay.

588
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,110
And now we go back to
this momentum equation.

589
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,130
Uh,

590
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:01,130
velocity of Jupiter Times the mass of
Jupiter is equal to the velocity of the

591
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,490
Sun Times the mass of the sun.

592
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,000
What we want to know is
the velocity of the sun.

593
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,910
And so that is equal to
the velocity of Jupiter,

594
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:10,260
which we just calculated,

595
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:10,980
uh,

596
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,980
times the mass of Jupiter
divided by the mass of the sun.

597
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,890
1.5 times 10 to the four.

598
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:23,280
That's the velocity of Jupiter
mass of Jupiter as it happens.

599
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:24,690
I think I wrote this down last time.

600
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,100
Two Times 10 to the 27
kilograms mass of the sun.

601
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,870
Two Times 10 to the 30.

602
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:33,920
Okay.

603
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,701
Two's capsule.

604
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:35,534
Obviously.

605
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,110
Uh,

606
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,880
we get 1.5 times 10 to the
four times 10 to the 27.

607
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:42,320
That's 10 to the 31.

608
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,500
10 to the 31 divided by 10 to the 30 is
10 to the one is equal to 15 meters per

609
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:49,001
second,

610
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:50,020
not kilometers.

611
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:51,010
Now meters.

612
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,350
And so the sun,

613
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,470
the Jupiter moves 15
kilometers per second.

614
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,470
The Sun moved 15 meters per second.

615
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,370
That makes perfect sense because the sun
is a thousand times more massive than

616
00:21:04,371 --> 00:21:04,761
Jupiter.

617
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:07,070
So it has to be going a
thousand times more slowly.

618
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,980
So instead of moving at some
number of kilometers per second,

619
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,290
it's moving at some numbers
of meters per second.

620
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:13,551
This,

621
00:21:13,551 --> 00:21:14,384
it turns out,

622
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,610
can be detected with modern equipment.

623
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,680
Uh,

624
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,640
detect a both.

625
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,483
Let's say,

626
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,200
uh,

627
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,460
in distance starts you can see things
that move by 15 meters a second.

628
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:27,600
Uh,

629
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,440
we'll come back to,

630
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,700
to how that's done in a minute.

631
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,110
How about the earth solar
motion due to Earth.

632
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,730
Now you might think this is going to be
bigger because the velocity of earth is

633
00:21:40,731 --> 00:21:42,320
bigger than the velocity of Jupiter,

634
00:21:42,321 --> 00:21:43,610
but of course the mass is much,

635
00:21:43,611 --> 00:21:44,444
much smaller.

636
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,310
So we have an earth,

637
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,630
earth is equal to a m sun.

638
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,550
The Sun where visa now means
the emotion induced by earth.

639
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,520
This number is bigger
than it was for Jupiter,

640
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,770
but this number is a whole lot smaller.

641
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,050
And so the overall effect is that,

642
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:03,770
uh,

643
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,810
the sun is going to be smaller.

644
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,913
Uh,

645
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,310
the earth earth over,

646
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,480
uh,

647
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,320
m son,

648
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,990
that's three times 10 to the fourth.

649
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:17,000
That's the velocity mass of the earth.

650
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:17,661
As it turns out,

651
00:22:17,661 --> 00:22:20,750
as six times 10 to the
24 meters per second.

652
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,560
Uh,

653
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,020
the sun down here at
two times 10 to the 30,

654
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:24,883
same son,

655
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,960
six over two is three,

656
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,640
three times three is 10.

657
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:33,050
So we get 10 times 10 to
the four times 10 to the 24,

658
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,790
over 10 to the 30,

659
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:35,750
uh,

660
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,583
10 to the one,

661
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,180
one five,

662
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,040
29 over 30,

663
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:45,250
that's 10 to the minus one is equal to
one 10th of a meter per second or 10

664
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,140
centimeters per second.

665
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,760
So that's much,

666
00:22:49,761 --> 00:22:52,070
much slower than the sun moves.

667
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:52,641
In response.

668
00:22:52,641 --> 00:22:53,540
Did you put her why?

669
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,460
Because the earth is so much less massive.

670
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:57,710
So 15 meters a second,

671
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:58,161
uh,

672
00:22:58,161 --> 00:22:58,610
for,

673
00:22:58,610 --> 00:22:58,791
uh,

674
00:22:58,791 --> 00:22:59,930
as a result of Jupiter,

675
00:22:59,931 --> 00:23:01,340
only 10 centimeters,

676
00:23:01,341 --> 00:23:01,761
a second,

677
00:23:01,761 --> 00:23:03,200
a 10th of a meter per second,

678
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:03,771
uh,

679
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:05,330
as a result of,

680
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,050
uh,

681
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,530
uh,

682
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,990
earth and with current technology,

683
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:09,950
uh,

684
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,310
things that slow are not detectable yet

685
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,970
in other around other stars.

686
00:23:19,971 --> 00:23:24,410
So we have a situation and this was what
was happening about 10 years ago where,

687
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:24,830
uh,

688
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:29,060
instruments have been developed that could
in principle see the reflex motion of

689
00:23:29,061 --> 00:23:30,740
stars due to planets like Jupiter,

690
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:32,840
but weren't yet capable of seeing,

691
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:33,380
uh,

692
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,550
the motion of stars.

693
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,090
Uh,

694
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,310
the motion of stars due
to planets like earth.

695
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:41,390
But we expect that solar systems
Oughta have planets like Jupiter.

696
00:23:41,391 --> 00:23:43,430
And so people went out to try and look,

697
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:46,493
all right,

698
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,650
how do you find,

699
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:50,120
how do you observe these things?

700
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,120
And now if you've taken
high school physics,

701
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,450
you will recall perhaps something
called the doppler shift.

702
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,830
This is the key.

703
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,123
Uh,

704
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,293
and,

705
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:02,960
uh,

706
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,390
this is a way of measuring velocity.

707
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,130
And it turns out,

708
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,263
oddly enough,

709
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:12,140
that velocities are some of the most
easy and straight forward things to

710
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:12,860
measure,

711
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,220
uh,

712
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:17,500
in astronomical objects because you
can determine them by the doppler ship.

713
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:18,711
Uh,

714
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:20,360
and so just to remind you,

715
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:20,810
or,

716
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:21,110
uh,

717
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,260
to inform you if you
haven't seen this before,

718
00:24:24,261 --> 00:24:24,710
and there's,

719
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,161
there's,

720
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:25,370
uh,

721
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,250
some help sheets and things that
you can look at about this too.

722
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,090
Uh,

723
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:29,923
light,

724
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:30,770
uh,

725
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,630
is characterized

726
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,153
bye.

727
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,570
It's wavelength,

728
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,190
uh,

729
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,010
which is usually given
the Greek letter lambda,

730
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,240
uh,

731
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,240
and a light that is something like four
times 10 to the minus seven meters of

732
00:24:50,381 --> 00:24:52,360
wave link has units of length.

733
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,170
Uh,

734
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,880
this looks blue to us,

735
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,190
a light that is,

736
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:57,940
uh,

737
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,980
let's color code this
for your convenience.

738
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,480
A five times 10 to the minus
seven meters looks green,

739
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,243
uh,

740
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,680
seven times 10 to the minus
seven meters a kind of looks red.

741
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,933
Uh,

742
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,000
longer wavelengths are
what we call infrared

743
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,170
and shorter wave lengths,

744
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,460
uh,

745
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:21,770
that,

746
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,420
that we can't see are called ultra violet.

747
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:24,861
Uh,

748
00:25:24,861 --> 00:25:25,694
and so,

749
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:26,001
uh,

750
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:28,430
so ultra violet up here,

751
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,420
and if you get really,

752
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:32,254
really long,

753
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:33,070
uh,

754
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,230
if you have like meter wave lengths,

755
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,040
uh,

756
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,230
that's radio waves out here.

757
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,050
And if you have really short wave lengths,

758
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,783
uh,

759
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,430
those are x rays and gamma rays.

760
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:50,400
So all of these kinds of radiation
are basically the same thing called

761
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:52,070
electromagnetic radiation.

762
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:55,671
Again,

763
00:25:55,671 --> 00:25:56,510
there's a help sheet,

764
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,823
uh,

765
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:03,160
these are all electromagnetic radiation
at what kind of radiation it is,

766
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,270
depends on the wavelength.

767
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:06,353
Uh,

768
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:11,790
and the key to the doppler shift
is that the observed wavelength

769
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,990
changes,

770
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:18,850
uh,

771
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:23,850
depending on the relative motion of
the thing in meeting the light in the

772
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:26,504
observer

773
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,560
motion of source and observer

774
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:37,940
in particular,

775
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,590
if they're moving toward each other,

776
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:46,381
uh,

777
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:48,120
then the wavelength gets shorter.

778
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:49,610
Yeah.

779
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,830
And if they're moving
away from each other,

780
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,040
the wavelength gets longer.

781
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,320
Do you feel an equation coming on?

782
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,300
Yeah,

783
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,610
because obviously this is
going to need to be quantified,

784
00:27:04,611 --> 00:27:04,861
right?

785
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:05,000
You know,

786
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,840
how much shorter,

787
00:27:05,841 --> 00:27:06,680
how much longer.

788
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,933
Uh,

789
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:08,541
but,

790
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:09,470
but before we do that,

791
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:10,490
let me just point out that,

792
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:10,700
uh,

793
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,180
uh,

794
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,230
this motion towards is sometimes
called a blue shift because it makes,

795
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,400
it pushes the light from the red end of
the visual spectrum towards the blue.

796
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:20,510
Uh,

797
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:22,520
and this kind of thing here,

798
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:24,890
the emotion away from each
other's called the red shift.

799
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,030
Okay.

800
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,690
Uh,

801
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,560
and uh,

802
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,130
let me,

803
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:30,963
uh,

804
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,620
let me show you why this is true.

805
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:33,101
Before I,

806
00:27:33,101 --> 00:27:34,720
before I write down the equation,

807
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,003
let's see.

808
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,383
Uh,

809
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:41,680
it's just,

810
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,513
uh,

811
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:47,080
let me get out of that
and try this one instead.

812
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,030
It's just a property of a,

813
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,130
of how waves what.

814
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,070
So,

815
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,860
uh,

816
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,550
look what's happened.

817
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,920
If the thing is stationary
there in the middle,

818
00:27:56,921 --> 00:27:58,120
but emitting the waves,

819
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,730
then the waves propagate
equally in all directions.

820
00:28:00,731 --> 00:28:05,620
In both observers see the same
distance between success of re waves.

821
00:28:05,621 --> 00:28:07,990
That is to say the same wavelength.

822
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,890
Uh,

823
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,120
and you can see that there.

824
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,490
Then when the thing is
moving in one direction,

825
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,000
uh,

826
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,380
each successive wave is emitted
a little bit closer to one,

827
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,260
a observer and a little further
away from the other observer.

828
00:28:20,261 --> 00:28:24,790
And so because the waves are
emitted a at different places,

829
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,560
the way front here,

830
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,310
uh,

831
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:27,690
Po,

832
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,360
uh,

833
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,980
I'll wait until this cycle goes through.

834
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,610
Again,

835
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,680
the wave fronts for this observer,

836
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:32,991
uh,

837
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:35,920
are closer to each other and
the wavelength looks shorter.

838
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:39,400
So when the thing is coming towards
you that submitting the wave,

839
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:39,730
uh,

840
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:42,280
it looks shorter to the
observer it's going towards,

841
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,990
whereas for this guy,

842
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:44,860
uh,

843
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,670
the waves,

844
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:49,090
each successive wave is emitted
a little bit further away.

845
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,560
And so the wave fronts,

846
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,270
uh,

847
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,710
are further away from each
other when they pass him in,

848
00:28:53,711 --> 00:28:55,150
the wavelength of becomes longer.

849
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,610
So that's the kind of conceptual,

850
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,180
uh,

851
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,170
thing that's going on.

852
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,200
And the key thing is that the velocity
that that's relevant here is velocity

853
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:06,520
toward and away from you.

854
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,350
If the thing is going sideways,

855
00:29:08,351 --> 00:29:09,700
it doesn't make any difference.

856
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:10,450
Uh,

857
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,900
and so it's not actually
velocity that you observe,

858
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,260
uh,

859
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,730
by looking at the doppler shift,

860
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:16,560
it's,

861
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,170
uh,

862
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,640
it's radio velocity,

863
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:19,990
which is the technical term for,

864
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,470
is the thing coming towards you or
moving away from you and how fast is it

865
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,304
coming towards you?

866
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,560
And how fast is it's moving away from you.

867
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,953
Okay.

868
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:32,391
Let me,

869
00:29:32,391 --> 00:29:33,224
uh,

870
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,450
turn this off here.

871
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,433
Stuff.

872
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:40,343
Hi.

873
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,120
All right,

874
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,200
so here's the equation

875
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,213
for that.

876
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,913
Let's see here.

877
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:02,000
Lamb does the wavelength.

878
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,920
I'll explain all these terms in a minute.

879
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,660
Uh,

880
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,860
and this is important,

881
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,870
and the terms mean the following things.

882
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,203
Uh,

883
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,640
this is radio velocity.

884
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:22,583
Okay.

885
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,051
Uh,

886
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:26,830
and it's positive when
it's going away from you.

887
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,240
It's negative when it's going towards you

888
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,610
and it's zero when it's going sideways

889
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:46,610
and it's a velocity of 10 meters per
second or whatever the appropriate units

890
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:49,430
have for launch per fortnight or
whatever the appropriate units are.

891
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:49,790
A,

892
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:53,090
the only restriction on the route units
is it has to be in the same unit as the

893
00:30:53,091 --> 00:30:54,620
thing in the denominator here.

894
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:55,611
That see,

895
00:30:55,611 --> 00:30:56,720
that's the speed of light.

896
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,840
That's three times 10 to
the eight meters per second.

897
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,590
Maybe we should have you work it
out in for logs per fortnight.

898
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,440
Uh,

899
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:08,681
no,

900
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:08,851
no,

901
00:31:08,851 --> 00:31:09,090
no,

902
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:09,923
we won't do that.

903
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,793
Uh,

904
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:11,340
but,

905
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:11,491
uh,

906
00:31:11,491 --> 00:31:15,570
as long as the velocity here is expressed
in the same terms as you expressed the

907
00:31:15,571 --> 00:31:16,201
speed of light,

908
00:31:16,201 --> 00:31:17,400
then the units we'll work out.

909
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,440
Uh,

910
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,470
this lambda to with the
little zero at the bottom,

911
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:23,700
uh,

912
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,500
is the rest.

913
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,463
Yeah,

914
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,640
wave length.

915
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,340
So that's the wavelength
you would observe,

916
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,210
uh,

917
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:31,900
from,

918
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,170
uh,

919
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,010
from whatever light source
electromagnetic radiation source you have.

920
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,390
If nothing was moving.

921
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,940
And Delta Lambda,

922
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,980
this is not delta times lambda.

923
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,170
That's one symbol.

924
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,010
Uh,

925
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,090
confusingly enough.

926
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,980
Delta always means change.

927
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:48,580
Uh,

928
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,150
for those,

929
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,770
you may remember this from Calculus.

930
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:51,370
Uh,

931
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,390
if you've taken calculus,

932
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:53,560
Delta always means change.

933
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,770
So this is a change in velocity.

934
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,130
Uh,

935
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:57,520
change,

936
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:57,821
sorry,

937
00:31:57,821 --> 00:32:00,040
change in the wavelength.

938
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,720
And it is defined such that the
observed wavelength is equal to the rest

939
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,333
wavelength,

940
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:15,140
plus the change in the wavelength
induced by the radio velocity.

941
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,640
So now look how this works.

942
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,580
If this side of the equation is negative,

943
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,500
if it's coming towards you,

944
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,310
uh,

945
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,380
then this quantity is negative.

946
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,420
That means this quantity is negative.

947
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,700
That means this quantity is negative.

948
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,930
That means the observed wavelength
is shorter than the rest wavelength,

949
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:34,460
which is exactly how it's supposed to be.

950
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:35,690
When you come towards you,

951
00:32:35,691 --> 00:32:36,501
it's blue shifted.

952
00:32:36,501 --> 00:32:37,610
The wavelengths get shorter.

953
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:38,150
Uh,

954
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:38,841
similarly,

955
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:40,030
if this is going,

956
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,510
if something's going away from you,

957
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:42,980
then Vesa bar is positive.

958
00:32:42,981 --> 00:32:44,000
This is positive,

959
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,760
and you end up with a longer wavelength.

960
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,653
Okay?

961
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,360
All right.

962
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,523
Example,

963
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:55,520
how fast you have to go
to turn a red light green.

964
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,800
This is potentially useful.

965
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:58,340
Uh,

966
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,930
should you ever be pulled
over for running a,

967
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,671
running a,

968
00:33:01,671 --> 00:33:02,840
a red light?

969
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,980
Uh,

970
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,330
you can just say it look green.

971
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:06,643
Uh,

972
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,940
how fast,

973
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,930
uh,

974
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,790
to make a red light green,

975
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,920
and let's call a green light five
times 10 to the minus seven meters,

976
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,270
a red light is seven times
10 to the minus seven meters.

977
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,480
So Delta Lambda had better be equal to
seven minus five times 10 to the minus

978
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:33,110
seven a,

979
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:35,270
that's two times 10 to the minus seven,

980
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:36,070
uh,

981
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,471
again,

982
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:37,250
in meters.

983
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:42,250
And we want this to be negative because
we want lamb does zero to be the red.

984
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,780
That's what it would be
like if nothing was moving.

985
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:45,890
Uh,

986
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,340
and,

987
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:46,521
uh,

988
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:49,310
we want lambda observed to be green,

989
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,451
uh,

990
00:33:50,451 --> 00:33:54,800
and lamb to observed equals
lambda zero plus Delta Lambda.

991
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:59,801
So this had better be minus two
times 10 to the minus seven meters.

992
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,370
Uh,

993
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,203
and so,

994
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:02,690
uh,

995
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,940
Delta Lambda over lambda zero,

996
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:07,640
that's minus two times
10 to the minus seven,

997
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,520
over five times 10 to the minus seven.

998
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,520
So that's minus two fifths is equal to
the radio velocity over the speed of

999
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:16,550
light.

1000
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,150
So if you're going at minus two fifths,

1001
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,210
the speed of light,

1002
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,550
then the red light looks green.

1003
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,050
Uh,

1004
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:24,290
Nan,

1005
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:27,230
the minus just means you have
to be moving toward that light.

1006
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:27,920
Uh,

1007
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,630
now two things about this.

1008
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,141
First of all,

1009
00:34:30,141 --> 00:34:33,770
don't use this as an excuse because it'll
cost you much more in the ticket for

1010
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:35,090
going over the speed limit.

1011
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:35,630
Uh,

1012
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,760
if you're going at two
fifths of the speed of life,

1013
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,713
second of all,

1014
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,080
uh,

1015
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,040
be wary of this a little bit
because there is in fact changes,

1016
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:43,460
uh,

1017
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,490
to the equation that happens when you're
going close to the speed of light.

1018
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:48,650
And we'll talk about that
when we get to relativity.

1019
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:49,040
Uh,

1020
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,690
and so this was just an example of,

1021
00:34:50,691 --> 00:34:50,961
of,

1022
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:52,160
of how this works out.

1023
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,000
Uh,

1024
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,180
it,

1025
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,013
but,

1026
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:54,500
uh,

1027
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,630
when you're dealing with
the motions of stars,

1028
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:58,490
15 meters per second,

1029
00:34:58,491 --> 00:34:59,840
10 centimeters or second,

1030
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:01,160
you're nowhere near the speed of light.

1031
00:35:01,161 --> 00:35:04,340
And so the equation that I
wrote down is actually fine.

1032
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,810
So what do you expect to see
when you're looking at a star,

1033
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,230
which has a planet in orbit around it?

1034
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,500
Looking at a star,

1035
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,060
at a star in some kind of orbit.

1036
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,320
So here's the radio velocity
as a function of time.

1037
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,600
And the key thing about orbits is that
the radio velocity changes because first

1038
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:30,680
the things coming towards you.

1039
00:35:30,681 --> 00:35:31,850
Then later in its orbit,

1040
00:35:31,851 --> 00:35:33,440
it turns around and goes the other way.

1041
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,810
Then it comes back and
it comes towards you,

1042
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,620
turns around and goes other way.

1043
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:42,690
So the radio velocity will change from
positive to negative and back as the

1044
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:44,550
object first comes towards you,

1045
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,630
then away from you.

1046
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:47,130
And so it'll look like this.

1047
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,173
Yeah,

1048
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,000
if you make a whole bunch
of observations of this,

1049
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,540
and it turns out that for circular orbits,

1050
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:57,783
uh,

1051
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,960
this is a sign wave.

1052
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:03,283
Uh,

1053
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,040
and,

1054
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:04,640
uh,

1055
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,230
if you were to observe this,

1056
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:09,260
you could observe
directly from such a plot.

1057
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,840
If you made repeated observations of,

1058
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,320
uh,

1059
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,050
of the radio velocity of a
star or some other thing in,

1060
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:16,910
or bet you could observe two things.

1061
00:36:16,911 --> 00:36:17,331
First of all,

1062
00:36:17,331 --> 00:36:20,330
you would immediately be able to
tell what the orbital period is.

1063
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,360
That's the amount of time.

1064
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,560
This is a time axis.

1065
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:25,370
It takes,

1066
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:25,640
uh,

1067
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,730
for the object to come back to
the same place in the orbit,

1068
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,241
uh,

1069
00:36:29,241 --> 00:36:30,320
for a second time.

1070
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,150
Second of all,

1071
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,870
you could tell something
about what the velocity is.

1072
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:36,300
Uh,

1073
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,990
the amplitude of this sign wave

1074
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,273
is,

1075
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,173
uh,

1076
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,000
something to do with the overall velocity
because that's the maximum velocity it

1077
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:48,260
has coming towards you.

1078
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,490
Uh,

1079
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:54,490
but you have to be a little careful here
because that's only true if the object,

1080
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,040
uh,

1081
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,730
if the orbit is edge on,

1082
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,560
let me explain what I mean by that.

1083
00:37:03,561 --> 00:37:04,790
We'll come back to this later.

1084
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,530
If the orbits going this way,

1085
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,840
then it never comes towards
you or goes away from you.

1086
00:37:08,841 --> 00:37:10,190
It's always going sideways.

1087
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,480
If on the other hand,

1088
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:12,500
the orbits going this way,

1089
00:37:12,501 --> 00:37:13,730
then first it comes towards you,

1090
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,900
then it goes away from you.

1091
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:15,530
Uh,

1092
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,240
and if it's somewhere in between,

1093
00:37:17,241 --> 00:37:21,530
you only see part of the motion of
the orbit in terms of radio velocity.

1094
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,460
So this amplitude is v
if the orbit is edge on,

1095
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,271
if not,

1096
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:29,540
v is going to be more than that because
you're only seeing part of the motion.

1097
00:37:29,541 --> 00:37:31,610
That's a detail we'll come back to later.

1098
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,010
So this is what you expect to see.

1099
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,050
Uh,

1100
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:40,100
if there's a planet going around the star
and if you have enough sensitivity and

1101
00:37:40,101 --> 00:37:45,020
your measurements of the doppler shift
to be able to actually see a that motion.

1102
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:48,260
Okay.

1103
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,460
So here's what they saw.

1104
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,241
This,

1105
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:50,600
uh,

1106
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,433
is uh,

1107
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:52,210
uh,

1108
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:57,080
a star called 51 Pegasus in
the constellation of pegasis.

1109
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,030
It is a solar analog,

1110
00:37:59,031 --> 00:37:59,870
so called,

1111
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:00,710
uh,

1112
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,920
by which they mean it's as about
as much like the sun as they can,

1113
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,440
as you can find if you go
out and look at other stores.

1114
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:07,310
So it's very,

1115
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:08,450
very much like the sun.

1116
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:08,960
Uh,

1117
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,510
this is a radio velocity curve.

1118
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:11,991
Uh,

1119
00:38:11,991 --> 00:38:13,960
I've taken the access off for a reason.

1120
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:14,870
I'll point out later.

1121
00:38:14,871 --> 00:38:15,681
But it's a,

1122
00:38:15,681 --> 00:38:15,981
you know,

1123
00:38:15,981 --> 00:38:20,981
this is radio velocity versus time and
this is exactly what you expect to see.

1124
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,240
It goes up,

1125
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,150
it comes down a very good news.

1126
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,100
This is exactly what you expect to see.

1127
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:28,610
Uh,

1128
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,690
for a planet.

1129
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:31,490
There are two problems here.

1130
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,140
As it turns out.

1131
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,670
Problem number one

1132
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,190
is the x axis

1133
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,450
because it turns out the amount of
time it takes you to go one orbit,

1134
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,230
uh,

1135
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:47,620
around for this object is a
little more than four days.

1136
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:54,690
The shortest orbital plus a period of a
planet in our own solar system is that

1137
00:38:54,691 --> 00:38:55,231
of mercury,

1138
00:38:55,231 --> 00:38:56,580
which is 88 days.

1139
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:01,650
So this thing is way closer to the
star then anything in our solar system

1140
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,800
x axis problem is that p is
equal to around four days.

1141
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,560
Problem number two

1142
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,500
is the y axis.

1143
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,570
And now let me put some
units onto this thing.

1144
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,540
I've done a very bad thing of
showing you a graph with no units,

1145
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:22,530
but it was just to,

1146
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:22,981
you know,

1147
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:24,300
prolong the suspense here.

1148
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,403
Uh,

1149
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,180
visa bar zero.

1150
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,010
So that's going sideways.

1151
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,830
This is 50 meters a second.

1152
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,460
This is negative 50 meters a second.

1153
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,050
Ah,

1154
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,500
and so first it here,

1155
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:38,850
it's coming towards you there.

1156
00:39:38,851 --> 00:39:39,870
It's going away from you.

1157
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,930
And so the amplitude of this thing,

1158
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,960
and therefore the velocity of the star
is something like 50 meters a second.

1159
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,970
Now it's less obvious
why that's a problem,

1160
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:51,661
but it is.

1161
00:39:51,661 --> 00:39:52,200
And let me,

1162
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,250
let me show you why.

1163
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,930
Now let me do the equation.

1164
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:55,660
Uh,

1165
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,090
do the equations a little bit.

1166
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,763
Uh,

1167
00:39:58,770 --> 00:39:59,280
okay,

1168
00:39:59,280 --> 00:39:59,901
so this is a,

1169
00:39:59,901 --> 00:40:01,440
so solar analog.

1170
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,470
What is the,

1171
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,010
uh,

1172
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:10,010
semi major access of the
planets or bed access of planet?

1173
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,250
We know P is equal to,

1174
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:14,700
uh,

1175
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,300
let's see,

1176
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:16,170
four over three.

1177
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:21,170
65.24 is equal to one over a hundred is
equal to 10 to the minus two in years.

1178
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,130
Uh,

1179
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,330
that's four days over,

1180
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,350
over a year.

1181
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:30,480
A and M is equal to one solar
mass because it's a solar analog.

1182
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:35,690
So a cube equals p squared m is
equal to 10 to the minus two squared.

1183
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,650
M is equal to one 10 to the minus four.

1184
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:44,100
So a is equal to 10 to the uh,

1185
00:40:44,101 --> 00:40:44,611
well let's,

1186
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:49,611
we got to do this right a hundred times
10 to the minus six to the one third

1187
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:51,084
power.

1188
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,133
Uh,

1189
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,630
five cube does a 125.

1190
00:40:54,631 --> 00:40:56,490
So the cube root of 100 is five,

1191
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,180
uh,

1192
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,960
five times 10 to the minus
two astronomical units,

1193
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,220
uh,

1194
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,750
or like to put it in a,

1195
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,890
in real units here,

1196
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:10,130
five times 10 to the minus
two and astronomical unit
is 1.5 times 10 to the 11

1197
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,103
meters,

1198
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:18,030
five times one and a half is like
seven times 10 to the nine meters.

1199
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,860
So that how,

1200
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,510
that's the semi major axis.

1201
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,830
And if you compare it,

1202
00:41:22,831 --> 00:41:26,070
if you go look at the lists of
planets in our own solar system,

1203
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:29,700
what you'll discover is that way closer
than any of the planets in our own solar

1204
00:41:29,701 --> 00:41:30,031
system,

1205
00:41:30,031 --> 00:41:32,850
way closer to the star than mercury is a,

1206
00:41:32,851 --> 00:41:35,420
I used the y axis yet.

1207
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:35,870
Uh,

1208
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,100
now I'm about to,

1209
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,330
uh,

1210
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,340
because what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take,

1211
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,850
I'm going to figure out the velocity
that this planet is moving at.

1212
00:41:43,851 --> 00:41:45,770
That's two Pi a over p.

1213
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,600
We wrote that down a little while ago.

1214
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,321
A,

1215
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:49,370
I just figured out,

1216
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,280
so two times Pi Times,

1217
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:52,790
uh,

1218
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:57,790
seven times 10 to the nine
p is one 100th of a year.

1219
00:41:57,981 --> 00:42:01,820
So that's 10 to the minus two
times three times 10 to the seven,

1220
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,860
which is the number of seconds in a year.

1221
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,620
Pi over three is one,

1222
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,070
uh,

1223
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:12,440
two times seven is 15,

1224
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:13,783
uh,

1225
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,250
10 to the nine,

1226
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,690
a 10 to the minus two
times 10 to the seven,

1227
00:42:17,691 --> 00:42:18,890
10 to the five.

1228
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:19,910
Uh,

1229
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:24,910
so this is 15 times 10 to the
four or 1.5 times 10 to the five.

1230
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:28,160
So this thing is going
on a hunt the planet.

1231
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:31,220
Now this is the total,

1232
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:36,250
which is approximately equal to v planet
is going at 150 kilometers a second,

1233
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:39,180
much faster than the
earth is going around.

1234
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,100
That makes perfect sense.

1235
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:40,940
It's in closer.

1236
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:43,010
Got to move faster to stay in its orbit.

1237
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:44,300
Uh,

1238
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:48,740
and so this is 150 kilometers a
second if you prefer those units.

1239
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:52,010
Now we know the velocity of the planet.

1240
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,290
We know the mass of the star.

1241
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,250
Uh,

1242
00:42:55,250 --> 00:43:00,250
we know the velocity of the star and
so we can figure out the mass of the

1243
00:43:01,071 --> 00:43:01,904
planet.

1244
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:02,810
Here's how it works.

1245
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,980
And Planet,

1246
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:07,520
the planet is equal to m star.

1247
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,380
The Star,

1248
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,113
uh,

1249
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:16,120
v Planet we've just figured out
is 1.5 times 10 to the five.

1250
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:17,211
Uh,

1251
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:19,940
actually let's leave it as
15 times 10 to the four.

1252
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,310
That'll turn out to be
easier for the arithmetic,

1253
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,670
the mass of the stars,

1254
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,040
the same as the mass of the sun.

1255
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,450
Two Times 10 to the 30.

1256
00:43:27,290 --> 00:43:27,561
Uh,

1257
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:29,690
the velocity of the star we just observed,

1258
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:31,070
we saw it moving back and forth.

1259
00:43:31,071 --> 00:43:32,570
It's 50 kilometers a second,

1260
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,400
five times 10 to the one.

1261
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,350
Okay.

1262
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,101
So now,

1263
00:43:37,101 --> 00:43:39,350
and this is multiplied by
the mass of the planet.

1264
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:45,580
So the mass of the planet mass of the
planet is equal to a two times 10 to the

1265
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:48,104
30,

1266
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:49,070
uh,

1267
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:54,070
times five times 10 to the one
divided by 15 times 10 to the four.

1268
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:57,680
Five over 15 is a third.

1269
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,400
So this is a third times 10 to the minus
three times the mass of the sun tent to

1270
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:07,070
a minus three times the mass of the sun.

1271
00:44:07,071 --> 00:44:08,240
That's the mass of Jupiter.

1272
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,660
So this is equal to one third,

1273
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,070
the mass of Jupiter,

1274
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:18,620
which is by the way bigger than the mass
of Saturn or any other object in our

1275
00:44:18,621 --> 00:44:19,520
own solar system.

1276
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:23,061
Okay?

1277
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:24,380
So that's catastrophic,

1278
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:25,701
right?

1279
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:30,701
That's a hopeless disaster because the
first part of the lecture and the second

1280
00:44:32,341 --> 00:44:35,460
part of the lecture have
entirely contradicted each other.

1281
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:39,300
Cause in the first part of the lecture
I gave you a whole song and dance.

1282
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:39,750
Uh,

1283
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,441
and you know,

1284
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:43,200
you all wrote it down and it
sounded believable at the time,

1285
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:46,950
how inner planets were going
to be these small rocky things.

1286
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:52,380
And now the very first planet we'd
go out and find turns out to be,

1287
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,133
uh,

1288
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:54,850
a,

1289
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:55,290
uh,

1290
00:44:55,290 --> 00:45:00,290
very close planet that quite massive,

1291
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:07,830
and this is impossible according to,

1292
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:08,690
uh,

1293
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:08,970
uh,

1294
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:13,970
this nice little fury of
planetary formation that I
promulgated to you earlier

1295
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,173
in the lecture.

1296
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:16,433
And so,

1297
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,190
uh,

1298
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,710
the very first a planet that was observed,

1299
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,070
uh,

1300
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:22,080
turned out to be a screw up.

1301
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,640
A worse than that.

1302
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:24,930
There were soon,

1303
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,190
uh,

1304
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:27,750
dozens more like it

1305
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,263
discovered.

1306
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:36,860
These are given the name hot Jupiters
and you could see what the problem is if

1307
00:45:38,011 --> 00:45:40,830
you figure out what the surface
temperature of these things ought to be.

1308
00:45:40,831 --> 00:45:43,080
It's that it's over a thousand degrees.

1309
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:47,250
There's no way you
could have a gas or ice,

1310
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:47,641
uh,

1311
00:45:47,641 --> 00:45:48,361
on such a thing.

1312
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:49,290
It would totally melt.

1313
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:49,951
Uh,

1314
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:53,760
and there aren't enough rocks
in the whole rocky elements,

1315
00:45:53,761 --> 00:45:55,020
silicon,

1316
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,010
uh,

1317
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,210
uh,

1318
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:01,860
and iron and so forth in the whole of
the planetary system of our own solar

1319
00:46:01,861 --> 00:46:02,694
system to,

1320
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,040
to add up to one third of the Jupiter,

1321
00:46:05,041 --> 00:46:06,480
even if you put them all together.

1322
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,070
So how is this done?

1323
00:46:11,071 --> 00:46:11,640
What is,

1324
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:13,050
what is going on here?

1325
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:13,950
Uh,

1326
00:46:13,950 --> 00:46:17,160
it seems clear that one of
two things must be true.

1327
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:22,290
Either this thing isn't a planet
and there's some other explanation,

1328
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:23,250
uh,

1329
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,090
for this,

1330
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:24,800
uh,

1331
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,800
attractive bunch of data here or
something has gone seriously wrong in our

1332
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:33,810
understanding of how planets form.

1333
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:34,890
Uh,

1334
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:35,431
and,

1335
00:46:35,431 --> 00:46:36,030
uh,

1336
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:36,330
uh,

1337
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,163
stay tuned.

1338
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,300
We'll talk about that next time.
