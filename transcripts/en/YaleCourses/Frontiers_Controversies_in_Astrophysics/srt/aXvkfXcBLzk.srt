1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:05,420
I had spent a very enjoyable weekend
reading your Pluto comments. Uh,

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,840
no, that was fun. Uh, it
is a surprisingly, uh,

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,830
it's a surprisingly deep topic.

4
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:14,630
There's technical issues about
how orbits of planets work. Uh,

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,120
there are these interesting
cultural and political

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,140
currents that underlie the
whole thing. Uh, and uh,

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,313
uh,

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,880
also some sort of deep
philosophy or what the literary,

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,320
uh, professors like to call
theory about what it means,

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,410
what it means to name something and what
the consequences of particular names

11
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:42,150
are. Uh, and, uh,

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,560
so I thought I would make a couple of
comments on the Pluto thing first before

13
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:50,520
we get, uh, get back to the
hot Jupiters. Let's see. Uh,

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,600
the first thing I would say,

15
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:54,480
let me encourage you all when
you get this kind of a question,

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,540
answer the question that's asked
the biggest problem in, uh,

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,600
the answers that I saw where
that sometimes you just
didn't address the specific

18
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:04,380
question that was asked.

19
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,380
What I asked was to what extent is
the Pluto controversy a scientific

20
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:11,574
controversy?

21
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,970
You don't answer that by a narrative
describing what happens if you say,

22
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,550
well they discovered Eris and then
that through the scientific world into

23
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:24,150
confusion and they had this big meeting
and there was all this fuss. Uh,

24
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:27,660
and then people started to get involved,
weren't scientists and so forth.

25
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,650
That doesn't answer the question because
the question was to what extent is this

26
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:33,150
a scientific controversy?

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,890
There are two possible categories
of answer to that question. One is,

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,360
yes,
it was a,

29
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:44,130
it is primarily a scientific controversy
and the other category is no,

30
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,040
it was primarily not a
scientific controversy.

31
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:50,940
And if you didn't say one of those
things or something somewhere in between,

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,730
then that's not kind of
responsive to the question.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,620
I would say that you could answer that
particular question in this case in both

34
00:01:58,621 --> 00:01:59,880
directions.
Uh,

35
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:04,470
perfectly well if you want to make a
case that it's a scientific issue, uh,

36
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:07,620
you say, look, classification
is very important to science.

37
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:12,270
I made that point in class
on, uh, uh, uh, a week ago.

38
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,590
Uh, and that, you know,

39
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:17,220
you've got to have your classifications
right and in order to understand what's

40
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:20,610
going on and what has happened
here is new data has come in,

41
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,640
which has thrown the old
classifications into question,

42
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:28,140
although it should be noted that there
wasn't officially a definition of planet,

43
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,420
uh,
that goes back to antiquity.

44
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:34,800
And one of the things they were trying
to do was to, was to create one. Uh,

45
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,730
but that as new data came in from
the outer parts of the solar system,

46
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:41,850
we had to revise our classifications
in this is a key point of science.

47
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:45,780
And therefore the whole thing is,
is at root a scientific issue.

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,460
But you could also argue the
opposite in that, you know,

49
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,920
the scientific issue
was not really in doubt.

50
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:58,160
Nobody was questioning whether Pluto and
Eris and all those things ought to be

51
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:02,980
in the same category as Jupiter. Clearly
they're not. That wasn't the issue.

52
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,870
The reason this became so controversial
is because there were a lot of people

53
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:09,970
who, uh, scientists and,

54
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,690
and non scientists who thought that it
would be nice if Pluto could remain a

55
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:18,220
planet and therefore they came up with
these rather convoluted definitions in

56
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:22,120
order to maintain the idea that
Pluto should remain a planet.

57
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:25,330
And then they got into trouble because
50 other things would therefore also have

58
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:26,520
to be planets.
Uh,

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,800
but it's rooted in a nonscientific desire
for Pluto to remain a planet and for

60
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:36,730
very few other things to be
admitted to this pantheon.

61
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,480
And that is fundamentally
not a scientific thing.

62
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:45,640
And you could argue that that's the
whole root of the entire issue. Now,

63
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,390
uh, one of the interesting things is that
these nonscientific things affect the

64
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:54,220
scientist to a lot of you quoted this
Guy Alan Stern, who's a planetary,

65
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,480
a famous planetary scientist who objected
to the way it all ended up by saying,

66
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:00,221
look,

67
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:04,810
one of the definitions that they've put
down is that you have to clear out your

68
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,870
orbit. And Pluto doesn't
make it in that, uh, uh,

69
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:11,410
in that context because it crosses the
orbit of Neptune, which much bigger thing.

70
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,850
But stern goes on to say Neptune
also crosses the orbit of Pluto.

71
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,740
And so obviously there's some
hidden assumption here, uh,

72
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:21,830
about, you know, the,

73
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,240
the thing that's much more massive
counts and the thing that's less massive

74
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:27,190
doesn't count,
but that hasn't actually been stated.

75
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:28,720
And so this is a lousy definition.

76
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,770
And so he objected on scientific
grounds to this definition. Uh,

77
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,000
and some of you noted that a stern is
the principal investigator of the new

78
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:40,750
horizons mission. Uh, but I don't think
you noticed the implications of that.

79
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,900
The New Horizons mission is a planetary
probe that is on its way now to Pluto.

80
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,870
And the reason that it was launched,

81
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:53,410
the retail Al Gore was actually very
enthusiastic about this when he was vice

82
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:54,910
president.
Um,

83
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:59,980
the reason that this was launched was
because Pluto was the only one of the

84
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:04,981
planets that voyager didn't go to until
we have these fabulous pictures of,

85
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:07,450
you know,
Saturn and Uranus and Neptune.

86
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,630
We have no fabulous pictures of
Pluto because nothing had gone there.

87
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,760
And in the late 1990s, people
thought, well, this is dumb there.

88
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,960
What planet out there
that hasn't been explored,

89
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:20,470
we've got to have a mission to go to this
planet. So now it's seven years later,

90
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:24,610
the mission just went past a Jupiter
actually. So it's on its way out. Uh,

91
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:28,570
and all of a sudden the thing that
it's going to has been demoted. Uh,

92
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,600
this is awkward. Uh, you know,

93
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:36,601
we're spending $100 million of your money
to go see the last of the planet and

94
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,020
now it's not a planet anymore.

95
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,870
And here's the guy who's
in charge of that mission.

96
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,940
And so of course he objects to the change
in definition that demotes his object,

97
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:50,230
which you spending 15 years of his life
on $100 million of your money to study,

98
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,650
uh, has now been kicked out
of the realm of the planet.

99
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:57,010
So not surprising that he would
take that particular point of view.

100
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,960
Mike Brown's another example. That's
the guy who discovered Eris. Uh,

101
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,880
and he has an lovely thing on his
website about how planet ought to be a

102
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,260
cultural definition.

103
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,190
And he kind of advocates for
thing where because it's cultural,

104
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:13,880
you gotta keep Pluto in and because
you've got to keep Pluto in,

105
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,310
you've got to allow
anything bigger than Pluto.

106
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,200
So you just have an arbitrary culturally
enforced cutoff at the mass of Pluto.

107
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,251
Uh,
and then,

108
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:25,520
and things that are more massive get to
count also because otherwise it would be

109
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:27,620
unfair.
Look what this does though,

110
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,610
it meets Eris is a planet and
none of these other things are,

111
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:36,080
which means Mike Brown is one of the four
people in the history of humanity who

112
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:37,890
has discovered a planet.
Uh,

113
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:43,430
and so that's a very convenient
definition. Uh, and so, you know,

114
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,480
and then he actually very graciously goes
on to say, well, I'll settle for a B.

115
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:51,710
The being the discover of the largest
dwarf planet until a bigger one gets

116
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,640
discovered. Uh, but you can see
he's not really happy about it.

117
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,540
He'd much rather that thing be decal
be decreed the 10th planet and perhaps

118
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:00,374
reasonably so.

119
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,420
So the scientists are also affected
by these kinds of things in ways,

120
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:05,870
uh,

121
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,870
that you have to think a little bit
about before as you interpret what their

122
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:15,920
take on the scientific parts of
the controversy, uh, really are.

123
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:19,350
So let me summarize all of
this. This is going to be, I,

124
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,510
I mentioned in the first class that,
uh,

125
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,630
I was going to tell fables about science
with morals attached to them and that

126
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,590
you could then explore these further
in your optional paper if you choose to

127
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:33,110
write letters. So that here's a fable, uh,

128
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:37,640
which is the, uh, um,

129
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,800
the demotion of Pluto.

130
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,130
And one could ascribe a
variety of morals to this. But,

131
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,630
but let me write down one version
that happens to appeal to me,

132
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,040
which is,
uh,

133
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,160
just the fact that I think
science can be affected,

134
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,150
uh,

135
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:04,150
by culture and you need to keep
your eye on that kind of thing.

136
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:07,100
When you interpret things
that scientist say,

137
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,310
particularly if they're
saying it to journalists, uh,

138
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,300
they're often much more circumstance
backed into things that actually get

139
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:17,960
published in the journals. Um, okay. Uh,

140
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:23,230
there was one kind of argument that that
rubbed me the wrong way a little bit

141
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:25,940
when some of you said it, which was, uh,

142
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,960
people had a little bit of
a tendency to say, you know,

143
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,990
all this definition and classification
stuff that's the word trivial or silly is

144
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:41,540
sometimes use that kind of unimportant
and it detracts from the science.

145
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,760
And I have to say,
I don't agree with that.

146
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,480
I think it's important for the science
to get these classifications right

147
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,800
because otherwise you don't know how to
describe what you're looking at and you

148
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:56,340
don't know how to interpret it. Uh, oh, I
should mention a, something about grading,

149
00:08:56,341 --> 00:09:00,960
I guess. Uh, it was six points
on that problem. The way I
did it was I started out,

150
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:03,810
everybody sorta started out
with five of those six points,

151
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,070
and if you said things that were
incomplete or incoherent or,

152
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,440
or a dumb in some way,
you got points taken off,

153
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:14,770
but there was also an extra point you
could get for being especially coherent,

154
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,920
uh, or uh, or especially
original or interesting or
just generally waking me up.

155
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:22,100
If after I'd read 40 others of them,
uh,

156
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,700
I bring this up just to point out that
if you get five out of six on that

157
00:09:26,701 --> 00:09:29,310
particular problem, that doesn't
mean you've done anything wrong.

158
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,090
It wasn't that we started with a perfect
score of six and started subtracting

159
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:36,330
things off. It just
meant, uh, that, uh, uh,

160
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:41,220
I felt that there were others in the pile
who were somehow somehow more coherent.

161
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,020
We'll hand these things back at the end of
the, of the class, by the way, and I'll,

162
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:50,140
and I'll make some remarks about
grading of the overall problem set, uh,

163
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,790
at the end.
Okay.

164
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,460
Another general point that showed up,
uh,

165
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,550
in other parts of the
problem set was it was, uh,

166
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,560
a kind of issue about velocities
in the center of mass.

167
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,450
Um,
let me,

168
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:12,180
here's the center of mass of some orbit.
And of course,

169
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,500
that's not a physical object.
That's just a point in space. Uh,

170
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,800
and the key thing to understand about the,

171
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:23,610
the center of mass is the center of mass
doesn't move. It doesn't move in space.

172
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,390
That's, that's a fixed point in
space. So this doesn't move a,

173
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:33,120
actually I should be more precise.
Uh, it's, motion doesn't change.

174
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:36,990
So if it's stationary and some
coordinate system, it sits there.

175
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,880
If it's moving at some velocity,

176
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:43,440
it continues to move at precisely
that velocity so that it's,

177
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,290
and then you can redefine
the coordinate system. So it,

178
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,260
so it doesn't move in some other
coordinates system, but it doesn't,

179
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,760
it doesn't go around in circles, uh,
or ellipses or anything. What does,

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,780
uh, go around? Are the
things going around it?

181
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,340
One of which is, uh, the
planet, which is over here,

182
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,030
uh, the other of which is
the star, which is over here.

183
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,430
And the way these two things move,

184
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,620
they have to stay one on each side,
uh,

185
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,260
in a straight line that,
whoops,

186
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:20,520
I'm going to miss in a straight line
that goes through the center of mass.

187
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,100
And I drew that wrong.
So let me redraw it here.

188
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,550
There we go. Uh, yeah.
And so it balances, right?

189
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:34,080
That's what the center of mass is.
It's the balance point. And so, uh, uh,

190
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,310
the star has to stay exactly
opposite to the planet. Uh,

191
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:40,230
how big are each of these things?
Well,

192
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:42,490
that depends on the
ratio of the masses in,

193
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:46,690
in an equation we wrote down
before the consequences that, uh,

194
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,550
as these things go around, they stay on
opposite sides of the center of mass.

195
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:54,940
So the amount of time it takes the
to go around the center of mass,

196
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:59,320
that's the orbital period has to be the
same as the amount of time it takes the

197
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:02,770
star to go around the center of Matt.
Also the orbital period.

198
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,600
So the orbital period

199
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,313
p

200
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,560
are required to be the same because it
has to take them the same amount of time

201
00:12:14,231 --> 00:12:16,460
to go round this center of mass because,
uh,

202
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,160
because they have to stay on opposite
sides of it the whole time. Uh, the, uh,

203
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,881
p is,

204
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:26,881
so the orbital period p is the same
for the planet and for the star,

205
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:33,280
whereas the velocity
and the semi major axis,

206
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,630
uh,
are different.

207
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,530
Okay.

208
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:39,230
Because while it takes the same
amount of time to go round,

209
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:41,570
the star is going for much less distance.

210
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,500
So the distance is shorter and therefore
the velocity has to be less for the

211
00:12:45,501 --> 00:12:46,100
star.

212
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:51,100
So we can talk about the star Versus
v planet and a star versus a planet.

213
00:12:53,091 --> 00:12:57,430
And we can add these things up
to make v Total and a total. Uh,

214
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,040
but you don't do that with the
period. The period is the same. Um,

215
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:07,040
okay, so that's, that's an
important concept. Questions.

216
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:13,040
Let me point out that this concept of
the center center of mass gets more

217
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,940
complicated when there's more than
one planet. Uh, because again,

218
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,230
the center of mass is still a fixed point.
Even when you've got two planets.

219
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:24,610
And so, uh, uh, one of the things that,

220
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,620
so the star is going around the
center of mass because of this planet,

221
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,380
but it's taking other extra
little wiggles. Uh, as a result,

222
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,260
if there's a second planet
as a result of that planet,

223
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,700
center of mass has to stay
exactly in the same place. Uh,

224
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,850
and the consequence of this is that
the motion of one clinic is actually a

225
00:13:46,821 --> 00:13:49,580
little bit affected by the
gravity of the other planet.

226
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:53,870
So it too is executing extra
little wiggles due to, uh,

227
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,670
due to the presence of a second planet.

228
00:13:55,671 --> 00:14:00,350
Those wiggles are very small compared
to the motion that's induced by the sun

229
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:04,430
because the other planets,
much less massive. Uh, but
they, they really are there.

230
00:14:04,431 --> 00:14:04,911
And in fact,

231
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:09,570
the planet Neptune was discovered
because the orbit of Uranus,

232
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,060
uh, had extra wiggles in it that couldn't
be accounted for by the known planets.

233
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:16,010
And so in the,
in the 19th century,

234
00:14:16,011 --> 00:14:21,011
a couple of clever mathematicians figure
it out from the motion of Uranus where

235
00:14:21,531 --> 00:14:24,410
Neptune had to turn out to be a,

236
00:14:24,411 --> 00:14:27,230
in order to explain these extra,
uh,

237
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,610
extra an unexplained motions. And then
some astronomers look in there. It was,

238
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,460
it was a huge triumph for,
uh, a Newtonian physics and a,

239
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:41,090
and a damned hard math problem
to, uh, and so, uh, uh,

240
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,470
this, this concept becomes a little more
complicated in the case where there are,

241
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,040
uh, uh, more than one planet, but in fact,

242
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:53,150
the way we're going to deal with that
is just, uh, to separate it into,

243
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,660
into one planet at a time.
Let me give you an example of that.

244
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,410
Uh,
let's see.

245
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,060
I don't think we need to change
the lighting. Whoops. Backwards.

246
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,510
Here we go.
All right.

247
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,490
So this is a radial velocity
curve of some star and it,

248
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:14,570
uh,
uh,

249
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,600
you can see the point here
are the observed radial
velocities and a variety of

250
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:24,650
times over a course of a
three or four years. And, uh,

251
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,220
then they've drawn in a sine curve or
to actually not quite a sine curve.

252
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:31,970
It's close to a sine curve and you can
see that the sine curve more or less goes

253
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:35,810
through these points, which
is nice, uh, because uh,

254
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:40,410
that indicates the presence of a planet
and you have velocity over here. But, uh,

255
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:42,770
I should mention something about velocity.

256
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,320
What they'd mean is not actually velocity.

257
00:15:45,321 --> 00:15:49,610
What they mean here is radial velocity.
Uh, and this is an important point.

258
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:52,100
It's not that the speed changes.

259
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:57,370
What changes if between here and here
on this plot is not the speed of the

260
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,650
thing, but it's direction. Uh,

261
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,790
because at plus 200 wet meat,

262
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:06,770
it's going away from you at 200 mile,
uh,

263
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,170
meters per second at minus 200.

264
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,270
It means it's coming towards
you at 200 meters per second.

265
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,000
That's why you can have
a minus velocity at zero.

266
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,880
It does not mean that
the thing has stopped.

267
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,800
It's going at the same speed as it was
up here and the same speed as it goes

268
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:26,360
down here,
but in a different direction.

269
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,350
So it's going still at 200
plus meters per second,

270
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,700
only it's going sideways.

271
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,570
And so it's neither coming towards
you nor going away from you.

272
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,680
Therefore it's radial velocity is
zero and you measure no doppler shift.

273
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,281
Remember,

274
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:43,730
these plots are created by measuring
the doppler shift and the doppler shift

275
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:47,540
tells you how fast something is either
coming towards you or going away from you.

276
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,500
So that's an important point.
Uh,

277
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:54,550
you can have dramatic changes from
positive to negative in the radio velocity

278
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,650
without changing the speed
of the object at all.

279
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,190
All you have to do is change its
direction. So first it comes towards you,

280
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:04,790
then it goes sideways, then it goes away
from you Dennett come sideways again.

281
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,920
So that's what this plot represent
a. And you could see that, that,

282
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:12,230
that these points go up and down
as they should. If something is,

283
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,210
is in orbit around the center of mass,

284
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,250
and these little points down at the
bottom are represent the difference.

285
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:23,810
Actually they've put it down here.
This should be a zero on the scale.

286
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,840
This is the difference
between the observed points
and this sign your soil model

287
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:30,260
that they've put up there.

288
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,850
So they've just calculated the
differences and there's some scatter, uh,

289
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,010
but it basically follows a pretty well,

290
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:41,000
the scattered is a whole lot less
than the, uh, changes in the velocity.

291
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,940
Money.
Turns out you can do better than this.

292
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,280
Here's an example now what
the line is now is not one,

293
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:52,410
but two sign curves added together,

294
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,270
one of which was the one we saw before.
So they fit for two planets now.

295
00:17:57,271 --> 00:18:02,271
And the other is a another sign curve
with a different amplitude because that

296
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:05,310
planet induces a smaller,

297
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,790
a motion in the star and
also at different period.

298
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,790
And so at certain points,
uh,

299
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:15,420
the periods lineup and you
get big deviations, then it,

300
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:18,910
then at other points you get
wiggles on top of wiggles. Uh,

301
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,940
and these things kind of
beat against each other.

302
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:25,941
So this complicated pattern of this
line here is just to sign waves added

303
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:31,810
together and now the points
line up much better. Uh,

304
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,890
if you recall these deviations between
the points in the lines before,

305
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,760
uh, we're, uh, you know, of, uh, uh,

306
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,690
up to say 50 meters a second
and now they're much smaller,

307
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,370
the things fit much better.

308
00:18:47,371 --> 00:18:51,630
I'll show you a blow up now of
this region of the plot, uh,

309
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,460
where a lot of these points are and you'll
see what I mean. Here are the point.

310
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,520
Here is the line and you can see that
this complicated line a really fits these

311
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:06,780
points quite well. That's evidence that
there are two planets in this system.

312
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:11,670
Uh, but in fact it gets even better than
that because what they then did was they

313
00:19:11,671 --> 00:19:12,930
said, all right, here's
what we're going to do.

314
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:14,760
We're going to take these
so called residuals.

315
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:18,780
We're going to subtract off our two planet
model and we're going to see whether

316
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:23,700
we can see anything interesting going
on in what's left over after those two

317
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:28,620
planets have been taken away. And
when they did that, they saw this, uh,

318
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,540
this is, uh, they sort of
grouped them all together. Uh,

319
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,880
and they've found something with
a period of 1.9 days that now has,

320
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:38,730
uh,

321
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,730
what looks like a sinusoidal wiggle
and have about a few meters per second.

322
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,730
Uh, remember where we started. Uh, the
deviations were 200 meters a second,

323
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,330
but you're now subtract off this, uh, uh,

324
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,260
these two planets and you're
left with a third. And so this,

325
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,120
this system is now known.

326
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:03,720
This particular star that they were
observing us now known to have three

327
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:05,010
different planets around it,

328
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,150
of which this one is the one
that has the shortest orbit,

329
00:20:09,151 --> 00:20:11,910
1.9 1.9 days.

330
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,890
So there are now several examples of
things in which we know that there's

331
00:20:16,891 --> 00:20:19,620
actually more than one planet
and one of these systems.

332
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,570
And this is how we find that out.

333
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,040
That the motion of the star is
not just one s one sine curve,

334
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,480
but the superposition of two, or in
this case, even three of these things.

335
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,590
Now, one of the interesting things
about this is it's quite a short orbit.

336
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,290
1.9 days.
That's one of the shortest orbits known.

337
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,430
It also has a relatively low amplitude.
The velocity,

338
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:45,330
the radial velocity, uh,
changes are quite small.

339
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,450
So the induced speed in
the star is quite small.

340
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,370
Those two things put together,

341
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,020
give you a relatively low mass
of the planet for reasons I'll,

342
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,770
I'll make specific in just a second.

343
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,520
This is one of the lowest mass planets
that's been discovered in this way.

344
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,470
It's only about 10 times the Earth's mass.
Uh,

345
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,520
that's kind of comparable to a little,

346
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:09,880
a little less than Neptune and
Uranus. Uh, and so in this case,

347
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:13,810
it isn't actually clear whether you
should think about this thing as a kind of

348
00:21:13,811 --> 00:21:18,760
low mass outer planet or
a big earth like rock.

349
00:21:18,761 --> 00:21:22,120
And so that isn't clear in
this particular place. A case,

350
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:25,660
let me make this a little
more specific here.

351
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:32,550
What are the inputs that you need
to know to figure out how big,

352
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,850
how, what the amplitude of that sine
curve is? How big the wiggles are?

353
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,860
You need to know a couple of things.

354
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,150
You need to know the
velocity of the planet,

355
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,390
which isn't what you observe. Remember,
you're observing the velocity of the star,

356
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,740
so the velocity of the planet,

357
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:52,550
which is approximately equal to
the total velocity. And, uhW,

358
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,460
as one of the exercises,
uh, on your problem set, uh,

359
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,840
you can demonstrate that that is equal
to g m over a the square root of GM over

360
00:22:04,691 --> 00:22:06,490
egg.
So that means,

361
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:12,600
Yup. Oh yes. Good. Thank
you. How about that?

362
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,213
Yeah.

363
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,550
Uh, okay. So this means Short Orbitz,

364
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,970
uh, give you small, a large

365
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,810
philosophies of the planet.

366
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,970
This makes sense.
If you're in close to the star,

367
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,340
you have to move faster
to keep yourself in orbit.

368
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,960
But of course,
you don't observe the velocity the planet.

369
00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:41,750
You've observed the velocity
of the star velocity.

370
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,100
This star is equal to the
velocity of the planet times, uh,

371
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,970
the mass of the planet over
the mass of the star. And so,

372
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:51,403
uh,

373
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:53,523
yeah,

374
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,550
large

375
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,350
planet masses

376
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,140
generate a large star velocities.

377
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,410
So the two things you need to know is,
uh,

378
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,430
how short is the orbit and
how massive is the planet.

379
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,640
And so if you have a short orbit,

380
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,310
uh,
that'll give you high v planet.

381
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,500
And if you observe, so you observe
the short orbit. And the other thing,

382
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:29,200
if the other thing you observe is a low,

383
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,690
relatively speaking fee star,

384
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:36,070
then it must be true

385
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,270
that you have a low planet mass

386
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,640
because, uh, if this is
big and this is small,

387
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,670
you've got to compensate for it
by having a small value out here.

388
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,070
And we'll come back to this, uh,
kind of reasoning in a minute.

389
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,050
Does that make sense?
So in fact,

390
00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:01,490
that particular planet with
it's very short orbital period,

391
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:06,380
but it's low velocity induced
velocity, uh, in the star.

392
00:24:06,381 --> 00:24:10,860
So, so short periods, Short,
semi major access, uh,

393
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,740
but also small v Starr, uh,
is the lowest mass planet,

394
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:19,280
I think at this point, uh, that has
been observed by this particular method.

395
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,623
Okay.

396
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:28,270
But as it turns out, most of the
ones, the short or the short period,

397
00:24:28,271 --> 00:24:32,050
planets that have been
observed, uh, are, uh,

398
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,160
are more massive than that. Uh,
and we had got these hot Jupiters.

399
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:41,050
And so the argument here using this
same kind of reasoning is that you have

400
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,270
short period,

401
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,240
a moderate values,

402
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,700
moderate to high values as
these things go for a v Star.

403
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,520
And that tells you it's a massive

404
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,910
planet. And as I pointed
out last time, uh,

405
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,890
this is deeply disturbing,
uh,

406
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:07,450
in terms of what we know or what
we think we know about planetary,

407
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:11,680
uh, about planetary
formation. So a short period,

408
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,040
yeah.

409
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,210
Uh, plus massive is, uh,

410
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:18,910
to put it mildly unexpected,

411
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,910
so unexpected that they almost
weren't discovered at all. Uh,

412
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,160
what happened is this,

413
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:32,370
the discovery of 50 the planet
around 51 Pegasus happened in 1995.

414
00:25:32,371 --> 00:25:36,630
And the way this worked out was, uh,
that was a team of astronomers, a Geoff,

415
00:25:36,631 --> 00:25:37,980
Marcy and Paul Butler,

416
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:42,210
chief among them in California who had
the best equipment for doing these kinds

417
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:45,420
of, of very high precision
radial velocity measurements.

418
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:49,620
And they had embarked on a campaign
to find Jupiter like planets,

419
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:53,130
which they thought they could do.
And they were piling update on many stars.

420
00:25:53,131 --> 00:25:57,810
They were looking at many sunlight
stars. And then one day, uh, in 1995,

421
00:25:57,811 --> 00:25:59,450
they woke up and,
uh,

422
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:03,780
a bunch of people in Switzerland announced
the discovery of the first planet, uh,

423
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,840
which disturbed the mightily
because they had been scooped.

424
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,950
And it disturbed them even more when
they discovered that the particular star

425
00:26:10,951 --> 00:26:14,580
that this planet was around
this 51 Pegasus thing that
I was talking about last

426
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:18,600
time was one of the stars that they
themselves had been observing. Uh,

427
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:22,290
but the thing was the period
you remember was four days.

428
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,290
And when Marcy and Butler and Co,

429
00:26:25,291 --> 00:26:28,410
we're expecting the periods
to turn out to be 10 years.

430
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,610
So they hadn't checked to see whether
there were four day variations.

431
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,580
And as soon as this paper by
these other other astronomers,

432
00:26:35,581 --> 00:26:39,060
these Swiss astronomers who discovered
the thing was published, they said, damn,

433
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,870
we've got a big pile of data on
this particular object in our desk.

434
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,930
We ought to take a look and see
whether these got other guys are ripe.

435
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:50,700
So they looked at it and you know, within
a week of a re analyzing their data,

436
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,790
they were able to confirm the fact,
uh,

437
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,350
that this really was a planet
in a four day or pit. Uh,

438
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,070
and annoyingly to them,

439
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:03,840
they already had the data that they
could have announced it first if they'd

440
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:05,730
looked at it and ask the question,

441
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:09,970
does this thing actually
have a four day orbit? Uh,

442
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,330
but it didn't occur to them
because it's well known.

443
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:16,730
You can't have a Jupiter in
a four day orbit. Uh, so they
kind of didn't check. Uh,

444
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:21,210
so here's another fable for you. Uh, uh,

445
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,740
the discovery, uh, of 51,

446
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:29,640
peg B, that's how you
label these planets. Uh,

447
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:34,800
a is the Star B is the
planet. Uh, and the moral, uh,

448
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,160
I guess you could say this in a
couple of ways. One would be to say,

449
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:39,780
expect the unexpected.

450
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:42,363
Uh,

451
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,390
and the other would just be to say,
look at your data,

452
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,640
but look at your data,
uh,

453
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,980
so that you could see things that aren't
the thing that you expect to see in

454
00:27:55,981 --> 00:28:00,150
your data. And that's kind
of an important, uh, an
important lesson, I think.

455
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,750
Uh, anyway, uh,

456
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:08,700
it turned out it was relatively
easy to find these hot Jupiters. Uh,

457
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,620
and within a few years they,
uh,

458
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,880
Marcy and Butler and the Soy sun and
some other teams as well had found

459
00:28:14,881 --> 00:28:18,330
literally dozens of these things.
So within a few years,

460
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,350
uh,
there were dozens of hot Jupiters known

461
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,610
around many stars.

462
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,300
And so

463
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:39,670
they hadn't yet of course filed anything
like our own solar system because they

464
00:28:39,671 --> 00:28:43,400
hadn't been looking for 10 years yet.
The orbit of Jupiter you will remember,

465
00:28:43,401 --> 00:28:47,980
is 10 years long. Uh, so they found
all these hot Jupiters and uh,

466
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:53,070
this might have suggested that
ordinary solar systems are rare.

467
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,510
Solar systems,
like our own

468
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,480
planetary systems
are rare.

469
00:29:01,481 --> 00:29:04,630
But I'll put a question mark after that
because it isn't really at all clear

470
00:29:04,631 --> 00:29:06,010
that that's true.
Uh,

471
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:11,140
and the reason is that hot Jupiters
are easier to find than ordinary solar

472
00:29:12,611 --> 00:29:13,444
systems

473
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:21,300
for exactly the reasons that I wrote
down just just a minute ago. Uh,

474
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,170
and the fact that they have short periods

475
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,040
and massive planets

476
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:36,310
generate larger values of the star,

477
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:41,150
both of those factors make for large
values of the thing that you're actually

478
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,720
trying to observe,
which is the velocity of the star.

479
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,870
So of course if you go out and you have
some new technology and you're trying to

480
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:47,770
observe something,

481
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:52,980
the first ones you'll observe are the
ones that have the largest signal that,

482
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,720
uh, uh, of the kind
you're trying to observe.

483
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:59,020
So if you're observing radial velocities,
you're trying to measure v Star,

484
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,700
the first ones that are going to pop out
at you or the ones with large values of

485
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:06,050
that. It's also true, uh,

486
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:09,400
that it's easier to observe
these shorter periods.

487
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,240
If you've got a four day period and
you observe the thing for a month,

488
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:23,800
you've watched it go back and forth,
uh, you know, eight times or something.

489
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,570
If you want to wait for eight orbital
periods of Jupiter, that 80 years,

490
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,120
uh,
and it's just going to take you longer.

491
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:35,590
There's a general rule in science that
no project can take longer than it takes

492
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,160
one graduate student to get a Phd.
Uh,

493
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,020
because of course there's the graduate
students who do all the work and it's

494
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:44,980
just hard to recruit a graduate student
to work on a project that won't be

495
00:30:44,981 --> 00:30:49,840
completed until they're
70. Uh, and um, uh,

496
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:54,640
so the, these shorter periods
are easier to observe, uh,

497
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,110
just because they're short.

498
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:00,280
In addition to the fact that the thing
you were observing a is much easier to

499
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:03,490
see.
This is called a selection effect.

500
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:12,260
So you're just more likely to see certain
kinds of objects than others for the

501
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:15,820
or for the straightforward reasons
that they're easier to see. Uh,

502
00:31:15,821 --> 00:31:17,860
and those will be the ones you find first.

503
00:31:17,861 --> 00:31:21,250
And if you don't take this into account
and thinking about the statistics of

504
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,510
these things,
you're going to screw up.

505
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,850
Because of course you see the
easy ones first. Of course,

506
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:29,830
you see lots of them before you see
the others. Uh, nevertheless, uh,

507
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:34,360
the existence of even one hot Jupiter,
uh,

508
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:38,800
was a crisis for planetary formation
theories because there's no way any such

509
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:42,610
thing ought to exist. So, but, uh,

510
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,850
even one hot Jupiter,

511
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,780
uh, messes up our theory. So
I'll just write that down.

512
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,890
NASA's up theory
aunt.

513
00:31:55,891 --> 00:32:00,660
So as soon as even the first of
these was, uh, was discovered, uh,

514
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,980
people, uh, started to think about
what the alternatives might be.

515
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,233
Uh,

516
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,360
and there are two kinds of alternatives
that think ways to explain the data

517
00:32:11,551 --> 00:32:16,050
without having a hot Jupiter.
So alternative number one,

518
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,610
uh, was that, uh,

519
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,930
a cell called low inclination double star.

520
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,810
So I'll explain that in a second.
The second object,

521
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:35,670
and this is supposed to be a star,
not a planet,

522
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,210
and there are known a double
stars with short periods.

523
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,910
They're formed in a very different way.

524
00:32:40,911 --> 00:32:44,960
Double Stars don't form the second star
doesn't necessarily form out of a disc

525
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:46,430
around the first storage form.

526
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,020
I Dunno by splitting the star in half
at some early part of it, uh, uh,

527
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,670
of its evolution until you get a very
different expectation for what kinds of

528
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:58,030
periods you have in there.
Many stars,

529
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,340
double stars known with short
periods of this kind. But, uh,

530
00:33:01,341 --> 00:33:05,000
so then how do you explain,
uh, if it was a double star,

531
00:33:05,001 --> 00:33:07,640
you would expect that the
induced velocity would be much,

532
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:10,250
much bigger because the
is much more massive.

533
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,780
And so what you do is you explain it
by saying, well, here is your, uh, uh,

534
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,220
here as you were observing it and the
orbit of the orbital plane is like this.

535
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:24,020
It goes up and down. So the stars
are orbiting each other this way.

536
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:28,640
So they neither come towards you
very much, nor go away from you. Uh,

537
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:32,660
and, uh, therefore the, uh, radio,

538
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,630
the velocity is high,
but the radio velocity,

539
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:39,140
which is the thing you observe is low.
So,

540
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,933
so

541
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,470
high velocity,

542
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,590
but low radio velocity,

543
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:56,500
uh,

544
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,260
because the system was
going sideways or buts are,

545
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:04,540
uh,
the technical term here is face on,

546
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,100
not edge on.

547
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,180
Okay.
Uh,

548
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:19,610
so that was one hypothesis. Uh, this
didn't work out for two reasons.

549
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,020
Problem number one,

550
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,910
no evidence

551
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,910
for light from more than one star.

552
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,043
Okay?

553
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,460
Stars are much brighter
than planets, right? So, uh,

554
00:34:38,461 --> 00:34:41,190
if you're looking at a star planet system,

555
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,240
all you expect to see is the light from
one star. And that's what is observed.

556
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,890
If you've got a second star
in that system, the second
star shines like a star.

557
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:54,000
And so you would expect to
see some evidence of light
from a second star in that

558
00:34:54,001 --> 00:34:56,730
system. And, and none of
those was observed. Uh,

559
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:00,120
the other problem is a kind
of statistical one. Uh,

560
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:04,260
there are many hot Jupiters.
Now,

561
00:35:04,261 --> 00:35:07,740
if you're going to explain
all these things by, uh,

562
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,860
having face on orbits with respect to us,

563
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,810
imagine what some observer somewhere
else in the galaxy with all these things.

564
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:19,620
Here's us in the middle of, of, of
our galaxy or somewhere in our galaxy.

565
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:24,750
And all of these objects happened to
be lined up exactly face on toward us.

566
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,290
Uh, some other astronomer
somewhere else, uh,

567
00:35:28,291 --> 00:35:31,320
would have to see them edge
on and so forth. So why is it,

568
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:36,200
what cosmic conspiracy has caused
all these things to be lined up, uh,

569
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:41,310
uh, face on toward us. It's as if
someone had carefully set up all these,

570
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:45,240
uh, all these double star systems to
fool us into thinking that hot Jupiters

571
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:48,520
existed. Uh, this is the
kind of argument, uh,

572
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:53,540
that people tend to reject because it
requires that we are in a very special

573
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:57,880
place or that some very special
coincidence has taken place. Uh,

574
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:01,530
and that isn't, uh, and as you keep
finding more and more of these things,

575
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:06,420
you wonder, well, how come
aren't some of them lined up,
uh, uh, edge on and in fact,

576
00:36:06,421 --> 00:36:08,430
it has to be very close to face on.

577
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:11,340
And so the odds that all
of these things have, uh,

578
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,810
our face on to within plus
or minus one degree, uh,

579
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,350
starts to become really small. Uh, as you
pile up more and more of these objects,

580
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:24,090
many hot Jupiters,
they can't all be face on.

581
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,100
And so as more and more of
these things were discovered,

582
00:36:28,101 --> 00:36:32,510
you could explain any one or perhaps
two of them is being faced on stars,

583
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:35,540
a star systems. But, uh,

584
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,750
it starts to get more and more difficult
to believe that all of them are in that

585
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:42,840
category. Okay. Uh,

586
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:48,330
let me see. What do I want to do
here? Okay. Alternative number two.

587
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,833
Okay.

588
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,530
Uh,
is pulsating stars.

589
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,350
Now this is interesting.

590
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,100
Some pop stars do pulsate the
Sun pulsates just a little bit,

591
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:04,960
not enough so that you
could see it in this way.

592
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,220
But there are other stars known that
pulsate by large amounts, they go out,

593
00:37:09,221 --> 00:37:12,850
they go in. Think about what happens
if you observe a pulsating star.

594
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,110
Here it is when it's small,
but getting bigger. Uh,

595
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:19,870
so all of the star is expanding,

596
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,850
but if you look at that star,

597
00:37:22,851 --> 00:37:26,740
you only see the half of the star
that's on your side of the star.

598
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:32,190
So you only see this part over here
and all of the surface of that star is

599
00:37:35,651 --> 00:37:39,250
coming towards you, right?
Cause this part, it's expanding.

600
00:37:39,251 --> 00:37:42,310
So this part's coming towards you.
This part's going half sideways,

601
00:37:42,311 --> 00:37:45,330
half towards you. This part's
going half side. You and have, uh,

602
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:49,150
have sideways half towards you. So if
you add up the light from all of this,

603
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,810
it has a net bulk motion
coming towards you. Now,

604
00:37:52,811 --> 00:37:57,430
supposing you look at it when it's at a
different part of it's a pulsation cycle.

605
00:37:57,431 --> 00:38:00,850
So now it's big, but
going, uh, but falling in

606
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,490
now you'll see the opposite.

607
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:09,830
All of the parts of this star
are moving away from you.

608
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:14,410
Some are moving sort of sideways, but
others are moving away from you. Uh,

609
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:18,860
and so you expect that if
you observe a pulsating star,

610
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:24,100
you'll see first positive radio velocity,

611
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:28,190
van,
negative radio velocity.

612
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,780
Then as it pulses back out again,
positive radial velocity.

613
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:37,660
And that starts to sound very familiar,
right? That's pretty much what we observe.

614
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:42,550
It goes up, it goes down. Uh,
and so the suggestion was that,

615
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:47,410
uh, uh, these things might actually be
some kind of pulsating star. Uh, okay.

616
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:51,940
So problems with the
pulsating star explanation.

617
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:59,200
Uh, basically, uh, solar
type stars, which these were,

618
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:05,770
stars are suppose to pulsate like this,

619
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:10,480
to have art supposed to
have large pulsations.

620
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:20,020
Uh, and, uh, it's also
true that pulsations

621
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,840
in general don't lead to

622
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:33,540
sinusoidal variations in radio.

623
00:39:33,741 --> 00:39:37,280
Velocity in orbit naturally
gives rise to a sine wave.

624
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:40,430
If the orbits close to
circular, uh, pulsations,

625
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,010
there's no particular
reason to have that pattern.

626
00:39:43,011 --> 00:39:46,790
You could have sudden rises and then
gradual decays and then things of that

627
00:39:46,791 --> 00:39:50,810
nature. You don't expect it to be signed
your soil. Uh, but both of these things,

628
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:51,530
you know,

629
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:55,430
what's weird is that there are a lot of
hot Jupiters in the world or that you

630
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:59,060
have some kind of pulsation mechanism,
but you haven't experienced before.

631
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,540
Both of them are sort of equally,
uh,

632
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:05,180
in violation of current
theory. And so, uh,

633
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,380
you might as well assume that you have
weird pulsations as well as having weird

634
00:40:09,381 --> 00:40:11,300
planets. Uh, however,

635
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:15,080
it turns out that the pulsation
theory makes a testable prediction.

636
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,840
And to explain this prediction,

637
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:28,100
I have to take a little digression and
talk a little bit about how doppler

638
00:40:28,101 --> 00:40:30,960
shifts are actually measured.
Uh,

639
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:33,860
so measuring

640
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,480
doppler shifts,
uh,

641
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:46,630
what you do is you look at,
uh, what's called a spectrum.

642
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:52,060
Those of you who, uh, Spec, no,
Gosh, I've spelled that wrong.

643
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,310
Uh,
spectrum

644
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,240
spectrum is just a plot of intensity,

645
00:40:59,241 --> 00:41:02,390
how much light there is
a against wavelength.

646
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,570
And if you a workout,
if you met her,

647
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:17,950
the spectrum of any particular
astronomical object, uh, you'll see,

648
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,263
uh,

649
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:24,820
that at certain wave lengths there is
much less intensity or much more intensity

650
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,840
than at many other wavelengths.

651
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:32,200
So you'll get a plot that
looks kind of like this.

652
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:37,201
There'll be specific wave lanes that
have abnormally large or abnormally small

653
00:41:39,651 --> 00:41:41,610
amounts of light coming from them.
Uh,

654
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:46,130
these are referred to as spectral
features or sometimes lines. Uh,

655
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:49,640
and when you have too little,
these are called absorption lines.

656
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:57,130
These are called emission lines because
you have extra emission or absorption of

657
00:41:57,621 --> 00:42:01,580
radiation at those particular wavelengths.
Uh,

658
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:05,090
there's a good explanation of why
this happens from atomic physics.

659
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:09,860
I won't go into detail, uh,
but let me just say that. Uh,

660
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:14,540
so there are specific wave lengths

661
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,540
with,
uh,

662
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,510
uh,
much less or much more emission

663
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:27,210
or more mission.

664
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:34,100
And each one of those wavelengths
is caused by a atomic transitions,

665
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:39,410
which emit more or absorb a
particular wavelengths of life light.

666
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:44,050
So caused by a atomic,
uh,

667
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:48,300
transitions.
I won't explain what those are in,

668
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,580
in detail, uh, but,

669
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,640
but each comes from a specific,

670
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,770
uh, chemical element. So hydrogen has pit,

671
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:04,910
particular hydrogen has particular
wavelengths associated with it.

672
00:43:05,371 --> 00:43:08,550
Helium has particular wavelengths
associated with it, uh,

673
00:43:08,551 --> 00:43:12,750
and so on and so on and
so forth. Uh, and uh, you,

674
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,930
and this by the way,
is how you can determine what,

675
00:43:15,931 --> 00:43:20,931
what stars are made out of
determine a composition of stars.

676
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,020
But for the present purpose,

677
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:30,910
the point is that you can go in with a
bunch of hydrogen in the laboratory and

678
00:43:30,911 --> 00:43:35,710
measure what the wavelengths
of the spectral features are.

679
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,370
If nothing is moving, uh, so can measure

680
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:42,383
these

681
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:48,660
wavelengths at rest in a lab.

682
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,190
And so, you know, when you advance what
the rest wavelengths of these things are,

683
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,760
you go out and measure them in stars
and it turns out they're not quite where

684
00:43:56,761 --> 00:44:00,870
they're supposed to be. And that's
how you determine what the, uh,

685
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:05,790
what the doppler shift of any particular
object is by comparing these spectral

686
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:09,170
features to where they are in the lab.
Uh,

687
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:16,170
now here's a, so, uh, if we
go back to talking about, uh,

688
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:19,080
pulsations.
So here is,

689
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,300
this is kind of a blow up

690
00:44:22,850 --> 00:44:23,683
of

691
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,990
and absorption line in this case.

692
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:26,973
Yeah.

693
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:30,760
So here's the intensity

694
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:37,690
and here's wavelength.
And it looked something like this are,

695
00:44:37,691 --> 00:44:41,740
so there's particular set
of wavelengths that are, uh,

696
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,680
uh, that are absorbed. Now,
if the whole star moves,

697
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:50,340
if the star is moving because
there's a planet around it, uh,

698
00:44:50,341 --> 00:44:53,040
what happens when it gets red shifted?
Well,

699
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:57,180
this whole thing moves to the right to
longer wavelengths and you get something

700
00:44:57,181 --> 00:44:59,090
that looks, you know, sorta like,

701
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,013
yes.

702
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:08,830
So this is a whole star moves away from
you until the whole thing shifts back

703
00:45:13,371 --> 00:45:16,580
and forth.
But pulsations are a little bit different

704
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,750
when the,
when you get a red shift due to pulsation,

705
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:26,150
it's because you know,

706
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:31,300
you're looking at something that does
this part of the star moves away from you,

707
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:38,930
but part of the star move sideways.

708
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:42,220
Yeah.

709
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:46,870
And so only part of, uh,
the mission is red shifted,

710
00:45:46,871 --> 00:45:50,230
but other parts of the emission are not.
Uh,

711
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:53,980
and so what you do is,
uh, uh, you sort of,

712
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:57,160
it's not like the whole
thing moves sideways.

713
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:00,550
It's that it sorta gets smushed
out because part of the SA, uh,

714
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:04,710
part of the star moves sideways, but
as part of the part of the re, uh,

715
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,370
absorbed from line moves sideways,

716
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:09,970
but part of the absorption line doesn't
move because it's coming. You know,

717
00:46:09,971 --> 00:46:12,790
it's like coming from this part of the
star, which is going sideways to you.

718
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:17,410
And so what you do is you get
something that looks more like this.

719
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:22,540
So this is part of the star moves away.

720
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:30,630
So the center of a of this line has moved.

721
00:46:30,631 --> 00:46:33,490
Here's the center here.
It's gotten even, uh,

722
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:37,890
even more red shifted then in the case
I drew there. Uh, but part of it has,

723
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,820
has been left behind.
And so the prediction,

724
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:46,870
okay,

725
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:50,410
is that for, uh, pulsations,

726
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,000
the shape of the,
uh,

727
00:46:56,001 --> 00:47:00,230
of these spectral features changes,
shape of lines

728
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:02,983
change,

729
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:07,570
whereas for orbital motion,

730
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,860
only the position

731
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:16,340
of the lines change.

732
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:20,890
So this can be observed.

733
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:24,820
You can go out and observe and you can
see whether the shape of the lunch change

734
00:47:24,821 --> 00:47:29,470
or not. And they did that,
uh, and it not pulsation,

735
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:35,700
uh,
but is consistent with orbits.

736
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,740
I think this is kind of a cool
experiment because you know,

737
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:46,600
this looks a lot like science,
right? There's two hypotheses,

738
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,950
each of which makes a different
prediction. Prediction
what hypothesis? One,

739
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:54,670
it's got to change its shape hypothesis
too. It does not change its shape.

740
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:58,390
You go out, you measure the thing and
you find out which hypothesis is right.

741
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,450
This is just what they told you
in eighth grade. And therefore,

742
00:48:01,451 --> 00:48:05,230
just what I told you a couple of days
ago never happens in astronomy. Uh,

743
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:09,640
but sometimes it does. Uh, and
so this is yet another fable,

744
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,270
uh, the disproof, uh,

745
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:18,900
of pulsation as explanation

746
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:23,670
for the velocity curves.

747
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:30,880
And the moral here is sometimes
science works like science.

748
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:40,720
So there were for several years,

749
00:48:40,721 --> 00:48:45,721
all of these attempts to try
and explain he hot Jupiter,

750
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:51,001
the radio velocity curves without actually
having to bite the bullet and believe

751
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:55,790
that hot Jupiters exist. None of them
were very convincing. Uh, this, uh,

752
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:58,300
double star hypothesis
didn't seem to work out.

753
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:02,830
The pulsation hypothesis didn't seem
to work out, but nevertheless, people,

754
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:03,490
uh,

755
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:07,600
kept trying to come up with alternative
explanations until something happened.

756
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:11,440
Uh, they're pretty much
nailed down. Uh, the, uh,

757
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:16,180
the idea that these things really
honest to goodness are, uh, planets. Uh,

758
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:17,860
but I don't have time to
tell you about that now,

759
00:49:17,861 --> 00:49:19,990
so we'll talk about it on Thursday.
Okay.
