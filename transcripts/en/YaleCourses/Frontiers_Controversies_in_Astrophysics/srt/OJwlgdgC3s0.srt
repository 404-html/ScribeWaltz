1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,500
I've been talking about a general
relativity and it particular the post

2
00:00:06,261 --> 00:00:10,940
Newtonian relativistic effects. These
are the first things that happen, uh,

3
00:00:10,941 --> 00:00:15,140
as the gravitational field become
strong enough that, uh, uh,

4
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:18,440
Newton doesn't perfect.
Newton's laws don't perfectly apply.

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,890
And let me just summarize those,
uh,

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,010
because we're going to see them all
in action, uh, in just a minute.

7
00:00:25,011 --> 00:00:27,380
So here are the post Newtonian effect

8
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:33,400
of general relativity.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:34,650
Okay.

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:34,921
Uh,

11
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:39,921
and the first of them is the precession
of the Para helion just going to list

12
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:41,904
these.

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,800
And this was seen and,
uh,

14
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,520
in the 19th century already.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,740
Yeah.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:54,200
Uh, and, uh, correctly
interpreted by Einstein. Okay.

17
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:58,610
Had to do with Mercury's orbit. I
should say this word Para helion. Uh,

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,750
that means closest approach to the sun.
Uh,

19
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,430
and so that only applies for planets.
If you have the same,

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,360
you can have the same kind of effect
in binary stars are and other things,

21
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,240
in which case, uh, you might, uh,

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,820
they call it a Perry Asteron.

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,910
That's the closest approach to
a star that isn't the sun. Uh,

24
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,420
or, uh, here's a favorite word
of mine. Peric the lack TACAN.

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,320
I liked that one. That's the
closest approach to a galaxy. Uh,

26
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,960
you can have the, the other
side of the orbit, uh,

27
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,010
that is on 180 degrees away from the
Para Galactica and that's called the

28
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,480
[inaudible] con.
Uh,

29
00:01:42,481 --> 00:01:47,481
and you are challenged to use that in a
sentence at any time over break anyone

30
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:49,940
who successfully does that, uh, uh,

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,590
send me an email recounting
the circumstances.

32
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:57,270
I'll give you an extra point or
something. Uh, all right. Uh, so,

33
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,390
uh, procession of the pair
of helium, that's, that's one
post Newtonian effect. Uh,

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,060
another post Newtonian effect
is the deflection of light

35
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,770
by mass just because
mass curved space time.

36
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:15,220
And so a light will follow
a curve pass. Also, uh,

37
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:20,200
this was first demonstrated in 1919
by the famous eclipse observations of

38
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:21,034
Edington.

39
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,923
Yeah.

40
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,630
And it also, uh, is,

41
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,900
has been manifested recently
in the discovery of so
called gravitational lenses

42
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,350
of various kinds

43
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,950
in which the,
uh,

44
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,910
appearance of an object is distorted by
the fact that the light from that object

45
00:02:45,911 --> 00:02:50,770
has to pass by some other
mass on its way to your eye.

46
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,750
And so I have a couple examples here,

47
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,990
which I'd like to show you
of gravitational lenses.

48
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,423
Okay.

49
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,430
Uh, this is the famous
Einstein Cross, so called a,

50
00:03:07,431 --> 00:03:11,380
and what this is, this is just
a, this is just a picture, uh,

51
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,220
I think from the Hubble Space Telescope.
And these four objects here,

52
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,590
uh, are the same object. That's
a quasar. Uh, it's just, uh,

53
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,980
for this purpose of point of light in
the sky, uh, but it's located, it's true.

54
00:03:24,981 --> 00:03:27,260
Location is behind this thing.

55
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,300
This is much closer to you than any
of these guys. This is a galaxy, uh,

56
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:35,450
about, uh, partway
between us and the Quasar.

57
00:03:35,451 --> 00:03:38,450
And what has happened is if there
were no deflection of light,

58
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,500
you'd see this quasar kind of
right behind the galaxy. Uh,

59
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:45,080
and in fact it would be hard
to distinguish between the two.

60
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,620
But what has happened is because
there's this galaxy in the way,

61
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:53,390
the light from the quasar starts coming
this way and then bends around the

62
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:55,460
galaxy and comes back toward us.

63
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:58,700
And the same is true up here
and down here and down here.

64
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,910
And so you get four different images
of this quasar of the same quasar.

65
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,010
And they know it's the same points are
because they've taken spectrum the thing,

66
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:10,370
and it's the exact same spectrum
on all four of these things.

67
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:15,350
And so these are just four
different images of the
same, uh, of the same object.

68
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:20,150
And the reason they're not symmetrically
distributed here is because the mass in

69
00:04:20,151 --> 00:04:22,550
this galaxy is not
symmetrically distributed.

70
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,560
And so depending on what path you take,
you get different amounts of deflection.

71
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:31,490
So that's a classic example
of a Gravitational Lens. Yes,

72
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,740
in principle,
you could see it right through here.

73
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:41,390
But there are two things about the
path that comes right at us. Uh,

74
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:46,280
there are two problems with that. One
is, uh, that, uh, for various reason,

75
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:47,990
these guys are all magnified.

76
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,680
And the one that comes through the
middle is d magnified. Second of all,

77
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:53,930
it's right in back of the galaxy.
Uh,

78
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,050
but in principle there's a fifth
one down in the middle. That's true.

79
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:02,420
Yes.
Sorry.

80
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,230
Okay. So let me, let me pause here
and tell you what a quasar is.

81
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,310
A quasar is a quasi stellar object.
What it is,

82
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:17,510
is it's a very bright source
right in the middle of a galaxy.

83
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,820
And so it's actually a point source
of light. It looks like a star.

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,700
Uh, these things turn out
to be what they really are.

85
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:29,830
It turns out our massive black holes in
the center of galaxies are creating, uh,

86
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:33,620
creating material from the, from
the galaxy itself. And so they,

87
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:37,670
but they appear to be very
bright nuclei of galaxies.

88
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:41,810
And if you could look really hard,
you could see the galaxy,

89
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:44,810
the background galaxy around this thing.
But in this particular case,

90
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:47,600
it's way too faint to see, uh, the galaxy.

91
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,870
It has a much larger extent,
uh,

92
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,290
because it's all the stars and all the
stuff in the galaxies is not coming right

93
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:58,760
from the middle, uh, and uh,
this much closer than those.

94
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:02,090
And so you can actually see that
it's extended in this case. Yes.

95
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,630
Oh, it's not the black hole
that submitting the light.

96
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,930
It's the material falling into the
black hole that gets heated up.

97
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:14,030
I'll actually talk about this
on Thursday a little bit.

98
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:18,470
Other questions about
the Einstein Cross here.

99
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,450
Let me show you another one.

100
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,580
So this is a Hubble space telescope.
Picture of a cluster of galaxies.

101
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,310
See all these different things,
all these extended sources.

102
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:36,140
Those are all individual
galaxies, galaxies. It turned
out come in clusters. Uh,

103
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:41,141
and so here's a big bunch of galaxies
and some of the galaxies you see here.

104
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:44,750
Most of the galaxies, all these
big ones are part of this cluster.

105
00:06:44,751 --> 00:06:48,020
This is a cluster that's
relatively nearby to earth,

106
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,130
but some of the galaxies are actually
not in the cluster. They're much,

107
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:56,450
much further away. They're in back
of the cluster and these things,

108
00:06:56,451 --> 00:07:00,490
these sort of streaky things you
see all over the place here. Uh,

109
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,870
what these are are galaxies.

110
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:07,871
There are in back of the
cluster of galaxies whose
light has been lensed when it

111
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:13,220
passes through the cluster of
galaxies and it's been stretched.

112
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,210
It's because what happened is
this thing here, for example, uh,

113
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,710
ought to be a tiny little galaxy that
you can barely see here except the light

114
00:07:21,711 --> 00:07:25,790
from the top end of the,
of that galaxy got bent up to here.

115
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:29,930
And the light from the bottom end of
that galaxy got bent down to here. Uh,

116
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:33,620
and so all, and that's why they're
all sort of in this kind of search.

117
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,280
All these things are kind of circular
around the center of this thing because

118
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:41,420
this is a very, very massive galaxy. And
that's the thing that's doing Melendez.

119
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,370
And so it effectively distort the
shape of the background galaxy.

120
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,570
And you could see a couple more of them
around this massive galaxy here. Um,

121
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,900
these, uh, are pretty,

122
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,930
but they also can be used
in order to understand, uh,

123
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,130
the distribution of mass inside the galaxy
cluster because the particular way in

124
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,740
which these galaxies are
distorted depends on how,

125
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,770
how much mass there is in this galaxy
cluster and how that mass is distributed.

126
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,110
And so these are used to study the
masses of and mass distributions of,

127
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,310
uh, of galaxy clusters. And so this is a
different kind of gravitational lensing.

128
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:29,000
Uh, and finally, let me show
you a joke. Um, this is,

129
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,050
uh,

130
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,700
a picture of the Smithsonian
Institute in Washington DC.

131
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,070
Uh,
where there are a group of whether the,

132
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,070
actually the Smithsonian astrophysical
observatory is actually in Cambridge,

133
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:41,600
Massachusetts.
And there,

134
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:45,920
there are a group of people who study
gravitational lensing and they have taken

135
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:49,940
this picture and imagined what it would
look like if about halfway between where

136
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:53,960
you're looking at this building. There
were a black hole, the mass of Saturn,

137
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,550
uh,
and here's what it looks like.

138
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,070
A and all these distortions
are simply due to the, uh,

139
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:07,310
change in direction caused
by the gravitational force
of this imaginary black

140
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:10,590
hole. Until you can see what happens. Uh,

141
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,890
the black hole is sort of
right down the middle here. Uh,

142
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:16,920
and so off at the edges there's
only a little bit of distortion.

143
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:21,000
And then in the middle
everything goes haywire. Uh,
let me take this back a notch.

144
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,800
Uh, take a look at these two central
towers, this one here and that one.

145
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,620
Uh, and so they're kind of, uh,

146
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:33,420
what's happened here is that you're seeing
light that has gone out and then been

147
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:37,660
bent back toward you. So it looks like
the towers over here, but look it,

148
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:42,410
that same tower is down here. And so
that's like from the tower that went,

149
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,140
that went down and underneath the black
hole and then got pulled back up to grow

150
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,140
to reach your eyes.

151
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:53,550
So there are two paths from that tower
to your eye and you can see both of them.

152
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,350
Look at this thing here. Uh, what's that?
Let me go back to the original picture.

153
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,820
That's this statue.

154
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,160
And what's happened is light from the top
of the statue has gone up and over the

155
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:10,110
black hole and come down towards you.
Uh, whoops. Uh, and so here it is.

156
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,090
Uh,
and similarly,

157
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,700
the clouds that were up here
have been bent down, uh,

158
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:21,090
have gone underneath the black hole and
been bent back up so you can see them

159
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:24,990
here. And so they worked out all the
distortions of this. Uh, and uh, uh,

160
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,110
so they like to show this kind of amusing
picture. They actually had a movie,

161
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:32,430
which I couldn't find on the,
uh, on the net last night,

162
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,264
which is too bad,

163
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,780
where they take the black hole and they
kind of move it across the front of this

164
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:39,690
thing and you can see all the
distortions coming up. Uh,

165
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,790
and so you can have enormous fun with
this kind of thing. Uh, needless to say,

166
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,750
this is not, this particular picture
has not ever actually been observed.

167
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:53,610
That's calculated, not, uh,
uh, not actually observed.

168
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,151
Uh,

169
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:59,151
but you can see the kinds of bizarre
affects that gravitational lensing can

170
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:00,710
create.
Um,

171
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,040
and as I mentioned,

172
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,120
in some cases these are scientifically
useful things because you can determine

173
00:11:09,121 --> 00:11:13,170
the distribution of the mass that's
causing the lending questions. Yes.

174
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,790
Well, uh, what you have to do,

175
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:28,050
it depends a little bit on the exact mass
distribution of the lens. In this case,

176
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:31,470
I think they're assuming a
point source. And so, uh,

177
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,980
it is in general true that if
there's a gravitational lens,

178
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:38,970
you end up seeing more light than you
otherwise would because it's focused in

179
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:39,804
towards you.

180
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:44,400
So the total amount of light that you
see if you're seeing a lens to object is

181
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:48,310
typically larger than the amount you
would see in the absence of Lens.

182
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,680
So there are more paths of light that
are curved towards you that are curved

183
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:55,030
away from.
If you're standing over on the side,

184
00:11:55,031 --> 00:11:59,410
you'll lose a little bit of the light
because it will be curved in some other

185
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:04,140
direction. Uh, and so there are more
different way you can see the thing for,

186
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,690
you know, it's uh, kind of an
early 20th century art thing.

187
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:12,150
You can see the same object from two
different sides at once. Uh, and uh,

188
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,680
you get these curious distortions.
Yes.

189
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:17,340
If you're looking into a
galaxy cluster in there,

190
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,440
a lot of streets are a lot of galaxies
and you don't know the mass of the galaxy.

191
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,340
You're trying to turn it mass,
the one that's causing it. Yeah.

192
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,850
How do you know what strengths
belong to which gallon?

193
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,780
What streets belong to
which ground galaxies. Okay.

194
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,880
You know that the streaks must come from
galaxies that are located behind the

195
00:12:35,881 --> 00:12:40,250
galaxy cluster that are not themselves
part of the galaxy cluster. Uh,

196
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,890
and in order to understand what
that streak is, in principle,

197
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,670
you'd need to know the exact
shape and size of that galaxy.

198
00:12:47,671 --> 00:12:50,850
You can go and take a spectrum of the
thing and figure out how far away it is

199
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:53,760
and what the relative distances
are. Uh, but you in principle,

200
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:57,330
you would need to know the exact shape
of that galaxy before it was distorted,

201
00:12:57,331 --> 00:12:58,320
which you don't know.

202
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:03,590
And so what you have to do to interpret
these things is to take many streaks and

203
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:08,580
assume that the galaxies that
cause them are kind of normal,

204
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,690
a normal distribution of
galaxies, shapes. And so it's,

205
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:16,080
it's more of a statistical process then
using them one at a time. In that case,

206
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,530
the quasars are a little easier to deal
with because you know that their points.

207
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,070
Um, and uh, there's,

208
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,560
there are various kinds of limits to
how much information you can get out of

209
00:13:25,561 --> 00:13:27,780
this. And it's, it's,
it's quite tricky to do.

210
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:31,260
What's easy to do is the thing
that they did in that picture.

211
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:35,190
You imagine that there's a mass in the
way and you figure out what happens to

212
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:36,450
the light from the background.

213
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,740
What's hard to do is to observe
the light in the background,

214
00:13:40,741 --> 00:13:42,420
not know what it ought to look like,

215
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:46,500
really and infer what the
mass distribution is. That's
a harder problem. And the,

216
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:50,700
and there's a lot of theoretical effort
at the moment going into trying to solve

217
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:53,410
that problem of here's what you see,
uh,

218
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,050
infer what the mass distribution it has
to be in order for you to see that. Yes.

219
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,050
Have we ever observed like,
you know,

220
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:02,320
sort of the perfect bun senior
we have there, we have a ringer.

221
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,990
Yes, there are some Einstein rings.
Uh, I don't have them here. Uh,

222
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,420
Hubble Space Telescope has
observed a bunch of these things.

223
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:13,040
Typically they're not full rings because
the mass distribution is not perfectly

224
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,350
symmetric, but there are
there, as you can see,

225
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:17,880
you can see those were taught
kind of little arcs. Uh,

226
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,880
and if you get it set
up just the right way,

227
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:22,550
the arc can go a large fraction
of the way around the circle.

228
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:29,880
So these are kind of fun
things to observe and also, uh,

229
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,420
give you useful information.

230
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,500
So that's the second of
the post Newtonian effects.

231
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:38,680
The first with the procession of the
Perry Kilian. Now the deflection of light,

232
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,520
uh, moving on, uh,

233
00:14:42,521 --> 00:14:45,970
number three here is what
we talked about last time,

234
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,070
which is the gravitational red shift.

235
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,690
Uh,

236
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:59,690
and here we have a delta lambda
over lambda or alternatively,

237
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,010
uh, in the case of the problems that
you're working on the pulse period, uh,

238
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,680
in either case, these are usually
given the letter z. That's red shift.

239
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:12,840
Yeah.

240
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,340
That's a definition of this, this
quantity Z, which is often used, uh,

241
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,960
and uh,
this is equal to this quantity.

242
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,000
Uh,
and this is the

243
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,160
Schwarzer old radius

244
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,433
of,

245
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,240
uh,
some mass.

246
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:40,860
Yeah.

247
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,430
And this are is the distance

248
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,110
of

249
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,400
the light source.

250
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,230
Okay.

251
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,610
From that mass.

252
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,293
And

253
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:01,730
what this equation signifies
is how much red shift is there.

254
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,060
If you observe this thing when
you are sitting at infinity,

255
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,920
do you observe from

256
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,110
infinite
distance?

257
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:22,790
And what do I mean by infinite distance?

258
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:27,380
What I mean is that rs over
our goes to zero. That's what,

259
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,070
that's what infinite. That's what
infinite army did in this case.

260
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,560
So you're sitting out there a long,
long,

261
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,990
long way away from any
gravitational effect.

262
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,160
You're looking at a light that is
emitted inside a gravitational field,

263
00:16:40,161 --> 00:16:45,110
relatively close to some mass. That
light is red, shifted by this amount.

264
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:49,610
Uh, and pulse periods are also
lengthened by the same amount.

265
00:16:49,611 --> 00:16:52,160
And I'll come back to that in a minute.
Uh,

266
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:57,161
one thing I want to say right now is
what happens if you are an observer and

267
00:16:57,321 --> 00:16:59,030
you're not infinitely far away?

268
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,170
What happens if you're just a little bit
further away than the light sources or

269
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:07,880
perhaps even if you're closer to the
object than the light sources? Uh,

270
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,050
and, uh, in that case, if

271
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,640
the observer is not at infinity,

272
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:26,190
then the observed red shift
a is equal to the red shift,

273
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,410
uh,

274
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,850
from the source to infinity,

275
00:17:33,851 --> 00:17:38,851
which you can calculate by this calculated
by this formula minus the red shift

276
00:17:39,761 --> 00:17:44,300
from the observer
to infinity,

277
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:48,620
which you can also calculate with
that same, uh, with that same formula.

278
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:51,450
So you have to subtract a two things.

279
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:54,570
Basically what happens is
imagine the light going from,

280
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,780
it starts out at the source,
it goes to the Observer,

281
00:17:57,781 --> 00:18:01,680
and then it keeps going all the way
out to infinity. And you want to ask,

282
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:02,850
what is the observers?
See,

283
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:08,060
the observer sees that portion of the
red shift that happens between the source

284
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:11,070
and the Observer.
So to figure out what that is,

285
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,920
you figure out the red shift
from the source to infinity.

286
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,280
You figure out the retro from
the Observer to Infinity,

287
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,080
and you subtract those things,

288
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,630
and that gives you the red
shift from the Observer,

289
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,680
from the source to the
Observer. Okay? Yes.

290
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,970
Ah, no, no, no. But look what happens
when rns over R is equal to zero.

291
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,170
That means there's no red shift.
That means there's no red shift.

292
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,620
It doesn't mean that the way
the observed wavelength is zero,

293
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,970
it meets the change in the
wavelength is zero. Yeah,

294
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,840
that's important. Uh, and uh, in the, uh,

295
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,360
just to comment on the problem set here,
uh,

296
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:57,790
the idea on the second part of the
problem of the problem set is a,

297
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,400
you do have an observer at infinity.
So here's The Observer.

298
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:06,850
Here's some neutron star and you have a
light source that can either be on the

299
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:13,781
surface of the neutron star or it can
be raised off the surface of the neutron

300
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:16,850
star. And, uh, basically what you're,

301
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,040
what you're observing is the change
in the light source. So this has some,

302
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,080
has some red shift,

303
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:28,340
some pretty large red shift cause it's
sitting on the surface of a neutron star.

304
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,100
This because it's further away from the
neutron star has slightly less red shift.

305
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:42,020
And what you are interested in
is the change in the red shift.

306
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,230
And the idea behind the problem is,
uh,

307
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:51,340
you want to set this up so that that
change in the red shift is the same as the

308
00:19:51,341 --> 00:19:53,650
change in the red shift
due to the doppler shift.

309
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:58,560
If this whole thing was in orbit around
something that's the plan of that, uh,

310
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,580
that,
that particular problem.

311
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,560
Okay. So that's the third, uh, uh,

312
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:16,490
of the, uh, post Newtonian relativistic
effects. And there's a fourth one.

313
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,570
The fourth is gravitational waves,

314
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:26,640
which, uh, I may have time to come
back and talk about in detail. Uh,

315
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,770
at the moment though, I just want to say
what the effect of these things is. Uh,

316
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,140
rather than talk in detail
about what they are,

317
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,550
the effect is that the
orbital period decreases.

318
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,740
Yeah.
It turns out this is a relatively small,

319
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,870
uh,
and uh,

320
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,990
it is not observed in the solar system.

321
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,400
Yeah.

322
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,930
Even, uh, even in mercury, which has
the strongest relativistic effect.

323
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:05,970
Okay.

324
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,790
So those are four,
uh,

325
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,610
post Newtonian effects
of general relativity.

326
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:17,090
And what I want to talk about now
is what has become probably the best

327
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,700
laboratory for general relativity,
uh,

328
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,130
that we know of Prom
with general relativity.

329
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:26,070
You can't actually study it
all that much in the lab. Uh,

330
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,900
because in order to study,

331
00:21:27,901 --> 00:21:32,040
you need strong gravitational forces
and it's very difficult to create strong

332
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,550
gravitational forces in a laboratory.
Uh, what would you need to do?

333
00:21:35,551 --> 00:21:39,050
You'd need to take some massive
object, crush it down to, you know,

334
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,240
the size of a black hole or something
and have it sit there and your lab.

335
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,640
And this is not something that one can do.

336
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:49,530
And so you have to go and
look at astronomical objects
in order to find suitable

337
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,710
situations in which to study
these relativistic effects.

338
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:57,890
So the best lab for general
relativity lab for g are here is uh,

339
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,230
uh, a set of objects and
one object in particular,

340
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:07,130
which is referred to as
the binary pulse are, uh,

341
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,910
this is discussed in the readings
for this week's problem set. Uh,

342
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,880
the discovery of this particular object
led to a Nobel prize for its discovers.

343
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:21,870
Uh, and, uh, uh, uh, that's what's
discussed in that article. So,

344
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,020
uh, the first thing to talk about
here is what is a pulse are.

345
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,710
So Paul Stars were discovered
in the late 19, uh, 1960s.

346
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,870
Okay.

347
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,703
Uh,

348
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,793
okay.

349
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:43,910
A woman named Jocelyn Bell and she,
uh,

350
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:47,230
wired up a whole field in Cambridge,
England to make the,

351
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:50,890
to make it behave like a
radio telescope and, uh,

352
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,920
discovered that there
were objects in the sky,

353
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:58,480
celestial objects that seem to be
emitting pulses of radio waves.

354
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:01,900
So the observed signature of these things,

355
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:07,000
what was observed his
pulses of radio waves.

356
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:12,490
So you get kind of a blip every few
seconds it goes, blip, blip, blip, blip,

357
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:16,780
and so forth. And, uh,
these pulses come by.

358
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,790
Uh,
so the pulsations happen,

359
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:26,970
uh, once, uh, it's sort of, uh, with,

360
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
with a period of somewhere between
milliseconds and 10 seconds.

361
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,940
So they come at you pretty rapidly.

362
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,670
Most of them are a few seconds
or maybe a fraction of a second.

363
00:23:44,671 --> 00:23:49,400
So these are blipping away
and they had no idea what these were.

364
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,190
And the first four of them,
uh,

365
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:57,220
they gave the nickname LGM one
l g M to l g m three LGM for,

366
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,450
for little green men. Uh, because the
thought was that these might actually,

367
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,260
they thought briefly that these might
be signals from some extra terrestrial

368
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:08,960
intelligence cause you know,
it's a very regular signal.

369
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:11,990
It's hard to imagine how
those could have been created.

370
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:14,870
But fortunately before they
publish their paper, uh,

371
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:18,110
somebody suggested a better solution,
which turns out to be correct.

372
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,690
That what these things are, are, uh,

373
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:24,160
rotating a magnetized

374
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,470
a neutron stars.

375
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,880
And this was the first direct evidence
that neutron stars existed. Uh,

376
00:24:31,881 --> 00:24:36,440
and the reason they thought they were
neutron stars, this is because, uh,

377
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,610
the speed with which these things pulsed,
um,

378
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,610
is supposed to be reflected in the
rotation of these neutron stars.

379
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:48,180
And something that rotates 10 times a
second had better be pretty small. Uh,

380
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,410
and so there was a strong size
limits on the neutron stars. Uh,

381
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,750
it's not gonna matter too much
exactly what these things are.

382
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,030
Uh,
but I'm going to explain it to you anyway,

383
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:02,510
but don't worry too much about it
for the purposes of relativity.

384
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,320
The key point here is that it's
an extremely accurate clock,

385
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,880
that you get these blips coming out
of the thing and that creates a very

386
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:15,881
accurate clock and then you can see
very small changes in the pulse rate of

387
00:25:16,971 --> 00:25:20,690
these things. So now let me just
briefly tell you what these are. Oh,

388
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,010
I should mention, uh, so, uh,
the discovery of neutron stars,

389
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:26,030
this was a very big deal.

390
00:25:26,031 --> 00:25:29,330
This was the first strongly relativistic
object that had ever been discovered

391
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,100
and they awarded a Nobel prize to
Joslin Bells, thesis supervisor, uh,

392
00:25:34,101 --> 00:25:38,300
and there is some feeling among some
folks that this was an injustice.

393
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:42,980
Uh, and so there is, uh,
people discuss the, uh,

394
00:25:42,981 --> 00:25:47,430
the story of Jocelyn Bell and
the discovery of, of Paul SARS.

395
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,150
Uh,

396
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:53,150
to her credit bell has never complained
a bell and the discovery of pulse.

397
00:25:54,751 --> 00:25:58,370
Ah Ha. Oh yes. Well, that's actually an
interesting question. The question is,

398
00:25:58,371 --> 00:26:02,540
did the thesis advisor do anything
as a thesis advisor? Myself,

399
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,750
I take that question seriously. Well,
this is the whole debate about, well,

400
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,050
who should have gotten the Nobel prize?
It,

401
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:15,070
the thesis supervisor thought up
the experiment and Bell did it.

402
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:19,010
So who ought to get the credit for that?
Uh,

403
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:24,070
it's actually a subtle question and it
bears on a problem for or whatever it is

404
00:26:24,651 --> 00:26:28,790
of, of this week's a, of this week's
homework. So it's worth thinking about.

405
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:33,920
Uh, Jocelyn bound the discovery of
pulse. Ours, uh, he also got the money.

406
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:39,060
Uh, that's not trivial sometimes.
Uh, and the moral of the story too,

407
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,330
it depends on who you ask for exactly.

408
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:46,180
The reason that you bring up a one
moral of the story is the Grad students,

409
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,370
particularly female Grad Students,
uh,

410
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,960
never get any credit
and that this is a great injustice.

411
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,760
Uh, as you get older, your attitude
toward this problem changes.

412
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:05,590
Uh, and uh, the alternative
moral is that, uh,

413
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:10,210
thinking and doing a is not the same,

414
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:15,640
are not the same, and that
thinking is better than doing, uh,

415
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,320
now, uh, what could raise various
objections and people have a,

416
00:27:20,321 --> 00:27:22,780
to this line of thought.
And interestingly enough,

417
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,440
the next time they had to give a Nobel
prize for something to do with Paul

418
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:29,950
starts, which was the discovery
of the binary pulse are uh,

419
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:33,940
they did give the prize also to the
graduate student and it's the graduate

420
00:27:33,941 --> 00:27:35,850
students,
uh,

421
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,880
description of what he did that you're
actually reading for this problem set.

422
00:27:39,881 --> 00:27:44,140
So you can opine on this,
uh, uh, this topic yourself,

423
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:49,340
uh, for, uh, on the
problem set anyway. Um, a,

424
00:27:49,341 --> 00:27:54,160
a, a matter of continuing controversy
in scientific circles. Uh,

425
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:57,340
but let me just briefly show you
what supposed to be happening here.

426
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,870
Here's a neutron star.

427
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,000
Okay.

428
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,850
Very dense thing. Yeah. And it's rotating.

429
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:07,800
So it's got some access of rotation here.
Take a different color.

430
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:12,630
So here's its axis of rotation and it's
rotating around its axis and it's also

431
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:15,720
got a magnetic field.
But the magnetic field,

432
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:20,070
the poll of the magnetic field is
not the same as the rotation pull.

433
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,660
That's true on the earth as well.

434
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:25,980
Magnetic north is not exactly in
the same place as, as true north,

435
00:28:25,981 --> 00:28:27,510
the center of the Earth's rotation.

436
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,040
And if you're in northern Canada and you
try and follow a compass signal north,

437
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,230
uh, you're going to get yourself into
big trouble because you know, the,

438
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,500
the actual magnetic pole is
somewhere in northern Canada.

439
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:41,640
And if you're north of that,

440
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:45,600
you'll be going south when
you think you're going north.
Uh, anyway, imagine that.

441
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:46,830
Here's the magnetic fields.

442
00:28:46,831 --> 00:28:51,540
Magnetic fields have these sort of
field lines that look like this. Uh,

443
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:52,410
and uh,

444
00:28:52,411 --> 00:28:56,670
what happens in these things is that
there's radio emission coming out of the

445
00:28:56,671 --> 00:29:01,200
magnetic poles. So there's radio
emission coming out this way.

446
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:08,900
And so, uh, if you're
observing this from here,

447
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,490
say,
uh,

448
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,990
you see a radio emission when the
poll was pointing towards you,

449
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:20,090
but then, uh, if the thing is
rotating, then half a rotation later,

450
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,290
so later,

451
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,523
uh,

452
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,430
but not too much later because this
thing rotates really quickly. Uh,

453
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:32,450
here's the neutron star still and now
the pole's over here because it's rotated

454
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,830
around by a factor of
two, uh, by, by half,

455
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,880
by half a rotation.

456
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,510
So now the radio emissions coming this
and if you're still sitting observing the

457
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:48,160
thing down here, you don't see
anything. So this is on and this is off.

458
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,500
So you watched this Paul, it
started like a lighthouse. You know,

459
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:55,900
a lighthouse has a beam of light
and when it's pointing towards you,

460
00:29:55,901 --> 00:29:59,320
you see light. And then as it's going
around in a circle, you don't see light,

461
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,060
then it points towards UGC light again.

462
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:05,710
And so the consequence of this is that
you get something that looks like radio.

463
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:09,400
If you plot radio emission versus time,

464
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,890
you get these very regularly spaced blips.
Uh,

465
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:19,750
and it is the time between one
blip in the next. That's the uh,

466
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,740
pulse period,

467
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,720
pulse period.

468
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:30,110
And so for our purposes here, I mean,
pulsars are very interesting objects,

469
00:30:30,111 --> 00:30:33,140
but we're not going to go into
them in any depth as objects.

470
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:37,610
The key thing is that it's got this
really accurate clock on it. And when,

471
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,020
if you imagine a pulse are in orbit around
something, when it comes towards you,

472
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,770
each one of these blips
happens a little closer to you.

473
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:49,430
So the light travel time
from the blip to you is less.

474
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:53,630
And so it seems like the blips happened
closer together because each one of

475
00:30:53,631 --> 00:30:57,650
them's emitted a little closer towards
you. Similarly, when it's going away,

476
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:02,750
each blip is emitted a little further
away. It takes extra time to get to you.

477
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,370
And the pulse period,

478
00:31:04,371 --> 00:31:09,340
the length of time between the pulses
appears to be longer by how much, uh,

479
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:14,210
by exactly the amount that the doppler
shift formula, uh, would suggest.

480
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:19,070
And so the pulse period
obeys the same rules, uh,

481
00:31:19,071 --> 00:31:22,840
in terms of its length as
a wave lengths of light.

482
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,423
Okay.

483
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,280
So, uh, for example,

484
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:35,430
it is true that a delta pulse period
over pulse period a is equal to the usual

485
00:31:40,151 --> 00:31:41,470
doppler shift formula.

486
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,003
Yeah.

487
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,540
Which is approximately
equal to VR oversee, uh,

488
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:56,390
in the Newtonian approximation.
Oh,

489
00:31:56,391 --> 00:31:58,300
and I should say in problem
one on the problem set,

490
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,550
you can use the Newtonian approximation
because as you'll discover,

491
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,350
the velocity of the object as it goes
around in its orbit is significantly less

492
00:32:06,351 --> 00:32:10,120
than the speed of light.
Okay.

493
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:12,760
So they discovered this binary pulse are

494
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:23,430
with a short orbital period. The orbital
period. This is now the orbital period,

495
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,420
uh, is around eight hours,
which is pretty short,

496
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:32,310
but it's still not very relativistic,
but you can measure these things. Two,

497
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:33,930
incredible accuracy,

498
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:39,543
okay?

499
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:45,750
So you can not only see the
velocity curve that we're used to,

500
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,080
you can also see tiny deviations
from the Newtonian velocity curve.

501
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,280
And from those tiny deviations
from the Newtonian velocity curve,

502
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:01,260
you can see these posts, Newtonian
effects, uh, in particular, it turns out,

503
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,170
so this is an ellipse.
It's in an elliptical orbit.

504
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,350
It's not a circular orbit,
it's a highly elliptical orbit.

505
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,740
And you can see the precession
of the Perry Asteron

506
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:19,590
as the elliptic city as
the direction of the orbit.

507
00:33:19,591 --> 00:33:21,570
As the position of the orbit changes,

508
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:25,170
you can see the procession of the Perry
Asteron and the procession of the Perry

509
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,740
Astro. It happens at the rate
of four degrees per year.

510
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:34,850
Now compare that to mercury in which the
same effect can be observed at 43 arc

511
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:37,620
seconds per century.

512
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,850
So this is a much stronger effect.

513
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,593
Okay?

514
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,220
Uh, okay. You can also see

515
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,940
the gravitational red shift.

516
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,460
Now,
let me show you how this comes about.

517
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:11,190
Uh, but you, you have to be careful
about exactly what you're seeing.

518
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:16,370
You're not seeing the gravitational
redshift due to the fact that the clock is

519
00:34:16,531 --> 00:34:21,450
sitting on a neutron star, uh,
because, okay, so you're seeing

520
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,750
the effect of the

521
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,650
companion object of this
other object in the system,

522
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:34,970
which happens to be also a neutron star,
but not a pulse are.

523
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,950
And what happens is this,

524
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:46,240
here's your clock and it's going around
in some kind of elliptical orbit.

525
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:49,730
Uh, here's the center of
mass. Here's the other.

526
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,660
So there's a clock that's
going around like this,

527
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:57,770
and then there's some other object.
It's going around like this.

528
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,783
Yeah,

529
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,570
there are approximately the same mass.

530
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:08,850
And so sometimes these objects are
close to each other. Uh, for example,

531
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,410
oops. Here, when they're here and here,

532
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,200
uh,
this is called this position one,

533
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:22,400
and then later on, half an orbit later,
they're out here in position two,

534
00:35:22,401 --> 00:35:24,470
and this one's gone all
the way out to here.

535
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:26,720
Okay?

536
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,200
Uh,
so at position one,

537
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,090
uh,
the objects are close

538
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,770
and sold. The clock has to, uh,

539
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,570
go is red shifted by the
presence of the other object.

540
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:49,910
Uh, and so it has to, uh, if there's
a red shift due to the other object,

541
00:35:49,911 --> 00:35:53,350
which is nearby, objects
are close. So the red shift,

542
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:54,930
yeah.

543
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,730
Caused by the other object,

544
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,540
other object is large.

545
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:05,760
Okay.

546
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,230
At position two,

547
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:15,180
the distance to the other object as
much greater distance is greater.

548
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,720
And so red shift is less.

549
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,201
Now,

550
00:36:24,201 --> 00:36:29,060
it's also true that there's a red shift
cost by the fact that this clock is

551
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,200
sitting on a neutron star.

552
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:33,680
But the thing about that red shift is it
doesn't change during the course of the

553
00:36:33,681 --> 00:36:34,310
orbit.

554
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:38,570
So you can't actually tell that it's there
because that's one of the differences

555
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:41,510
between measuring pulse periods of,
uh,

556
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,130
of Paul Stars and measuring wavelengths
of light with the spectral features in,

557
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:48,560
in light. You know, what
it's supposed to be.

558
00:36:48,561 --> 00:36:51,440
If it isn't red shifted in
the case of the pulse, ours,

559
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:54,530
you don't know in advance what
the pulse period ought to be.

560
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,780
So you can't tell what it,

561
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,890
what it should be if there
was no gravitational field
or was no doppler shift.

562
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,660
All that you can tell is the amount by
which it changes during the course of an

563
00:37:05,661 --> 00:37:09,840
orbital period. And so
you're comparing, uh, uh,

564
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,790
the red shift when the objects are in
this position to the red shift of the

565
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:18,140
objects in this position, the red
shift caused by the pulse are itself,

566
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,130
doesn't change,

567
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:23,510
but the red shift caused by where it's
companion is and the gravitational force

568
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:27,590
exerted by the companion does
change. The consequence, by the way,

569
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,500
is that if these things
are in a circular orbit,

570
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:34,130
you can't see the gravitational redshift
cause they're always the same distance

571
00:37:34,131 --> 00:37:37,250
away from each other. And the
gravitational redshift doesn't change.

572
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:39,320
There is a gravitational red shift,

573
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:42,050
but it doesn't change during
the course of the period.

574
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,900
And it's the change that you can observe.
Yes.

575
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:50,180
So it just gets red ship docked to the
frequency of the light in the pulses is,

576
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,390
it's the time. It's the time
between pulses. Uh, yeah.

577
00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:00,290
There you could imagine that the
pulses might have a spectral feature.

578
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:03,560
And then you would, then you would see
it in the spectral feature too. In fact,

579
00:38:03,561 --> 00:38:06,350
that's extremely hard to have that.
That doesn't happen. It's, it's a,

580
00:38:06,351 --> 00:38:09,770
it's a continuum, a of
light. So it's the type,

581
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,780
what you observe is the time between
pulses and that's a can be observed

582
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:18,140
extremely accurately.
You get 20 decimal places of accuracy.

583
00:38:18,141 --> 00:38:19,220
It's really kind of frightening.

584
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,433
Yes.

585
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,200
Well, if it's a circular orbit,
know if there's a circular orbit,

586
00:38:32,201 --> 00:38:34,060
they're always the same
distance around each other.

587
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,950
They're chasing each other in a circle.

588
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,110
That's what it means
to be a circular orbit.

589
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:42,640
Has every point on the orbit is the same
distance to the center for both objects.

590
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:47,590
So each object is the same distance
from the center of mass at all times.

591
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,180
That's what makes it a circular orbit.

592
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,730
And they're always on the opposite
side of the center of mass.

593
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:55,420
So the distance between them is
always the same. For a circular orbit,

594
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,350
I'll draw it. Uh, here we go.
Here's the center of mass.

595
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,540
Supposing these objects are the same mass
as each other. So here's one of them.

596
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:09,280
It's going around this way. And here it
is right now. And here's the other object.

597
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,570
It's going around this way
and here it is right now.

598
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,540
And they're just going to
march around this circle.

599
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,010
Each being on the opposite
side of the center.

600
00:39:19,011 --> 00:39:23,720
And the distance between the won't change.
Oh,

601
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,800
they only overlap if there,
if the two objects are the same mass.

602
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,880
Uh, so if one object is
more massive than the other,

603
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:35,690
then you've got a little
circle going this way, uh,

604
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,130
and wipes and a big circle going this way.

605
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,020
Uh,
let's see.

606
00:39:42,021 --> 00:39:45,500
It would it have to be there and then
they're still the same distance from each

607
00:39:45,501 --> 00:39:50,210
other at every point along the way because
each one of them is always the same

608
00:39:50,211 --> 00:39:52,370
distance from the center
of mass in the middle.

609
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,740
And they're always on opposite sides.

610
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,273
Okay.

611
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:03,140
Ah,
so the way you lips his work is,

612
00:40:03,141 --> 00:40:06,740
so here's an ellipse and the
lips can be bigger little,

613
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:09,980
here's an ellipse they're doing ellipses,

614
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:13,790
and the center of mass is
at one focus of the ellipse.

615
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:18,560
It's not at the center of the ellipse.
That's the key thing. Uh, and so at,

616
00:40:18,561 --> 00:40:20,870
when they're your furthest
away from the focus,

617
00:40:20,871 --> 00:40:24,650
you have a long distance from the center.
When you're closer, you're closer.

618
00:40:24,651 --> 00:40:26,270
And it's because each one of these things,

619
00:40:26,271 --> 00:40:29,090
you don't maintain a constant
distance from the center of mass.

620
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,050
Okay?
Uh,

621
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,860
so because of this effect
in elliptical orbits,

622
00:40:38,861 --> 00:40:40,930
in Binary pulsars and elliptical orbit,

623
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,820
you can observe the
gravitational red shift also.

624
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,540
And this is what they got the
Nobel prize for. Really. Uh,

625
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:54,340
you can see that the orbital period
decreases. It's getting shorter.

626
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:56,530
The two objects are spiraling in together,

627
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:04,910
decreases due to gravitational waves.

628
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:11,030
So you can observe three different posts,

629
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:15,650
Newtonian effects in
these systems. So, uh,

630
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:21,430
so this constitutes a serious test of
general relativity in the following way.

631
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:28,900
If you could do only the Newtonian
only Newtonian measurements,

632
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:34,100
what would you get?
Well,

633
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,080
we did this before for the planets.

634
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,740
What you can get out of a Newtonian
measurement to velocity. Remember,

635
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:41,750
what you're doing is you're
measuring the doppler shift,

636
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:46,720
you're measuring radial velocity.
What you get is a, you can determine,

637
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:51,040
uh, m total, the total mass of the system.

638
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,560
If you know the inclination,

639
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,270
that's something we tended to leave out.

640
00:41:57,271 --> 00:42:00,080
We always claimed these things are
edge on cause it makes the calculations

641
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:00,660
easier.

642
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,410
But in fact you get a different answer
depending on what the inclination is and

643
00:42:04,411 --> 00:42:08,880
you don't necessarily know the
inclination. So if you now measure,

644
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,360
yeah,

645
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,590
the precession

646
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:13,953
okay

647
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:16,280
of the Perry Astro

648
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:22,890
then this also the amount of that also
depends on m one m two the two masses and

649
00:42:26,651 --> 00:42:31,120
the inclination.
So you can solve for the inclination now

650
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:35,600
is it isn't actually
precisely how you do it,

651
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:39,830
but conceptually this is how it works.
You're now solve for the inclination.

652
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,200
You then know, uh, m total,

653
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:48,660
but not each individual mass

654
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:58,030
m one m two and the inclination,
this is I,

655
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,900
right, but you don't know
the individual masses. Now,

656
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:08,010
if both objects were pulsars
and you could see both orbits,

657
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,840
then you would also know, uh, the, the
individual, uh, masses. But you don't,

658
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:16,020
you only see one of these objects.
Okay.

659
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:21,380
So now the next effect is
gravitational red shift.

660
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:30,400
And this again depends in a different way.

661
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:35,290
On m one m two and the inclination had,

662
00:43:35,291 --> 00:43:38,190
so now,
uh,

663
00:43:38,191 --> 00:43:43,191
you can solve for m one and since
you know they're the total mass,

664
00:43:44,641 --> 00:43:45,960
you also get him to,

665
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:47,690
okay.

666
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,550
So at this point,
you know,

667
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,330
m one m two and the inclination,

668
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,390
what's happening here is that
each time you measure an effect,

669
00:43:56,391 --> 00:43:58,040
you get an additional constraint.

670
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:03,260
And you started out having a
three unknowns and what equation?

671
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:07,850
Uh, and of course you can't solve for
three unknowns with only one equation,

672
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,910
but then you observe two more effect.

673
00:44:10,911 --> 00:44:13,970
So now you have three
unknowns and three equations.

674
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:18,320
So now you can solve for all
of these things. Now, you know,

675
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:21,440
everything at this point you can predict

676
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,530
what the period change should
be because you know everything,

677
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,660
then you can measure that.

678
00:44:33,661 --> 00:44:38,661
And so you have a specific prediction
of created from general relativity.

679
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:43,290
You can measure this effect,
uh,

680
00:44:43,291 --> 00:44:47,700
and the prediction turns out to be correct
to within the measurement terrorists

681
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,290
and the measurement errors are getting
more precise all the time because as time

682
00:44:56,291 --> 00:44:57,070
goes on,

683
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:01,620
the amount of change in the period since
they first observe it increases because

684
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,800
the periods changing more,
it's slowing down and slowing the period,

685
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:08,570
the periods getting faster and faster.
The object serve are falling in. Uh,

686
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:11,860
and so over time, uh,
that change mounts up,

687
00:45:11,861 --> 00:45:14,380
you can measure it better and
better and better as time goes on.

688
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,560
And so the precision of this test of
general relativity is going up all the

689
00:45:20,111 --> 00:45:22,330
time.
So it is now clear,

690
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:25,570
uh,

691
00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:30,570
that general relativity is a correct
to some number of decimal places is,

692
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:33,663
uh,

693
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,870
I'm going to put correct in quotes
because it depends how accurately you can

694
00:45:37,871 --> 00:45:38,261
measure it,

695
00:45:38,261 --> 00:45:43,261
but the accuracy is going up all the
time in the post Newtonian approximation.

696
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,890
Remember,
all these affect our posts,

697
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,380
Newtonian only actually,

698
00:45:50,381 --> 00:45:54,370
they've now observed a couple of post
post Newtonian effect, which are the next,

699
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:58,440
uh, the next term in the, uh, in
the series expansion. But, uh,

700
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,810
and those are also correct, but they're
not measured as precisely yet. Uh, so,

701
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:07,610
so it's clear that general relativity
is correct as long as everything is,

702
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:11,410
is still pretty close to, uh, um,

703
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,410
it's still pretty close
to the Newtonian thing.

704
00:46:14,411 --> 00:46:15,880
You can actually still have orbits,

705
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,960
but you could imagine a theory

706
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,250
which is like Newton,

707
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,800
uh,
in the first term of the expansion,

708
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,820
like general relativity
in the second term,

709
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,110
the post Newtonian term,

710
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:44,710
but different

711
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,900
at very,
uh,

712
00:46:49,901 --> 00:46:52,690
strong in very strong
gravitational fields.

713
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,630
So you've got to get the first term to
work and it's got to come out like Newton,

714
00:46:58,870 --> 00:47:00,550
you've got to get the second term to work.

715
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:03,820
It's got to come out like
general relativity. But then, uh,

716
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:08,800
you can imagine all sorts of different
functions that work with this work with

717
00:47:08,801 --> 00:47:11,410
this and are different in
the higher order terms.

718
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,520
And the higher order terms are the things
that give rise to all these exciting

719
00:47:15,521 --> 00:47:20,230
effects. Like, uh, it's like event
horizons and things like that. So,

720
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:24,250
uh, what would be nice, it would be good,

721
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:27,721
uh,

722
00:47:27,721 --> 00:47:32,721
to have some way of testing strong field

723
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:39,920
effects. And by that I mean
situations in which, uh,

724
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,810
the Schwartz showed radius over our,
uh,

725
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:46,000
becomes close to one because in that case,

726
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:49,300
all the terms in this series
expansion contributing.

727
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,470
And if you can get it,
if the theory is right there,

728
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:55,480
then all the terms have to be the same.

729
00:47:55,481 --> 00:48:00,040
And you don't have this nagging doubt
about whether you could come up with some

730
00:48:00,041 --> 00:48:04,060
theory that looks like Newton in the same
way that general relativity looks like

731
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:07,570
Newton Buddies, different, uh, uh,
once you get higher order terms,

732
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:09,910
looks like general relativity
and the second term,

733
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,090
but turns out to be a totally
different theory. Needless to say,

734
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:18,250
the theorists have come up
with a literally an infinite
number of such theories

735
00:48:18,251 --> 00:48:22,210
because there's a whole infinite
family of things which satisfy this,

736
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:26,090
satisfy this and look different
at the upper level. So, uh,

737
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:30,100
what we're going to talk about next
time is how one might go about,

738
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:33,700
uh,
testing strong field relativity.

739
00:48:33,701 --> 00:48:37,120
This is a subject close to my heart
because it's what I do for a living. Uh,

740
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:38,770
and we'll talk about it on Thursday.
