1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:01,850
Okay,

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,160
welcome to the second part of,

3
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:05,030
uh,

4
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:06,530
of astro one 60.

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,073
Uh,

6
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,450
this is going to be about
black holes and relativity.

7
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,320
And,

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,153
uh,

9
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,260
just to give you a kind of a preview,

10
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,070
the whole point of black holes is
that of course they emit no light,

11
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:20,660
so you can't see them directly.

12
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,300
Uh,

13
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,520
and so the question arises,

14
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:23,990
how do you know that they're there?

15
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:29,290
And the reason you can demonstrate the
black holes exist is because they're in a

16
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,390
orbit around other things.

17
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:34,910
And you can see the motion
of the other things,

18
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:35,360
uh,

19
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,390
that interact gravitationally
with the black hole.

20
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,550
This concept should be familiar to a
certain extent because it's exactly the

21
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:46,610
same thing we've been doing
for discovering exoplanets.

22
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:48,590
You don't see the exoplanet directly.

23
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:49,161
Uh,

24
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:53,870
what happens is that there's something
else that you can see that's affected by

25
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:55,370
the presence of the exoplanet.

26
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:55,641
So the,

27
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:57,350
exactly the same thing happens with,

28
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:58,610
with black holes.

29
00:00:58,611 --> 00:01:00,680
And so we're going to use,

30
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,580
uh,

31
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,740
the same equations,

32
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,280
the same concept,

33
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:05,900
uh,

34
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,120
to explore this very different contexts.

35
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:08,680
So,

36
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,410
uh,

37
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:10,243
black holes,

38
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,370
oh,

39
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,210
black holes,

40
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,630
I can't be seen directly.

41
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:24,700
And so instead of detecting them directly,

42
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:25,534
you use,

43
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,373
uh,

44
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,950
this combination of orbital dynamics.

45
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,310
Yeah.

46
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,061
And,

47
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:33,750
uh,

48
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,310
things like the top layer shift,

49
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,723
okay.

50
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,890
To infer their presence and more than
just inferring their presence to infer

51
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,390
their properties.

52
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:47,870
Now the context is more complicated.

53
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,500
Uh,

54
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,910
and in particular,

55
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,073
uh,

56
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,170
we're no longer going to
be using a Newton's laws,

57
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:58,620
Newton's law of gravity,

58
00:01:58,621 --> 00:01:59,790
Newton's laws of motion,

59
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,180
uh,

60
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,470
because there's a more comprehensive
theory that replaced Newton,

61
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,100
uh,

62
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,860
which is necessary to
understand these things.

63
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:12,660
And that more a complex theory is
Einstein's theory of relativity.

64
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,850
So we're going to be using some
relativity rather than Newtonian physics.

65
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,950
This gets weird very fast.

66
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:27,760
Okay.

67
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,330
Uh,

68
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:28,841
and,

69
00:02:28,841 --> 00:02:28,931
uh,

70
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:30,160
so I'm not going to start there.

71
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:33,610
I'm going to start with a kind of
Newtonian explanation for what black holes

72
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:33,791
are.

73
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,710
We'll do that this time and then,

74
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,041
uh,

75
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,780
the weirdness we'll start on Thursday.

76
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,860
Uh,

77
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,680
so the first concept,

78
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:42,830
uh,

79
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,390
and the easiest way I think
to understand black holes,

80
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:46,991
uh,

81
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:48,970
is the concept of the escape.

82
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:49,804
Philocity

83
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,030
this is a piece of high school physics.

84
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:55,070
Some of you may have
encountered it before.

85
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:55,880
Uh,

86
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,880
and it just means how fast you have to
go to escape from the gravitational field

87
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,950
of a given object.

88
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:06,700
If you go outside and you shoot up a
rocket ship or something like that,

89
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:11,350
how fast do you have to shoot it up so
that it doesn't fall back to the earth?

90
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,620
And so that you can define an
escape philosophy for the earth,

91
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,000
uh,

92
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,050
or for any other object for that matter,

93
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:20,920
which is just how fast you have to
go to escape its gravitational field.

94
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,560
There's an equation associated with this.

95
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:26,190
It looks like this a v escape,

96
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:26,400
the,

97
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,400
that's the escape velocity to g m
over r all to the one half power.

98
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,031
Uh,

99
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:34,781
and uh,

100
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:36,700
this is the speed,

101
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,223
uh,

102
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,710
required to escape,

103
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,233
uh,

104
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:43,871
uh,

105
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:45,520
the gravitational field.

106
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,463
Yeah.

107
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,663
Uh,

108
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,290
and object.

109
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,643
Yeah.

110
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,833
Uh,

111
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:58,870
supposing that the object has mass
equal to m and radius equals to R.

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,420
Oh,

113
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,440
one other assumption.

114
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,550
I'm assuming here that you're standing
on that you start from standing on the

115
00:04:07,551 --> 00:04:08,720
surface of the object.

116
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,083
Uh,

117
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,800
if you are

118
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:17,803
the surface,

119
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:20,893
okay,

120
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,190
this equation should look vaguely but
not a hundred percent familiar to you

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,720
because you derive something that looked
a lot like it on the second problem set

122
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,770
where you worked out the relationship
between the semi major access of an orbit

123
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,640
and the speed and object had
to go in to be in that orbit.

124
00:04:40,641 --> 00:04:41,330
And what,

125
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:41,810
uh,

126
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,490
the way that calculation worked out,

127
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:48,050
it was velocity equals g m
over the semi major axis a.

128
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,720
So that too wasn't there,

129
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,280
uh,

130
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,550
in that derivation.

131
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,601
But otherwise,

132
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:56,600
the form of this is actually
quite similar to them.

133
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:57,590
So let me explain,

134
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,580
uh,

135
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,690
why that is.

136
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,740
Here's a,

137
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,030
here's some object.

138
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,240
It's got a radius of r and a massive m.

139
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,390
And imagine that you've got
something that you know,

140
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,740
orbit around this object,

141
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:17,930
but it's in orbit right above the surface.

142
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:20,090
It's just skimming the
surface of the thing.

143
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:20,870
Uh,

144
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,810
that would be impossible in the case
of earth because the friction from the

145
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:25,070
atmosphere which slowed you down,

146
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:25,401
but in,

147
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:25,790
uh,

148
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,001
uh,

149
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:27,500
a planet without an atmosphere,

150
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:28,610
this would be possible.

151
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,690
Imagine you're just sort of skimming over
the tops of the mountains or whatever.

152
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,310
So here you are in orbit.

153
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:39,230
This is something in a nice circular
orbit right above the surface of this

154
00:05:39,231 --> 00:05:40,064
object.

155
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:43,190
And it's going around and uh,

156
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,930
it's got some velocity,

157
00:05:44,931 --> 00:05:47,180
which I'm going to call
the circular velocity.

158
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,380
And,

159
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:48,640
uh,

160
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,820
as we calculated in the
previous section of the course,

161
00:05:52,821 --> 00:05:54,680
that's GM over a,

162
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,810
which is in this case GM over,

163
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,110
cause you're s,

164
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,580
uh,

165
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,630
skimming the surface,

166
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,950
the one half power.

167
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,370
So that's how fast you have
to go to stay in orbit.

168
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,650
If you go slower than that,

169
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:07,640
uh,

170
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,080
let's take a different color here.

171
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,150
If you go slower than that,

172
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,240
you crash into the surface
right away because you don't,

173
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:16,070
you're not going fast
enough to stay in orbit.

174
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,490
So that's what happens in the case.

175
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,120
If you have a velocity less
than the circular velocity.

176
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,020
What happens if you're going
faster than the circular velocity?

177
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:27,470
Well,

178
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,700
you're going so fast that you move
further away from this object.

179
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:33,470
You don't stay skimming the surface.

180
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:38,450
So here you are going a little bit
faster and now you're not in a circular

181
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:39,284
orbit,

182
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,470
and your orbit ends up looking something
like this nice elliptical orbit.

183
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,020
Okay.

184
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,020
And this is a velocity greater
than the circular velocity,

185
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:53,640
uh,

186
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,330
but still less than the escape philosophy
because you haven't to escape the

187
00:06:57,331 --> 00:07:01,650
gravitational a feel because
you're still in an orbit.

188
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:02,940
It's an elliptical orbit now,

189
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:05,700
but you're still in an orbit and
it'll come back to the same place.

190
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,230
Now,

191
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:12,230
if you're going at somewhat faster
than that at the escape velocity,

192
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,700
then you never come back.

193
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,960
You continue,

194
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,290
uh,

195
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,900
all the way out to infinity.

196
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:25,783
Uh,

197
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,380
your orbit continues to change direction
a little bit due to the gravitational

198
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:31,220
force of this thing.

199
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:32,930
You just continued to slow down.

200
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:33,500
Uh,

201
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,340
but in the end,

202
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:34,701
uh,

203
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:35,690
you never come back.

204
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:37,220
So it's a non repeating orbit,

205
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,790
and if you're going even faster
than the escape velocity,

206
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,243
uh,

207
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,210
then,

208
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:47,600
uh,

209
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,110
you,

210
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,410
uh,

211
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,150
get to infinity even faster.

212
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,453
Uh,

213
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,491
and,

214
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:52,820
uh,

215
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,031
uh,

216
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:53,841
and more importantly,

217
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:54,621
when you get there,

218
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:56,270
you're still moving pretty fast.

219
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:56,781
Uh,

220
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:57,410
this,

221
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:57,650
uh,

222
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,790
gradually slowed down.

223
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,930
So all of these different kinds of orbits,

224
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,910
but one that crashes into the planet,

225
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,530
the one that's skims the planet,

226
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:07,940
the one that's an elliptical orbit,

227
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:09,530
the one that escapes altogether,

228
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,010
those are all within a factor of the
square root of two of each other.

229
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,990
Because remember,

230
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,790
the escape velocity here

231
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:23,770
is equal to two g m
over r to the one half.

232
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,120
Yeah.

233
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,750
So,

234
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,020
uh,

235
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,700
just by increasing your or your orbital
speed by a factor of the square root of

236
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:30,180
two,

237
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,470
you go from being in a nice circular
orbit to escaping the gravitational field

238
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:35,610
of the object all together.

239
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,720
So you can calculate escape
velocities of things.

240
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:40,883
Uh,

241
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:44,130
let's do that once the
escape philosophy of earth

242
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,550
of earth,

243
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,690
that would be the escape is two g m over
r to the one half a to g is seven times

244
00:08:57,841 --> 00:08:59,250
10 to the minus 11.

245
00:08:59,600 --> 00:08:59,910
Uh,

246
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,930
m is for the earth is
six times 10 to the 24,

247
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:04,830
uh,

248
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:08,460
are for the earth is something
like seven times 10 to the six.

249
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,060
This all has to be taken to the
one half power sevens cancel.

250
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,111
What do we have here?

251
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:13,890
Let's see,

252
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:16,500
12 times

253
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,310
10 to the 13,

254
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,960
24 minus 11,

255
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:26,010
over 10 to the six one half.

256
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,361
Let's see,

257
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:32,361
that's 1.2 14 minus six is eight
times 10 to the eight to the one half.

258
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,130
That's something like 10 to
the four meters per second,

259
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,640
because I've used a,

260
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,330
the value of g that's appropriate
for meters per second.

261
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,890
So that's about a 10 kilometers a second.

262
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:48,510
So that's the escape
philosophy of the Europe.

263
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,560
If you go outside,

264
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,100
you throw a football up into the
air at 10 kilometers per second,

265
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:54,300
it's not going to come back down.

266
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,530
Try it.

267
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,363
Ah,

268
00:09:58,950 --> 00:09:59,790
good exercise.

269
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,690
Okay.

270
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,380
Uh,

271
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,420
you could calculate
the escape velocity of,

272
00:10:03,421 --> 00:10:05,130
of any particular object.

273
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,580
You can calculate the escape
velocity of each human being.

274
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:09,993
Uh,

275
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:12,480
uh,

276
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,313
a human,

277
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,650
a human has a massive 100 kilograms,

278
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,140
a radius of about one meter.

279
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:19,730
Uh,

280
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,090
this is kind of a big human,

281
00:10:21,091 --> 00:10:21,691
but a,

282
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:22,524
we'll go with it.

283
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,610
Uh,

284
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,110
let's see.

285
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,110
V Escape is equal to two g m over a half.

286
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:32,010
There's a very famous book about physics,

287
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,550
uh,

288
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,510
with the title,

289
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:33,841
uh,

290
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,760
assume a spherical cow.

291
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:36,361
Uh,

292
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:36,781
and this,

293
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:39,510
so this is the kind of thing
that physicists like to do.

294
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:40,980
It's an idealized situation.

295
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:43,080
We have this perfectly
spherical human being.

296
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,220
Uh,

297
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:44,970
and uh,

298
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,211
okay,

299
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,530
so let's do the calculation.

300
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,360
Two Times seven times 10 to
the minus 11 times a hundred.

301
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:53,310
That's 10 to the two over one.

302
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,473
Uh,

303
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,650
did the square root,

304
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,370
uh,

305
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,210
that's a 14 times 10 to the minus nine.

306
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,390
Call it 1.4 times 10 to the minus
eight a to the half power that,

307
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:06,690
uh,

308
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:08,460
something like 1.2,

309
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:09,390
let's call it one,

310
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,440
one times 10 to the minus
four meters per second.

311
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,573
Or,

312
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:14,970
uh,

313
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:15,451
let's see,

314
00:11:15,451 --> 00:11:17,940
that's one 10th of a
millimeter per second.

315
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:18,660
Uh,

316
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,210
that's less than one meter per hour.

317
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,390
And that's why we don't go
into orbit around each other.

318
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,470
Okay?

319
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:30,870
Because you're always moving way,

320
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:31,141
way,

321
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:34,590
way faster than the escape velocity
of the people you're interacting with.

322
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:35,910
Uh,

323
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:36,880
the escape philosophy,

324
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,880
your earth is 10 kilometers a second,

325
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:40,410
so you're not moving that fast,

326
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:41,640
so you're bound to the earth.

327
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,350
But,

328
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:42,720
uh,

329
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,970
when you're a hanging
around with your friends,

330
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:48,090
you're probably going faster
than one meter per hour.

331
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:48,751
Uh,

332
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:49,381
and,

333
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:49,740
uh,

334
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,990
therefore you're moving faster
than the escape velocity.

335
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:55,600
You don't feel a great effect
of the gravitational force,

336
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,080
uh,

337
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,370
of other people.

338
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,760
This is kind of an anti
Valentine's Day calculation,

339
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,180
right?

340
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,360
Because it proves that human beings
are not attracted to each other,

341
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,081
uh,

342
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:07,150
at least not by the force of gravity.

343
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,463
Uh,

344
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:11,530
and so you can do this
calculation for any given object.

345
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,510
Fine.

346
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,860
So what's a black hole?

347
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,590
Black hole has actually
a very simple definition.

348
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,990
A black hole is simply something,

349
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,340
uh,

350
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,110
in which the escape velocity is greater
than or equal to the speed of light.

351
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,130
C is the,

352
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:27,790
uh,

353
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,950
expression for the seat of speed of life.

354
00:12:29,951 --> 00:12:33,550
This is three times 10 to
the eight meters per second.

355
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,260
Uh,

356
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,360
and if you've got something where,

357
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:38,050
uh,

358
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,090
the escape philosophy is
great in the speed of light,

359
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,500
that's what a black hole is,

360
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:42,940
and it makes a certain amount of sense.

361
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,550
If the escape velocity is
greater than the speed of light,

362
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,760
then a light won't escape this object.

363
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:50,020
So you won't be able to see it,

364
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,381
right?

365
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:53,650
Because the way you see something is
you see the photons that come off it.

366
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,023
Uh,

367
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,130
and there's nothing
particularly extraordinary
about this as far as it goes.

368
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,880
Uh,

369
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,713
in fact,

370
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,020
uh,

371
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,030
in the middle of this was already,

372
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,893
uh,

373
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:09,040
talked about and worked out in some detail
in the middle of the 18th century by

374
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,570
an otherwise obscure,

375
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,031
uh,

376
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:13,390
English clergyman named
I think John Mitchell.

377
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,231
And,

378
00:13:14,231 --> 00:13:15,040
uh,

379
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,510
he did the following calculation.

380
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:17,290
He said,

381
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:17,800
okay,

382
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,240
now,

383
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,073
uh,

384
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,440
if this is going to be true,

385
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:22,390
how big is such an object?

386
00:13:22,391 --> 00:13:24,010
How dance doesn't have to be,

387
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,390
and you can work this out.

388
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:25,870
Uh,

389
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,470
supposing the v the escape philosophy
is equal to the speed of light.

390
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:34,590
So C is equal to two g m
over r to the one half power.

391
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:35,531
Uh,

392
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:40,531
you can square both sides and regroup and
you have R is equal to two g m oversee

393
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:42,544
square.

394
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,350
This is now,

395
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,000
it wasn't called this in the 18th century,

396
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:48,130
but it's now called the
Schwartz Shield radius.

397
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,320
[inaudible]

398
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,060
was a contemporary of Einstein's.

399
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,083
Uh,

400
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,741
and,

401
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:56,140
uh,

402
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:01,140
this is the size something has to be in
order for it to escape velocity to be

403
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,160
equal to the speed of light.

404
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,550
And a black hole in another definition
of a black hole is something in which the

405
00:14:11,021 --> 00:14:14,860
radius of the object is less
than the Schwarzman radius.

406
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,330
Because if the radius is less,

407
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,180
then the escape velocity
will be even greater.

408
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,330
So as I say,

409
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,740
this was worked out in obscurity in the
middle of the 18th century and nobody

410
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:28,000
thought anything much about it.

411
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:31,060
Mitchell sort of pondered for a little
bit what touch an object would look like.

412
00:14:31,061 --> 00:14:32,500
And he decided it would look dark,

413
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,431
uh,

414
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:33,851
and,

415
00:14:33,851 --> 00:14:34,190
and,

416
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:35,110
and true enough,

417
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,590
uh,

418
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,460
but who cares?

419
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,300
Uh,

420
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:37,931
and,

421
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:38,170
uh,

422
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,670
nobody thought anything further
about it for 150 years until,

423
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:43,480
uh,

424
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,080
Einstein came along at the
start of the 20th century and,

425
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,243
uh,

426
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,740
came up with the theory of relativity
and one the pieces important pieces of,

427
00:14:52,741 --> 00:14:54,860
of relativity is that the speed of light,

428
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,480
this c is a very,

429
00:14:56,481 --> 00:15:01,481
very special velocity and has a
rather bizarre and extremely profound

430
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:02,774
properties.

431
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,300
And it was only at that point that,

432
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:05,720
uh,

433
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:10,370
the concept of the black
hole was recognized as
something that was in any way

434
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:11,420
out of the ordinary.

435
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,260
Uh,

436
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:12,830
and,

437
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,460
uh,

438
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:13,731
uh,

439
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:15,170
so for 150 years,

440
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:17,000
this idea kind of lay dormant,

441
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:17,530
uh,

442
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,860
until it was resurrected by a profound
change in the thinking about the

443
00:15:21,861 --> 00:15:22,970
underlying physics.

444
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,420
Uh,

445
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,840
so this is one of these
kinds of historical fables
that we've hit a couple of

446
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:27,081
times.

447
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:28,820
This is the fable of,

448
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,460
uh,

449
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,293
Mitchell's,

450
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,633
uh,

451
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,410
uh,

452
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,610
discovery

453
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,180
of black holes.

454
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:40,800
Yeah.

455
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,460
And,

456
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,760
uh,

457
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:46,760
the moral of this little fable might be
that the importance of a result changes

458
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,110
depending on the context.

459
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,380
Oh,

460
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,213
result

461
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,893
changes.

462
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:55,910
Yeah.

463
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,290
Sometimes dramatically,

464
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,071
uh,

465
00:15:58,071 --> 00:15:59,840
with context.

466
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:03,680
So something that looks quite
unimportant for a long time,

467
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,780
all of a sudden become a very big deal.

468
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,711
Uh,

469
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:08,330
and so it happened in this case.

470
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:09,801
Okay.

471
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:10,634
So how,

472
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,110
one question you can ask is,

473
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:12,500
uh,

474
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,400
that's all fine.

475
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:16,180
How big is the Schwab chilled radius for,

476
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,690
for some bunch of objects?

477
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:18,800
Let's try the sun.

478
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,960
Uh,

479
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,180
here,

480
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,800
let me start a new piece of paper.

481
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,770
So how

482
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,460
big is the Schwab trilled
radius of the sun?

483
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,853
Uh,

484
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,460
swatch of radius again,

485
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:40,580
two g m oversee squared equal two times
seven times 10 to the minus 11 mass of

486
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:43,081
the Sun.

487
00:16:43,081 --> 00:16:47,370
Now two times 10 to the
30 divided by c squared,

488
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:49,170
C is three times 10 to the eight.

489
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,190
Okay.

490
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,190
And we'll square it.

491
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:52,890
Okay,

492
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,723
so let's see.

493
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,133
Uh,

494
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:59,020
two times two is four times seven is 30,

495
00:16:59,500 --> 00:16:59,980
uh,

496
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,980
30 times 10 to the 1930 minus 11 is
19 divided by three times three is 10.

497
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,500
Uh,

498
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,840
10 to the eight squared is 10 to the 16.

499
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,560
So that's three times 10 to the
three because 19 minus 16 is three.

500
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,730
Oh in meters because
we're still in mks units.

501
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,990
Cause that's what we're,

502
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,740
uh,

503
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,550
using.

504
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:25,760
Uh,

505
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,940
that's the units of that
we've chosen great times,

506
00:17:28,941 --> 00:17:29,930
10 to the three meters,

507
00:17:29,931 --> 00:17:31,580
that's three kilometers.

508
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,890
That's a pretty small for the sun.

509
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,301
Uh,

510
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:37,370
and so you might imagine that,

511
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:37,740
uh,

512
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,180
uh,

513
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,270
such objects are,

514
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:44,120
are rare or perhaps even nonexistent
because it would have to be incredibly

515
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:49,121
small and therefore incredibly dense to
have a strong enough gravitational field

516
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,180
to prevent light from escaping.

517
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:51,990
Uh,

518
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,420
and so,

519
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,681
uh,

520
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:58,800
you might've thought that this is
an entirely theoretical concept,

521
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:00,600
and that no matter how interesting it is,

522
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,150
a,

523
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,500
there's no point in really studying and
get further because you're unlikely to

524
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:06,600
ever encounter one of
these things in real life.

525
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,320
Uh,

526
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,180
but one of the strange things that was,

527
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:09,730
uh,

528
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,040
has been known for quite some time is
that black holes really should exist,

529
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,670
uh,

530
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,820
and that they are predicted to exist.

531
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,110
And this has been known for quite a
while known for at least 70 years,

532
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,150
70 years,

533
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:27,921
uh,

534
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:29,060
that black holes

535
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,530
should exist.

536
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,010
Okay.

537
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,620
And the reason they
should is that they are,

538
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,220
uh,

539
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,300
one of the possible end
points of stellar evolution,

540
00:18:42,301 --> 00:18:43,650
the evolution of stars.

541
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,590
And so now I want to
summarize how stars evolve.

542
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,940
I should say this is the
subject of a whole courses.

543
00:18:58,941 --> 00:19:00,980
You can take a astro,

544
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:01,490
uh,

545
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,570
three 50,

546
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,570
and they will talk about
this for the entire semester.

547
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:05,870
Uh,

548
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:09,080
you can take astro one 10 and
they'll talk about it for a month.

549
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,591
Uh,

550
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:11,300
but we're going to do
it in about 20 minutes.

551
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,170
Uh,

552
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,270
say save you time and effort here.

553
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,200
Uh,

554
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,770
so,

555
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:16,603
uh,

556
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:16,731
uh,

557
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:21,680
Star's life is determined by the
competition between two forces.

558
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:22,311
Uh,

559
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:26,570
so stars a lifetime and evolution,

560
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:28,611
uh,

561
00:19:28,611 --> 00:19:29,510
is determined

562
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,240
by two forces.

563
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,340
One is gravity,

564
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,250
which has the tendency to
hold the star together.

565
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,120
Uh,

566
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,890
and now the thing about gravity is,

567
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:41,670
uh,

568
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:42,600
it ought to work.

569
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:42,901
Uh,

570
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:44,820
the stars have no solid surface.

571
00:19:44,821 --> 00:19:49,821
So if you can imagine gravity pulling
on an atom on the surface of the star,

572
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:53,490
why should that Adam just fall all the
way down to the bottom of the star,

573
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,090
uh,

574
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,940
because there is no solid surface
to prevent it from doing so.

575
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,350
Uh,

576
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,510
and the answer is that gravity
isn't the only force operating.

577
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:01,530
There's also pressure.

578
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,360
So there's gravity,

579
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:04,871
uh,

580
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:08,470
which pulls stuff in and pressure,

581
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,300
which has the tendency to push out and
these things balance in most stars in the

582
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:16,870
sun for example,

583
00:20:16,871 --> 00:20:20,860
these two forces are in balance
at all points in the sun.

584
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,190
And this balance goes
by the technical name,

585
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,440
a hydro static equilibrium.

586
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,523
Okay.

587
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,431
Uh,

588
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:33,170
hydro because it's a fluid,

589
00:20:33,171 --> 00:20:34,790
it's not a solid surface static,

590
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:35,541
nothing's moving.

591
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:37,730
And equilibrium is just balance.

592
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,060
And to be a little more
precise the way this works,

593
00:20:41,061 --> 00:20:41,571
here's the,

594
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:43,400
here's the surface of some star.

595
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,000
Uh,

596
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,400
here's some point within the star and
there are two kinds forces acting on this

597
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:48,750
point.

598
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:52,870
There's a gravity which is pulling the
thing toward the center of the star.

599
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,540
And then there's pressure forces,

600
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,110
uh,

601
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,490
in two different ways.

602
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:57,820
Uh,

603
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,660
the outer regions of the
star exert a pressure inward.

604
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:06,880
So there's an inward pressure and the
inner regions of the star exerted pressure

605
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,773
outward.

606
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:08,980
Uh,

607
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,700
and,

608
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:09,941
uh,

609
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:14,170
the outward pressure has to be greater
than the inward pressure by exactly the

610
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:15,760
right amount to counteract gravity.

611
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
So it basically looks like pee
out minus P N is equal to gravity.

612
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,870
And this holds true at all points.

613
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,460
Now in order,

614
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,443
uh,

615
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,310
it's the other way round.

616
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:31,144
Right?

617
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,193
Thank you.

618
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,060
P in minus p out.

619
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,713
Yeah.

620
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,410
Right.

621
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:42,410
P in minus p out has to equal gravity and
that requires that the pressure on the

622
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:48,591
inside has to be bigger than the pressure
on the outside because you don't have

623
00:21:48,811 --> 00:21:49,680
negative gravity.

624
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:50,341
Uh,

625
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:52,440
at least not until the
third part of this course.

626
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,693
Uh,

627
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,550
but at the moment you don't
have any negative gravity.

628
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,470
And so,

629
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,260
uh,

630
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,170
the pressure on the inside has to be
greater than the pressure on the outside.

631
00:22:01,171 --> 00:22:01,411
Okay.

632
00:22:01,411 --> 00:22:02,670
So what is pressure?

633
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,360
Uh,

634
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,090
cast your mind back to
high school chemistry.

635
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,770
I remember high school chemistry
doesn't matter if you don't,

636
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,540
I'll tell you everything you need to know.

637
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,310
There's something called
an ideal gas and uh,

638
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:18,810
there's something that the ideal gas does,

639
00:22:18,811 --> 00:22:20,670
which is to exert gas pressure.

640
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,150
Uh,

641
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:24,540
your high school chemistry
teacher probably wrote down
something that looks like

642
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:27,390
this Pv equals an r t.

643
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:28,823
Uh,

644
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,820
and uh,

645
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,010
here's the thing about,

646
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,930
about this vias volume.

647
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:34,764
In this case,

648
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,190
p is the pressure and is the,

649
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:38,820
uh,

650
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,860
number of particles

651
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,060
per volume.

652
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,050
And so the key thing here is that,

653
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,830
uh,

654
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,830
in divided by V is equal to the density
basically times a constant cause.

655
00:22:58,111 --> 00:22:58,920
Remember,

656
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,753
uh,

657
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,653
uh,

658
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:04,260
density is mass per volume.

659
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,470
If you take the number of particles
and you multiply by the mass,

660
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:10,280
if each particle that'll give you the
total amount of mass and he'd give him

661
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:10,890
region,

662
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,330
you divide by the volume,

663
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,860
that equals the density.

664
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,380
And so this also is a constant,

665
00:23:16,381 --> 00:23:17,400
this ar thing.

666
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,700
And so what you get is p is equal to
a constant times the density times the

667
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:27,204
temperature.

668
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:32,660
So this is how physicists think of the
ideal gas law because we prefer to work

669
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,080
in terms of the density.

670
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,820
Okay?

671
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,960
So here's,

672
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,920
here's the pressure and the pressure on
the inside had better be bigger than the

673
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:43,290
pressure on the outside or
this isn't going to balance,

674
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:48,410
which means either the density or the
temperature or both had better be larger

675
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:51,770
in the middle of the star than it
is in the outer parts of the star.

676
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,130
So inside

677
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,980
of the star,

678
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,280
the t ant or the row has to be
bigger than it is on the outside.

679
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,450
Now turns out that if you just keep the
temperature constant all the way through

680
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:15,901
the star,

681
00:24:15,901 --> 00:24:17,550
you never achieve this balance.

682
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:18,660
Uh,

683
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,890
so if only the density varies,

684
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:29,230
then you enter regions do
have a higher pressure,

685
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:32,920
okay.

686
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,570
But the increase in density also increases
the force of gravity because gravity

687
00:24:37,571 --> 00:24:39,430
is dependent on how much mass there is.

688
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,960
And if you increase the density,

689
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:42,550
you also increase the amount of mass.

690
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,361
Uh,

691
00:24:43,361 --> 00:24:44,500
so you have higher pressure,

692
00:24:44,501 --> 00:24:46,540
but you also have higher gravity.

693
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,390
And it turns out,

694
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:49,870
uh,

695
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:54,160
that you can prove
mathematically speaking that uh,

696
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,820
no balance is possible because
it's always ends up being the case,

697
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,440
uh,

698
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,850
for gas pressure,

699
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,270
that the amount you have to increase
the density by if you're only increasing

700
00:25:07,271 --> 00:25:08,104
the density,

701
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:08,620
uh,

702
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,440
will also increase the gravity
and you'll never get it balanced.

703
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:16,620
So the consequence of that is that the
inner parts of a star must be hotter

704
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,430
then the outer parts,

705
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:27,950
otherwise the star wouldn't exist.

706
00:25:27,951 --> 00:25:28,784
It would collapse.

707
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:29,931
Ma'Am.

708
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:30,764
This is true.

709
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,150
The inside of the sun

710
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,980
turns out to be something
like 10 to the seven degrees.

711
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,140
Okay.

712
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,550
The surface of the sun.

713
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,030
Yeah.

714
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,430
Uh,

715
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:45,720
turns out to be something like
six times 10 to the three degrees.

716
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:46,861
So yes,

717
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:48,990
indeed the inside very
much hotter than the sun.

718
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,190
Very much hotter than
the outside in the sun.

719
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,410
And that's what keeps the sun in balance.

720
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,470
And there's a problem with this.

721
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,610
And the problem is that there,

722
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,370
there's,

723
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:02,700
uh,

724
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,980
something called thermodynamics.

725
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,880
And one of the laws of thermodynamics is
that he tends to flow from places where

726
00:26:08,881 --> 00:26:10,980
it's hot to places where it's cool.

727
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,173
Uh,

728
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,540
this is evident in everyday life.

729
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:16,800
If you take a little piece of,

730
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:17,161
I don't know,

731
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:18,570
molten lead or something,

732
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:20,550
and you drop it in a bucket of water,

733
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,610
the heat from the led will
spread into the water.

734
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,400
The water will increase in
temperature very slightly.

735
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,460
The heat will come out
of that piece of led.

736
00:26:29,461 --> 00:26:31,890
The led will solidify and,

737
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:32,280
uh,

738
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:32,580
uh,

739
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,310
everything will come into a
kind of temperature balance.

740
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,181
Similarly,

741
00:26:36,181 --> 00:26:38,070
if you put a snowball and,

742
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:38,430
uh,

743
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,300
some hot place,

744
00:26:39,301 --> 00:26:39,900
it'll melt.

745
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,500
Why?

746
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,850
Because the heat from,

747
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,300
uh,

748
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,133
from around,

749
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,450
we'll go into the snow ball.

750
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:44,980
Uh,

751
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,170
the temperatures will,

752
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:46,590
uh,

753
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,630
try and equalize each other and bell,

754
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:49,740
it'll come out even.

755
00:26:49,741 --> 00:26:50,430
So this,

756
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:50,670
uh,

757
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:54,060
law of thermodynamics is why the
snowball has no chance in hell.

758
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,313
Uh,

759
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,220
and uh,

760
00:26:56,221 --> 00:26:58,410
so this is happens in stars too,

761
00:26:58,411 --> 00:26:59,130
right?

762
00:26:59,130 --> 00:26:59,550
Uh,

763
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:04,290
so the heat in the center of the star,

764
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,283
yeah.

765
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,410
It flows out.

766
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:08,963
Yeah.

767
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,710
When it gets to the surface,

768
00:27:10,711 --> 00:27:11,544
it's radiated

769
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:14,901
at the surface.

770
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:16,340
It radiate a,

771
00:27:16,341 --> 00:27:19,910
and that's the energy that we see coming
from the star is this heat that was in

772
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:20,391
the center.

773
00:27:20,391 --> 00:27:21,470
It's gotten to the surface.

774
00:27:21,471 --> 00:27:25,070
It's now radiating away out
into the cold depths of space.

775
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,750
And that's what we see.

776
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:31,370
But that means that the temperature
in the center of the star,

777
00:27:31,371 --> 00:27:35,330
which is holding the star up decreases
and then the star wouldn't hold itself

778
00:27:35,331 --> 00:27:35,810
up.

779
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:40,810
So you require in order for the star
to hold itself out and energy source.

780
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,463
Yeah.

781
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,830
At the center of the star.

782
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,260
This does two things.

783
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,750
It replaces all that last heat.

784
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,140
Yeah.

785
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:57,441
Uh,

786
00:27:57,441 --> 00:27:58,940
and it preserves

787
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:00,540
okay.

788
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,240
The equilibrium of the star
so it doesn't collapse.

789
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,383
Yeah.

790
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:07,170
Okay.

791
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,760
So this is all pretty abstract.

792
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:09,750
Uh,

793
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:14,750
and it was known that this had to be
true before they figured out what the

794
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:16,410
energy source was.

795
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,060
It was known for,

796
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:18,690
uh,

797
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:21,990
people just sort of thinking in very
general terms about how the Sun could

798
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:22,824
exist,

799
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,570
understood that there had to be some kind
of large source of energy down in the

800
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:28,650
middle of the star.

801
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:31,410
And notice it has to be
in the middle of the star.

802
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:31,981
It does.

803
00:28:31,981 --> 00:28:35,940
No good for the energy to be created
all the way through the star because if

804
00:28:35,941 --> 00:28:37,590
it's created all the way through the star,

805
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,310
uh,

806
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,850
then,

807
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,091
uh,

808
00:28:39,091 --> 00:28:42,900
the temperature is distributed throughout
the star and you don't get a situation

809
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:45,240
where it's much hotter in the
middle than it is on the outside.

810
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:50,420
So everybody knew for quite a while that
there was energy being created in the

811
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:51,931
center of the story.

812
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:54,150
They just didn't understand
how that was done.

813
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:54,601
Uh,

814
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:57,510
and then when people
invented nuclear physics,

815
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,021
uh,

816
00:28:58,021 --> 00:29:00,150
in the 1930s and forties and 50s,

817
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,270
it was understood that this
comes from nuclear reactions,

818
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:06,120
nuclear fusion in particular,

819
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,680
in the case of the sun,

820
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:12,890
it's the fusion of hydrogen atoms
together to make helium that does this and

821
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:14,780
that releases energy.

822
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:17,580
And the same way that a nuclear bomb does,

823
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:26,110
the problem with this is that eventually
you run out of hydrogen or whatever

824
00:29:26,121 --> 00:29:30,140
your nuclear fuel is because you've got
only a limited amount of it in any one

825
00:29:30,141 --> 00:29:30,830
star.

826
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,180
So eventually

827
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,190
the nuclear fuel runs out

828
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,980
and then the star has

829
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,060
many adventures,

830
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,440
uh,

831
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,760
before it settles down.

832
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,420
And,

833
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:46,660
uh,

834
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,231
for these,

835
00:29:47,231 --> 00:29:51,130
I will have to refer you either to a
textbook or to some other course because

836
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,960
I'm not going to take
you through the whole,

837
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,973
uh,

838
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,790
uh,

839
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:58,090
exciting life of a star wants
its nuclear fuel is exhausted.

840
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,100
Suffice it to say that you know,

841
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:04,090
in advance what the outcome has to be
because there's no way it can hold itself

842
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:08,020
up in the long run because it doesn't
have an energy source down at the center

843
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:08,854
of the star.

844
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:09,903
Uh,

845
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:10,720
so,

846
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,110
uh,

847
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,990
the consequence of this has
to be that the star collapses.

848
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,310
Okay?

849
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:17,940
Now,

850
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:22,940
it doesn't necessarily collapse all the
way down to being a black hole because

851
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,280
there are other kinds of pressure besides
the pressure exerted by an ideal gas.

852
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,920
So at very high densities,

853
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,413
okay?

854
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,580
You get other kinds of pressure.

855
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,303
Okay.

856
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,300
In particular,

857
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:44,360
there's some king called a electron,

858
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:45,240
okay?

859
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,800
Degeneracy pressure

860
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:53,740
is sometimes called fair me pressure
after the guy who thought it up,

861
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:56,630
okay?

862
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:00,500
Degeneracy is another one of those words
that means something different to a

863
00:31:00,501 --> 00:31:02,240
physicist than they do to ordinary,

864
00:31:02,241 --> 00:31:03,080
normal people.

865
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:03,741
Uh,

866
00:31:03,741 --> 00:31:08,480
so I remember the first
time I taught astro one 10,

867
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,390
uh,

868
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:09,530
uh,

869
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,430
right after,

870
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:10,890
uh,

871
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,800
I came here about 15 years ago.

872
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,370
I started talking in the middle of a
class about degenerate white dwarfs.

873
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:19,850
And you could feel this sort of wave of,

874
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,690
uh,

875
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,440
something between confusion and,

876
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:22,941
and,

877
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:23,271
and,

878
00:31:23,271 --> 00:31:25,880
and anxiety permeate through the class.

879
00:31:25,881 --> 00:31:27,230
And I had no idea what was going on.

880
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,720
Some teaching assistant had
to pull me aside afterwards.

881
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,670
Remind me that these words
mean different things.

882
00:31:31,671 --> 00:31:34,430
So I apologize if this sounds like a,

883
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:37,250
a sort of adult version
of a Grimms fairy tale,

884
00:31:37,251 --> 00:31:37,551
you know,

885
00:31:37,551 --> 00:31:38,900
with degenerate white dwarfs,

886
00:31:38,901 --> 00:31:40,070
wandering around and stuff,

887
00:31:40,071 --> 00:31:43,100
but such or such are the
words we have to work with.

888
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,270
Uh,

889
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:44,990
okay.

890
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:49,070
So you have this electron degeneracy
pressure that's a different kind of

891
00:31:49,071 --> 00:31:53,810
pressure and that can stabilize
the star so it stabilizes a star,

892
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,600
stabilizes the store at,

893
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:02,050
around the radius of the earth.

894
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,350
So that very high density material,

895
00:32:06,351 --> 00:32:07,970
we can calculate the density.

896
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:12,020
You'll remember our equation
for density mass over volume.

897
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:12,800
Uh,

898
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,640
and so let's see,

899
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:14,480
how does this work?

900
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,090
Uh,

901
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,240
this will be the mass of the sun.

902
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,820
Let's say divided by
the volume of the earth,

903
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,230
that's four thirds.

904
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:26,231
Pi r cubed radius severest
seven times 10 to the six cubed.

905
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:27,800
Uh,

906
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,633
so let's see,

907
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,210
uh,

908
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:32,210
two times 10 to the 30th over,

909
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:33,050
uh,

910
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:33,883
four,

911
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,780
seven cube seven squared
is 57 cubed is 350,

912
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,340
um,

913
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,150
times 10 to the 18 at six times three.

914
00:32:46,151 --> 00:32:46,390
Yeah.

915
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:46,691
Okay.

916
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:47,524
We're doing all right.

917
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,550
Uh,

918
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:53,550
and let's say that that's
2000 times 10 to the 27 over,

919
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,143
I dunno,

920
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:00,450
1400 times 10 to the 18
went to cancel those,

921
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:01,990
uh,

922
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:05,560
10 to the nine kilograms
per meter squared.

923
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,380
That's about a million
times denser than water

924
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,491
watering.

925
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:17,020
Your members tend to the three
kilograms per meter square

926
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,830
than water.

927
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,220
Water,

928
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,720
uh,

929
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:26,320
is defined to have a density of
one gram per cubic centimeter.

930
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,440
So if you were to pick up one gram of
this white dwarf of one cubic centimeter

931
00:33:31,871 --> 00:33:32,651
of just white dwarf,

932
00:33:32,651 --> 00:33:35,650
it would be a million times
more massive than a gram.

933
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,730
That's about a ton.

934
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,680
So a thimble full of this stuff,

935
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,371
uh,

936
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:40,360
weighs about a ton,

937
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:41,733
very dense,

938
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:42,460
uh,

939
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:47,460
and the sun will end its life as a
white dwarf with the select pressure,

940
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,330
uh,

941
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,100
balancing the gravity

942
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,820
and these such stars
are called white dwarfs

943
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,270
and there are many of them known

944
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:01,221
like dwarfs.

945
00:34:01,221 --> 00:34:02,840
This is the end point of the sun.

946
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,643
Okay.

947
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,620
And then in the 1930s,

948
00:34:08,621 --> 00:34:09,460
what happened,

949
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,001
uh,

950
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:12,310
to make black holes inevitable,

951
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,000
uh,

952
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,870
was that,

953
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:14,141
uh,

954
00:34:14,141 --> 00:34:17,320
one of the Great Theoretical
astrophysicist of the 20th century,

955
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,930
a man named Subramanian Chandra Sacar,

956
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,410
uh,

957
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:25,060
discovered that electron degeneracy
pressure doesn't always do the job.

958
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,740
So in the 1930s,

959
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,720
a chanter sacar

960
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,230
discovers,

961
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,490
proves,

962
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,750
uh,

963
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:39,750
that if the mass of an object is greater
than 1.4 times the mass of the sun,

964
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:41,443
uh,

965
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,610
electron,

966
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,680
this kind of electron
pressure is insufficient

967
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,060
and the star continues to collapse.

968
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:54,070
Now,

969
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:54,430
uh,

970
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:57,400
Chandra was a graduate student
in England at the time.

971
00:34:57,401 --> 00:35:01,450
He figured this out and he presented
this rather dramatic result at a big

972
00:35:01,451 --> 00:35:04,000
meeting of the Royal
Astronomical Society in London.

973
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:04,960
And then,

974
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,230
uh,

975
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,870
every graduate student's
worst nightmare took place.

976
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:08,740
Uh,

977
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:13,180
Chandra's thesis advisor was a very
famous man named Arthur Eddington,

978
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:16,510
one of the great physicists
of the early 20th century.

979
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:20,020
And after Chandra had presented
his results to all these,

980
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:20,400
uh,

981
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,530
assembled scientific dignitaries,

982
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,200
Addington got up and denounced
his own student and said,

983
00:35:26,201 --> 00:35:27,580
this can't possibly be true.

984
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,160
And Addington made the famous remark,

985
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,200
there ought to be a law of
nature to prevent stars from
behaving in this foolish

986
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:36,034
manner.

987
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:36,953
Uh,

988
00:35:37,350 --> 00:35:38,190
and uh,

989
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:42,900
and the consequence of that is that
a lot of people didn't follow up on

990
00:35:42,901 --> 00:35:44,280
Chandra's a idea.

991
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,790
Chandra got miffed,

992
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,040
as you might understand,

993
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,450
he got on the boat to the,

994
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:48,840
uh,

995
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,860
to the United States.

996
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:53,400
He spent the rest of his career at
the University of Chicago on the boat.

997
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:58,380
He wrote a great textbook still in use
on the structure of stars in which you

998
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:02,040
laid out in detail all of the
arguments that the chapter sake,

999
00:36:02,041 --> 00:36:03,720
our limit must actually exist.

1000
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,700
And,

1001
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,310
uh,

1002
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,470
50 years later he got
the Nobel prize for it,

1003
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:10,020
but that there was this
kind of time lag there.

1004
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:10,651
Uh,

1005
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:12,210
and it is I think,

1006
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:17,211
important for those of us say on the
faculty to recall that if Eddington had

1007
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:20,640
listened to his student
instead of to his intuition,

1008
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:21,001
uh,

1009
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:24,480
the study of black holes would probably
be 40 years more advanced than it is.

1010
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,410
So,

1011
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:25,651
uh,

1012
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,450
another fable for our times,

1013
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:28,883
uh,

1014
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,970
Chandra was always very
gracious about this actually.

1015
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:34,470
He would praise,

1016
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:34,891
uh,

1017
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:37,320
Addington to the skies
as a wonderful advisor.

1018
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:38,131
And then with this,

1019
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:39,210
a little asterisk,

1020
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,340
uh,

1021
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:45,340
so fable Chandra [inaudible] Chandra say
cars limit is the title and the moral

1022
00:36:45,721 --> 00:36:48,660
here is a belief your student,

1023
00:36:48,661 --> 00:36:49,710
not your intuition.

1024
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,140
Uh,

1025
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,973
and actually

1026
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:02,110
the story of Edington was
actually kind of interesting.

1027
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,700
As Eddington got older,

1028
00:37:03,701 --> 00:37:05,710
he became more and more convinced that,

1029
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,310
uh,

1030
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:06,551
you know,

1031
00:37:06,551 --> 00:37:08,290
he could guess the right answer.

1032
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:08,921
Uh,

1033
00:37:08,921 --> 00:37:11,000
and so it wasn't just
the chatter sacred limit,

1034
00:37:11,001 --> 00:37:11,681
it was other things.

1035
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:15,460
He got a little weird toward the end of
his life and he started believing his

1036
00:37:15,461 --> 00:37:15,940
intuition.

1037
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,110
Einstein did this too,

1038
00:37:17,111 --> 00:37:17,710
right?

1039
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,590
Einstein famously discovers
all this great stuff,

1040
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,250
and then the second half of his life
has completely useless scientifically

1041
00:37:24,251 --> 00:37:25,600
because he becomes convinced,

1042
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,230
uh,

1043
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,170
that his gut is telling him
that quantum mechanics is wrong.

1044
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:29,621
Uh,

1045
00:37:29,621 --> 00:37:30,670
this famous remark,

1046
00:37:30,671 --> 00:37:32,740
God does not play dice with the universe.

1047
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,160
Uh,

1048
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,600
but it turns out that isn't true.

1049
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,640
And so,

1050
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,050
uh,

1051
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:36,220
uh,

1052
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:36,461
you know,

1053
00:37:36,461 --> 00:37:38,050
there is this probabilistic,

1054
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,060
uh,

1055
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,980
nature of reality that
quantum mechanics shows.

1056
00:37:41,981 --> 00:37:46,120
And so Einstein spent the second half
of his life trying to prove that his

1057
00:37:46,121 --> 00:37:47,260
intuition was correct.

1058
00:37:47,261 --> 00:37:49,060
The quantum mechanics
couldn't really be true,

1059
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,960
and thus did no physics worth
doing for about 30 or 40 years.

1060
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:53,350
Uh,

1061
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,670
so you have to watch out for this.

1062
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:56,860
If you're too smart and
start believing yourself,

1063
00:37:56,861 --> 00:37:57,910
you can get into trouble.

1064
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,030
Um,

1065
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,863
all right.

1066
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,240
Uh,

1067
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,410
now having to settle that
Eddington was partly right.

1068
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:10,570
There is sort of a law of nature that
prevents stars from behaving in this

1069
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:11,404
foolish manner.

1070
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:11,831
Uh,

1071
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,161
so,

1072
00:38:12,161 --> 00:38:12,620
uh,

1073
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,160
to understand that what
happens when white dwarfs,

1074
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:15,910
uh,

1075
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:18,400
when the white dwarf collapses,

1076
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,650
it's got to get rid of its electrons.

1077
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,280
Because the problem is the way this
electron degeneracy pressure works.

1078
00:38:26,281 --> 00:38:29,040
You can't squeeze electrons
any closer together.

1079
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:29,580
Uh,

1080
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,200
then they are a white dwarf.

1081
00:38:31,201 --> 00:38:32,790
So now you have to get rid of electrons.

1082
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:33,690
And so what are you do?

1083
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,590
You combine the electrons and the protons
and you turn them into neutrons plus

1084
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:39,430
neutrinos.

1085
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,830
These are neutrinos.

1086
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,950
They stream out.

1087
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,900
And so,

1088
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,350
uh,

1089
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:48,670
you end up with something that's
made entirely out of neutrons,

1090
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,860
saw the whole star,

1091
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:52,120
uh,

1092
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,380
turns into neutrons.

1093
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,243
Uh,

1094
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,400
a chemist would think of
this as essentially turning
the whole star into one

1095
00:39:03,651 --> 00:39:08,651
Adam into one atomic nucleus and atomic
nucleus with no PR on a Tom and Adam

1096
00:39:09,051 --> 00:39:10,160
with no protons,

1097
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,360
no electrons,

1098
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,430
and tend to the 57 neutrons.

1099
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,451
And you could imagine,

1100
00:39:14,451 --> 00:39:14,661
you know,

1101
00:39:14,661 --> 00:39:16,610
putting that somewhere
on the periodic table,

1102
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,570
uh,

1103
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,060
astronomers call these
things neutron stars,

1104
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,240
and they exist.

1105
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,280
They were discovered in the 1960s.

1106
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:30,950
Okay.

1107
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,840
And a typical neutron star,

1108
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:34,520
a couple times the mass of the sun,

1109
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,683
uh,

1110
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:36,913
has,

1111
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,000
uh,

1112
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,260
mass equals two times the mass of the
sun radius of about 10 kilometers.

1113
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,700
And you can work out the density for
that density is a billion times greater.

1114
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:50,330
I'll leave this as an exercise,

1115
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,290
uh,

1116
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,240
greater than for white dwarfs.

1117
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,290
So instead of a cubic centimeter
of the stuff weighing a ton,

1118
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:06,380
it now weighs a billion tons a and you're
having a tough time moving it around,

1119
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:13,360
but 10 kilometers that getting close
to their Schwab chilled radius.

1120
00:40:13,741 --> 00:40:16,280
Remember we calculated the
truck showed radius of the sun.

1121
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,880
It was about three kilometers.

1122
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:18,841
And in fact,

1123
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:20,140
if you calculate a,

1124
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:25,190
the shark shield radius of a star in
terms of the Schwartz Shield radius of the

1125
00:40:25,561 --> 00:40:26,394
sun,

1126
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,090
uh,

1127
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:27,481
let's see,

1128
00:40:27,481 --> 00:40:32,481
you get to g m oversee squared where m
is the mass of the star divided by two g

1129
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,680
mass of the sun oversee squared.

1130
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:38,341
Uh,

1131
00:40:38,341 --> 00:40:43,341
so the g's and the C's all cancel
here and you get m star over m son.

1132
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:46,523
So

1133
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,270
if the chanter sake,

1134
00:40:51,271 --> 00:40:54,060
our mass of the sun is
equal to three kilometers.

1135
00:40:54,061 --> 00:40:55,110
As we calculated,

1136
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,280
uh,

1137
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,850
the,

1138
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,240
uh,

1139
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,240
Schwab chilled radius of a star with
whose mass happens to equal three times,

1140
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:07,020
the mass of the sun is going to be three
times 10 kilometers or 10 kilometers

1141
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,640
that equal to the radius
of a neutron star.

1142
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,420
So a neutron star

1143
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:25,550
with mass greater than three times the
mass of the sun has a radius less than at

1144
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:27,720
Schwab children.

1145
00:41:27,721 --> 00:41:28,554
Yes.

1146
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,260
And that's a black hole.

1147
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,653
I remember,

1148
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,290
uh,

1149
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,370
and uh,

1150
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:40,030
the thi the key thing here is that there
are lots of stars with mass more than

1151
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:41,840
three times the mass of the sun.

1152
00:41:41,841 --> 00:41:44,450
We don't see them as black holes
because they're still in hydrostatic

1153
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,313
equilibrium,

1154
00:41:45,410 --> 00:41:48,890
but eventually they're going to run out
of nuclear fuel and they're going to

1155
00:41:48,891 --> 00:41:49,640
collapse.

1156
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:49,911
Now,

1157
00:41:49,911 --> 00:41:50,744
in fact,

1158
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,240
during the course of,

1159
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,630
of the star's life,

1160
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:56,870
one of the things I glossed over
is stars tend to lose masses.

1161
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,610
They live,

1162
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:57,780
uh,

1163
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,980
and so they don't end up with
the same mass they started with,

1164
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,040
but stars with initial masses at
the beginning of their lifetime,

1165
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:09,040
a greater than,

1166
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:09,230
Oh,

1167
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:09,590
I dunno,

1168
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:12,770
something like 30 times
the mass of this done son.

1169
00:42:12,771 --> 00:42:17,771
We'll end up with masses greater
than three times the mass of the sun.

1170
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,860
And then there's nothing
to stop their collapse.

1171
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,180
What happens is they
turn into neutron stars,

1172
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,830
but they turn into neutron stars,

1173
00:42:27,831 --> 00:42:29,060
whose truck showed radius,

1174
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:29,861
who's ready.

1175
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:31,610
I are smaller than the
Schwab showed radius.

1176
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:32,650
And that,

1177
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,340
uh,

1178
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:33,740
uh,

1179
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,640
is a black hole,

1180
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:36,560
so they collapsed down into black holes.

1181
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:43,870
And so you expect a large number
of black holes to actually exist.

1182
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:48,680
This is what happens to massive
stars at the end of their life.

1183
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:49,760
Uh,

1184
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,630
and so,

1185
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:51,950
uh,

1186
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,090
we expect

1187
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,580
there to be that there are,

1188
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,500
okay.

1189
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,333
Manny

1190
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,753
black holes.

1191
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,060
Okay.

1192
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:13,060
And so the question we'll be exploring
in the rest of this segment of the class

1193
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,800
is how can you find these things,

1194
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,173
uh,

1195
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,200
what are the properties of these things
from a theoretical point of view,

1196
00:43:21,201 --> 00:43:25,040
what does Einstein's theory of relativity
suggests that these things are going

1197
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:25,874
to behave like?

1198
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:26,900
And then the,

1199
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:27,980
the big question is,

1200
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,240
once you found some,

1201
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:31,280
and you have a theory for
what they behave like,

1202
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,780
then you can ask the question,

1203
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:36,680
does the actual behavior of these
objects that conform to the theoretical

1204
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:37,640
expectations?

1205
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,410
Another way of saying that is,

1206
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,550
was Einstein,

1207
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,300
right?

1208
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:46,300
Is General relativity the correct theory
to describe these very exotic objects.

1209
00:43:46,551 --> 00:43:51,140
And so that's what we'll be talking
about in the rest of this section of the

1210
00:43:51,141 --> 00:43:51,890
courts.

1211
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:52,370
Now,

1212
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:54,650
let me turn back to the
previous section of the course,

1213
00:43:54,651 --> 00:43:55,370
which was,

1214
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:55,820
uh,

1215
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,520
which culminated last
time in this little test.

1216
00:43:58,850 --> 00:43:59,450
Uh,

1217
00:43:59,450 --> 00:43:59,991
and,

1218
00:43:59,991 --> 00:44:00,290
uh,

1219
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,820
I think we're ready to hand these back.

1220
00:44:01,821 --> 00:44:02,360
Is that true?
