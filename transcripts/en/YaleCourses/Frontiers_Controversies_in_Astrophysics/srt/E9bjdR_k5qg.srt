1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,340
We've been talking about the
expansion of the universe. Uh, and,

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,900
uh, in answer, I want to
follow up on something I said,

3
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:14,580
kind of an answer to a question last time,
which is,

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,510
uh,

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,510
that it turns out that the expansion of
the universe alone doesn't require you

6
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:23,430
to have a big bang.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,950
There's other explanations or in
particular one other class of explanation,

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,600
uh, which is compatible with the
observation of the expanding universe,

9
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,400
but doesn't exactly,
uh,

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,820
lead to a big bang in the sense
that we think of it today.

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,710
And so I want to talk about these
alternatives. Uh, this is, uh,

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,160
frontiers and controversies as of 1950,

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,630
uh,
in 1920,

14
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:59,130
you'll recall they were worried about
whether the spiral nebulae where island

15
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:01,350
galaxies of their own or not,

16
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,630
that was settled by hobbles
observation in the 1950s. Uh,

17
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,200
it had become clear that it really is
true that the universe is expanding. Uh,

18
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,230
but there were two categories of
explanation that were being put forward,

19
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,980
uh, to explain that and, uh, deciding
which is, which was the current,

20
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:24,660
a big topic of the day. So,
uh, the universe expand.

21
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:33,840
And what do we make of this
fact? Well, one option is, uh,

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,250
the big bang,
what we now call the Big Bang,

23
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,290
which as I've mentioned,

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,240
implies that in the past everything
was closer together, was denser.

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,710
Uh, and that creates other
changes. If things get denser,

26
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:52,290
they also get hotter.
And you may remember from chemistry.

27
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,260
So this implies in the past,
uh,

28
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,430
things were different from how
they are now. They were denser,

29
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,620
hotter,
uh,

30
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,090
uh, and, uh, that in the future, uh,

31
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,150
it'll go the other way.
Uh,

32
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,600
things will become sparser and cooler.

33
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,690
Uh, and there may be other
changes associated with this. Uh,

34
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,630
there may be different kinds of galaxies
in the past from now and then and

35
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:27,310
different kinds of galaxies now as
compared to the future and so forth.

36
00:02:27,311 --> 00:02:28,940
If the universe,
uh,

37
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:33,260
is a place whose bulk
properties can change in time.

38
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,510
So things change,

39
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,130
uh,
in time.

40
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,080
And the implication is that you can
extrapolate this back to an initial

41
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,380
singularity, that there was a moment
at some point in the past where,

42
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,430
uh, all a currently existing space
was piled up in a single point.

43
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,430
This is the way I talked about this
last time was that the scale factor was

44
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:04,930
equal to zero.
And so there is this implication of,

45
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,470
uh,
an initial singularity.

46
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,490
Now this is not the initial singularity
is not the kind of thing that can be

47
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:19,090
verified scientifically because all the
physical laws break down the same way

48
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:20,860
they do in the singularity,

49
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,610
inside a black hole or at an event
horizon or something like that. Uh,

50
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:26,440
but nevertheless,
that's the implication.

51
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:30,130
That's the extrapolation
of this set of ideas.

52
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,150
But, uh, at least at the time,

53
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:38,440
that was not the only set of ideas
that could explain this expansion.

54
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,300
There was an alternative which
was described as the steady state.

55
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,650
I should say that both of these names
were given to these ideas by people who

56
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:55,630
supported the steady state.
Uh, Big Bang, uh, was, uh, uh,

57
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,050
that phrase was used as an insult by
this steady state people to make fun of,

58
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,440
uh, the ideas of the big bang, which
we now actually know to be correct.

59
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,330
And that's why that particular
phrase, uh, is in a way so misleading,

60
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,310
uh, that they were deliberately
trying to a obscure and, uh, uh,

61
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,020
insult some of the ideas in the
big bang from time to time. Uh,

62
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:25,021
astronomical organizations in popular
magazines run contests to rename the great

63
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:29,050
theory and come up with some better name
that won't give you in your mind the

64
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:33,720
impression of an explosion coming out
from some central point. Uh, and, uh,

65
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,870
people send in suggestions and
it never gets anywhere. Uh,

66
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,520
we're stuck with the big bang.
Uh,

67
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,430
but it is good to remember that it was
named by its opponents who supported this

68
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:45,610
steady state. So how would
this work? Uh, the idea,

69
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:49,100
the central idea here is that new,
uh,

70
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,010
the university sticks expands,

71
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:55,960
but then new matter and energy is created,

72
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,520
uh, to, uh, fill in the void,

73
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,580
the void as the universe expands. So sure,
all galaxies are moving away from us,

74
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,970
but new galaxies are being created
where the old galaxies used to be.

75
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,180
And the consequences of that is
that the past and the future both,

76
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,070
uh, have a similar bulk
characteristics. The density,

77
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,750
the overall density is the
same. Uh, and other, uh,

78
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,520
characteristics are the same

79
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,930
because as things move further away,

80
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:36,730
you simply replace them with other
things like them. And so, uh, you know,

81
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,760
you have to kind of invent a sub
way of creating matter and energy,

82
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,270
uh, but that's not nearly as bad
as creating a whole universe,

83
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:51,210
which is what you have to do, uh, in the
case of the, uh, uh, of the big banks.

84
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:54,690
So, uh, in this case, the past
and the future are the same. The,

85
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,760
it also implies that the universe is
eternal in contrast to the big bang where

86
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:05,060
there's this initial moment, which
a one then instantly asks, well,

87
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:07,130
how did that happen and
what happened before it?

88
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:11,880
So we get around that this is
an eternal process. Uh, and, uh,

89
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,040
it's also infinite.

90
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,200
And so we don't have to start asking
these awkward questions about what's

91
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:22,070
outside the universe. And
so people found this, uh,

92
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,020
in some ways much more satisfying.

93
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,493
Uh,

94
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:33,110
and so there were these two
quite different explanations
of the observed fact

95
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,830
that the universe was expanding. Now,
the historians of science who, uh,

96
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,260
have studied this controversy,

97
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:45,261
some of them make the claim that which
side you ended up on in the 1950s before

98
00:06:46,591 --> 00:06:48,450
there was a lot of evidence either way,

99
00:06:48,451 --> 00:06:52,170
this was kind of a philosophical rather
than a scientific question at the time.

100
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,390
Uh, that which side you ended up
here, uh, dependent largely on,

101
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:02,100
uh,
your religious beliefs or lack thereof.

102
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,940
And they document this and a lot of the
work on the Big Bang and a lot of the

103
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:10,000
supporters of the Big Bang, uh,
we're, as I mentioned last time, uh,

104
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:12,330
Catholics in one important
case that this guy,

105
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:16,200
the metro who worked out
all the equations, wasn't in
fact a Catholic priest, uh,

106
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:20,190
also a physicist in his
spare time. Uh, and, uh,

107
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,810
this is a nice, uh, kind of idea
because from that point of view,

108
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:28,980
because it gives you this initial
moment of creation, uh, which is,

109
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,153
uh,

110
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,990
if you're a religious person and it's
relatively easy to come up with a reason

111
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:38,040
why that might've happened. Uh, on the
other hand, a lot of the scientists,

112
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:42,750
particularly in Britain where the
steady state was, uh, largely developed,

113
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,960
we're of a kind of atheistic or agnostic
turn of mine and they didn't like this

114
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:51,300
initial singularity.
And they liked the idea of an eternal,

115
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,980
infinite universe as actually
Einstein did too. Uh, because, uh,

116
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,460
uh,

117
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,020
you didn't have to have a creation event
and you didn't have to invoke the kinds

118
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:05,880
of ideas that come along
with that. Uh, and, uh,

119
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,690
uh, there's some dispute over over
how much this really matter to people.

120
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:12,360
But what was clear is in the 1950s,

121
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:17,450
this was not a question for which there
was scientific evidence either way.

122
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,730
And so what the scientific evidence
said was that the universe expanded.

123
00:08:20,731 --> 00:08:25,060
And then you could follow either of
these Arabs. Interestingly, however, uh,

124
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,320
these two hypotheses make
quite different predictions,

125
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,610
which in the end turned out to
be testable. And in particular,

126
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,450
um,
what it,

127
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,990
what it predicted if
the big bank predicts a,

128
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:44,010
it makes this very strong prediction
that the past is fundamentally different

129
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:45,384
looking,

130
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:50,100
uh, from the present. Now,

131
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,260
uh, it, over the course
of a human lifetime,

132
00:08:52,261 --> 00:08:54,290
this isn't going to make
a lot of difference. Uh,

133
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,130
the galaxies don't get that
much further away from us, uh,

134
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,930
in 20 or 30 years, but it, uh,

135
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,020
but one can actually look into the past
by looking at things that are far away.

136
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,080
This is because the speed of light
is finite. When we look at the sun,

137
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:12,060
we don't see the sun as it is right now.

138
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:15,510
We see the sun as it was eight minutes
ago when the light started to travel

139
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:18,870
toward us because the sun is eight
light minutes. It's minutes away.

140
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,150
If we look at Alpha Centaury the
nearest star other than the sun, uh,

141
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,940
if Alpha Centaury, uh, blew up or
disappeared or something right now,

142
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,750
we wouldn't know about it for four years
because it's four light years away. Uh,

143
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,480
similarly, if we look at, uh, uh, uh,

144
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:36,750
a galaxy that's 10 mega parsecs away,
a mega parse,

145
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:41,700
a parsec is three light years.
So a mega parsec is 3 million light years.

146
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,750
Uh, some galaxy that's
10, uh, that's 10 light,

147
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,320
10 makeup parsecs away.
That's 30 million light years away.

148
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,700
So we're seeing it not as it is, but
as it was 30 million years ago. Now,

149
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:57,240
it turns out that in the, in the course
of cosmic time, a few million years here,

150
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,050
here, here, here or there, it doesn't
make any difference to anybody. Uh,

151
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,700
but once you get into billions,
now you're talking cosmic time.

152
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,800
Uh, and so if you look at things that
are billions of light years away,

153
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:15,801
that turns out to be a
substantial fraction of the
age of the universe predicted

154
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:16,741
by the big bang.

155
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:20,430
We'll get back a little later in this
lecture to how you determine what the age

156
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:21,780
of the universe is supposed to be.

157
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,770
But if you go back a substantial
fraction of the age of the universe,

158
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:30,690
if you look back, uh, that,
uh, over distances that great,

159
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:35,870
then you predict that you ought to see
things that look different from the

160
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:37,140
galaxies you see today.

161
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:41,130
Because the universe at that time was
denser and hotter and the galaxies were

162
00:10:41,131 --> 00:10:45,600
younger on average. And Andrew ought to
be able to see some kinds of differences.

163
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:49,260
So the passage different from the present,
and this is observable,

164
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,490
uh,
through,

165
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,050
uh,
this concept of the lookback time,

166
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,760
uh,

167
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,380
just the fact that the
further away something is the
longer it's taken the light

168
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:07,580
to travel to you. And so you're actually
seeing things not as they are right now,

169
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,750
but as they are in the past.

170
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:13,010
And so you can imagine a great research
project where you sort of look at nearby

171
00:11:13,011 --> 00:11:16,820
galaxies to see how things are in the
current day. Then you look at really,

172
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:20,630
really distant ones, some substantial
fraction of the age of the universe ago.

173
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,160
And you ask yourself the question,

174
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,730
are those galaxies the same as
the galaxies that exist today?

175
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,630
Or are they in some sense different?
Uh, so that's a testable prediction.

176
00:11:29,631 --> 00:11:31,820
There's also a testable
prediction on this side,

177
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:37,030
which is the two ought to actually be
able to find these places where the new

178
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:41,690
matter and energy is being created
because that's a constant ongoing process.

179
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,840
It has to be cause it's got to fill
in the empty spaces left behind by the

180
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:51,590
expanded galaxies. So the prediction
over here that is that there exists,

181
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,260
uh,

182
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,520
places of matter

183
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,110
and energy creation.

184
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,920
So this is potentially testable.
And in the 1960s,

185
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:07,260
evidence was actually found that
kind of decided this question when,

186
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:10,480
which is why we now no longer
believe in this steady state.

187
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,920
And two things happened. Actually. There
were a number of things that happen. Uh,

188
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,260
but one of them was the discovery

189
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,840
of what were called quasars.
Uh,

190
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,580
these are now known to be a accreting

191
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,300
supermassive black holes,
but they didn't know that then.

192
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,970
So this is in the 1960s.

193
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,500
That's what we think they are now.
But the way it did,

194
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:45,620
no it then all they knew is that
they had discovered, uh, uh,

195
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,960
a great source of huge amounts of energy

196
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,650
and you'd think that this would
be a very good thing. Uh, uh,

197
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,560
some kind of unknown energy source would
be just the thing for the steady state

198
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:04,240
people because that's what they needed.

199
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:09,130
They needed this some kind of source of
mass energy creation and indeed that was

200
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:11,350
claimed for a little
while. These things. Uh,

201
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:15,070
the main characteristic of these things
is that they have very high red shifts,

202
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,600
which implies very large distances.

203
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,000
Uh, because uh, uh, velocity is
proportional to the distance.

204
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:29,640
That's the Hubble law. Everybody
agreed that the Hubble lovers, right?

205
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:32,330
So these things were known to
be large distances away. Uh,

206
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,460
and so if you're a steady state
person, you say, well, that's great.

207
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,310
If they're so far away,
they must be incredibly bright.

208
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,920
Otherwise we wouldn't be able to see them.
And that there's our,

209
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,180
there's our energy source that we
require a, if you're a big bank person,

210
00:13:45,181 --> 00:13:46,110
what you say is,
ah,

211
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,920
now we finally found a bunch of things
that are really far away and we can ask

212
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:50,730
the question,

213
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:55,320
are things that are that far away the
same as in the local universe or are they

214
00:13:55,321 --> 00:13:57,410
different? And what it turned out, uh,

215
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,540
one of the very first things that was
discovered is that there were many more,

216
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,950
uh,
quasars in the past.

217
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:12,200
Then there are now,
uh,

218
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:14,770
and so whatever they are
super massive black holes are,

219
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,950
or whatever hypothesis
you have for these things,

220
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,640
it turns out they're dining out.
There were more of them in the past,

221
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,930
then there are now they were brighter.
Uh,

222
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:27,931
and so here is an example of a significant
change in the composition of the

223
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:32,754
universe.

224
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,413
Yeah.

225
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,820
Uh, which is the thing that's
predicted by the big bang. And so, uh,

226
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,520
uh,

227
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,030
although initially it looked like quasars
might be helpful to the steady state

228
00:14:47,031 --> 00:14:48,770
as soon as they started
to get enough of them.

229
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:50,900
So you could do these
kinds of statistical tests.

230
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,190
It became the first really strong
evidence that the universe was changing in

231
00:14:55,191 --> 00:14:59,060
time. This was not the only thing
that was discovered in the 1960s.

232
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:03,200
Another thing is the so called
cosmic microwave background.

233
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:10,720
And we'll talk much more about
that, uh, later on right now.

234
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,150
Uh,
I just want to say that what this is,

235
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,970
is it's a radiation that was created,

236
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:24,120
uh, that was generated
when the universe was, uh,

237
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,163
when,
uh,

238
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,970
the universe was much
denser than it is now,

239
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,000
a much hotter than it is now. In fact, uh,

240
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:40,420
it comes from it's radiation
emitted by ionized hydrogen.

241
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:45,210
So this is when the whole universe
was at 10,000 degrees or so Kelvin,

242
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:45,630
uh,

243
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:50,630
obviously much hotter than
the universities right now
and much smoother all this

244
00:15:50,651 --> 00:15:55,651
hydrogen rather than being locked
up in individual stars and stars,

245
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,930
a concentrated in individual galaxies,

246
00:15:58,931 --> 00:16:03,040
all this hydrogen was very smoothly
distributed around space. Uh,

247
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:08,620
and, uh, so this came from a time,
this radiation, which you can,

248
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,870
which you can easily detect it with
radio telescopes and the like, uh,

249
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,610
comes from a time when the
universe was much denser,

250
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:20,020
hotter and smoother than it is
today. Again, in accordance with, uh,

251
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,560
uh, uh, with the prediction
of the big banks. So this is,

252
00:16:23,561 --> 00:16:26,410
this provided very strong
support for the big bag.

253
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,450
And, uh, the discoverers
of this, uh, have got,

254
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,460
there've been Nobel prizes given
out on a regular basis for, uh, uh,

255
00:16:37,461 --> 00:16:40,490
discoveries related to the cosmic
microwave background. And as I say,

256
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:44,880
we'll come back, I'll, I'll, I'll talk
about that at some length later on. Uh,

257
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,880
another thing that was discovered is
that the universe is pretty clearly,

258
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,320
uh, mostly three quarters,
hydrogen and one quarter helium,

259
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,340
just about every cosmic object you see.
Not the earth,

260
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,130
but the solar system as
a whole has that, uh, uh,

261
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,630
has those proportions and all stars
have these proportions and all galaxies

262
00:17:05,631 --> 00:17:07,790
consist of stars that
have these proportions.

263
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,090
And it turns out this could be
explained by the Big Bang, uh,

264
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,280
when it was a denser,
hotter and smoother, uh,

265
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,190
uh,
in the early universe.

266
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:20,680
Yeah,

267
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,040
it was hot enough for hydrogen fusion,

268
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,720
hydrogen fusion into helium,

269
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,030
but it didn't last very long because
the universe was expanding and cooling.

270
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,570
And you need to have very
high temperatures in order
to have hydrogen fusion.

271
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:40,410
That's why it can only happen in the
center of the sun or in an atomic bomb

272
00:17:40,411 --> 00:17:44,190
explosion or something
like that. Uh, and so, uh,

273
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:49,191
the universe for about three minutes
was hot enough for hydrogen to fuse.

274
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:54,981
And if you ask yourself what fraction of
the hydrogen feuds during the time the

275
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:57,990
universe, uh, was hot
enough for that to occur,

276
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,060
the answer turns out to be about a
quarter of it in exact agreement with the

277
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:06,990
currently observed fractions of
hydrogen and helium in the universe.

278
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,770
So this is, uh, in first three minutes,

279
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,400
there's a famous popular book from the
1980 [inaudible] called the first three

280
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:19,380
minutes, which discusses this by Steven
Weinberg, uh, in the first three minutes,

281
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,830
one quarter of hydrogen,
uh,

282
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:26,280
fuses into helium.
And afterwards,

283
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,260
no more.

284
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:30,270
Yeah.

285
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,380
Because it's too cool.

286
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,680
Yeah.

287
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,570
For these reactions to occur. So that
was another piece of evidence that,

288
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,190
uh, the, the, uh, the big bang was
the right explanation and the, uh,

289
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,070
uh, uh, steady state
was not yes. Question.

290
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,413
Sorry.

291
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,680
Uh, so, uh, if you start from time
zero when everything is put together,

292
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:56,760
after three minutes,

293
00:18:56,761 --> 00:19:00,480
the universe has cooled sufficiently
so that you can't have hydrogen fusion

294
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,710
generally then nothing, no more
nuclear reactions occur until much,

295
00:19:04,711 --> 00:19:06,180
much later when stars form.

296
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,420
And we know how fast the universe
is expanding because we, uh,

297
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,470
we can measure the Hubble
constant now, uh, and so you know,

298
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:19,970
how long it takes for the
universe to expand, uh,

299
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,850
to the point where the temperature
drops enough so that there's no general

300
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:25,020
hydrogen fusion anymore.

301
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,260
And then you do this little calculation
of how much fuses during that time.

302
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:34,580
Other questions?
Okay.

303
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:35,950
Um,

304
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,450
hmm.

305
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,740
More recently with the Hubble Space
Telescope and other other big ground based

306
00:19:40,741 --> 00:19:45,330
telescopes, uh, we've discovered, uh,

307
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:50,270
that you, you can now see galaxies
that are very far away that are, uh,

308
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:53,820
as they were a substantial
fraction of the, uh,

309
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,110
of the age of the university go.
Uh,

310
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:01,130
and by now it's clear that galaxies evolve
and that the statistical demographics

311
00:20:04,081 --> 00:20:07,980
of galaxies, how many there are, how
massive they are, how big they are,

312
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:12,930
all those kinds of things that those
statistics changed dramatically over the

313
00:20:12,931 --> 00:20:16,200
course of the universe over the course
of the amount of look back time that we

314
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:19,440
can, uh, that we can
currently observe. Uh,

315
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,220
so galaxies evolve, uh, uh,

316
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,720
very significantly.

317
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:29,730
So everything points,
uh,

318
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:34,780
toward the big bang and
away from the steady state.

319
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,153
Uh,

320
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:41,430
much to the surprise of a lot
of the scientists who felt,

321
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,670
uh, possibly correctly given
what was known in the 1950s,

322
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,210
the steady state was a
more elegant solution. Uh,

323
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:53,820
and so let's see, the fable here is, uh,

324
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,910
the demise of the steady state.

325
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,100
Okay.

326
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,160
Uh, and the moral, well, their
various morals to this. Uh,

327
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,750
but let me be provocative
and say, uh, that sometimes,

328
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,320
uh, science, uh,

329
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,410
is anti atheistic,

330
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,913
yes.
Stick,

331
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,250
not anti religious,

332
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,910
uh, because it could've come
out the other way, right? Uh,

333
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,990
it could have turned out that the steady
state was right and then you wouldn't

334
00:21:30,991 --> 00:21:34,900
have had this, uh, uh, then
you wouldn't have had this, uh,

335
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:40,260
moment of creation, uh, and, uh, uh,

336
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,810
and you wouldn't, uh, and, and, uh,

337
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:46,080
Pope John Paul the second wouldn't have
been so enthusiastic about astrophysics

338
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,340
in just the same way that it might
have turned out that human beings are

339
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:53,800
fundamentally different from all
other species of animals. Uh,

340
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,530
and if that had been true,
uh,

341
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,950
the geneticist would have discovered
that instead of what they did discover.

342
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:01,260
And so, uh, there's a feeling,

343
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:06,190
particularly in current political debates
that is somehow intrinsically anti

344
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:09,830
religious. Uh, and I think that
isn't true. It's not, it, it, it,

345
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:15,150
it isn't one way or another, it's just a
way of finding stuff out. And sometimes,

346
00:22:15,151 --> 00:22:18,700
as in this particular case,
uh, you might find out, uh,

347
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,560
that the atheist or whatever the
atheist had proposed a is wrong.

348
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,360
And that's actually what happened
in this particular case. Uh,

349
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:30,330
so the demise of the steady
state is, uh, uh, uh,

350
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:34,200
one of the big things that happened in
the latter half of the 20th century.

351
00:22:34,201 --> 00:22:38,310
And so now, uh, the
scientific evidence is very,

352
00:22:38,311 --> 00:22:42,180
very strongly in favor of the big
bang. Ah, I should define what I mean,

353
00:22:42,181 --> 00:22:44,880
I think by the Big Bang
theory because as I said,

354
00:22:44,881 --> 00:22:47,510
this is a phrase coined by its enemies.
Uh,

355
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,100
and it's one of these
phrases like black hole,

356
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:54,510
which actually doesn't have a
technical definition, uh, and, uh,

357
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:59,400
you get into trouble by people using
it in different ways. Uh, and so, uh,

358
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,270
if,
uh,

359
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:05,270
if what you mean by this is that
in the past the universe was denser

360
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,280
and hotter and smoother

361
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:18,110
cause it's, it's constantly, you
know, forming new stars and galaxies.

362
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:21,700
Everything is, is, is getting
more lumpy with time. Uh,

363
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,470
and that you can extrapolate this

364
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,260
to an initial singularity,

365
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,200
then I think,
uh,

366
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,640
then I think there's extremely strong
scientific evidence in favor of this.

367
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,060
But you have to keep your eye on this
word extrapolate because sometimes the big

368
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,150
is used,
uh,

369
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:53,330
is used to describe
this moment of initial,

370
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:58,280
uh, creation or whatever you want to
call it. There's this initial moment of,

371
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,470
uh, of infinite density
and somehow everything, uh,

372
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,610
starting to expand, there's a,
you can't observe that that's us.

373
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,850
That's one of these things that
you can't see uh, now or you know,

374
00:24:10,851 --> 00:24:14,090
with our current theories at
any point in, uh, in the future.

375
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:15,890
And so that's an extrapolation.

376
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:18,020
That's not an observation
and that's a fundamental,

377
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,090
fundamentally different things.

378
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,330
So if you use big bang to
indicate that particular moment,

379
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,330
then you can say that the
scientific evidence for the actual,

380
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,890
that actual moment isn't, uh, uh,

381
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,030
isn't strong and indeed
couldn't even exist, uh,

382
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,570
within our current current
theories because there's
all the physics breaks down

383
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:37,990
there. Uh, and so what
you mean when, what,

384
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:41,930
what I mean when I say that there's a lot
of scientific support for the Big Bang,

385
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:45,170
is there support for this idea that
the universe is changing in time?

386
00:24:45,171 --> 00:24:47,540
It was dense or hotter
and smoother in the past.

387
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,640
And then if you extrapolate this back,

388
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,800
there was an initial singularity some
number of years ago and you can actually

389
00:24:54,801 --> 00:24:59,060
figure out how many years ago that was,
which is what I'm about to do. Net.

390
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,070
Uh, and so this, uh, is now the
kind of currently accepted theory,

391
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:09,070
I should say. Uh, there are a few remnant
hold outs from the steady state type,

392
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,610
uh, who, uh, uh, annoy the
rest of us by not giving in.

393
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,120
Uh, and, uh,

394
00:25:15,121 --> 00:25:19,090
there's actually been some interesting
controversy over the years about, uh,

395
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,401
you know,

396
00:25:19,401 --> 00:25:24,401
how much telescope time do you give to
people whose proposal is to look for the

397
00:25:25,251 --> 00:25:29,080
places where mass has created
in the steady state theory, uh,

398
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:34,050
if nobody else believes that theory
anymore, uh, and, uh, uh, uh,

399
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,020
by now the answer is none. Uh, but it
took quite a while to get to that point.

400
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,233
Okay.

401
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,860
Do people lie about what they're
going to observe? Excellent.

402
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,930
That graduate students or amuse?
Uh, no. What happens is this,

403
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,340
you have to present,

404
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:58,790
so you have to write these proposals
because the telescopes are oversubscribed

405
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:02,450
and you have to come up with a
plausible thing that you're going to do.

406
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,280
Now it then it then varies how this,

407
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:11,480
how this is actually done. An operation
in the space telescope for example,

408
00:26:11,481 --> 00:26:14,360
what you have to do is then you fill
out what's called a phase two form,

409
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:17,870
which tells exactly where the space
telescope is supposed to point and for how

410
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:20,810
long. And you submit that and
they upload it and they do it.

411
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:25,990
If you deviated drastically from the
target list you gave them when they

412
00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:30,470
approved your proposal, that'll get
flagged and they won't do it. Uh,

413
00:26:30,471 --> 00:26:32,420
on the other hand,
on ground based telescopes,

414
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:36,320
you kind of go to the telescope and still
in many cases you operate it yourself

415
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:39,260
and there's not a lot of control
over where you point the thing,

416
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,090
the control then happens later.
Uh,

417
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:47,170
one of the key components of a proposal
for telescope time is what you did with

418
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:51,960
the data you got from the last amount
of telescope time they gave you.

419
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:52,801
And you know,

420
00:26:52,801 --> 00:26:55,860
you have to list all the publications
or if you haven't actually gotten around

421
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:59,530
to publishing anything, which is
usually the case with me recently. Uh,

422
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,050
you have to show a little,
little graphs, uh, or, you know,

423
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:08,130
describe the data and what you're going
to do with it and so forth. And, uh,

424
00:27:08,131 --> 00:27:08,891
one of the things I,

425
00:27:08,891 --> 00:27:11,940
I sit on these committees that make
these kinds of decisions and one of the

426
00:27:11,941 --> 00:27:16,941
things you look for is if they haven't
done interesting work and kind of done

427
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:21,670
what they claimed they would
do the last time round, uh,

428
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,550
their proposal goes down to the bottom.

429
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:26,860
You're always looking for ways to
trash other people's proposals. Uh,

430
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,540
because you've got seven times more.
In the case of the space telescope,

431
00:27:30,541 --> 00:27:33,000
you've got seven times more
proposals than you can grant,

432
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,960
of which only a small handful
are not worth doing a.

433
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:41,380
And so any opportunity you have to say,
you know, these guys are Bozos, uh,

434
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,730
you definitely take that opportunity
because otherwise you have way too many

435
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:49,290
good proposals leftover. So there's a
kind of internal control that isn't,

436
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,450
uh, explicit on this sort of
thing. And after a while, you know,

437
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:57,000
if people keep getting up in
public and saying, you know,

438
00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:02,150
quasars are sources of mass energy
creation that and therefore support the,

439
00:28:02,451 --> 00:28:06,300
the steady state, even if they're
a great big quasar expert, uh,

440
00:28:06,301 --> 00:28:09,840
you start to get a little bit queasy
about giving them large amounts of

441
00:28:09,841 --> 00:28:13,740
telescope time that might be a more
profitably be used by someone else.

442
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,100
This then gets interpreted by the, uh, uh,

443
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,780
remnant steady state
supporters or whoever the,

444
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:24,780
the minority idea might be of a hugely
o oppressive scientific bureaucracy,

445
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:29,490
you know, not allowing the
maverick wonderful thinker
to do their own thing. Uh,

446
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:33,780
and that sometimes is true,
uh,

447
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,650
but not often.

448
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:39,890
Most of the time it's the same people
not allowing the insane people to use the

449
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:44,310
telescopes. Uh, and that's
actually a much more common thing.

450
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,510
And so while it can be good propaganda
to say, yeah, these, uh, oppressive, uh,

451
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,360
elitist, uh, uh, you know, bureaucratic,

452
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:57,810
uh, uh, people mafia who
runs the scientific world,

453
00:28:57,811 --> 00:29:02,811
or not allowing my great idea to have to
get any opportunities to prove itself,

454
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:07,650
uh, most of the time it turns out
the establishment is right. Uh,

455
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,270
and so, uh, you know,

456
00:29:09,271 --> 00:29:12,420
there is this interesting question
about allocation of resources.

457
00:29:12,421 --> 00:29:15,360
It's not just telescope time,
more importantly, even money. Uh,

458
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,400
there's a big debate right now,
for example,

459
00:29:17,401 --> 00:29:20,460
in the theoretical physics
community about string theory.

460
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:25,080
String theory is the hot theory of
everything. Uh, and, uh, everybody,

461
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:28,740
uh, is supposed to be a string theorist
in theoretical physics at the moment,

462
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:32,370
except for a few people who point out
that it hasn't actually been all that

463
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:37,290
successful in explaining
anything. In fact, it hasn't
explained anything ever. Uh,

464
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,860
and therefore might one not want
to consider alternative theories.

465
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,210
And then the strength theorists say, but
you know, ah, this is a really good idea.

466
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,130
We got to continue to look at it one day.

467
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:51,400
We'll get it right and we'll
figure out everything. Uh, and, uh,

468
00:29:51,401 --> 00:29:55,750
so there has now recently been some
popular books that claimed that string the

469
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:59,930
string theories theorists are oppressing
everybody else by not letting, uh,

470
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:04,660
other kinds of good ideas
be funded. Uh, and, uh, uh,

471
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,920
by,
uh,

472
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,060
not letting smart young people who are
working on other things by not hiring

473
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:14,860
them into departments and so forth. It's
an interesting argument, uh, and, uh,

474
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,030
uh, ongoing in the strength theory
community and some sort of, as I said,

475
00:30:19,031 --> 00:30:21,430
they've been writing popular
books on both sides of this.

476
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:22,960
So it's kind of busted out into,

477
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,560
you can read about this now and the New
York review of books and places like

478
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:28,270
that. Uh, and, uh,

479
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:32,230
so what you do about minority ideas,

480
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:35,220
ideas that are not supported by,
uh,

481
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:40,500
the current paradigm of a
given scientific subject is a,

482
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:43,030
is a very tricky one in
a very interesting one.

483
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:47,890
And one that needs to be reevaluated
from time to time. And in fact, uh,

484
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,760
cosmology may be approaching such a
moment where a genuinely new idea is going

485
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:57,520
to have to be required. Uh, we,
we're probably not quite there yet,

486
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:01,870
but we'll talk about, uh, uh,
alternative cosmological theories toward,

487
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,660
toward the end of the course.
I'm sorry,

488
00:31:04,661 --> 00:31:09,550
I didn't mean to go off on
this, but, but, uh, uh, uh,

489
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,820
it's on my mind cause I had, as I
said, I serve on these committees.

490
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:14,380
So you have to think about these things.
Actually,

491
00:31:14,381 --> 00:31:16,810
the space telescope people
did a very interesting thing.

492
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:19,000
At one point they decided,
uh,

493
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:21,040
I don't think they ever actually
followed through on this,

494
00:31:21,041 --> 00:31:25,990
that 5% or some small amount of
the time, different scientific, uh,

495
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,210
uh,
resources sometimes have this,

496
00:31:28,211 --> 00:31:32,110
that like 5% of the time goes
for risky science. Science.

497
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:35,920
That's really weird. Probably
won't work. But if it works,

498
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:38,620
it's incredibly important because,
uh,

499
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:41,670
committees tend not to want to do that.
Uh,

500
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:46,360
they tend to want to do the things that
they know are going to produce some good

501
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:48,230
results. And so sometimes, uh,

502
00:31:48,231 --> 00:31:51,950
the people who organize these
things force the committees, uh,

503
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:56,140
to have a little category of
special weird project. Uh,

504
00:31:56,141 --> 00:31:59,830
and then of course, what
happened five years later,
they are net and they analyze,

505
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:02,080
you know, where did all the
good science come from? Uh,

506
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:04,420
and if it didn't come
from the weird projects,

507
00:32:04,421 --> 00:32:08,530
which is almost certainly the case, uh,
although not 100%, certainly the case,

508
00:32:08,531 --> 00:32:12,070
but generally the case, then they
say, look, we wasted 5% of our money,

509
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:15,100
telescope time, whatever it is, we're
going to close down this program.

510
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:19,720
And then you kind of have to start over
again. Uh, so how weird. It is weird, uh,

511
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,420
uh, difficult to say. All right.

512
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,990
The expansion of the
universe. We now believe, uh,

513
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:33,991
for the reasons I outlined that this
indicates a kind of big bang idea,

514
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:38,890
which means we can
extrapolate back to the,

515
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,320
that it all started and we can
calculate how long it took. Uh,

516
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,840
let me do a simpler calculation.
Uh, but exactly analogous.

517
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,030
Supposing you're in a car,

518
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,240
you're in a car and you're driving at a
speed of 50 miles per hour and you are

519
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,240
100 miles.
Oh,

520
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,930
away from your starting point,

521
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,930
how long have you been driving?

522
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:22,370
So this they taught you how to solve
in seventh grade. Uh, if you are,

523
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,170
uh, a hundred miles away, yeah, you,

524
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:29,750
you take time is equal to
distance over velocity.

525
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,190
Uh, so hundred miles, you're
going 50 miles an hour.

526
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:38,780
Uh, that means you must have
been going for two hours,

527
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:44,120
not such a hard problem. Uh,
there's a hidden assumption though.

528
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,120
Sorry. Speed. It's
constant. Yeah. Providing,

529
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,660
provided that the speed is constant.

530
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,833
Okay.

531
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:00,020
Okay.
But let's make that assumption.

532
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:04,730
Let's assume that the universe is
expanding at the same rate all the time.

533
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:09,620
How, uh, how long has it been going?
Well, take some galaxy, any galaxy,

534
00:34:09,621 --> 00:34:14,600
it turns out it doesn't matter
which galaxy and say, uh, so galaxy,

535
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,973
uh,

536
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:21,430
a is at distance D it's moving
half Velocity v away from us,

537
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,370
you know, that's the whole idea. Uh,

538
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:35,780
so how long has it been since
it was right on top of us? Well,

539
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,840
so it's been going for a time equal
to d over v by exact analogy with the

540
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,930
distance,
uh,

541
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,660
velocity time questions that
they ask you about, you know,

542
00:34:50,661 --> 00:34:53,330
cars driving to Cleveland and stuff.
Uh,

543
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:58,700
so it's been going for type t equals d
over t. But now in the case of galaxies,

544
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:03,350
there's this interesting relationship
that V is equal to h over d.

545
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,970
So d over V is equal to one over h.

546
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,370
Okay. And that can be measured.
That's Hubble's constant.

547
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,370
And so can you, age of the universe is
equal to one over the Hubble constant

548
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,870
provided that the expansion
has been at a constant rate.

549
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,820
Uh, let me remind you,
H is, is uh, has been,

550
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,590
it's 70 kilometers per
second per mega parsec.

551
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,660
That's kind of an interesting unit. Uh,
you've got kilometers per mega parsec.

552
00:35:45,661 --> 00:35:48,100
Both of those are measures of distance.
Uh,

553
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,770
this is basically velocity over distance,
uh,

554
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,160
and uh, but velocity contains
a distance within it.

555
00:35:56,161 --> 00:36:00,430
So if you were to cancel those two
distance terms in some way, uh,

556
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,710
you'd have that the units of the
Hubble constant are one over seconds.

557
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,560
So the units of one over
the Hubble constant,

558
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,420
our seconds it's and measure of
time. Uh, it's, it's reciprocal time.

559
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:16,500
One over h is a measure of time. What is
that time? It's the age of the universe.

560
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:18,210
What do I mean by the age of the universe?

561
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:22,770
That's how long it has been since all
galaxies and all objects in the universe,

562
00:36:22,771 --> 00:36:25,470
all points in the universe were
piled on top of one another.

563
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,333
Yes.

564
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,480
Uh,
let's see.

565
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,620
Yeah.

566
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:39,240
Did I write it wrong?
Uh,

567
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,010
p equals yeah. Yeah. I wrote p equals HD.

568
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,180
Thank you. Uh, and so now
what am I going to do?

569
00:36:47,181 --> 00:36:48,890
I'm going to divide both sides by H.

570
00:36:48,891 --> 00:36:51,670
I'm going to divide both sides by V
and then okay. Comes out, right? Sorry.

571
00:36:51,671 --> 00:36:55,600
Thank you very much. Uh,
stop me when I do that. Uh,

572
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,910
right, because this is the huddle, mom.

573
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,220
Okay. So how old is the universe? Well,

574
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:13,990
it's a one over 70 kilometers
per second per mega parsec. Uh,

575
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:17,300
that actually is not a very
useful unit of time. Uh,

576
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,790
so let's see if we can do better.
Uh,

577
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:25,160
h is equal to 70 kilometers per second,
per mega parsec.

578
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:28,040
Now we want to cancel the
kilometers per mega parsec.

579
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:33,250
So what we want to multiply this by
is the number of mega parsecs in one

580
00:37:34,701 --> 00:37:38,590
kilometer. That's a very
small number, right? It's,

581
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:43,180
it's some tiny fraction. Cause in Mega
Parsec is huge. Uh, it's uh, you know,

582
00:37:43,181 --> 00:37:46,770
3 million light years. There's nothing
like that. No kilometer, not so huge. Uh,

583
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:52,050
so let to calculate this term that's
going to be one kilometer is 10 to the

584
00:37:52,121 --> 00:37:54,340
three meters.
Uh,

585
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:57,220
one Mega Parsec Amiga is 10 to the six.

586
00:37:57,221 --> 00:38:01,240
A Parsec is three times
10 to the 16 meters. Uh,

587
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:06,450
and so this is equal to one
third times 10 to the minus 22.

588
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:12,181
10 to the minus 19 is equal to
a three times 10 to the minus

589
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,240
20.
Right?

590
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,530
Uh,
but at 70 of those,

591
00:38:21,531 --> 00:38:26,531
so h is equal to seven times 10 to the
one times three times 10 to the minus 20,

592
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,500
which is equal to 20 times 10 to the
minus 19 or two times 10 to the minus 18,

593
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:39,310
uh, in of one over
seconds. So one over age,

594
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:44,670
we now know in seconds is equal to
one over two times 10 to the minus 18

595
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:45,934
seconds.

596
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:51,150
That's a half times 10 to the 18
or five times 10 to the 17 seconds.

597
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,150
One year

598
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,320
is equal to three times
10 to the seven seconds.

599
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,170
So the age of the university in the years

600
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:11,290
is a five times 10 to the 17,

601
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,280
over three times 10 to the seven a,

602
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:20,281
which is something like a 1.7
times 10 to the 10 or 17 billion

603
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,613
years.

604
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:35,630
So that's the answer universally
is 17 billion years old. Uh,

605
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,260
it's not quite the answer because
of that assumption, right?

606
00:39:38,261 --> 00:39:43,090
The assumption was that the universe
is expanding at the same rate, uh,

607
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,570
uh, all the time. And that's
not necessarily true. Uh,

608
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,870
and the next thing we're going
to do is ask the question,

609
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:54,490
what happens if the expansion rate
of the universe changes with time?

610
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,490
It probably does. It
almost certainly does. Uh,

611
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:03,250
because the universe is filled with
mass. What does mass do? Mass exerts?

612
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,820
Well, Newton would have it. That
mass exerts gravitational force.

613
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:10,240
It slows down the expansion of the
universe. So what do you expect?

614
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:14,350
You expect the universe to be
slowing down gradually? Uh,

615
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,310
and this, uh, gives rise to
a couple of possibilities.

616
00:40:18,311 --> 00:40:21,700
And I think I mentioned this briefly in
passing. Now we're going to do it, uh,

617
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,440
more, uh, in more detail. This is
the scale factor of the universe,

618
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,810
uh, which started at
zero. Uh, here's time.

619
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,730
Here's now a w.

620
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:39,250
Here's whatever the scale factor
of the university is now, uh, and,

621
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,930
uh, uh, what has happened? Here's,
here's, here's what it looks like.

622
00:40:43,931 --> 00:40:46,510
If there's no change.
So this is constant

623
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:49,100
expansion.

624
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,170
And so,
uh,

625
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:57,060
it is this amount of time that
turns out to be 17 billion years.

626
00:40:58,810 --> 00:40:59,643
Uh,

627
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,950
but in fact,
it's all a,

628
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:05,860
it seems likely that the
universe is in fact slowing down.

629
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,900
So what does that look like?
Well,

630
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:12,020
that means that in the future
it's going to do this. Uh,

631
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:14,320
it means that in the
past it was doing this,

632
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,593
uh,

633
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:20,260
because it was, it's presumably been
slowing down since the very beginning.

634
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:25,390
And that means that the universe is,
uh, started, uh, later than you think,

635
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:28,660
because it, it started expanding
more quickly than it is now.

636
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:32,270
And then it's been slowing down.
So, in fact, you might say, uh,

637
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,560
the unit that what we've really shown
is that the universe has to be less than

638
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,420
17 billion years old.

639
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:43,860
By the way,

640
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:48,120
this calculation is why it was such bad
news when Hubble got the answer wrong.

641
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,640
Uh,
you will recall from the problem set,

642
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:54,750
Hubble thought that the Hubble
constant was 500 kilometers per second,

643
00:41:54,751 --> 00:41:59,670
per mega parsec 500 is a bigger
number. It means, uh, it, it, it's,

644
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:03,360
uh, what, seven times bigger
than we currently believe.

645
00:42:03,361 --> 00:42:07,650
That means that a Hubble's estimate of
the age of the universe was a factor of

646
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:11,430
seven smaller than, uh,
uh, 17 billion years,

647
00:42:11,431 --> 00:42:13,420
which is about two and
a half billion years.

648
00:42:13,421 --> 00:42:18,390
So Hubble's the implication of huddles
result for the Big Bang in the big bank

649
00:42:18,391 --> 00:42:21,930
context at least, was that the universe
was two and a half billion years old.

650
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,980
That was very bad news
because the geologists had
already figured out that the

651
00:42:25,981 --> 00:42:28,070
earth was 4 billion years old.
Uh,

652
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:32,700
and it's not good news to have a planet
that's a factor of two older than the

653
00:42:32,701 --> 00:42:34,080
universe.
Uh,

654
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:38,130
and so this was part of the initial
suspicion of the Big Bang explanation.

655
00:42:38,131 --> 00:42:40,160
Part of the reason people, uh, uh,

656
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:45,030
tried to develop steady state ideas
was that Hubble's a calculation of the

657
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:50,031
constant gave you an age of the universe
that was in contradiction to existing,

658
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,830
uh,
geological ages measured on earth.

659
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:58,200
By now we're up to 17 billion years
and that seems to, uh, uh, that's fine.

660
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:01,470
The universe of the earth is only
four and a half billion years old,

661
00:43:01,471 --> 00:43:03,060
so there's no conflict there anymore.

662
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,240
There are some star clusters that are
known to be 12 or 13 billion years old,

663
00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:09,980
uh, and they, uh,

664
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:14,550
cause some trouble for some values of
the Hubble constant until quite recently.

665
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,530
Uh, okay. Um, so, but then this, uh,

666
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:24,030
this begs a question, namely, uh,
what's going to happen in the future?

667
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:27,600
Could it be that the expansion
of the universe stops,

668
00:43:27,601 --> 00:43:32,400
turns around and comes back
leading to a big crunch,

669
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:38,670
another one of these
technical terms, uh, and uh,

670
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,230
uh, how much mass with the
universe have to contain, uh,

671
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:46,170
for that to be true? So let
me do that calculation. Now.

672
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:51,450
This is something we know how to do.
This is an escape philosophy. Problems.

673
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:55,830
The universe, you know, you throw a,
uh, you throw a pan up in the air.

674
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,040
If you throw it slowly, it stops,
turns around and comes back.

675
00:43:59,041 --> 00:44:02,310
If you throw it fast, it goes
away. Or to put it a different way,

676
00:44:02,311 --> 00:44:05,640
if you throw a pen up in
the air at some velocity,

677
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,860
whether it comes back or not,

678
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,400
depends on the gravitational force
of the planet you're standing on,

679
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:15,180
which in turn depends on the mass
and the density of that planet. Uh,

680
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:20,190
so if you set your universe into
motion, it's expanding outward. Uh,

681
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:24,240
depending on the density of
the universe, uh, it can stop,

682
00:44:24,241 --> 00:44:28,380
turn around and fall back, or it can
keep going. So here's the calculation.

683
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,970
Here's any, here's, here's
us or any other observer.

684
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,660
It works no matter where you
do a, then there's some, uh,

685
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:41,290
there's some galaxy, some
distance d away from us. Uh,

686
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:43,860
it's moving outward at a rate of,
uh,

687
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,110
some Velocity v where vias
related to d, uh, by this, uh,

688
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:53,970
uh, uh, equation or mega
parsec. That's right.

689
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,690
Uh, and then, uh, what's
trying to pull it back? Well,

690
00:44:57,691 --> 00:45:02,340
the mass inside of this region
is trying to hold it back.

691
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:06,300
It's only the massing side of
that region because the mass, uh,

692
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:09,660
outside of Erie, we talked about
this in the context of planets.

693
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,700
This all cancels out. Uh, and so,

694
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:19,410
uh, what is the escape philosophy?
So the escape velocity,

695
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:24,710
you may recall is the square
root of a to g m over d.

696
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,030
That's the escape philosophy of
this object. And let me make sure

697
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:38,790
I haven't screwed this up. No, that's
right. Uh, and so the question is,

698
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:42,750
is the greater than V escape?

699
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,840
All right,

700
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:53,020
so let's evaluate this.
What's an m is equal to, uh,

701
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:55,790
uh,
the density

702
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:01,930
times the volume density,
we'll call that, uh,

703
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:07,210
the given its usual symbol of row and
the volume is four thirds Pi de que.

704
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:11,960
That's the volume of
this fear of material.

705
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:18,620
And you'll see why I translated
into density in a minute. Uh,

706
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,450
the velocity is equal to h Times d.

707
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,710
So the question is,

708
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:29,950
is h times d greater than the square
root of two g over d times the mass row?

709
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:41,140
Four thirds Pi Dq.
Alright,

710
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:45,140
let's square both sides. I got
to get rid of this, uh, uh,

711
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:50,670
uh, this square root sign.
So h squared, d squared, uh,

712
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:55,930
is h squared d squared greater
than two g row four thirds Pi.

713
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,760
And we've got a deep cube divided by d.
So that's d squared.

714
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:06,323
Okay?

715
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:08,700
And here's the key thing.

716
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:12,900
The Ds cancel the distance cancel.

717
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:16,610
It doesn't matter which
galaxy and you pick a,

718
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:19,590
it doesn't matter how
far away that galaxy is,

719
00:47:19,591 --> 00:47:24,591
you get the exact same result for every
portion of the universe you examine.

720
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,180
So the question becomes,
is

721
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,630
the density less than

722
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:41,980
three eight squared over eight Pi?

723
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:46,210
Gee, I've just rearranged the terms. Uh,

724
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:47,440
this is the row.

725
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:51,850
It's still on the less than side I've
taken the two times four is eight,

726
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,610
that's this eight.
There's a pie that goes down here.

727
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:59,790
This three comes over on top and the h
nods and the h squared stays where it is.

728
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:05,400
So this quantity is defined
as the critical Danson.

729
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:10,720
If the density of the universe is
less than the critical density,

730
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,670
the universe expands forever.

731
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:16,763
Yeah.

732
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:21,830
If the density of the universe is
greater than the critical density,

733
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,260
then the universe re collapses.

734
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,490
So, uh, we can calculate this. Uh,

735
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,130
this is all constants
on this right hand side.

736
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,640
We've measured h we've measured h,
so we know what that is.

737
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,320
Three times two times 10 to the minus 18.

738
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:47,100
That's h a. We work that out square, uh,

739
00:48:47,101 --> 00:48:51,840
over eight Pi Times seven
times 10 to the minus 11.

740
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:57,000
Uh, and now it's just arithmetic.
And I'll tell you the answer.

741
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:59,110
We, you can work it out for yourself. Uh,

742
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:02,640
I got six times 10 to the minus 27,

743
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,660
and this isn't units of
kilograms per meter cube.

744
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,890
That's a really small density.

745
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,540
It doesn't take much to hold the
universe back. On the other hand,

746
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,680
the universe is really big. Uh,
obviously the density of, of,

747
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:20,670
of this room of the air in
this room is 20. Uh, it,

748
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,340
it is 30 orders of magnitude bigger.

749
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:28,430
That's why the earth isn't expanding
because we're so dense that our little

750
00:49:28,621 --> 00:49:31,740
region of the universe has turned
around and re collapsed log since.

751
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:35,340
But if you take the universe as a whole,
planets are rare.

752
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:39,030
Stars are rare.
Galaxy's even are rare.

753
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:42,430
And it turns out as well,
discuss next time, uh,

754
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,800
that the universe is actually
fairly close, uh, in, in bulk.

755
00:49:46,801 --> 00:49:50,160
If you take a large enough region
that includes all the empty space,

756
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:54,510
it turns out that the average density
of the universe is actually surprisingly

757
00:49:54,511 --> 00:49:59,511
close to this critical value at which
the universe will be balanced between

758
00:49:59,521 --> 00:50:02,160
expanding forever and re collapsing.

759
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:06,180
And so we'll talk about how you actually
measure the average density of the

760
00:50:06,181 --> 00:50:10,680
universe and thus determine the
fate of the universe. Uh, next time.
