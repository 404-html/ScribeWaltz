1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:04,950
You'll recall that where we got to
last time is that there are lots of hot

2
00:00:04,951 --> 00:00:05,784
Jupiters,

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,550
there are lots of hot Jupiters and uh,

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,610
the alternative theories that were
presented to explain the evidence for hot

5
00:00:19,071 --> 00:00:19,461
Jupiters,

6
00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:23,450
the evidence for hot Jupiters comes in
this form of these velocity curves where

7
00:00:23,451 --> 00:00:28,451
you plot the radial velocity versus time
of the star and the star goes back and

8
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:33,710
forth and you infer from that that
there must be a planet going around it,

9
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:35,540
which is pulling the star back and forth.

10
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,530
Uh,

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,311
and uh,

12
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:41,660
some alternative explanations were
proposed to explain these kinds of data.

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,930
Those alternative explanations
didn't seem to work very well.

14
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,080
And so you have to kind of take
the hot Jupiters seriously.

15
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:48,950
Uh,

16
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,760
before I go on,

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,620
let me mention that by now,

18
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,150
hot Jupiters are not the only kind of
planets that have been seen this way.

19
00:00:56,151 --> 00:01:01,151
There are also a planet in a now
known to have much longer orbits,

20
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,650
orbits up to a few years.

21
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,220
These are harder to see for two reasons.

22
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:10,821
First of all,

23
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:12,590
it takes you a few years to see him.

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,191
Uh,

25
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:14,030
and second of all,

26
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:16,190
because when the orbits get longer,

27
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,460
the velocities that they
induce go down because,

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,000
uh,

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,770
things in long orbit to go slowly.

30
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,550
Uh,

31
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,271
but nevertheless,

32
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:24,920
now we've been able to
see a bunch of things.

33
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,813
Oddly,

34
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,290
in many cases,

35
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:27,720
uh,

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,500
they turn out to have
highly elliptical orbits,

37
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,290
orbits in some cases,

38
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:36,890
uh,

39
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,140
not the hot Jupiters,

40
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,560
not the ones that are close in.

41
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:41,720
Those all are more or less circular.

42
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,110
Uh,

43
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,540
but some of these longer ones
have highly elliptical orbit.

44
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:48,740
That's also very weird in
terms of [inaudible] theories
of planetary formation,

45
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,903
uh,

46
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,773
because,

47
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,110
uh,

48
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,340
one of the things that,

49
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:52,670
uh,

50
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,600
are theories were designed to explain
was the fact that all the major planet in

51
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:59,810
our own solar system have orbits
that are close to circular.

52
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:01,820
It does a very good
job of explaining that.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,750
And then,

54
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:02,990
uh,

55
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,230
naturally enough has trouble explaining
the ones we see that are in highly

56
00:02:06,231 --> 00:02:07,064
elliptical orbits.

57
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:07,730
Oh,

58
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:08,563
uh,

59
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,860
highly elliptical.

60
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,491
Yes.

61
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:14,300
I didn't highly elliptical
orbits in some cases and adjust.

62
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:14,810
Uh,

63
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,081
so,

64
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:15,800
you know,

65
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,800
the way you recognize a highly elliptical
orbit is it's not your soil anymore.

66
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,090
It's got some other shape.

67
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,853
Uh,

68
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,810
so these come in periodic
but non sinusoidal,

69
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,630
uh,

70
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,630
velocity curves.

71
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,900
So all this is very amusing.

72
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:41,471
Uh,

73
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:43,300
and you pile up all these very strange,

74
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:43,930
uh,

75
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,940
kinds of planet or what
you think our planet,

76
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,600
uh,

77
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,600
but there's still sort of the nagging
question of whether these a radio velocity

78
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:55,330
curves might be explainable
in some other way.

79
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:57,850
And it would be awfully nice to have,

80
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,450
uh,

81
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,283
evidence,

82
00:02:59,510 --> 00:02:59,700
uh,

83
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,340
of some other kind for the
existence of these planets.

84
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:03,940
This is,

85
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,451
this is,

86
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:04,721
you know,

87
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:05,800
what happens in science.

88
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:09,220
You find some kind of fairly
strong evidence for something,

89
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:09,610
uh,

90
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,150
but it would be way stronger if you
found two different kinds of evidence,

91
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,650
different collected in different ways
or reflecting different aspect of what

92
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:18,484
you're observing,

93
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,683
uh,

94
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,640
that both point in the same direction.

95
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,810
And,

96
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,291
uh,

97
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,210
at a certain point along the way about,

98
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:25,760
uh,

99
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,230
uh,

100
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,640
six years ago or so,

101
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:28,630
uh,

102
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,250
a new kind of evidence for the existence
of these planets was discovered.

103
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:34,690
And the first such case,

104
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,080
uh,

105
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:39,190
which is now a very famous
star for this reason,

106
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:39,680
uh,

107
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,430
was something called a HD.

108
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,810
Uh,

109
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,460
two oh nine,

110
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:47,170
four 58.

111
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,640
That's the name of the star.

112
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,850
And this was a hot Jupiter system.

113
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,481
Uh,

114
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:54,190
so this is the name of the star,

115
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,830
a hot Jupiter.

116
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,943
Okay.

117
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,200
Was discovered,

118
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,140
okay.

119
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:04,860
In the usual way by a
doppler measurements,

120
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:06,630
by radial velocity measurement.

121
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,893
Uh,

122
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,290
and then something else was discovered.

123
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,253
Okay.

124
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,531
So all,

125
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:21,360
let me show you what they
found in this system.

126
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,850
All right,

127
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:28,350
so,

128
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,080
uh,

129
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,670
let me explain what's plotted here.

130
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,690
Is the brightness of this system,

131
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,190
not the radio velocity.

132
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:36,640
This time,

133
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,080
the brightness against time.

134
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,310
Uh,

135
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,230
and so here it is on the 9th of September,

136
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,570
1999 and somebody is measuring
the brightness of the star,

137
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,171
this thing,

138
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:51,520
and it's set up in units so that
the average brightness is one.

139
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,780
And you can see these measurements
have a little bit of error in the,

140
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:59,781
they scatter around and then at a certain
point there's a dip and the brightness

141
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:01,660
of the star for a few hours.

142
00:05:01,661 --> 00:05:02,860
Notice this is in days,

143
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:04,180
this is a 10th of a day.

144
00:05:04,181 --> 00:05:05,860
So 2.4 hours,

145
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:06,694
something like that.

146
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,110
So for a few hours,

147
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,310
the brightness of this thing
dips down to about 98% of it,

148
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,110
of the brightness it has sowed.

149
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,140
So to loses 2% of its
brightness for a little while,

150
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:18,220
and then it comes back up.

151
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,270
Uh,

152
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,830
and then interestingly enough,

153
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:24,550
seven nights later on the
night of the 16th of September,

154
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,140
it did the same thing.

155
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,850
Now seven nights is an important number
for this particular system because it

156
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:34,120
turns out that the orbital
period of it's hot,

157
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:34,601
Jupiter,

158
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,460
which was already known at the time,

159
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:36,910
uh,

160
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,500
is three and a half days.

161
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:41,770
So this is exactly two orbits later,

162
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,720
the exact same dip occurred.

163
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,870
You couldn't see it one or a bit later
cause three and a half days later,

164
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:47,704
it's daytime.

165
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:48,401
Uh,

166
00:05:48,401 --> 00:05:49,151
and uh,

167
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:51,730
one of the features of astronomy
is that you do it at night.

168
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:52,923
Uh,

169
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:53,831
and uh,

170
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:55,750
so you have to wait two days,

171
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:58,040
two orbits to see the same thing again.

172
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,390
So every,

173
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,380
uh,

174
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,490
every orbit,

175
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:03,650
there appears to be this little dip.

176
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,540
And what is happening is that this is
a system that's almost exactly edge on.

177
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,950
And what's happening is that the planet
is passing in front of the Star and at

178
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:13,910
once per orbit,

179
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:15,770
the planet gets in the way of the star,

180
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,491
the planets,

181
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:17,211
this little thing,

182
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:17,691
the stars,

183
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:18,524
a big thing.

184
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,820
And a small amount of the stars
light is obscured by the planet.

185
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,260
This is called a transit.

186
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,041
Uh,

187
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,450
so let me just write that down.

188
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,270
And then transit

189
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,550
are discovered.

190
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,953
Uh,

191
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,801
yeah.

192
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:38,071
Okay.

193
00:06:38,071 --> 00:06:38,940
We'll come back to the,

194
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,580
to the overheads and amend it cause
I want to show you more plots.

195
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:42,743
Uh,

196
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,680
and it's the planet getting
in the way of the starlight.

197
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,250
And what this tells you also
is how big the planet is.

198
00:06:50,251 --> 00:06:54,930
Because you've got a little disc in front
of a big disk and the amount of light

199
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:55,711
that's obscured,

200
00:06:55,711 --> 00:07:00,711
this 2% tells you what the ratio of the
area projected by the planet compared to

201
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:05,040
the area projected by the entire start is.

202
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:09,060
So this gives you an additional piece
of information you already know the mass

203
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:09,841
of the thing for,

204
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:11,730
because you've measured
the radio velocity.

205
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,770
Now we also know its size.

206
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,210
Uh,

207
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,920
so this was very interesting and it is,

208
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:18,540
as I was saying just a second ago,

209
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:23,570
an entirely different kind of confirmation
of the existence of this planet.

210
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:29,091
So there's no pulsation going on here
because something that you not only are

211
00:07:29,431 --> 00:07:33,280
getting the changes in velocity
of the planet you're seeing of,

212
00:07:33,281 --> 00:07:34,114
of the star,

213
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,350
you're also seeing the light of the star
diminished when the planet passes in

214
00:07:37,351 --> 00:07:38,184
front of him.

215
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:38,580
Uh,

216
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,210
and then so they decided this was
interesting and so they did the same

217
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,900
experiment except with the Hubble space
telescope instead of with some ground

218
00:07:45,901 --> 00:07:46,770
based telescope.

219
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,300
This is what you see with Hubble.

220
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:48,680
Uh,

221
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,150
and you can see why humble
is a better telescope.

222
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,661
Uh,

223
00:07:51,661 --> 00:07:52,800
then the grab based stuff,

224
00:07:52,801 --> 00:07:54,390
this is exactly the same plot.

225
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,380
This is uh,

226
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:56,100
uh,

227
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,970
the average brightness of the
system outside of the transit.

228
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,330
Uh,

229
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,100
so this is 1.0.

230
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:03,690
This is 0.985.

231
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,390
So it's dropped down 1.5% in brightness.

232
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:09,020
This is in days in [inaudible].

233
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,420
Uh,

234
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,980
this is a 10th of a day here.

235
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:15,960
Each of these big ticks is a 0.05 of
the day and here's the star going along

236
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:16,830
perfectly normally.

237
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:17,664
And uh,

238
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,240
you get better measurements because
you're not distorted by the atmosphere.

239
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,600
And then all of a sudden the
thing drops and it gives,

240
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:28,410
has this very particular
shape to the light curve,

241
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:30,000
to the curve of brightness.

242
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,750
With time.

243
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,190
This shape is perfectly explained by
the hypothesis that you're passing and

244
00:08:35,191 --> 00:08:37,770
opaque disc across the
surface of the star.

245
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,980
As the disc touches the star,

246
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,460
it starts to uh,

247
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,840
and gradually more and more
of the disc is over the star.

248
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:48,060
You get this steep drop here.

249
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,950
And then this rounded part down on the
bottom comes about because when you look

250
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:53,784
at a star,

251
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,570
uh,

252
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,190
the of the star,

253
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:59,520
the central portion of the star looks
a little bit brighter than the edges.

254
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,770
Because if you think
about looking at a sphere,

255
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,090
if you look at the center,

256
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:04,200
you're looking right at it.

257
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,760
If you're looking at the side,

258
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:09,570
you're sort of grazing the edge and it
turns out there's something called limb

259
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:10,081
darkening,

260
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:11,370
which comes about because of this.

261
00:09:11,371 --> 00:09:12,091
So stars,

262
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:13,200
if you look at the sun,

263
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:14,034
for example,

264
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,830
the edges of the sun look a
little fainter than the middle.

265
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,240
And so what happens is as,

266
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:22,080
as this disc passes across
the face of the star,

267
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:27,530
it obscures successively brighter parts
of the star until you get down to here.

268
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,620
Then it obscures a gradually fainter
parts of the star until it gets to the

269
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:32,190
edge.

270
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,590
Now the disk is,

271
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,130
as it goes up here,

272
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:35,581
uh,

273
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:38,010
is passing beyond the edge of the star.

274
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:41,310
So this is exactly the
shape of a light curve.

275
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,430
You would predict if you passed
an opaque disc in front of a star.

276
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:45,390
Uh,

277
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,120
and,

278
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,710
uh,

279
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,690
it really works out remarkably well.

280
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:49,350
In fact,

281
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,830
uh,

282
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,960
there's a line underneath these points.

283
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:54,330
You can see it off here and off here,

284
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:54,900
uh,

285
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,690
which is a prediction and you can't see
the line because it's under the points

286
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:00,524
so nicely.

287
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:00,961
Uh,

288
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:02,730
so this works out incredibly well.

289
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,550
This is an old,

290
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,800
this is almost for sure.

291
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,251
Uh,

292
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:06,510
and opaque disk,

293
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,180
namely the planet passing
in front of the star.

294
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,360
So transits are discovered,

295
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:15,820
uh,

296
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,370
the dip in light,

297
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,130
uh,

298
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:23,490
due to a planet passing

299
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:25,950
across

300
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,853
the star.

301
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,730
No,

302
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,730
this does not happen in every hot
Jupiter because you have to be lined up

303
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:35,850
pretty,

304
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,300
uh,

305
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,540
pretty perfectly in order for the
planet to pass in front of the star.

306
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,374
That is to say,

307
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:40,800
uh,

308
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,550
if here,

309
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,383
here's you,

310
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,190
here's,

311
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,150
here's an observer,

312
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:45,720
uh,

313
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,860
here's the star.

314
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:47,880
Uh,

315
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,713
and,

316
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,140
uh,

317
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,190
if the planet,

318
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,840
if the orbital plane of
the planet looks like this,

319
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,213
uh,

320
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,350
then when the planet,

321
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:58,981
uh,

322
00:10:58,981 --> 00:10:59,940
in front of the star,

323
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:00,850
it'll be below it.

324
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,340
So if you think about it,

325
00:11:02,341 --> 00:11:03,140
imagine,

326
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,480
uh,

327
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,270
imagine a planet that's
orbiting like this.

328
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:10,560
Here's its star and it never passes in
front of the star because when it's,

329
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,880
when it's in front of the star,

330
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:13,140
it's below the star.

331
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,170
Whereas if it,

332
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,870
if it's exactly edge on,

333
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,100
then once per orbit,

334
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:18,600
it will pass in front of the star.

335
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:22,320
But you have to have a very precise
alignment for that to take place.

336
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,513
So,

337
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,240
uh,

338
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,170
requires,

339
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:26,730
uh,

340
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,080
a precisely,

341
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,620
okay,

342
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:29,920
uh,

343
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,940
edge on

344
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,823
alignment.

345
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:35,640
Okay?

346
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,440
But if you have such an alignment,

347
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:38,310
uh,

348
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,310
you know how these dips ought to line
up with the radio velocity curve.

349
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:46,930
So now what you see is your measure,

350
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:50,670
the brightness of the star versus time,

351
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:52,260
and you see these dips,

352
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:53,094
here's a dip,

353
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:56,350
then one orbit later you get
another dip and so forth.

354
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,160
Uh,

355
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,760
if you then at the same time
measure the radio velocity,

356
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:01,883
okay?

357
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:02,961
Uh,

358
00:12:02,961 --> 00:12:03,411
and again,

359
00:12:03,411 --> 00:12:05,480
this is the radio velocity of the star.

360
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:09,620
Then you know how this has to
take place because here you are,

361
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,300
you're looking at it and the
moment where the dip takes place,

362
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,500
the planet's got to be
exactly in front of the star.

363
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,160
That means the planet is at this
point in its orbit going that way,

364
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:22,994
for example.

365
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,940
And the star is in this part
of its orbit going that way,

366
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,560
which means this,

367
00:12:27,561 --> 00:12:29,750
the radio velocity at the moment,

368
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:34,220
the dip occurs has to be zero because
for them to be lined up one in front of

369
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:34,700
the other,

370
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,500
they've both got to be going sideways.

371
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,650
And shortly before that,

372
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,490
the star was moving away from you
because they're moving into position like

373
00:12:43,491 --> 00:12:44,120
this.

374
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,350
Shortly afterwards,

375
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,790
the star is coming towards you.

376
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,870
Uh,

377
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:52,870
and remember that positive
radial velocities are coming
towards going away from

378
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:54,170
you.

379
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,210
Negative velocities
are coming towards you.

380
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,810
So it used to be the star used
to be going away from you,

381
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,710
positive.

382
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,390
It's now at zero,

383
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:03,680
at the point of the dip,

384
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,690
and then it's going to
be coming towards you.

385
00:13:05,691 --> 00:13:10,100
So it has to be that these
dips take place at that point

386
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,100
in,

387
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,510
uh,

388
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,150
uh,

389
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,983
in the,

390
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,873
uh,

391
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,491
curve.

392
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:17,510
And so here again,

393
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:19,430
it's got to be like this.

394
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,180
And so the way this has to work
out is something like this.

395
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:29,140
So you can predict what the radio velocity
has to be at the particular moment

396
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:30,470
where the transits occurred.

397
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,340
And this works.

398
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,130
This works for a HD.

399
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,243
Uh,

400
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,051
what is it?

401
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:36,621
Two Oh nine,

402
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:37,454
four 58.

403
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,520
So this works out.

404
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,113
Okay.

405
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:46,520
So now you've got a lot of evidence
that this really is a planet.

406
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,690
Not only is it moving the star back and
forth the way you expect the planet to

407
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:51,110
do,

408
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:56,030
it's also passing in front of that star
at exactly the moment you expect it to

409
00:13:56,031 --> 00:13:57,290
pass in front of the star.

410
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,120
And the shape of the dip that it creates
is exactly what you would expect if you

411
00:14:02,121 --> 00:14:04,160
pass an opaque disc in front of a star.

412
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,550
So now you've got a whole bunch
of different kinds of evidence,

413
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:08,683
uh,

414
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,943
you can ask,

415
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,470
does this prove it's a planet?

416
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,321
Uh,

417
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:16,670
and then you get into this
problem with scientific proof.

418
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,220
What does it mean to prove
something in science?

419
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,660
You could probably figure out some clever
way that it's actually a pulsating,

420
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,190
pulsating star,

421
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:25,820
uh,

422
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,820
which has a star spot on it that somehow
precisely mimics exactly the way a

423
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:32,240
planet would behave,

424
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,363
uh,

425
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,360
impossible that this would,

426
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:40,361
well now I should be careful with that
word in highly improbable that this,

427
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,050
uh,

428
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,450
would actually occur in real life.

429
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:45,081
So I think,

430
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:45,914
you know,

431
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,920
people have the feeling
that that science is,

432
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,780
is truth somehow.

433
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,560
Uh,

434
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,040
and,

435
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,280
uh,

436
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:52,611
you know,

437
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:56,750
that you can prove things in science
kind of to a mathematical certainty that

438
00:14:56,751 --> 00:14:57,800
actually isn't the case.

439
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,550
Uh,

440
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,020
the legal standard,

441
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:00,261
you know,

442
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:03,890
what you're familiar from cop
shows of beyond a reasonable doubt,

443
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,461
uh,

444
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:06,440
applies in science as well.

445
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,041
Uh,

446
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:11,300
and that's actually a more appropriate
standard to use for anything which,

447
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:11,740
Eh,

448
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:11,920
in,

449
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,010
in the law or,

450
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,281
or,

451
00:15:13,281 --> 00:15:15,740
or in the natural world in which you,

452
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,100
uh,

453
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,660
try and reason by induction.

454
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,833
Uh,

455
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,190
and so I would say that this plus this
plus the shape of the mission of the

456
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:25,910
spectral lines,

457
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:27,200
which we talked about last time,

458
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:27,890
uh,

459
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,680
plus the shape of these depths,

460
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,230
uh,

461
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,730
that's proof way beyond a reasonable
doubt that there's a planet around,

462
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:35,000
uh,

463
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,500
around this particular star.

464
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:37,850
Uh,

465
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:38,451
and,

466
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:38,631
uh,

467
00:15:38,631 --> 00:15:41,300
that really ended the conversation.

468
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,463
Yes.

469
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,470
Is it always directly,

470
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,571
and John is,

471
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:49,240
could there be a case in
which a little bit below.

472
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,580
So is it always edge on?

473
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,450
Uh,

474
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,283
well,

475
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,760
orbits don't change.

476
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,470
So for this object,

477
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:57,550
it's always add on.

478
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,140
For most objects,

479
00:15:59,141 --> 00:16:00,130
it is not adjunct.

480
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,810
And so in fact,

481
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:04,690
what had happened was by the
time they discovered this one,

482
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:08,110
there were a couple of
dozen of hot Jupiters known.

483
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,590
None of the rest of them do this
because in all the rest of them,

484
00:16:11,591 --> 00:16:13,330
the orbit isn't aligned properly.

485
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,171
And so the,

486
00:16:14,171 --> 00:16:16,600
the planet never goes
in front of the star.

487
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,650
And so in the vast majority
of cases you don't get this.

488
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,120
And so they only,

489
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:26,830
they only discovered this after they'd
found so many of them that one of them

490
00:16:26,831 --> 00:16:28,600
turned out to be aligned properly.

491
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,021
You know,

492
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:29,860
just by chance.

493
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,783
Is there a there,

494
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,000
is it possible for a core of it to knock,

495
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:35,890
never pass in front of the center?

496
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:36,800
No.

497
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,020
What,

498
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,360
what it does is it passes.

499
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,560
It's got to do this.

500
00:16:39,561 --> 00:16:41,300
It's got to have some moment where the,

501
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:45,140
where the planet is as far
towards you as it can be,

502
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:46,670
and then it turns around and comes back.

503
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,590
But for most orbits,

504
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,580
at that point,

505
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:54,581
the planet will either be below or
above the star from your line of sight.

506
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:58,070
So imagine this orbit as the planet goes,

507
00:16:58,071 --> 00:17:00,350
here's a star planets
going around the star.

508
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,600
It reaches its furthest forward point,

509
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,480
but it's well below the star
from your line of sight.

510
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,540
So it depends on,

511
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,510
on the angle of the orbital plane.

512
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,160
Does that make sense?

513
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,620
It doesn't happen.

514
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,613
You can pass,

515
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,540
you know.

516
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,050
Oh,

517
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:16,370
Oh yes.

518
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:16,881
Sorry.

519
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:17,870
A exactly right.

520
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,390
It doesn't have to pass
through the center of the star.

521
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,020
It can,

522
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,170
it can graze the tip at the
bottom of the star a little bit.

523
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:24,981
And in fact,

524
00:17:24,981 --> 00:17:25,940
in this object,

525
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:26,310
uh,

526
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:31,310
you can tell how close to the center it
goes by the exact shape of the curvature

527
00:17:31,581 --> 00:17:33,620
down at the bottom of that light curve.

528
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:34,640
Uh,

529
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,260
because you know what the
expected distribution of
brightness across the face of

530
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:39,980
the star is.

531
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,190
You also know something
about the radius of the star.

532
00:17:43,191 --> 00:17:44,990
This is supposed to be a solar type star,

533
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:46,700
presumably has a radius of the sun.

534
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,730
If it passes a across,

535
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:49,940
uh,

536
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,270
sort

537
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,680
of grace is the bottom,

538
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,600
then the,

539
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,460
then the dip will be
shorter because it will,

540
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,750
it will pass through faster until you can
figure out exactly what the trajectory

541
00:17:59,751 --> 00:18:00,710
across the thing is.

542
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,910
Most of the time it misses a,

543
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,390
and in this case you
can figure out that the,

544
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:05,601
uh,

545
00:18:05,601 --> 00:18:07,430
that the angle of inclination,

546
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:07,911
so called,

547
00:18:07,911 --> 00:18:09,020
which is 90 degrees,

548
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,330
if it's exactly edge on his 80,

549
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:13,040
I think 88 point something.

550
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:16,940
I don't remember the answer because it
doesn't go exactly across the center.

551
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:19,280
It goes sort of sort of halfway down.

552
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:19,930
Uh,

553
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:20,630
so yeah,

554
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,910
that actually gives you
additional information,

555
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,930
uh,

556
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,790
how long the dip is and what the exact
shape of the thing tells you which part

557
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,250
of the star it passes across.

558
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,551
Yes.

559
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:31,851
Good.

560
00:18:31,851 --> 00:18:32,684
Thanks Bethany.

561
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,400
Other questions about this?

562
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:37,503
Yeah.

563
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:42,120
Discovered a planet through
transit without having to previous.

564
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,890
All right.

565
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:46,790
Have we discovered a planet through
transit without having discovered the

566
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:47,610
previous,

567
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,443
uh,

568
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,670
radio velocity curves?

569
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:50,270
Yes.

570
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,170
And we'll get to that.

571
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,303
Uh,

572
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:52,971
because,

573
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:53,150
uh,

574
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,140
let me just say this,

575
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,450
as soon as this was discovered,

576
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,460
people got way excited because it's
quite difficult to make these kinds of

577
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:03,860
precise radial velocity measurements.

578
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,960
You have to have very
specialized equipment.

579
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:07,700
Only a few people in the world can do it.

580
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,100
There's this bunch of people
in California who can do it.

581
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:12,200
There's this bunch of people
in Switzerland who can do it.

582
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,040
US normal astronomers don't have
that kind of expertise and equipment,

583
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,120
but measuring a change in
brightness of a star by 2%,

584
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,983
that easy.

585
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,860
I can do it up on the up on Science
Hill in our little observatory up there.

586
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:25,221
In fact,

587
00:19:25,221 --> 00:19:26,960
I have done it for this star.

588
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,850
Uh,

589
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:28,683
you can,

590
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:29,211
uh,

591
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,100
if the timing were better,

592
00:19:31,101 --> 00:19:32,750
this star is up in the summertime,

593
00:19:32,751 --> 00:19:33,590
unfortunately.

594
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,380
Uh,

595
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,140
and if it were up in the fall,

596
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:40,730
we would have this be an exercise in astro
one 55 because it's entirely straight

597
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:44,480
forward to go and measure a 2%
difference in brightness in a star.

598
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,020
Uh,

599
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,770
anybody,

600
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,160
you know,

601
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,890
with 2000 bucks worth of equipment,

602
00:19:48,891 --> 00:19:51,350
you can go out into your
backyard and do this experiment.

603
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:53,180
This is a big deal.

604
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,100
So as soon as that was possible,

605
00:19:55,101 --> 00:19:56,390
everybody got fired up.

606
00:19:56,391 --> 00:19:56,721
You know,

607
00:19:56,721 --> 00:19:57,350
I'm going to park,

608
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,180
I'm going to play this game myself.

609
00:19:59,270 --> 00:19:59,591
Uh,

610
00:19:59,591 --> 00:20:03,680
and we all laid very elaborate plans
for going out and finding zillions of

611
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:04,340
planets.

612
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:09,340
And the problem is that it has to be
exactly aligned edge on for this to even

613
00:20:10,011 --> 00:20:10,844
occur.

614
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,260
And so most,

615
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,780
most stars with planets,

616
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,220
this doesn't happen.

617
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:17,503
And so,

618
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,250
uh,

619
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,240
you would have to observe many,

620
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:20,631
many,

621
00:20:20,631 --> 00:20:21,740
many stars,

622
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,120
uh,

623
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,050
in order to see this one time.

624
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:24,883
So you have to,

625
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:25,280
yeah.

626
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,310
While it's easy to do for
any one particular object,

627
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:28,970
uh,

628
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,090
it's hard to discover them this way
because you have to do it in bulk.

629
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:32,570
A,

630
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,490
you have to look at many stars,

631
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,060
uh,

632
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,893
at once.

633
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,940
So then people thought,

634
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,810
well,

635
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,380
great,

636
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,520
we know how to do this.

637
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,380
We'll look at many stars at lunch.

638
00:20:42,381 --> 00:20:45,890
We'll take pictures of star clusters of,

639
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,370
uh,

640
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,200
where there are lots,

641
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,130
lots of stars.

642
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:48,481
Uh,

643
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:51,700
and we'll just keep taking pictures of
these star clusters over and over again.

644
00:20:51,701 --> 00:20:54,100
You'll look at 30,000 stars at a time,

645
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:54,621
uh,

646
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:57,130
and if one of them has a dip,

647
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,300
we'll find that dip.

648
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:02,290
And so the way we'll deal with the fact
that this doesn't always occur is by

649
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:03,790
looking at star clusters.

650
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,190
Uh,

651
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,890
and so they tried this again,

652
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,310
uh,

653
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,910
with the space telescope because it
works better at doing this kind of thing.

654
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:12,760
The problem with star clusters is the
stars are really close to each other.

655
00:21:12,761 --> 00:21:14,740
So from the ground it
just looks like a mush.

656
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,220
Uh,

657
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,740
in this case you have to
see the stars separately.

658
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,520
So,

659
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:18,671
uh,

660
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:19,230
they took,

661
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:19,530
uh,

662
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,040
uh,

663
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,480
uh,

664
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,400
a particular star cluster also the
advantage of doing it from spaces,

665
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,510
no day time,

666
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,111
uh,

667
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:28,240
and so you can observe continuously.

668
00:21:28,241 --> 00:21:32,530
So they took eight consecutive days
of Hubble Space Telescope time and did

669
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:37,531
nothing but look at a star cluster cluster
called fit famous cluster called 47

670
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,831
37.

671
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:39,140
Sergeant,

672
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,850
they took repeated images of this
star cluster and they figured,

673
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:43,450
uh,

674
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,500
we ought to see,

675
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,100
uh,

676
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,100
some number of a planet by the
transit method first in this cluster.

677
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:51,090
So just,

678
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,420
here's what the cluster it looks like.

679
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,703
Um,

680
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:58,300
so this on the left is a ground
based picture of this cluster.

681
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,840
And you can see what the problem with
observing this stuff from the ground is.

682
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,540
If you look down in the middle
and it's all mushed together,

683
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,690
you wouldn't be able to
pick out individual stars.

684
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,910
But then this box here,

685
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,530
uh,

686
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,850
blown up to the right
hand side of the picture.

687
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:16,240
This is what that little box looks
like from the Hubble Space Telescope.

688
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:20,830
And now you have the resolution
to observe each of these stars,

689
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,210
uh,

690
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,020
or many of them individually.

691
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:26,290
And so they took eight nights of
spa Hubble space telescope time.

692
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,340
That's a lot of time,

693
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:27,790
uh,

694
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,680
on the space telescope in space.

695
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,020
Telescope cost about a million
dollars a day to run a,

696
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,770
and so this is 8 million
bucks worth of observing time.

697
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,053
Um,

698
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,590
okay,

699
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,380
so what did they expect to see?

700
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,663
So

701
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,070
finding

702
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:49,960
yeah,

703
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,290
planets directly,

704
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,213
uh,

705
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,040
from transits

706
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,060
and so the observe

707
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:05,620
a cluster of stars.

708
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:06,980
Okay.

709
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,900
30,000 stars at a time.

710
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,300
So what do you expect?

711
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:12,811
Well,

712
00:23:12,811 --> 00:23:16,500
it turns out from the
Reggio philosophy studies,

713
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,150
they'd gone and looked at a lot of,

714
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:18,421
uh,

715
00:23:18,421 --> 00:23:19,830
sort of sunlight stars.

716
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:20,640
Uh,

717
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,750
so 30,000,

718
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,910
more or less sunlight stars,

719
00:23:23,911 --> 00:23:24,960
I should specify,

720
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,070
uh,

721
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,430
from the radial velocity measurements.

722
00:23:29,431 --> 00:23:30,720
From the doppler measurements,

723
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,960
they got answers like
approximately one out of 10 stars.

724
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:40,500
This is a rough estimate.

725
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Have hot Jupiters and then how aligned
to do they have to be a approximately one

726
00:23:49,731 --> 00:23:53,360
out of a hundred hot Jupiters.

727
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:54,790
Okay.

728
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,770
Is Aligned.

729
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,100
Yeah.

730
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,000
Properly,

731
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,370
uh,

732
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:02,240
to get a transit.

733
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,550
And so now you have a prediction.

734
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,290
You look at 30,000 stars,

735
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,520
a 10th of them have
planet that's 3000 planet,

736
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,010
uh,

737
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:13,251
one,

738
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:16,970
100th of those will be lined up in
such a way that you can see a transit.

739
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,660
Uh,

740
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,150
that's 30 transits predict.

741
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,240
Okay.

742
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,260
30 transits.

743
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:24,430
Yeah.

744
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,280
And it was that kind of calculation.

745
00:24:27,281 --> 00:24:28,570
This is just a rough estimate,

746
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:30,250
but they had done this
much more precisely.

747
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,340
It was that kind of
estimate that persuaded,

748
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:33,940
uh,

749
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,330
the,

750
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:34,780
uh,

751
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,250
people at the Space Telescope
Institute to allocate all these,

752
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:39,760
uh,

753
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,650
all these many hours of space,

754
00:24:41,651 --> 00:24:42,700
telescope time to,

755
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:43,534
to this project.

756
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:44,741
Uh,

757
00:24:44,741 --> 00:24:45,640
the result,

758
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,150
yeah.

759
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:49,250
Was Zero transits,

760
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,373
none,

761
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,203
not seen.

762
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,500
And this was a little distressing except
it didn't take people very long to

763
00:24:57,501 --> 00:24:59,570
figure out that they should
have known this in advance.

764
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,793
Uh,

765
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,401
and,

766
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:01,940
uh,

767
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,600
this is,

768
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:02,841
you know,

769
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:06,890
you get a result and then of course
people and you get an unexpected result.

770
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:08,690
And then people start
writing papers which say,

771
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:08,901
well,

772
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:09,734
of course,

773
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,210
that's what you should have gotten.

774
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,370
Any fool could have predicted that you
would not see any transits in a cleaner

775
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,280
star cluster.

776
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,020
Uh,

777
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,590
except none of the fools did.

778
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,663
Uh,

779
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,230
let's see.

780
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,390
Uh,

781
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,970
so,

782
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:23,180
uh,

783
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,490
but in retrospect it was clear that this,

784
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,930
that this wasn't going to,

785
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,620
uh,

786
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,190
uh,

787
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,650
give you the thing you thought
because of two factors.

788
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,930
First and Co why?

789
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,771
Uh,

790
00:25:33,771 --> 00:25:35,990
so first factor in clusters,

791
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,910
the stars are really close together.

792
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,313
Stars,

793
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,220
uh,

794
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,750
they sometimes collide,

795
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:42,740
uh,

796
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,530
or more often have near collisions.

797
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,450
And when a star comes cruising
into your planetary system,

798
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,520
the star has a lot of gravity.

799
00:25:53,521 --> 00:25:56,760
It's going to completely wreck the orbits
of the planet because you're going to

800
00:25:56,761 --> 00:25:58,530
have the gravity of a second star.

801
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,730
And it turns out that what this
does is it liberates the planet.

802
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:03,910
And so yeah,

803
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,390
will,

804
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,100
uh,

805
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,970
disrupt

806
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,780
planetary orbits.

807
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:15,650
So you kind of don't expect
there to be any plant.

808
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:16,820
You expect it to be planets.

809
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:17,654
In the cluster,

810
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,020
but there'll be free floating planets
sort of wandering around the cluster

811
00:26:21,021 --> 00:26:26,021
because they will have been detached from
their parents star by incoming stars,

812
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,873
uh,

813
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,140
by close encounters with
other stars in the cluster.

814
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:30,700
Uh,

815
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,100
uh,

816
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,933
put it this way,

817
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,060
the nearest star to
the sun beside the sun,

818
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:35,390
uh,

819
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,520
Alpha San is about a parsec away,

820
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:38,270
uh,

821
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:41,810
in a cubic parsec at the center
of one of these clusters,

822
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,560
there are a million stars.

823
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,281
Uh,

824
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:46,230
and so there are a million stars,

825
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:46,670
uh,

826
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:51,150
packed into the space where only one
star exist in our corner of the galaxy.

827
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,290
So they run around,

828
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:52,621
you know,

829
00:26:52,621 --> 00:26:53,610
if you were in a cluster,

830
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:56,280
if you were in a planet on a cluster
and you're looking up at the sky,

831
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:59,880
the constellations would change from
year to year because the stars are so

832
00:26:59,881 --> 00:27:00,650
nearby,

833
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:00,810
uh,

834
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,670
that their motions would
be readily apparent.

835
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,660
And once every few hundred million years,

836
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,140
a Star would come cruising into your
solar system and detached or all of the

837
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:11,330
planets from the style.

838
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,590
So you don't expect
there to be any planets.

839
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,873
Uh,

840
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,290
you also don't expect
there to be any planets.

841
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:19,020
For an entirely different reason,

842
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:22,650
which is one of the things
that had been discovered,

843
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,251
uh,

844
00:27:23,251 --> 00:27:26,340
as they were piling up
all these hot Jupiters,

845
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,120
uh,

846
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,120
found by the doppler shift method is that
stars are more likely to have planets,

847
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:36,810
yeah.

848
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,190
Have Planet

849
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,640
if they have high amounts,

850
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:44,641
uh,

851
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:45,840
of heavy elements,

852
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,180
heavy elements.

853
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,321
Now,

854
00:27:52,321 --> 00:27:53,154
let me explain that.

855
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:53,550
Uh,

856
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,490
most stars stars are

857
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:57,880
okay,

858
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,810
mostly.

859
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,020
Okay.

860
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,220
Hydrogen and helium.

861
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,260
Okay.

862
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,093
Uh,

863
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,200
astronomers do chemistry
in a very peculiar way.

864
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,160
Uh,

865
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,730
we,

866
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,563
uh,

867
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:12,750
have we considered there three
kinds of things in the universe.

868
00:28:12,751 --> 00:28:13,790
There's hydrogen,

869
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,050
there's helium,

870
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,160
and there's metal,

871
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,330
uh,

872
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,020
chemists.

873
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,220
Everything else is a metal.

874
00:28:19,221 --> 00:28:20,570
I don't care if it's oxygen,

875
00:28:20,571 --> 00:28:21,081
carbon,

876
00:28:21,081 --> 00:28:21,780
whatever.

877
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:21,951
Uh,

878
00:28:21,951 --> 00:28:24,410
the chemists get really
uncomfortable with this.

879
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,543
Uh,

880
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,120
but,

881
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:26,271
uh,

882
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:26,840
you know,

883
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,651
it's like the,

884
00:28:27,651 --> 00:28:27,921
the,

885
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:28,340
the,

886
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:28,790
the,

887
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,030
uh,

888
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:31,190
supposedly to primitive tribes.

889
00:28:31,191 --> 00:28:33,140
I'm not sure if this actually exists,

890
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:34,580
but the linguists say there are,

891
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,100
there are tribes in the
world where they count one,

892
00:28:37,101 --> 00:28:37,521
two,

893
00:28:37,521 --> 00:28:38,360
and many.

894
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,440
Uh,

895
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:39,920
well,

896
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
this is how a straw,

897
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,660
I don't know if such tribes exist except
for the astronomers who really do,

898
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,261
uh,

899
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:46,670
and we count one,

900
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,600
one,

901
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,170
two,

902
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,940
and Manny and do we call a any
chemical elements heavier than helium?

903
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:53,690
A metal.

904
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,230
Uh,

905
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:57,760
so we have this concept
called medalists city,

906
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:06,310
which is defined to be
the fraction of something.

907
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,210
Of elements.

908
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,000
Yeah.

909
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,833
Heavier.

910
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,570
Yeah.

911
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,980
Then hydrogen and helium.

912
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:13,500
Okay.

913
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,480
Which are the first two
in the periodic table,

914
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:16,350
as you probably know.

915
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,030
So everything else is a metal.

916
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,010
The metal Felicity of the sun.

917
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,143
Uh,

918
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,223
sons,

919
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,550
medalists city.

920
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:25,270
Yeah.

921
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,480
It's about 2%.

922
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,231
Uh,

923
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:28,781
and the metal,

924
00:29:28,781 --> 00:29:31,260
the city of the solar system
is therefore about 2%,

925
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,030
because the sons got all the mass,

926
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,163
uh,

927
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,910
and high medalists,

928
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:37,770
city stars,

929
00:29:37,771 --> 00:29:38,970
by which I mean metal.

930
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,560
These greater than the sun,

931
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:46,160
greater than solar are more,

932
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,210
okay.

933
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,043
Likely.

934
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,250
Okay

935
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,870
to have planets.

936
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:53,790
This makes perfect sense.

937
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,460
This isn't the first thing in a
little while that's made any sense.

938
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,330
Uh,

939
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,140
because,

940
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:58,710
uh,

941
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:01,260
how do you make a planet what
planets aren't made out of?

942
00:30:01,261 --> 00:30:02,250
Hydrogen and helium,

943
00:30:02,251 --> 00:30:04,110
planets are made out of the other stuff.

944
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:04,530
Uh,

945
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:07,140
we're made out of silicon and iron,

946
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,621
uh,

947
00:30:07,621 --> 00:30:07,951
and,

948
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:08,401
and,

949
00:30:08,401 --> 00:30:08,491
uh,

950
00:30:08,491 --> 00:30:09,420
the Jupiter,

951
00:30:09,421 --> 00:30:10,650
it's got a lot of ice.

952
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,520
And so all these kinds of
heavy elements you don't make,

953
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,850
you can't make a planet if all you've got
is hydrogen and helium because there's

954
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:19,290
nothing solid to,

955
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:19,650
to,

956
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,461
to have it for them.

957
00:30:20,461 --> 00:30:23,010
And the only way you get to
keep your hydrogen and helium,

958
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:28,160
the 98% of the stuff that hydrogen and
helium is if you already have a big core

959
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,490
of heavier,

960
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:29,970
uh,

961
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,980
either rocks or ice or something else,

962
00:30:31,981 --> 00:30:35,290
if you already have some metallic
in the astronomical sense,

963
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,210
uh,

964
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:36,810
core.

965
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,160
And so this makes perfect sense.

966
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,580
Uh,

967
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,170
if you don't have any metals,

968
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,060
you can't be forming planets.

969
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,400
And Star clusters of the,

970
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,160
of the kind that a humble observe,

971
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,260
uh,

972
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,260
are known.

973
00:30:49,261 --> 00:30:51,300
And this particular one is,

974
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:52,800
uh,

975
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,060
to consist of low medalists
city plan a stars.

976
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:00,470
Uh,

977
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,230
in the case of a 47 talk,

978
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,100
the one we looked at,

979
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:04,880
uh,

980
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,430
it's the medalists city of the thing is,

981
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:08,150
uh,

982
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:08,900
uh,

983
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,700
I think about a fifth that,

984
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:11,301
of the Sun.

985
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:15,620
So it's got very substantially
fewer heavy elements.

986
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,070
So no planets.

987
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,190
So in two different ways,

988
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:23,450
this was a mistake,

989
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,500
right?

990
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:24,831
Uh,

991
00:31:24,831 --> 00:31:26,750
but that was only realized afterwards.

992
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:30,320
And it's unfortunate that it was a mistake
in two different ways because if it

993
00:31:30,321 --> 00:31:32,720
was a mistake in only one different way,

994
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:37,370
you would have learned something from
this because you would have confirmed the

995
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:39,340
idea that uh,

996
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:41,590
star close stellar encounters,

997
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,430
strip planets off of stars,

998
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,280
except maybe it's only because of the,

999
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:49,700
the low metal listening or you would have
confirmed the idea that low medalists,

1000
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:52,190
the stars can't have
planets except in this case,

1001
00:31:52,191 --> 00:31:53,480
maybe it's just because of the,

1002
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,170
the stars.

1003
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,520
The planets had been stripped away.

1004
00:31:55,521 --> 00:32:00,470
So it's kind of unfortunate that there
were two excellent explanations different

1005
00:32:00,471 --> 00:32:03,740
from each other about why you should
have predicted this result before you

1006
00:32:03,741 --> 00:32:04,574
obtained it.

1007
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,630
Uh,

1008
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,171
however,

1009
00:32:06,171 --> 00:32:07,220
having done that,

1010
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,043
uh,

1011
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,660
it was clear what the
next experiment had to be,

1012
00:32:11,661 --> 00:32:15,710
that you want it to go out and try and
measure these transits in some region

1013
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:19,490
that's a little less dense and
a whole lot more metal rich.

1014
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,470
So next experiment,

1015
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,900
which was done last summer,

1016
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,403
uh,

1017
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,260
didn't look at a star cluster.

1018
00:32:30,261 --> 00:32:31,400
It looked at the center,

1019
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:33,920
a region close to the
center of the galaxy.

1020
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,680
So this is lots of stars.

1021
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,370
Okay.

1022
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:45,060
But significantly less dance.

1023
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,220
Okay.

1024
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,053
Then,

1025
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,440
uh,

1026
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,030
then what you would get in,

1027
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:50,780
uh,

1028
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,410
uh,

1029
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,910
in the center of a cluster.

1030
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,150
Okay.

1031
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:55,360
Uh,

1032
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,230
fortunately they'd put up a bigger camera
into the space telescope since then,

1033
00:32:59,231 --> 00:33:00,280
so you could cover more,

1034
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,271
more of the sky,

1035
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:02,110
which was useful.

1036
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,450
Uh,

1037
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,310
this is the camera,

1038
00:33:03,311 --> 00:33:03,731
by the way.

1039
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,600
You may have read,

1040
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,140
uh,

1041
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,950
over the weekend,

1042
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,160
uh,

1043
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,990
Hubble's had a little bit of a problem.

1044
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:08,590
Uh,

1045
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:12,230
the electronics in this a wide
field camera have shorted,

1046
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,990
have shorted out,

1047
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,883
and so,

1048
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,580
uh,

1049
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:18,430
Hubble's kind of in
trouble until they get the,

1050
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:18,850
uh,

1051
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,090
the next visit because it's
major cameras now blind.

1052
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:22,720
Uh,

1053
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,231
and,

1054
00:33:23,231 --> 00:33:23,351
uh,

1055
00:33:23,351 --> 00:33:24,190
this happened,

1056
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:25,024
I should say,

1057
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,390
uh,

1058
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:29,560
12 hours after the deadline
for submitting proposals.

1059
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,370
Uh,

1060
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:35,370
so there had been almost a
thousand proposals submitted
from around the world of

1061
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:37,900
which may be only a fifth
would ever get done.

1062
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:38,530
Uh,

1063
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,350
people in our department and basically
every department in the whole,

1064
00:33:41,351 --> 00:33:41,501
uh,

1065
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:43,210
astronomy department in the whole world.

1066
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,520
We're going nuts trying to prepare their,

1067
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:45,900
uh,

1068
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,700
detailed proposals for using
the thing they submitted them.

1069
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,650
And a few hours later it broke.

1070
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,640
Uh,

1071
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:56,080
and so then there was this nice little
email from the people at the Space

1072
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,470
Telescope Institute saying,

1073
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,340
uh,

1074
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:02,970
you might want to reconsider and we've
created a new deadline three weeks from

1075
00:34:03,401 --> 00:34:08,080
now so that you can revise and extent
there are other instruments that still

1076
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:08,530
work,

1077
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,030
but not the camera's aren't as good.

1078
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:10,480
Uh,

1079
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,670
and so now everybody's scratching
their head and thinking,

1080
00:34:12,671 --> 00:34:13,870
can I actually do this?

1081
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:15,130
And if I can,

1082
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,360
what's the good strategy?

1083
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:20,650
Do I want to try and do it now when the
competition is going to be much less

1084
00:34:20,651 --> 00:34:25,651
because the instruments are lousy or do
I want to wait until after September,

1085
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:29,920
2008 when they're scheduled to go up and
replace the camera and repair the thing

1086
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,050
and try and do it with
the good instruments?

1087
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:33,940
Then when everybody else in the world,

1088
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:35,620
there's going to want
to do their experiment.

1089
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,221
Uh,

1090
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:38,710
and so we're all grappling
with this at the moment.

1091
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:39,341
However,

1092
00:34:39,341 --> 00:34:41,410
last summer this was working like crazy.

1093
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,101
Uh,

1094
00:34:42,101 --> 00:34:42,640
and,

1095
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:42,821
uh,

1096
00:34:42,821 --> 00:34:46,570
they did another one of these 10
consecutive days of observations,

1097
00:34:46,571 --> 00:34:48,310
but this time of the center of the galaxy,

1098
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:51,490
which has lots of stars but less dense
than in the center of the cluster,

1099
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:54,520
and also has the advantage
that many of these stars,

1100
00:34:54,521 --> 00:34:57,310
most of them are high
medalists city stars.

1101
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,243
Okay.

1102
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,020
Uh,

1103
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,310
hopefully this'll work,

1104
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:04,870
right?

1105
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,180
Uh,

1106
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,260
because you've eliminated both of the
excellent reasons why it didn't work the

1107
00:35:09,261 --> 00:35:10,094
last time.

1108
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:10,730
Uh,

1109
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:15,320
so here is the field of view that they
were looking at this as a tiny piece of

1110
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,520
the center of the galaxy.

1111
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,310
Lots and lots and lots of stars,

1112
00:35:19,311 --> 00:35:20,960
which is good because
you want to see them.

1113
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,850
And these little circles here,

1114
00:35:22,851 --> 00:35:26,180
which are numbered from one to 16,

1115
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:27,014
I believe,

1116
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,830
uh,

1117
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,500
our circles around little sunlight stars,

1118
00:35:30,501 --> 00:35:33,020
you can see the stars in
the middle of those circles.

1119
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:34,540
You probably have a
hard time seeing what's,

1120
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,570
let's turn the lights down.

1121
00:35:35,571 --> 00:35:36,860
This is kind of a nice picture.

1122
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,123
Uh,

1123
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,770
this is what the center of the galaxy
looks like to the Hubble Space Telescope

1124
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,240
and,

1125
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,360
and these bright things,

1126
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:46,194
it's called it.

1127
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,240
The colors are sort of quasi real.

1128
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:48,870
Uh,

1129
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,261
these,

1130
00:35:49,261 --> 00:35:53,090
these things are red giant
stars and solar type star.

1131
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:56,310
It's the center of the galaxy quite
far away are really quite faint.

1132
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:57,240
You can barely see it.

1133
00:35:57,241 --> 00:35:59,190
See in the middle of this a circle,

1134
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:02,580
there's a little star there that's a
sunlike star in the middle of the galaxy.

1135
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,650
And these circles are the
stars in which they found,

1136
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,910
um,

1137
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:10,260
uh,

1138
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,910
in which they found Trantis.

1139
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,260
So in this case it worked.

1140
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,500
So it's true that one or the other,

1141
00:36:16,501 --> 00:36:18,600
or both of those reasons they had,

1142
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:20,310
why it didn't work in the star clusters,

1143
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,240
uh,

1144
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,073
uh,

1145
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:25,020
were in fact the reason it
didn't work in the star clusters.

1146
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:27,540
Cause here's a situation where
those problems don't exist.

1147
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,700
And now they found 16 of these things,

1148
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,160
which is pretty close to the
amount you would have expected.

1149
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:32,881
Uh,

1150
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:34,050
and so now,

1151
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:34,890
uh,

1152
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:35,723
it is,

1153
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,300
uh,

1154
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,500
these are planets which have been
discovered first by the transit method.

1155
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,580
I should say.

1156
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:45,120
There are a couple of others that have
been discovered first by the transit

1157
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:45,760
method,

1158
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,021
uh,

1159
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:49,200
from people at the ground just going
out and looking at random stars.

1160
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,910
And in some of those cases they have then
done the opposite thing and gone back

1161
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:57,510
and found the radial
velocity measurements after,

1162
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,020
uh,

1163
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,540
having discovered the Tra
the planet by transit.

1164
00:37:00,541 --> 00:37:03,900
You can't do radio velocity on these
guys because they're too faint.

1165
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:04,950
Uh,

1166
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,750
and uh,

1167
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:05,940
you,

1168
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,130
your,

1169
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,380
it's just not going to work out.

1170
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,343
Okay.

1171
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,183
Uh,

1172
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,243
how are we doing?

1173
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:17,863
All right.

1174
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:21,223
Now,

1175
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,910
a couple of consequences of this.

1176
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:24,853
If

1177
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
you have both radio velocity measurement,

1178
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,920
which tells you the mass of the planet,

1179
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,193
okay.

1180
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,410
And transits,

1181
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,760
which tells you the radius of the planet,

1182
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,321
then you know,

1183
00:37:56,321 --> 00:37:57,490
something very important,

1184
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,211
you know,

1185
00:37:58,211 --> 00:38:00,730
the density density,

1186
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,480
then you get the density.

1187
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:10,590
Density is usually written down with
the Greek letter row for some reason,

1188
00:38:11,051 --> 00:38:12,100
which I don't understand,

1189
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,660
but it's always done that way.

1190
00:38:13,661 --> 00:38:14,680
So we'll do it too.

1191
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:15,963
Uh,

1192
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:21,030
and density is defined as mass of
something divided by its volume.

1193
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,460
Uh,

1194
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,580
and so for a spherical object,

1195
00:38:27,581 --> 00:38:28,414
the volume,

1196
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:28,690
uh,

1197
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,520
if you go back to some geometry book,

1198
00:38:30,521 --> 00:38:31,360
you can look this up,

1199
00:38:31,361 --> 00:38:34,330
four thirds pi times the radius cubed,

1200
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,330
and that's the density.

1201
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,710
The density.

1202
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:39,603
If you,

1203
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,740
the density of water

1204
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,950
is about what is one gram
per cubic centimeter.

1205
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:53,040
Yeah,

1206
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,361
of course.

1207
00:38:53,361 --> 00:38:54,800
That's a lousy set of units.

1208
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:58,340
We do things and
kilograms per cubic meter,

1209
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,000
uh,

1210
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,410
that as it turns out,

1211
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,980
a thousand kilograms per cubic meter.

1212
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:06,240
So,

1213
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,650
uh,

1214
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,450
if you picture a cubic meter,

1215
00:39:08,451 --> 00:39:09,830
that's a pretty huge aquarium.

1216
00:39:09,831 --> 00:39:11,060
It actually is pretty heavy.

1217
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,320
Uh,

1218
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:13,851
and,

1219
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,684
uh,

1220
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:15,883
uh,

1221
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,251
let's see,

1222
00:39:16,251 --> 00:39:17,084
is this right?

1223
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,140
Uh,

1224
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:18,951
10 to the two,

1225
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:20,630
10 to the six times a gram?

1226
00:39:20,631 --> 00:39:20,781
Yeah,

1227
00:39:20,781 --> 00:39:21,590
that's right.

1228
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,423
Um,

1229
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:23,691
and,

1230
00:39:23,691 --> 00:39:23,841
uh,

1231
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:24,430
in fact,

1232
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:24,720
uh,

1233
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,640
interestingly enough,

1234
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:27,490
this is the definition of a grab.

1235
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:29,690
This is where they came up with that,

1236
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:30,350
uh,

1237
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:35,350
that metric unit is to make it work out
so that the density of water is one is

1238
00:39:36,201 --> 00:39:38,330
exactly one gram per cubic centimeter.

1239
00:39:38,331 --> 00:39:40,430
You'd have to specify the
temperature too because,

1240
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,270
uh,

1241
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,510
uh,

1242
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,080
but,

1243
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,261
uh,

1244
00:39:42,261 --> 00:39:42,801
so that's,

1245
00:39:42,801 --> 00:39:42,960
uh,

1246
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,080
that's a typical density of water,

1247
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,910
which is an ice right?

1248
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,520
Rocks have higher density,

1249
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,880
much higher density.

1250
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:01,020
That's why a handful of iron is heavier
than an equivalent sized handful of snow

1251
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,990
a or something like that.

1252
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,233
Um,

1253
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:08,200
so if you know the density,

1254
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:13,201
you can tell something
about the composition of the
planet and it turns out that

1255
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:16,090
the hot Jupiters,

1256
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:17,790
uh,

1257
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,800
in the few cases we now have,

1258
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:20,910
it's not just one case,

1259
00:40:20,911 --> 00:40:21,990
it's several cases.

1260
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:26,310
Hot Jupiters have low density,

1261
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:27,490
okay?

1262
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:30,340
They really are ice balls.

1263
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,530
They're not made out of rock.

1264
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:40,360
And so an ideal you might've had about
where the hot Jupiters come from as well.

1265
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:42,580
In these high medalists city stars,

1266
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:46,600
there's just a whole bunch more rock and
earth like planet to kind of get big.

1267
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,530
Uh,

1268
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,730
but that isn't what happened.

1269
00:40:48,731 --> 00:40:50,410
These things really are made out of,

1270
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:50,890
uh,

1271
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:55,570
out of ice and now you have a problem
because you know how far away they are

1272
00:40:55,571 --> 00:40:59,020
from the star and the
temperature of these things.

1273
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:04,720
Surf at the surface temperature of
these things is like a thousand degrees.

1274
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:06,250
Okay?

1275
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,010
This is not a good
place to put a snowball.

1276
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,293
All right?

1277
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:10,811
Uh,

1278
00:41:10,811 --> 00:41:12,610
you put a snowball in some place,

1279
00:41:12,611 --> 00:41:14,050
which is a thousand degrees.

1280
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:14,441
Uh,

1281
00:41:14,441 --> 00:41:16,000
we won't specify the place,

1282
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,020
uh,

1283
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,270
and something bad is gonna happen to it.

1284
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:20,200
Uh,

1285
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:20,890
now,

1286
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:21,370
uh,

1287
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:22,060
the,

1288
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,900
and so therefore,

1289
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:25,530
how could these planets have formed a,

1290
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,190
and so the idea of the current,

1291
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:27,700
uh,

1292
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,410
current thinking on this

1293
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,860
is an idea called migration.

1294
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:36,223
Okay.

1295
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:41,030
And the idea behind migration
is that you make Jupiter's,

1296
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,130
uh,

1297
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:47,400
in the outer solar
system where they belong

1298
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:54,370
and then through some mechanism which
people have ideas about but which aren't,

1299
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:58,790
isn't at the moment really specified
these things after they are formed,

1300
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:03,080
they migrate into the inner solar system.

1301
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:10,660
And the reason this is a useful
thing to do is that a big thing.

1302
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:12,340
Okay.

1303
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,900
Melts slowly.

1304
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:18,310
The reason for that is
that the surface area,

1305
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:19,743
uh,

1306
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:20,360
yes

1307
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:22,940
to volume ratio is low.

1308
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:25,810
Okay.

1309
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:26,290
Uh,

1310
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:29,980
volume goes up as the cube of the radius.

1311
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,900
Surface area goes up as the square.

1312
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,300
If you shine a light on something,

1313
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,030
yeah.

1314
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,720
The amount of energy of picks
up depends on how big it is,

1315
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,040
not on how massive it is.

1316
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:39,690
And,

1317
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:40,510
and so,

1318
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,343
uh,

1319
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:45,740
changes of temperature in interacting
with your environment are,

1320
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:47,890
are less the bigger you are.

1321
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:48,551
This is why,

1322
00:42:48,551 --> 00:42:49,001
by the way,

1323
00:42:49,001 --> 00:42:52,830
Arctic animals tend to be big because
they're trying to survive in an,

1324
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,120
in an environment that's
much colder than they are.

1325
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,970
And so they generate energy by their,

1326
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,440
by their volume,

1327
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:02,710
and they lose it out their
skin by their surface area.

1328
00:43:02,711 --> 00:43:05,290
So you want to have a lot of volume
compared to your surface area.

1329
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:06,760
Big things melt slowly.

1330
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,420
Uh,

1331
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:12,220
so you can't have ice planetesimals
in the inner solar system,

1332
00:43:12,221 --> 00:43:15,400
but you can't have something the
size of Jupiter and it'll melt.

1333
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,620
But it'll take longer than the,

1334
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,250
uh,

1335
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:18,670
uh,

1336
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,300
then the age of the solar system or
even the age of the universe to do so.

1337
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,590
So this is the idea.

1338
00:43:23,591 --> 00:43:24,131
And of course,

1339
00:43:24,131 --> 00:43:26,230
the key point here is this migration.

1340
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:26,870
Uh,

1341
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,440
and there are ideas about
why this should happen.

1342
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,070
Uh,

1343
00:43:30,070 --> 00:43:32,170
but it isn't wholly clear.

1344
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:32,710
Now,

1345
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:33,543
one thing,

1346
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,220
a consequence of this idea,

1347
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:38,450
okay,

1348
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,920
is that there are no terrestrial planets,

1349
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,330
okay?

1350
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,380
No terrestrial planets.

1351
00:43:46,381 --> 00:43:48,900
Because as this Jupiter is moving inward,

1352
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,550
if there's an earth in the way,

1353
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,960
it's gonna either knock it out of
its orbit completely or the earth,

1354
00:43:54,961 --> 00:43:58,170
we'll run into Jupiter and become
incorporated into that planet.

1355
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:03,340
And so if you've got a Jupiter size six
to size system in near where your earth,

1356
00:44:03,871 --> 00:44:05,820
like planet is orbiting that Earth,

1357
00:44:05,821 --> 00:44:07,230
like planets in big trouble,

1358
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:08,010
uh,

1359
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:11,310
for exactly the same reason the
planets are in trouble in general,

1360
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:14,730
when another star comes through because
you've got something much more massive

1361
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,710
coming by screwing up your orbit,

1362
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:17,630
uh,

1363
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:19,080
so that no terrestrial planets,

1364
00:44:19,081 --> 00:44:19,920
their orbit

1365
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,533
are

1366
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,150
disrupted,

1367
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:24,760
uh,

1368
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,593
by,

1369
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:26,050
uh,

1370
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,280
the migrating

1371
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,553
Jupiter.

1372
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:30,801
Now,

1373
00:44:30,801 --> 00:44:31,634
in fact,

1374
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,410
I have to qualify this a little.

1375
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:39,060
There was a paper that showed up in the
literature a few months back with some

1376
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:43,620
clever way of preserving the terrestrial
planets as to Jupiter came by.

1377
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:44,200
Uh,

1378
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,120
I have to say,

1379
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:45,721
uh,

1380
00:44:45,721 --> 00:44:49,710
I don't fully appreciate
the force of this argument.

1381
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:50,430
Uh,

1382
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:54,000
it is perhaps true because I haven't
read the paper carefully enough.

1383
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:54,510
Uh,

1384
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:58,740
but I sh I feel obliged to mention that
somebody at least has an idea about how

1385
00:44:58,741 --> 00:44:59,574
you can avoid it.

1386
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,451
But in a,

1387
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:02,070
in sort of straightforward terms,

1388
00:45:02,071 --> 00:45:04,470
you don't expect there to
be terrestrial planets.

1389
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:05,070
Uh,

1390
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,630
in a situation where a,

1391
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,690
a Jupiter has migrated from
the outer solar system,

1392
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,480
the inner solar system questions,

1393
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:13,853
how are we doing?

1394
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,813
Uh,

1395
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:15,683
yes.

1396
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,610
What causes the hot Jupiters to migrate?

1397
00:45:20,611 --> 00:45:22,140
This is a subject of some,

1398
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:23,560
uh,

1399
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:25,980
some discussion among the experts.

1400
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,740
The idea is that when the Jupiter forms,

1401
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:31,170
remember it forms out of a disc of gas.

1402
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:36,290
There might still be a
substantial residual gas and
dust disk and as the Jupiter

1403
00:45:37,441 --> 00:45:38,700
plows through it,

1404
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:39,720
uh,

1405
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:44,670
the friction with that disc slows it down
and if you slow down the orbit of the

1406
00:45:44,671 --> 00:45:45,310
planet,

1407
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,120
it'll gradually fall in worked.

1408
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,330
That's one idea.

1409
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:49,380
There are some,

1410
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:49,770
there,

1411
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,180
there are other ideas,

1412
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:51,480
but,

1413
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:51,930
uh,

1414
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:54,510
it isn't clear and if it were clear,

1415
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,220
you would have predicted it to happen.

1416
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:56,731
And indeed,

1417
00:45:56,731 --> 00:45:59,130
there's a whole problem
with the migration theory.

1418
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,650
So problem with migration,

1419
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:04,143
okay.

1420
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:09,230
Is sometimes it doesn't work because
Jupiter in our solar system is where

1421
00:46:10,671 --> 00:46:11,510
Jupiter is.

1422
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:12,740
It didn't migrate.

1423
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,240
It has to work.

1424
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,330
Needs is,

1425
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:20,380
so the problem with the migration
system is it needs to work,

1426
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,180
but not always.

1427
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:29,420
It also can't work too well
because if it works too well,

1428
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:32,700
then the Jupiter falls right into the sun,

1429
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,080
right?

1430
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,600
So it has to work most of the time,

1431
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,740
but not all the time,

1432
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,910
but not too well.

1433
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,210
This is a complicated balancing act.

1434
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:46,111
Uh,

1435
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:48,900
and whatever theory you propose,

1436
00:46:48,901 --> 00:46:52,290
whether it's this friction with
a dusk disc or anything else,

1437
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,220
you've got a little problem
with this whole concept,

1438
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:56,760
uh,

1439
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,760
because you have to tune this mechanism
up so that it takes most Jupiter's moves

1440
00:47:03,541 --> 00:47:06,180
them into the older sister
interest inner solar system,

1441
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:10,230
and then stops working at just the right
point to leave you with a whole bunch

1442
00:47:10,231 --> 00:47:13,380
of hot Jupiters most
but not all of the time.

1443
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:16,560
All right.

1444
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,060
That's as much as we know about it.

1445
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:19,910
That's,

1446
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:20,191
you know,

1447
00:47:20,191 --> 00:47:23,340
you've got to come back three years from
now and see if we straighten this out

1448
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:24,840
because that's where we are at the moment.

1449
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:25,830
All right.

1450
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:26,340
More later.
