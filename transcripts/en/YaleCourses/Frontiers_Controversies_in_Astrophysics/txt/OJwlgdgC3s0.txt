Speaker 1:          00:00          I've been talking about a general relativity and it particular the post Newtonian relativistic effects. These are the first things that happen, uh, as the gravitational field become strong enough that, uh, uh, Newton doesn't perfect. Newton's laws don't perfectly apply. And let me just summarize those, uh, because we're going to see them all in action, uh, in just a minute. So here are the post Newtonian effect of general relativity.

Speaker 2:          00:34          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34          Uh, and the first of them is the precession of the Para helion just going to list these. And this was seen and, uh, in the 19th century already.

Speaker 2:          00:49          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Uh, and, uh, correctly interpreted by Einstein. Okay. Had to do with Mercury's orbit. I should say this word Para helion. Uh, that means closest approach to the sun. Uh, and so that only applies for planets. If you have the same, you can have the same kind of effect in binary stars are and other things, in which case, uh, you might, uh, they call it a Perry Asteron. That's the closest approach to a star that isn't the sun. Uh, or, uh, here's a favorite word of mine. Peric the lack TACAN.

Speaker 1:          01:26          I liked that one. That's the closest approach to a galaxy. Uh, you can have the, the other side of the orbit, uh, that is on 180 degrees away from the Para Galactica and that's called the [inaudible] con. Uh, and you are challenged to use that in a sentence at any time over break anyone who successfully does that, uh, uh, send me an email recounting the circumstances. I'll give you an extra point or something. Uh, all right. Uh, so, uh, procession of the pair of helium, that's, that's one post Newtonian effect. Uh, another post Newtonian effect is the deflection of light by mass just because mass curved space time. And so a light will follow a curve pass. Also, uh, this was first demonstrated in 1919 by the famous eclipse observations of Edington.

Speaker 2:          02:23          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:24          And it also, uh, is, has been manifested recently in the discovery of so called gravitational lenses of various kinds in which the, uh, appearance of an object is distorted by the fact that the light from that object has to pass by some other mass on its way to your eye. And so I have a couple examples here, which I'd like to show you of gravitational lenses.

Speaker 2:          03:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:02          Uh, this is the famous Einstein Cross, so called a, and what this is, this is just a, this is just a picture, uh, I think from the Hubble Space Telescope. And these four objects here, uh, are the same object. That's a quasar. Uh, it's just, uh, for this purpose of point of light in the sky, uh, but it's located, it's true. Location is behind this thing. This is much closer to you than any of these guys. This is a galaxy, uh, about, uh, partway between us and the Quasar. And what has happened is if there were no deflection of light, you'd see this quasar kind of right behind the galaxy. Uh, and in fact it would be hard to distinguish between the two. But what has happened is because there's this galaxy in the way, the light from the quasar starts coming this way and then bends around the galaxy and comes back toward us.

Speaker 1:          03:55          And the same is true up here and down here and down here. And so you get four different images of this quasar of the same quasar. And they know it's the same points are because they've taken spectrum the thing, and it's the exact same spectrum on all four of these things. And so these are just four different images of the same, uh, of the same object. And the reason they're not symmetrically distributed here is because the mass in this galaxy is not symmetrically distributed. And so depending on what path you take, you get different amounts of deflection. So that's a classic example of a Gravitational Lens. Yes, in principle, you could see it right through here. But there are two things about the path that comes right at us. Uh, there are two problems with that. One is, uh, that, uh, for various reason, these guys are all magnified. And the one that comes through the middle is d magnified. Second of all, it's right in back of the galaxy. Uh, but in principle there's a fifth one down in the middle. That's true.

Speaker 2:          04:58          Yes. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          05:05          Okay. So let me, let me pause here and tell you what a quasar is. A quasar is a quasi stellar object. What it is, is it's a very bright source right in the middle of a galaxy. And so it's actually a point source of light. It looks like a star. Uh, these things turn out to be what they really are. It turns out our massive black holes in the center of galaxies are creating, uh, creating material from the, from the galaxy itself. And so they, but they appear to be very bright nuclei of galaxies. And if you could look really hard, you could see the galaxy, the background galaxy around this thing. But in this particular case, it's way too faint to see, uh, the galaxy. It has a much larger extent, uh, because it's all the stars and all the stuff in the galaxies is not coming right from the middle, uh, and uh, this much closer than those. And so you can actually see that it's extended in this case. Yes.

Speaker 1:          06:05          Oh, it's not the black hole that submitting the light. It's the material falling into the black hole that gets heated up. I'll actually talk about this on Thursday a little bit. Other questions about the Einstein Cross here. Let me show you another one. So this is a Hubble space telescope. Picture of a cluster of galaxies. See all these different things, all these extended sources. Those are all individual galaxies, galaxies. It turned out come in clusters. Uh, and so here's a big bunch of galaxies and some of the galaxies you see here. Most of the galaxies, all these big ones are part of this cluster. This is a cluster that's relatively nearby to earth, but some of the galaxies are actually not in the cluster. They're much, much further away. They're in back of the cluster and these things, these sort of streaky things you see all over the place here.

Speaker 1:          07:00          Uh, what these are are galaxies. There are in back of the cluster of galaxies whose light has been lensed when it passes through the cluster of galaxies and it's been stretched. It's because what happened is this thing here, for example, uh, ought to be a tiny little galaxy that you can barely see here except the light from the top end of the, of that galaxy got bent up to here. And the light from the bottom end of that galaxy got bent down to here. Uh, and so all, and that's why they're all sort of in this kind of search. All these things are kind of circular around the center of this thing because this is a very, very massive galaxy. And that's the thing that's doing Melendez. And so it effectively distort the shape of the background galaxy. And you could see a couple more of them around this massive galaxy here.

Speaker 1:          07:50          Um, these, uh, are pretty, but they also can be used in order to understand, uh, the distribution of mass inside the galaxy cluster because the particular way in which these galaxies are distorted depends on how, how much mass there is in this galaxy cluster and how that mass is distributed. And so these are used to study the masses of and mass distributions of, uh, of galaxy clusters. And so this is a different kind of gravitational lensing. Uh, and finally, let me show you a joke. Um, this is, uh, a picture of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC. Uh, where there are a group of whether the, actually the Smithsonian astrophysical observatory is actually in Cambridge, Massachusetts. And there, there are a group of people who study gravitational lensing and they have taken this picture and imagined what it would look like if about halfway between where you're looking at this building.

Speaker 1:          08:51          There were a black hole, the mass of Saturn, uh, and here's what it looks like. A and all these distortions are simply due to the, uh, change in direction caused by the gravitational force of this imaginary black hole. Until you can see what happens. Uh, the black hole is sort of right down the middle here. Uh, and so off at the edges there's only a little bit of distortion. And then in the middle everything goes haywire. Uh, let me take this back a notch. Uh, take a look at these two central towers, this one here and that one. Uh, and so they're kind of, uh, what's happened here is that you're seeing light that has gone out and then been bent back toward you. So it looks like the towers over here, but look it, that same tower is down here. And so that's like from the tower that went, that went down and underneath the black hole and then got pulled back up to grow to reach your eyes.

Speaker 1:          09:49          So there are two paths from that tower to your eye and you can see both of them. Look at this thing here. Uh, what's that? Let me go back to the original picture. That's this statue. And what's happened is light from the top of the statue has gone up and over the black hole and come down towards you. Uh, whoops. Uh, and so here it is. Uh, and similarly, the clouds that were up here have been bent down, uh, have gone underneath the black hole and been bent back up so you can see them here. And so they worked out all the distortions of this. Uh, and uh, uh, so they like to show this kind of amusing picture. They actually had a movie, which I couldn't find on the, uh, on the net last night, which is too bad, where they take the black hole and they kind of move it across the front of this thing and you can see all the distortions coming up. Uh, and so you can have enormous fun with this kind of thing. Uh, needless to say, this is not, this particular picture has not ever actually been observed. That's calculated, not, uh, uh, not actually observed. Uh, but you can see the kinds of bizarre affects that gravitational lensing can create. Um, and as I mentioned, in some cases these are scientifically useful things because you can determine the distribution of the mass that's causing the lending questions. Yes.

Speaker 1:          11:21          Well, uh, what you have to do, it depends a little bit on the exact mass distribution of the lens. In this case, I think they're assuming a point source. And so, uh, it is in general true that if there's a gravitational lens, you end up seeing more light than you otherwise would because it's focused in towards you. So the total amount of light that you see if you're seeing a lens to object is typically larger than the amount you would see in the absence of Lens. So there are more paths of light that are curved towards you that are curved away from. If you're standing over on the side, you'll lose a little bit of the light because it will be curved in some other direction. Uh, and so there are more different way you can see the thing for, you know, it's uh, kind of an early 20th century art thing. You can see the same object from two different sides at once. Uh, and uh, you get these curious distortions. Yes.

Speaker 3:          12:14          If you're looking into a galaxy cluster in there, a lot of streets are a lot of galaxies and you don't know the mass of the galaxy. You're trying to turn it mass, the one that's causing it. Yeah. How do you know what strengths belong to which gallon?

Speaker 1:          12:28          What streets belong to which ground galaxies. Okay. You know that the streaks must come from galaxies that are located behind the galaxy cluster that are not themselves part of the galaxy cluster. Uh, and in order to understand what that streak is, in principle, you'd need to know the exact shape and size of that galaxy. You can go and take a spectrum of the thing and figure out how far away it is and what the relative distances are. Uh, but you in principle, you would need to know the exact shape of that galaxy before it was distorted, which you don't know. And so what you have to do to interpret these things is to take many streaks and assume that the galaxies that cause them are kind of normal, a normal distribution of galaxies, shapes. And so it's, it's more of a statistical process then using them one at a time.

Speaker 1:          13:15          In that case, the quasars are a little easier to deal with because you know that their points. Um, and uh, there's, there are various kinds of limits to how much information you can get out of this. And it's, it's, it's quite tricky to do. What's easy to do is the thing that they did in that picture. You imagine that there's a mass in the way and you figure out what happens to the light from the background. What's hard to do is to observe the light in the background, not know what it ought to look like, really and infer what the mass distribution is. That's a harder problem. And the, and there's a lot of theoretical effort at the moment going into trying to solve that problem of here's what you see, uh, infer what the mass distribution it has to be in order for you to see that. Yes.

Speaker 3:          13:58          Have we ever observed like, you know, sort of the perfect bun senior we have there, we have a ringer.

Speaker 1:          14:02          Yes, there are some Einstein rings. Uh, I don't have them here. Uh, Hubble Space Telescope has observed a bunch of these things. Typically they're not full rings because the mass distribution is not perfectly symmetric, but there are there, as you can see, you can see those were taught kind of little arcs. Uh, and if you get it set up just the right way, the arc can go a large fraction of the way around the circle. So these are kind of fun things to observe and also, uh, give you useful information. So that's the second of the post Newtonian effects. The first with the procession of the Perry Kilian. Now the deflection of light, uh, moving on, uh, number three here is what we talked about last time, which is the gravitational red shift. Uh, and here we have a delta lambda over lambda or alternatively, uh, in the case of the problems that you're working on the pulse period, uh, in either case, these are usually given the letter z. That's red shift.

Speaker 2:          15:12          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:12          That's a definition of this, this quantity Z, which is often used, uh, and uh, this is equal to this quantity. Uh, and this is the Schwarzer old radius

Speaker 2:          15:35          of,

Speaker 1:          15:36          uh, some mass.

Speaker 2:          15:40          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:40          And this are is the distance

Speaker 2:          15:46          of

Speaker 1:          15:47          the light source.

Speaker 2:          15:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          15:51          From that mass.

Speaker 2:          15:55          And

Speaker 1:          15:56          what this equation signifies is how much red shift is there. If you observe this thing when you are sitting at infinity,

Speaker 2:          16:10          do you observe from

Speaker 1:          16:16          infinite

Speaker 1:          16:20          distance? And what do I mean by infinite distance? What I mean is that rs over our goes to zero. That's what, that's what infinite. That's what infinite army did in this case. So you're sitting out there a long, long, long way away from any gravitational effect. You're looking at a light that is emitted inside a gravitational field, relatively close to some mass. That light is red, shifted by this amount. Uh, and pulse periods are also lengthened by the same amount. And I'll come back to that in a minute. Uh, one thing I want to say right now is what happens if you are an observer and you're not infinitely far away? What happens if you're just a little bit further away than the light sources or perhaps even if you're closer to the object than the light sources? Uh, and, uh, in that case, if the observer is not at infinity, then the observed red shift a is equal to the red shift, uh, from the source to infinity, which you can calculate by this calculated by this formula minus the red shift from the observer

Speaker 1:          17:43          to infinity, which you can also calculate with that same, uh, with that same formula. So you have to subtract a two things. Basically what happens is imagine the light going from, it starts out at the source, it goes to the Observer, and then it keeps going all the way out to infinity. And you want to ask, what is the observers? See, the observer sees that portion of the red shift that happens between the source and the Observer. So to figure out what that is, you figure out the red shift from the source to infinity. You figure out the retro from the Observer to Infinity, and you subtract those things, and that gives you the red shift from the Observer, from the source to the Observer. Okay? Yes.

Speaker 1:          18:30          Ah, no, no, no. But look what happens when rns over R is equal to zero. That means there's no red shift. That means there's no red shift. It doesn't mean that the way the observed wavelength is zero, it meets the change in the wavelength is zero. Yeah, that's important. Uh, and uh, in the, uh, just to comment on the problem set here, uh, the idea on the second part of the problem of the problem set is a, you do have an observer at infinity. So here's The Observer. Here's some neutron star and you have a light source that can either be on the surface of the neutron star or it can be raised off the surface of the neutron star. And, uh, basically what you're, what you're observing is the change in the light source. So this has some, has some red shift, some pretty large red shift cause it's sitting on the surface of a neutron star. This because it's further away from the neutron star has slightly less red shift. And what you are interested in is the change in the red shift. And the idea behind the problem is, uh, you want to set this up so that that change in the red shift is the same as the change in the red shift due to the doppler shift. If this whole thing was in orbit around something that's the plan of that, uh, that, that particular problem.

Speaker 1:          20:07          Okay. So that's the third, uh, uh, of the, uh, post Newtonian relativistic effects. And there's a fourth one. The fourth is gravitational waves, which, uh, I may have time to come back and talk about in detail. Uh, at the moment though, I just want to say what the effect of these things is. Uh, rather than talk in detail about what they are, the effect is that the orbital period decreases. Yeah. It turns out this is a relatively small, uh, and uh, it is not observed in the solar system.

Speaker 2:          20:53          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          20:54          Even, uh, even in mercury, which has the strongest relativistic effect.

Speaker 2:          21:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:05          So those are four, uh, post Newtonian effects of general relativity. And what I want to talk about now is what has become probably the best laboratory for general relativity, uh, that we know of Prom with general relativity. You can't actually study it all that much in the lab. Uh, because in order to study, you need strong gravitational forces and it's very difficult to create strong gravitational forces in a laboratory. Uh, what would you need to do? You'd need to take some massive object, crush it down to, you know, the size of a black hole or something and have it sit there and your lab. And this is not something that one can do. And so you have to go and look at astronomical objects in order to find suitable situations in which to study these relativistic effects. So the best lab for general relativity lab for g are here is uh, uh, a set of objects and one object in particular, which is referred to as the binary pulse are, uh, this is discussed in the readings for this week's problem set. Uh, the discovery of this particular object led to a Nobel prize for its discovers. Uh, and, uh, uh, uh, that's what's discussed in that article. So, uh, the first thing to talk about here is what is a pulse are. So Paul Stars were discovered in the late 19, uh, 1960s.

Speaker 2:          22:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:35          Uh,

Speaker 2:          22:38          okay.

Speaker 1:          22:40          A woman named Jocelyn Bell and she, uh, wired up a whole field in Cambridge, England to make the, to make it behave like a radio telescope and, uh, discovered that there were objects in the sky, celestial objects that seem to be emitting pulses of radio waves. So the observed signature of these things, what was observed his pulses of radio waves. So you get kind of a blip every few seconds it goes, blip, blip, blip, blip, and so forth. And, uh, these pulses come by. Uh, so the pulsations happen, uh, once, uh, it's sort of, uh, with, with a period of somewhere between milliseconds and 10 seconds. So they come at you pretty rapidly.

Speaker 1:          23:41          Most of them are a few seconds or maybe a fraction of a second. So these are blipping away and they had no idea what these were. And the first four of them, uh, they gave the nickname LGM one l g M to l g m three LGM for, for little green men. Uh, because the thought was that these might actually, they thought briefly that these might be signals from some extra terrestrial intelligence cause you know, it's a very regular signal. It's hard to imagine how those could have been created. But fortunately before they publish their paper, uh, somebody suggested a better solution, which turns out to be correct. That what these things are, are, uh, rotating a magnetized a neutron stars. And this was the first direct evidence that neutron stars existed. Uh, and the reason they thought they were neutron stars, this is because, uh, the speed with which these things pulsed, um, is supposed to be reflected in the rotation of these neutron stars.

Speaker 1:          24:43          And something that rotates 10 times a second had better be pretty small. Uh, and so there was a strong size limits on the neutron stars. Uh, it's not gonna matter too much exactly what these things are. Uh, but I'm going to explain it to you anyway, but don't worry too much about it for the purposes of relativity. The key point here is that it's an extremely accurate clock, that you get these blips coming out of the thing and that creates a very accurate clock and then you can see very small changes in the pulse rate of these things. So now let me just briefly tell you what these are. Oh, I should mention, uh, so, uh, the discovery of neutron stars, this was a very big deal. This was the first strongly relativistic object that had ever been discovered and they awarded a Nobel prize to Joslin Bells, thesis supervisor, uh, and there is some feeling among some folks that this was an injustice.

Speaker 1:          25:38          Uh, and so there is, uh, people discuss the, uh, the story of Jocelyn Bell and the discovery of, of Paul SARS. Uh, to her credit bell has never complained a bell and the discovery of pulse. Ah Ha. Oh yes. Well, that's actually an interesting question. The question is, did the thesis advisor do anything as a thesis advisor? Myself, I take that question seriously. Well, this is the whole debate about, well, who should have gotten the Nobel prize? It, the thesis supervisor thought up the experiment and Bell did it. So who ought to get the credit for that? Uh, it's actually a subtle question and it bears on a problem for or whatever it is of, of this week's a, of this week's homework. So it's worth thinking about. Uh, Jocelyn bound the discovery of pulse. Ours, uh, he also got the money. Uh, that's not trivial sometimes. Uh, and the moral of the story too, it depends on who you ask for exactly. The reason that you bring up a one moral of the story is the Grad students, particularly female Grad Students, uh, never get any credit

Speaker 1:          26:54          and that this is a great injustice. Uh, as you get older, your attitude toward this problem changes. Uh, and uh, the alternative moral is that, uh, thinking and doing a is not the same, are not the same, and that thinking is better than doing, uh, now, uh, what could raise various objections and people have a, to this line of thought. And interestingly enough, the next time they had to give a Nobel prize for something to do with Paul starts, which was the discovery of the binary pulse are uh, they did give the prize also to the graduate student and it's the graduate students, uh, description of what he did that you're actually reading for this problem set. So you can opine on this, uh, uh, this topic yourself, uh, for, uh, on the problem set anyway. Um, a, a, a matter of continuing controversy in scientific circles. Uh, but let me just briefly show you what supposed to be happening here. Here's a neutron star.

Speaker 2:          27:59          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:00          Very dense thing. Yeah. And it's rotating. So it's got some access of rotation here. Take a different color. So here's its axis of rotation and it's rotating around its axis and it's also got a magnetic field. But the magnetic field, the poll of the magnetic field is not the same as the rotation pull. That's true on the earth as well. Magnetic north is not exactly in the same place as, as true north, the center of the Earth's rotation. And if you're in northern Canada and you try and follow a compass signal north, uh, you're going to get yourself into big trouble because you know, the, the actual magnetic pole is somewhere in northern Canada. And if you're north of that, you'll be going south when you think you're going north. Uh, anyway, imagine that. Here's the magnetic fields. Magnetic fields have these sort of field lines that look like this. Uh, and uh, what happens in these things is that there's radio emission coming out of the magnetic poles. So there's radio emission coming out this way. And so, uh, if you're observing this from here, say, uh, you see a radio emission when the poll was pointing towards you, but then, uh, if the thing is rotating, then half a rotation later, so later,

Speaker 2:          29:22          uh,

Speaker 1:          29:23          but not too much later because this thing rotates really quickly. Uh, here's the neutron star still and now the pole's over here because it's rotated around by a factor of two, uh, by, by half, by half a rotation. So now the radio emissions coming this and if you're still sitting observing the thing down here, you don't see anything. So this is on and this is off. So you watched this Paul, it started like a lighthouse. You know, a lighthouse has a beam of light and when it's pointing towards you, you see light. And then as it's going around in a circle, you don't see light, then it points towards UGC light again. And so the consequence of this is that you get something that looks like radio. If you plot radio emission versus time, you get these very regularly spaced blips. Uh, and it is the time between one blip in the next. That's the uh, pulse period,

Speaker 2:          30:22          pulse period.

Speaker 1:          30:25          And so for our purposes here, I mean, pulsars are very interesting objects, but we're not going to go into them in any depth as objects. The key thing is that it's got this really accurate clock on it. And when, if you imagine a pulse are in orbit around something, when it comes towards you, each one of these blips happens a little closer to you. So the light travel time from the blip to you is less. And so it seems like the blips happened closer together because each one of them's emitted a little closer towards you. Similarly, when it's going away, each blip is emitted a little further away. It takes extra time to get to you. And the pulse period, the length of time between the pulses appears to be longer by how much, uh, by exactly the amount that the doppler shift formula, uh, would suggest. And so the pulse period obeys the same rules, uh, in terms of its length as a wave lengths of light.

Speaker 2:          31:24          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:27          So, uh, for example, it is true that a delta pulse period over pulse period a is equal to the usual doppler shift formula.

Speaker 2:          31:45          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          31:47          Which is approximately equal to VR oversee, uh, in the Newtonian approximation. Oh, and I should say in problem one on the problem set, you can use the Newtonian approximation because as you'll discover, the velocity of the object as it goes around in its orbit is significantly less than the speed of light. Okay. So they discovered this binary pulse are with a short orbital period. The orbital period. This is now the orbital period, uh, is around eight hours, which is pretty short, but it's still not very relativistic, but you can measure these things. Two, incredible accuracy,

Speaker 2:          32:38          okay?

Speaker 1:          32:40          So you can not only see the velocity curve that we're used to, you can also see tiny deviations from the Newtonian velocity curve. And from those tiny deviations from the Newtonian velocity curve, you can see these posts, Newtonian effects, uh, in particular, it turns out, so this is an ellipse. It's in an elliptical orbit. It's not a circular orbit, it's a highly elliptical orbit. And you can see the precession of the Perry Asteron as the elliptic city as the direction of the orbit. As the position of the orbit changes, you can see the procession of the Perry Asteron and the procession of the Perry Astro. It happens at the rate of four degrees per year. Now compare that to mercury in which the same effect can be observed at 43 arc seconds per century. So this is a much stronger effect.

Speaker 2:          33:47          Okay?

Speaker 1:          33:48          Uh, okay. You can also see the gravitational red shift. Now, let me show you how this comes about. Uh, but you, you have to be careful about exactly what you're seeing. You're not seeing the gravitational redshift due to the fact that the clock is sitting on a neutron star, uh, because, okay, so you're seeing

Speaker 2:          34:22          the effect of the

Speaker 1:          34:26          companion object of this other object in the system, which happens to be also a neutron star, but not a pulse are. And what happens is this, here's your clock and it's going around in some kind of elliptical orbit. Uh, here's the center of mass. Here's the other. So there's a clock that's going around like this, and then there's some other object. It's going around like this.

Speaker 2:          34:57          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          34:59          there are approximately the same mass. And so sometimes these objects are close to each other. Uh, for example, oops. Here, when they're here and here, uh, this is called this position one, and then later on, half an orbit later, they're out here in position two, and this one's gone all the way out to here.

Speaker 2:          35:26          Okay?

Speaker 1:          35:26          Uh, so at position one, uh, the objects are close and sold. The clock has to, uh, go is red shifted by the presence of the other object. Uh, and so it has to, uh, if there's a red shift due to the other object, which is nearby, objects are close. So the red shift,

Speaker 2:          35:54          yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:54          Caused by the other object, other object is large.

Speaker 2:          36:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          36:05          At position two, the distance to the other object as much greater distance is greater. And so red shift is less.

Speaker 1:          36:23          Now, it's also true that there's a red shift cost by the fact that this clock is sitting on a neutron star. But the thing about that red shift is it doesn't change during the course of the orbit. So you can't actually tell that it's there because that's one of the differences between measuring pulse periods of, uh, of Paul Stars and measuring wavelengths of light with the spectral features in, in light. You know, what it's supposed to be. If it isn't red shifted in the case of the pulse, ours, you don't know in advance what the pulse period ought to be. So you can't tell what it, what it should be if there was no gravitational field or was no doppler shift. All that you can tell is the amount by which it changes during the course of an orbital period. And so you're comparing, uh, uh, the red shift when the objects are in this position to the red shift of the objects in this position, the red shift caused by the pulse are itself, doesn't change, but the red shift caused by where it's companion is and the gravitational force exerted by the companion does change.

Speaker 1:          37:26          The consequence, by the way, is that if these things are in a circular orbit, you can't see the gravitational redshift cause they're always the same distance away from each other. And the gravitational redshift doesn't change. There is a gravitational red shift, but it doesn't change during the course of the period. And it's the change that you can observe. Yes.

Speaker 2:          37:45          So it just gets red ship docked to the frequency of the light in the pulses is,

Speaker 1:          37:52          it's the time. It's the time between pulses. Uh, yeah. There you could imagine that the pulses might have a spectral feature. And then you would, then you would see it in the spectral feature too. In fact, that's extremely hard to have that. That doesn't happen. It's, it's a, it's a continuum, a of light. So it's the type, what you observe is the time between pulses and that's a can be observed extremely accurately. You get 20 decimal places of accuracy. It's really kind of frightening.

Speaker 2:          38:21          Yes.

Speaker 1:          38:29          Well, if it's a circular orbit, know if there's a circular orbit, they're always the same distance around each other. They're chasing each other in a circle. That's what it means to be a circular orbit. Has every point on the orbit is the same distance to the center for both objects. So each object is the same distance from the center of mass at all times. That's what makes it a circular orbit. And they're always on the opposite side of the center of mass. So the distance between them is always the same. For a circular orbit, I'll draw it. Uh, here we go. Here's the center of mass. Supposing these objects are the same mass as each other. So here's one of them. It's going around this way. And here it is right now. And here's the other object. It's going around this way and here it is right now. And they're just going to march around this circle. Each being on the opposite side of the center. And the distance between the won't change. Oh, they only overlap if there, if the two objects are the same mass. Uh, so if one object is more massive than the other, then you've got a little circle going this way, uh, and wipes and a big circle going this way. Uh, let's see. It would it have to be there and then they're still the same distance from each other at every point along the way because each one of them is always the same distance from the center of mass in the middle. And they're always on opposite sides.

Speaker 2:          39:56          Okay.

Speaker 1:          40:00          Ah, so the way you lips his work is, so here's an ellipse and the lips can be bigger little, here's an ellipse they're doing ellipses, and the center of mass is at one focus of the ellipse. It's not at the center of the ellipse. That's the key thing. Uh, and so at, when they're your furthest away from the focus, you have a long distance from the center. When you're closer, you're closer. And it's because each one of these things, you don't maintain a constant distance from the center of mass. Okay? Uh, so because of this effect in elliptical orbits, in Binary pulsars and elliptical orbit, you can observe the gravitational red shift also. And this is what they got the Nobel prize for. Really. Uh, you can see that the orbital period decreases. It's getting shorter. The two objects are spiraling in together, decreases due to gravitational waves. So you can observe three different posts, Newtonian effects in these systems. So, uh, so this constitutes a serious test of general relativity in the following way. If you could do only the Newtonian only Newtonian measurements, what would you get? Well,

Speaker 2:          41:34          we did this before for the planets. What you can get out of a Newtonian measurement to velocity. Remember, what you're doing is you're measuring the doppler shift, you're measuring radial velocity. What you get is a, you can determine,

Speaker 1:          41:47          uh, m total, the total mass of the system. If you know the inclination, that's something we tended to leave out. We always claimed these things are edge on cause it makes the calculations easier. But in fact you get a different answer depending on what the inclination is and you don't necessarily know the inclination. So if you now measure,

Speaker 2:          42:09          yeah,

Speaker 1:          42:10          the precession

Speaker 2:          42:13          okay

Speaker 1:          42:13          of the Perry Astro then this also the amount of that also depends on m one m two the two masses and the inclination. So you can solve for the inclination now is it isn't actually precisely how you do it, but conceptually this is how it works. You're now solve for the inclination. You then know, uh, m total, but not each individual mass m one m two and the inclination, this is I, right, but you don't know the individual masses. Now, if both objects were pulsars and you could see both orbits, then you would also know, uh, the, the individual, uh, masses. But you don't, you only see one of these objects. Okay. So now the next effect is gravitational red shift. And this again depends in a different way. On m one m two and the inclination had, so now, uh, you can solve for m one and since you know they're the total mass, you also get him to,

Speaker 2:          43:47          okay.

Speaker 1:          43:47          So at this point, you know, m one m two and the inclination, what's happening here is that each time you measure an effect, you get an additional constraint. And you started out having a three unknowns and what equation? Uh, and of course you can't solve for three unknowns with only one equation, but then you observe two more effect. So now you have three unknowns and three equations. So now you can solve for all of these things. Now, you know, everything at this point you can predict what the period change should be because you know everything, then you can measure that. And so you have a specific prediction of created from general relativity. You can measure this effect, uh, and the prediction turns out to be correct to within the measurement terrorists and the measurement errors are getting more precise all the time because as time goes on, the amount of change in the period since they first observe it increases because the periods changing more, it's slowing down and slowing the period, the periods getting faster and faster. The object serve are falling in. Uh, and so over time, uh, that change mounts up, you can measure it better and better and better as time goes on. And so the precision of this test of general relativity is going up all the time. So it is now clear,

Speaker 1:          45:24          uh, that general relativity is a correct to some number of decimal places is, uh, I'm going to put correct in quotes because it depends how accurately you can measure it, but the accuracy is going up all the time in the post Newtonian approximation. Remember, all these affect our posts, Newtonian only actually, they've now observed a couple of post post Newtonian effect, which are the next, uh, the next term in the, uh, in the series expansion. But, uh, and those are also correct, but they're not measured as precisely yet. Uh, so, so it's clear that general relativity is correct as long as everything is, is still pretty close to, uh, um, it's still pretty close to the Newtonian thing. You can actually still have orbits, but you could imagine a theory which is like Newton, uh, in the first term of the expansion, like general relativity in the second term, the post Newtonian term, but different at very, uh, strong in very strong gravitational fields. So you've got to get the first term to work and it's got to come out like Newton, you've got to get the second term to work. It's got to come out like general relativity. But then, uh, you can imagine all sorts of different functions that work with this work with this and are different in the higher order terms. And the higher order terms are the things that give rise to all these exciting effects. Like, uh, it's like event horizons and things like that. So, uh, what would be nice, it would be good,

Speaker 1:          47:27          uh, to have some way of testing strong field effects. And by that I mean situations in which, uh, the Schwartz showed radius over our, uh, becomes close to one because in that case, all the terms in this series expansion contributing. And if you can get it, if the theory is right there, then all the terms have to be the same. And you don't have this nagging doubt about whether you could come up with some theory that looks like Newton in the same way that general relativity looks like Newton Buddies, different, uh, uh, once you get higher order terms, looks like general relativity and the second term, but turns out to be a totally different theory. Needless to say, the theorists have come up with a literally an infinite number of such theories because there's a whole infinite family of things which satisfy this, satisfy this and look different at the upper level. So, uh, what we're going to talk about next time is how one might go about, uh, testing strong field relativity. This is a subject close to my heart because it's what I do for a living. Uh, and we'll talk about it on Thursday.
