Speaker 1:          00:00          Welcome to part three of the course. Uh, this is going to be about cosmology. One of the most amazing thing that's happened over the past half century or so is that cosmology, which is, uh, the study of the universe as a whole, uh, has become a scientific subject. Uh, and something that one can say something about in scientific terms rather than merely philosophical terms. Uh, in recent years, in the past 10 years or so, uh, there's been a kind of a revolution in cosmology, uh, which has come about because of the discovery that the vast majority of the universe is made out of stuff, uh, that we have no idea what it is. So, uh, the discovery is we have no idea what the universe is made of. Uh, and that actually, you know, it doesn't sound so good. Uh, it sounds like this is a big failure of science somehow, but scientists are clever.

Speaker 1:          00:59          So we describe it differently. What we, what we claim is that what has happened is that we have discovered dark energy, dark energy. What is that? We don't have a clue. Uh, but, uh, it's most of the universe and we've discovered that it exists. Uh, and so that's kind of where we are right now. And what I want to do over the next, uh, four or five weeks is talk about the discovery of dark energy, uh, how that was done. And now that we know that it's there, but we don't know what it is, uh, what people intend to do about it. Uh, and, uh, this is, I should say only a relatively small fraction of modern cosmology. Uh, if you, uh, want to know about, uh, many of the other interesting things that are going on in cosmology, you have to take a whole course or several courses on this topic.

Speaker 1:          01:52          Such courses exist. Uh, I recommend Astro one 70 or two 20 if you find yourself interested in this kind of thing. But nevertheless, this one particular discovery, and in fact what I'm going to be focusing on is not just dark energy, but one particular way, uh, that dark energy, the first way. There are now other indications that it exists. One particular way in which dark energy has been discovered. And so it's a fairly narrow focus, uh, that I'll be taken care of. But that will be, that will enable us to get a, into some depth about how this discovery was made. So let me let you in on the secret before we even begin. Dark energy is something that you can't see that's sort of it's name. Uh, we've done this twice already, right? Uh, we've discovered planets around other stars, uh, that you couldn't see the planets.

Speaker 1:          02:45          How do you do that? You look at the star, the motion of the star. We've discovered the existence of black holes, uh, which of course you can't see. How do you do that? You look at the motion of some star that is influenced by the existence, the black hole. So what are we going to do about dark energy? Well, this isn't a hard to extrapolate a, what we're going to do is we're going to look at the motion of things that we can see and infer the presence of dark energy. And of course, how do we look at the motion? We look at doppler shifts. Uh, that will be another recurring theme. Uh, and, uh, so the plan of action here is actually not so different from something we've done a couple of times before, although the contacts and the implications and the particular details. Uh, needless to say, our, uh, okay. So let's go back in time, uh, almost 90 years back to 1920, 1920. So it's opposing one word to give a course in frontiers and controversies in astrophysics in the year 1920. Uh, what would one have been talking about frontiers and controversies? The big issue, uh, at least in terms of, uh, uh, cosmology, uh, was the question of the so called spiral nebulae.

Speaker 1:          04:13          These had been discovered over the previous few decades after the invention of photography, uh, allowed pictures of the sky to be created. And as people took pictures of the sky, what they discovered was all scattered all over the sky or these little spiral clouds, the so called spiral nebulae. What are these things? They wandered and in particular, where are these things? And there were two basic hypotheses. One was that these are sort of clouds, uh, shining clouds of gas. These were known to exist in other kinds of shapes, shapes. So these are, uh, clouds a of some kind of glowing gas, uh, and that they are part of our, so called galaxy galaxy comes from the Greek word for milk. It's basically Greek for Milky Way, the Milky Way as this band of, uh, stars across the sky. Uh, it looks like just a white street. You can't see it in the city with city lights.

Speaker 1:          05:20          Uh, you know, if you've never seen this, go somewhere dark, wait till the moon goes down, get your eyes adapted and look for the Milky Way. It's really very spectacular. Uh, if you really want to do this right, do it in the southern hemisphere. Um, because the center of our galaxy is down there. It's quite spectacular. Uh, anyway, uh, it had been known since Galileo's time, but what the Milky Way really was, was a band of stars. And so that there's this huge bunch of stars out there, uh, so faint, so packed together. We see it just as he continuous band of light. Uh, and so all these stars, that's our galaxy. Uh, and the question was, these spiral nebulae might be little clouds of something or other scattered around our galaxy. The alternative, uh, less popular at the time, but perhaps more spectacular is that these spiral nebulae are galaxies themselves. Our whole galaxies of stars, different from our own galaxy. These were sometimes referred to as island universes.

Speaker 1:          06:23          So the Milky Way is our own galaxy. And each one of these tiny little spiral things is a galaxy itself located much, much further away obviously than any of the stars that we can see. And you can, you can see that this is a question of some important in particular to how beat you think the universe is. If all of these, uh, uh, spiral nebulae are part of our own galaxy than maybe what the universe is, is, uh, is one galaxy. Uh, and at that time it was already starting to be known how big the galaxy was and so forth. Uh, but if each one of them's its own galaxy, then, uh, obviously the entire universe much be much, much bigger because it contains thousands, perhaps millions of individual galaxies. Each of them more or less like our own. So we know what the answer's going to turn out to be. Uh, this is correct.

Speaker 1:          07:22          But they didn't know that in 1920 and in fact, they staged what was called the great debate, uh, in 1920 between a very famous astronomer named Harlow Shapley, who was at Harvard, and he, uh, maintained that the a spiral nebulae must be part of our own galaxy. Uh, and so he had many good reasons to think this. There was a lot of evidence that, uh, these spiral nebulae couldn't be that far away. Uh, they must be really quite nearby. And so Shapley had in the true Harvard manner, uh, all of the right arguments and was completely wrong. Uh, and, uh, his opponent, a man named Curtis educated at Yale, but at that point were working somewhere else, turned out to be entirely right. Uh, but, uh, but totally lost the debate because he just didn't have that much evidence backing him up. Uh, so the intuition of the Yale man comes through. Uh, so this is a famous incident in the history of science. Uh, it garnered enormous attention at the time. Remember, this is a year after the eclipse expedition has verified Einstein's theory of general relativity. So people are pretty excited about modern science at the time. Uh, and this was reported widely in the press. So, uh, this is another one of our sort of science fables here. Uh, the great debate

Speaker 1:          08:52          and one version of the moral. This story might be a, you can have all the right arguments and still be wrong. Have many a good argument.

Speaker 2:          09:06          Okay.

Speaker 1:          09:06          Uh, and still be wrong.

Speaker 1:          09:11          Uh, as Mr Shapley, uh, turned out to be interestingly at the time in 1920, they thought, you know, it's going to take us a long time to, you know, really get to the truth of this. And that turned out not to be the case. Within just a few years after the debate had taken place. This problem was totally solved. And the man who solved it, uh, was, uh, perhaps the greatest, uh, observational astronomer of the 20th century, uh, a man named Edwin Hubble after whom a telescope was subsequently named. Uh, and what is, what helped solve this was simply better equipment. Uh, and in fact, starting kind of a trend that has continued for a century. Now what happened was, so a Hubble was out in California where there are nice, clear skies and, uh, persuaded a and a rich man to give a lot of money to build a really big telescope.

Speaker 1:          10:11          Uh, this was a hundred inch telescope. That's the diameter of the, uh, uh, uh, uh, the diameter of the, uh, mirror. This is actually still in use. Uh, although the site is no good cause it's way too near to the lights of San Francisco. But, um, uh, he took this brand new telescope, he looked at the spiral nebulae and he did the same thing to the spiral nebulae that Galileo had done to the, uh, to the Milky Way. He resolved it into individual stars and he could see the individual stars in these spiral nebulae and discovered in the nearest stuff, thumb, uh, that, um, uh, that they were made up of stars. And then you notice that the stars that were making them up were incredibly faint. And that even the brightest stars in these things were incredibly faint. And so he inferred the distance to these things by assuming that, you know, they're kind of ordinary stars, like any other kinds of stars except they're way, way fainter, and therefore they must be much further away. And this was compelling evidence that these spiral nebulae really were island galaxy island universes, galaxies like our own. And, uh, the key thing to do that is to have a telescope powerful enough to resolve, uh, some of the nearby examples into individual stars. So there are many galaxies. And this was known shortly after the great debate took place,

Speaker 1:          11:39          and that made the universe very much larger than people had previous leaks suspected because there are all these galaxies around. So Hubble was the great expert at observing galaxies. And so the next thing he decided, he would look at you guys, okay, now we know these things are galaxies. Uh, let's check out there. You know, he took doppler shift measurements. He's trying to figure out the motions of galaxies. Um, and so he discovered a very strange thing, namely, that they are all going away from us. Every galaxy he measured was red shifted. Uh, and so by, by the usual doppler shift interpretation of these things, they must all be moving away from us. And Hubble went further and he created one of the most famous diagrams in all of astronomy, uh, in which he plots red shift, uh, which is to say Z, which is to say a radial velocity divided by the speed of light, at least in the Newtonian approximation, which he was working in a versus distance. So he figured out how far away these galaxies are. We're, he measured their red shift. Uh, and what he discovered is that these things were very tightly correlated. So if you plot each galaxy, measure distance in a retro for each galaxy, for a large number of galaxies, what you find is that they line up like this.

Speaker 1:          13:22          This is the so called huddle diagram. And it's basically the thing we're going to be talking about for the next five weeks or so is huddled diagrams and what you can infer from them. Uh, and, uh, the huddle diagram can be sort of summed up a in an equation. If this is a straight line, then it must be true that the velocity of a given galaxy is equal to a constant, which was given the letter h for the Hubble constant times the distance. This is Hubble's constant

Speaker 1:          14:07          and uh, and, and that just basically says in Algebra what this says pictorially, uh, that there, uh, that these things line up in a straight line. Uh, the Hubble constant is an extremely important number. Uh, you measure it by creating these huddle diagrams and just measuring the slope of the line. Uh, and the, uh, primary scientific purpose of the Hubble Space Telescope, the largest and most expensive science project ever created was to get an accurate measurement of the Hubble constant. So all these beautiful pictures you see are byproduct. Uh, the purpose of the thing was to measure the Hubble constant accurately. There had been for many years a dispute over what the correct value was. This was resolved by the space telescope and other things within the past decade. Uh, and this was a big success. We now know what the Hubble constant is. It's measured in somewhat weird unit. Uh, it's, uh, 70 or so kilometers per second, per mega parsec. All right, now let's pause there for just a moment. Uh, you could see why they use this peculiar unit, uh, because you want it, they're measuring velocity in kilometers per second, and they're measuring distance in mega parsecs. Mega of course, uh, doesn't just mean big. It's a technical term. It means a million means 10 to the six parsecs

Speaker 1:          15:32          a parsec, you will remember it's about three light years, uh, or three times 10 to the 16 meters or three times 10 to the 13 kilometers. Uh, and so for each mega parsec that it given galaxy as a way. And notice now we've changed our units from parsecs, which we use for stars two mega parsecs. That's basically the change in the scale of the universe that came about when people realize that the spiral nebulae were galaxies. Uh, so now you have to talk about mega parsecs. In fact, now we also talk from time to time, I've got about Giga parsecs, which are billions of parsecs. Um, for each mega parsec that a galaxy is away from us, it moves 70 kilometers per second more away from us. So something that's 10 kiloparsecs away, uh, ought to be moving 700 kilometers per second. Something that's a hundred mega parsecs away would be moving 7,000 kilometers a second, uh, away from us.

Speaker 1:          16:32          And that's just an expression of what this relationship is. Humble by the way. Got this quite wrong. Uh, he, he, he, he correctly a line to the mall up. Uh, but his value for the Hubble constant turned out to be about 500 in these units, which was quite wrong. Uh, and we'll talk about that a why that was, uh, later on. But now, but by now with the Hubble Space Telescope, we totally know this. Uh, and that's a, an important result. Now, this is, this diagram and this relationship are basically the key to what we're going to be talking about. And so, uh, in fact, this relates to the fact that there's, this linear relationship tells you several things. It tells you that the universe is expanding.

Speaker 2:          17:17          Sure.

Speaker 1:          17:19          Uh, and, and because of that, it tells you that the, uh, indirectly there's other evidence that has to be brought to bear as well that the big bang exist. So this is the basis of Big Bang cosmology. I don't want to talk about that right now. We'll talk about the big bang on Tuesday. We'll have a whole big question and answer sessions. So bring all your questions about the big bang and cosmology. We'll do that all up on Tuesday. Uh, what I want to talk about now is much more mundane. Uh, namely how do you measure these points? How do you do this? How do you create this diagram? This diagram has these fabulous implications. Uh, but in order to understand what's going on, you'd better know, uh, how you get the diagram in the first place. Now, part of it's clear, the x axis, uh, we understand fairly well measuring,

Speaker 2:          18:17          okay

Speaker 1:          18:18          radio velocity,

Speaker 2:          18:20          okay.

Speaker 1:          18:22          Uh, that's easy. That's just the doppler shift.

Speaker 1:          18:28          So that comes directly out of a particular kind of measurement that you can readily readily do. Uh, the y axis is the biggest problem in all of astronomy. Namely, how do you measure the distance to something? And if you think about it, that's what this great debate was all about. Uh, some people thought that the distances to these spiral nebulae where a few hundred or maybe a few thousand parsecs other people's thought they were millions of parsecs away and it wasn't clear, which was right. And if you think about looking up into the sky, looking at stars in the sky at night, uh, it's, uh, you can see where there's a problem. You look up there, you see a bunch of stars, and suddenly one of them shoots across the [inaudible] guide to shooting star. Uh, they don't, except for the motion across the sky. They don't look that difference. And yet some of the, the, the fixed stars are, uh, hundreds of light years away. The planets, which looked much the same to the naked eye are, uh, you know, uh, uh, a million times closer and that shooting stars in the top of the atmosphere, uh, and it's very hard to tell, uh, what the distances when you're just kind of look up there. And so distance is hard.

Speaker 1:          19:51          And that's, uh, basically, uh, the problem I want to talk about for the rest of today's class. How do you measure distances? Yes.

Speaker 3:          20:00          You said, how do we know what the original,

Speaker 1:          20:06          oh, so how do you know what the original wavelength was? You make the assumption that, uh, atomic physics and chemistry are the same in the distant galaxies as they are here, and therefore hydrogen should emit lines at the same frequency as they do in the atmosphere. Now, uh, one of the things you can do if you don't like what the cosmological implications of things is you can say, well, rather than interpreting this as, as cosmology, let's just say that in distant portions of the universe, physics is different. If you go down that road, uh, you can get any answer you want. Uh, and this has been seriously discussed from time to time. Um, right? So how do you measure distance? That's the key.

Speaker 1:          21:01          Well, there's one and only one kind of direct where you could imagine doing this. Here's The sun, here's the earth going around the sun. Uh, earth. Uh, here is, uh, a nearby star and here are a bunch of other much further away stars. They were all scattered around the sky and you observe this nearby star, uh, during the course of the year. As the year goes on, you observe it repeatedly. You observe it from here, for example. Uh, and when you observe it from here, it's in this direction. Whoops, it's in this direction. And therefore it appears to be in that position relative to the other stars. Whereas when you observe it here, uh, it's, uh, in a little bit of a different position with respect to the other stars. It looks like it's here. And so if you observe this star repeatedly over the course of the year, it appears to move back and forth against the background of the other stars.

Speaker 2:          22:06          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          22:08          this is a triangle. A, we know what to do about triangles. You can measure this angle, uh, because that's just the angular separation of the two apparent positions of this star in the sky. We know this distance. That's one astronomical unit because this is the earth going around the sun. Uh, and then what we want to know is the distance to this star d, uh, let's call that d one. And we know the equation for this already. We've done this before. This is Alpha equals [inaudible] over d one, uh, where uh, d two in this case is exactly one astronomical unit. And you may recall that if you measure this in arc seconds and you measure this in parsecs and you measure this in a, you a, you get a consistent set of answers. Uh, and so, uh, uh, one the way it works out is one over Alpha in arc seconds equals the distance in parsecs. And the reason that works is because d two by this method is always equal to one astronomical unit. If you try this on Jupiter, uh, you have to account for the fact that Jupiter's further away, uh, this is called the parallax method.

Speaker 1:          23:35          It's common in surveying. You know, you look at the same thing from two different places. You can figure out distances by, uh, basically trigonometry here. This is it called the parallax method. Uh, and a parsec. This is the definition of a parsec is one parallax. Second, it's a contraction because you measure an arc second, and the distance, uh, is one part second. That is the definition of a parsec. That's why we use parsec is a distance measurement because it comes naturally out of this parallax method. Uh, and so that's a fairly direct geometric method. And you know, this is a surveying technique. This is how this is a straight forward way of getting the distance. And the problem with this is that it only works on things that are really nearby because we can measure, you know, uh, maybe a hundredth of an arc second change in position, uh, but no better than that. And so you can only get measurements of distances in this way out to a few hundred parsecs works to kind of maximum given our current instrumentation, uh, of a few hundred parsecs.

Speaker 2:          24:45          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          24:47          but the center of our Galaxy is 8,000 parsecs away. These other galaxies are mega parsecs away. We can't be measuring one, 1000000th of an arc second, at least not at the moment in terms of parallax. So this only works for the very nearest stars. And that's why, uh, there was all this confusion about the spiral nebulae because you know, if they were 500 parsecs away, you'd never be able to tell. So most other distance measurement methods of distance are some form of what's called the standard candle method. So here's how the standard candle method works. Uh, it's a three step process, uh, part one, uh, you look at something, you know, how bright something is, the bright something is, this is basically a version of what Hubble did when he figured out that the spiral nebulae must be very, very distant and must therefore be island university's, you know how bright something is. In the case of Hubble, uh, he's looking at the brightest stars in the galaxy. She figures they're about as bright as the brightest stars in our own galaxy. So he knows how bright they are. A part two, you measure, uh, how bright, uh, the object locks

Speaker 1:          26:23          take a picture of it or you count photons or whatever it is that you do and you figure out how bright it looks. Uh, and obviously it first something of a given brightness. The further away it is, the fainter it looks. And we know exactly how that works. It's a distance squared thing. If it's twice as far away, it's a fourth. It's a fourth as bright. If it's three times far further, it's one ninth that's bright. It goes as one over the distance square. Uh, this is a well known fact. Uh, you can, you can try this out with light bulbs at home. Uh, and uh, so if you know how bright it is and you measure how bright it, uh, uh, it appears to be, then you can compute the distance. Okay. Uh, and this is why it's called a standard candle. Oh yeah. So, uh, the way this is, how do you know this? That's the big question. How do you know how bright the thing is in the first place? Uh, and the answer is usually that is it that you're looking at something which is an example of a class of objects like stars or bright stars. Uh, who's

Speaker 1:          27:34          a brightness is no, that's why you use the term standard candle. Cause here's a bunch of things. They're all the same brightness. They all have the same standard candle power. Some of them look fainter than others. The ones that look fainter, obviously you have to be further away. And if you know the true brightness of this class of objects, you can figure out how far away any example of it is, uh, have to standard candles. Uh,

Speaker 1:          28:06          and the problem with this is this phrase here as you can pretty clearly see if you get it wrong, if you make the wrong assumption about how bright these objects are, you're going to screw this up completely. And that's what Hubble did. A Hubble was looking at a, a particular kind of bright star, uh, and which he thought he knew how bright it was and he was wrong. Uh, and uh, so he got the wrong Hubble constant now because he used the same kind of start in all his galaxies. He got it the same amount wrong for all these different galaxies. So they still lined up, they just lined up along the wrong track. Um, so it was still true that something that he thought was twice as far away as something else was in fact twice as far away as something else. He just got both of those numbers wrong by the same factor. Okay. Uh, this brings us to the, uh, awkward question of how do you measure brightness. And now we have to talk about one of the, uh, great impediments to learning astronomy. Uh, namely the magnitude scale, astronomers count brightness

Speaker 1:          29:31          upside down and logarithmically

Speaker 1:          29:36          and I am now obliged by my membership in the astronomical community to inflict this upon you. Uh, saw the magnitude scale. This is how we measure brightness. It's upside down in logarithmic and to the key, a numerical relationship, uh, that, uh, works. It looks like this. If you subtract the magnitude of one object from another, uh, that equals minus five halves times the log of the ratio of the brightnesses. Don't panic. Uh, alright. The magic word here is help sheet, uh, which will be posted later this afternoon. Uh, so this is a key equation. So let me, let me just define the terms. Uh, this is the magnitude of an object of, of two different objects. Uh, and this is the brightness.

Speaker 2:          30:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          30:35          Of the two objects whereby brightness, I mean, something sensible, like how many photons per second, uh, do you get from them or, or, or, or, or some other kind of a true measure of how bright they are. Uh, now, uh, this is a somewhat awkward equation because it's a relative equation. It doesn't tell you what the magnitude of either one of these things is. What it tells you is, uh, the magnitude of one compared to another. So in order to figure out the magnitude of something, you have to know the magnitude of something else. Uh, and so you need one other piece of information to have this be useful, which is that they have defined a particular star to have magnitude zero. Uh, the star Vega is defined, uh, to have magnitude

Speaker 1:          31:30          zero. Uh, and so if you start with thinker, you could figure out the magnitude of any other, uh, given object. Uh, and, uh, uh, I actually, this is now causing trouble because it turns out that in the far infrared Vega is variable. Uh, and that's kind of unfortunate for the basis of the whole magnitude system to turn out, to be variable. Uh, but they've coped with that in various ways. All right, let me pause and remind you of some things about Logarithms, uh, which you may have forgotten. What's the definition here? The logarithm of 10 to the x is equal to x. That's the definition of a logarithm. Uh, so, uh, for example, uh, the logarithm of three times 10 to the two a is equal to the logarithm of 10 to the one half. That's three times 10 to the two is equal to the logarithm of 10 to the 2.5. Because when you multiply to the x by 10 to the why you get 10 to the x plus y, uh, which is equal to two and a half.

Speaker 1:          32:46          That's an example. More examples on the help sheet, uh, just in general, the logarithm of tent city x times 10 to the y is equal to x plus y. Because when you add those together, that's how it works. Uh, the logarithm of 10 to the x divided by 10 to the Y is equal to x minus y. Again, because of the way, uh, logarithms multiplied together, uh, and the Logarithm, uh, let's see, 10 to the x rays to the nth power is equal to m times x. This by the way, is why logarithms are so incredibly useful. Uh, you should always do all your arithmetic and logarithms. Uh, you should just automatically convert everything in your head into logarithm. In fact, in the days before calculators, this is how people used to do arithmetic. This is how slide rules work, I should say. Uh, they mark the thing off logarithmically and then you're moving back and forth.

Speaker 1:          33:50          Uh, and people, you know, if you memorize like 10 logarithms of a few convenient numbers, you can do all sorts of calculations in your head because multiplication turns into edition, which is much, much easier to do. And so if you can convert things into logarithms in your head, then all you have to do is add numbers. That's easy. Uh, similarly taking something to the amp power, for example, taking the square root of a number or taking the cube of a number or something like that reduces down to multiplication. Uh, it's hard to take a square root of a number in your head, but it's easy to divide a number by two, which is the equivalent of taking a square root. So if you're thinking in Logarithms, all you gotta do is divide it by two, and you can amaze your friends by doing square roots in your head.

Speaker 1:          34:35          Uh, if your friends are the kinds of people who are amazed by that kind of thing. Uh, mine are, uh, and, uh, so I recommend this to you. You know, if you have to prove that you've learned something at college, uh, spend a half hour memorizing 10, 10 different logarithms. Did that just blow people's mind by taking square roots on bets? Uh, okay. Uh, or you can do problem sets in astronomy one 60, uh, for example, uh, Sirius, the star Sirius, which is the brightest star in the sky, uh, is about three times brighter, uh, van Vega. So what's its magnitude?

Speaker 1:          35:30          What's its magnitude? Well, uh, let's write down the equation. Magnitude of serious minus the magnitude of Vega is equal to minus five halves. Log of the brightness of serious divided by the brightness of Vega. Now, uh, uh, anytime you see three times brighter or 20 times fainter or any thing, uh, of that kind, what you're really talking about is a ratio. If serious is three times brighter than Vega, that means the brightness of serious divided by the brightness of Vega is three. That's what that statement means. Uh, and so we can just plug it right in. Five halves, log of three, uh, cause cause a serious is three times brighter than Vegas. So that ratio is equal to three. What's the log of three? One half. Thank you very much. Uh, this is equal to minus five halves. Log of 10 to the one half. You will remember that the square root of 10 is three. Uh, so, uh, three is also equal to Pi. But for, for for Logarithms, uh, the important thing is the three is equal to the square root of 10. And so this is minus five halves times one half a minus five fourths. Now the magnitude of Vega, we know that zero, so the magnitude of serious is equal to minus five fourths.

Speaker 1:          36:58          This is what I mean by the fact that the scale is upside down. Uh, the brighter the star is, the, the lower, or if it goes through zero more negative, the number becomes minus one is a brighter star, then zero zero is a brighter star, then two, two is a brighter star, then five and so forth. Uh, and so low numbers are bright. The magnitude of the sun obviously extremely bright. When we look at it turns out to be minus 26 and a half. Uh, and uh, uh, the magnitude of the faintest star that can be seen with the Hubble telescope is about plus 30. So, which is incredibly faint. Uh, and that by the way, is why again, why logarithms are such good news because the entire range of things we can see in this guy goes from minus 26 to plus 30. Those are numbers you can get your mind around. Uh, in fact, the difference in brightness between those things is a number that I can't even pronounce. Uh, and uh, uh, so much easier to deal with magnitudes. All right. Now that has to do with how bright things are, how bright things, how bright things appear to be, or how bright they are. But, uh, remember what we're trying to do, we're trying to compare how bright something is intrinsically to how bright it looks. And this gets you into the question of there are actually two kinds of magnitude. The intrinsic brightness of an object,

Speaker 1:          38:33          uh, is something called absolute magnitude, whereas the observed brightness is referred to as apparent magnitude. And now the astronomers screw you up again because we have different symbols for the apparent brightness, apparent magnitude, and the absolute magnitude, the absolute magnitude is given a simple capital m and the apparent magnitude is given the simple small m. And the problem is that you can't actually tell the difference between those two in my handwriting, uh, and probably yours as well. Uh, so, uh, this leads to untold confusion, but that's the way life is. Uh, and the relationship between these two has to relate to distance. Okay. Before we get there, the definition of absolute magnitude magnitude, you'll notice that in the previous comparison of serious to vague, I was talking about apparent magnitude, how bright it looks in the Scott absolute absolute magnitude is defined as the apparent magnitude. If the object in question, we're exactly 10 parsecs away.

Speaker 1:          40:05          So the sun has an absent, an apparent magnitude, as I said before, minus 26 and a half. But it's actually not that bright of a star. If you took the son out to a distance of 10 parsecs, its magnitude would be 4.7, uh, so, which is, uh, among the fainter stars you could see in the sky. Uh, and so the absolute magnitude of the sun is 4.7, even though it's apparent magnitude is minus 26 and a half. Uh, so it turns out, for example, that the star Sirius, uh, is about three parsecs away. And so, uh, oh, I haven't told you an important thing yet. We'll come back to this in a second. The problem set problem. Obviously he's going to be uh, how, what is the absolute magnitude of serious, but I, but I have to write down the formula first. Little m, that's the apparent magnitude

Speaker 1:          40:58          minus big m. That's the absolute magnitude, uh, is equal to five times the logarithm of the distance over 10. Parsecs. Now notice what happens if the distance is equal to 10. Parsecs then you've got the log of one. What's the log of one? Zero. Thank you very much because this is the log of 10 to the zero log of 10 to the zero is zero. And so if the log of this thing is zero, then right hand side is zero. So at a distance of 10, parsecs, the apparent magnitude is equal to the absolute magnitude cause m minus M is zero, which is exactly what the definition was. So that works. So example, serious. Uh, so how far, uh, so what is the absolute magnitude of serious?

Speaker 1:          42:00          All right, here we go. Uh, the apparent magnitude we figured out just a minute ago is minus five fourths minus the absolute magnitude, which is what we're trying to figure out a five times the log of three over 10, which is a third, uh, which is equal to five times the log of 10 to the minus one, half a three is 10 to the one half, one over three is 10 to the minus one half, which is minus five halves. But that five comes from here. The minus a half comes from here. Uh, so m is equal to five halves. Um, let's see. Minus five fourths is equal to five fourths. Uh, and that is the absolute magnitude. I'm sorry. Oh, oh, you want me to do okay? Sure. So we okay to here. So, oh a. Okay, fine. Um, luck. This is actually an important point. Log of a third. That's what we're going to try and do. A is equal to log of one over 10 to the one half a one over one over 10 to the n is equal to 10 to the minus. And that's the key thing. And so this is the log of 10 to the minus one half. That then means that five times the log of a third is equal to five times minus a half is equal to minus five halves.

Speaker 2:          43:53          Yes.

Speaker 1:          43:56          Uh, there are no unit. Yeah. Magnitude tutor. Just numbers.

Speaker 2:          44:00          Yeah. Yes.

Speaker 1:          44:08          Ah, well what I did w sorry, I skipped a step to start from that. Minus five fourths minus M is equal to minus five halves. So I multiply both sides by negative one.

Speaker 1:          44:27          Can I subtract five fourths from both sides? You got to keep the minus side straight to the easiest way to make mistakes. And this is to get the thing upside down and lose track of where your minus sign talk, which is really easy to do because the whole scale is backwards. So you know, minus five fourths is bright, uh, whereas five fourths is faint and so your one is constantly getting these things upside down. Be careful, uh, look at your answers to see it makes sense. If some incredibly think galaxy turns out to have a magnitude of minus 50, that's almost certainly wrong because that's much brighter than the sun. Uh, all right, so now, uh, now we can actually do a, the standard candle method. Here's the, here's the key problem. Uh, if you observe a star like serious and you, I don't know, you take it spectrum more or some alien comes down and tells you this stars just like serious or, or however you work this out. If you observe a star like serious and measure, it's apparent magnitude.

Speaker 2:          45:43          Okay

Speaker 1:          45:43          to be 8.75, how far away is it?

Speaker 1:          45:52          And now we're back to where we were 20 minutes ago before I started all this nonsense. Namely, we're trying to measure the distance of something which was the whole purpose as you may recall. Uh, so how far away is it? Uh, let's see. Em minus M is equal to five log d over 10. Parsecs. Uh, the apparent magnitude is 8.75 a the absolute magnitude. We just figured out his five fourths. 1.25 is equal to five, log d over 10. Parsecs and you'll notice I've chosen my numbers carefully because this is gonna work out well. Uh, this is 7.5 and I'm going to divide both sides by five 7.5 over five is equal to the log of d over 10 parsecs or 1.5 is equal to the log of d over 10. Parsecs. Now what do I do? Yeah, exactly. You have to take 10 to the power of both sides.

Speaker 1:          47:02          Uh, whenever you're stuck with log of something and you don't want the log of the something you want the actual something itself, what you gotta do is 10 to the 1.5 is equal to 10 to the log d over 10 parsecs 10 to the log of anything is equal to itself. So this is d over 10 parsecs. Uh, and thus it's 10 to the 1.5 30. Yes, 10 to the 1.5 is equal to 10 to the one times 10 to the half is equal to three times 10 to the one is 30. So 30 is equal to d over 10 parsecs add D is equal to 300. Parsecs. And for the person who asked about units, which was a very good question. This is where the units come back. It's because there's this 10 parsecs embedded inside the equation. And so the unit of length comes back here. And so that's how you measure distance. You know how bright something is probably by having looked at some other more nearby example, uh, you measure how bright it looks, you compare those two things and out pops the distance. So, uh, this is done usually in the form of what's called the distance ladder,

Speaker 1:          48:27          which we will talk about much more in section. So you'll get many more opportunities to do this nearby. Stars you measured the distance and parallax from the parallax method.

Speaker 2:          48:42          Okay?

Speaker 1:          48:43          Then you find examples of similar stars. Uh, you know, you measure, uh, the apparent magnitude,

Speaker 2:          48:59          okay?

Speaker 1:          48:59          You assume, uh, the absolute magnitude to be the same as the absolute magnitude for things you already know. The distance to you assume the absolute magnitude. Uh, Andrew compute

Speaker 2:          49:13          the distance.

Speaker 1:          49:16          This then gets you new. Uh, this tells you that you learned from this the absolute magnitudes of magnitudes of brighter things, not just stars, but whole galaxies, supernovae, all sorts of things, brighter things which you can then measure further away. And just to conclude, you can see pretty clearly that this method is fraught with potential problems because every time you go through this,

Speaker 1:          50:05          you know, that's a swear word in science, you're making an assumption and that assumption can lead you astray. And so the whole history of cosmology since 1925, using that work, uh, assuming, uh, the absolute magnitude of things for which you're trying to measure the distance, so you can put them on the Hubble diagram so that you can deduce the rate of the expansion of the universe. And thus its age and ultimate fate a. So it all rests on this little point embedded inside the standard candle, a which will be discussed at great length. Okay. That's it for today.
