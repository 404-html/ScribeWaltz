Speaker 1:          00:00          Last time my, uh, I wrote down the Schwartz Shield metric, uh, which was the sort of culmination of the theoretical part of the, uh, uh, uh, of this section of the course. And I realized as I was talking to some of you afterwards about, uh, uh, about some of the implications of this that, uh, the way I, one of the ways in which I wrote it down might've been a little confusing. So let me write it down again. Uh, and I'll say a couple things. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to write it down, uh, with a little r instead of a capital r. And I'll tell you why in just a minute. Obviously it doesn't matter. I've just changed the notation slightly. And the reason I want to do this is because I want to emphasize that this are the little r Wood I've now written down as a little r in this equation is not the radius of the object are, is just a coordinator.

Speaker 2:          01:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:16          It, uh, it can be anything. It's not the radius of the object, uh, for which the mass is giving you the swatch drilled radius. The Schwartz wrote radius is ups is a very specific ratings. Uh, R sub s is equal to two g m oversee squared. So that's a specific number or is the little r here is just to coordinate and so is uh, fi and theta, which combined into this thing which I've called Omega and t. Uh, and so, uh, if you have an object of mass am and radius, I'll give a, I'll call that a r sub zero, just to make sure that you understand that this is the radius of the object.

Speaker 1:          02:09          The radius of the object doesn't come into this metric. The mass does because the mass, uh, uh, turns into the Schwab radius and that's part of, that's part of the equation. But the radius of the object doesn't matter. And so if you then ask, well what is a black hole? A black hole is something in which, uh, the radius of the object is less than the Schwartz Shield radius. Because if that's true, then there is some coordinate are some little are where a little R is equal to r s and then if you go up into in into these equations here, very, these very strange things happen when little r is equal to rs. Yes. Question. Oh, you're right. You're right. It has to be the other way around. I'm sorry this has to be squared. You're right on both counts. Good. Uh, s over our rs over our, yes, it better be that way because our s over our in uh, in, in the normal part of spaces less than one. So thank you very much. Sorry about that.

Speaker 2:          03:19          MMM.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Okay. I think we're all, I think we're all right. Are we all right? Yeah. Good. Uh, okay, so there is some r where r is equal to rs and then these very bizarre things start to happen. If our zero, the radius of the actual object is bigger than a true our trilled radius, then that isn't true. There's no r where R is equal to r s then,

Speaker 2:          03:49          okay.

Speaker 1:          03:49          No are equal to rs. Now you might think that somewhere inside the object there would be a little R, which is equal to the Schwartz drilled radius. But that isn't a, that turns out not to be right either because the relevant m the relevant mass. Oh, sure.

Speaker 2:          04:12          Uh,

Speaker 1:          04:16          oh yeah.

Speaker 2:          04:19          Okay. So yeah, let me get this back.

Speaker 1:          04:24          The relevant mass, uh, is the mass

Speaker 2:          04:29          okay.

Speaker 1:          04:29          Inside are, so if you're, uh, if you've got some mass and like this and you're outside, if you're here then the whole of the mass counts. But if you're sitting inside this thing, then the only mass that counts is this mass here.

Speaker 2:          04:51          Uh,

Speaker 1:          04:53          and so for our, for coordinates, for positions inside the object, then the relevant mass that you put into the equation is less than the mass of the whole object. And the consequence of that is that as you go further and further inside the thing, the mass becomes less and less. Uh, and the Schwab chilled radius becomes less and less. And so it, uh, if the total size of the object is greater than the Schwab chilled radius, then there is no position,

Speaker 2:          05:40          uh,

Speaker 1:          05:42          inside the thing, which is less than the Schwartz drilled radius because the relevant mass decreases and soldiers, the Schwartz would radius as you go in toward the center of the object. So, uh, I just wanted to, uh, to make sure you understood, uh, that the, the key to using this metric is that the, the, this, our term in it tells you where you are. It has nothing to do with the size of the object, and you become a black hole when the size of the object is smaller than the Schwab chilled radius. Because under those circumstances, there's some position or set of positions, uh, where you can be inside the Schwab, chilled a radius, and therefore all of these very exotic effects start to happen. Questions on this or have I just baffled you further?

Speaker 2:          06:35          Okay.

Speaker 1:          06:36          Well, we'll see. Sorry. Oh, no. Yes. This is the radius of the object, son. His son has a, has a.in the middle. Not that you could tell with my handwriting, but uh, okay. I don't know whether that was helpful or not, but, uh, I felt the need to say yes please. Oh, this right here. Yeah. So, uh, uh, the situation is that what is the relevant m to put into this equation? This, this is true by the way, in Newtonian physics also, if you're inside an object, then the mass outside of your position, this stuff doesn't count toward the M and you only want to count, uh, the mass inside of where you are. Yeah. So this whole circle is an object object, uh, with, uh, mass and some with some mass in some radius. But now you're asking the question, what happens if you're somewhere inside this thing?

Speaker 1:          07:52          Yes. No. The dot. Well, the dotted line could be anything. You're at some position inside and this, the dotted line is, uh, the radius at which you are at which your particular position? No, it's just, it's just wherever you are inside the thing, less mass counts than you think it's going to because it's only the stuff inside your own radius that counts toward, toward the metric or toward the gravitational force. In the Newtonian thing you can be at whatever point you choose to be inside here, you can draw this same thing. And the, the point of this is that if you are now down in here where you thought the Schwartz Shield radius was going to be for the whole of this mass, in fact, the Schwartz showed radius is still going to be inside your position because much less mass will count toward it.

Speaker 1:          08:51          This isn't helping. I can tell by the look on your face. Um, okay. Let me try again. Let me try again. Okay, here's, here's an object, okay? And this object has r has a radius bigger than neutral Nutro Archbold radius, and it's got some mass. Okay, so now I'm going to draw in dotted lines. It's Schwartz Shield radius that's inside here. Okay? Now supposing you're inside this object, supposing you're living here, uh, then at that point, you, I, I draw this sort of interior radius here. And, uh, if I'm at this point, then I ask what is the, the Schwartz Shield radius that goes into the metric

Speaker 1:          09:47          for something that's sitting inside for person x here? And the answer to that is it's actually smaller than the Schwartz showed radius of the entire object because less mass counts only this mass counts towards the Schwab trilled radio. So there's some part of the object whose mass no longer counts because it's outside your position. And so as I move in here to some interior point, the Schwartzwald radius that is appropriate for me to use become smaller. Does that make more sense? Ah, so if I was a black, if it was a black hole, right? Okay. So now let's do the opposite case. Good question is less than the Schwab chilled radius. So now here's my object and here's the Schwartz chilled radius. That's the difference, right? And therefore, uh, uh, and the consequence of this, by the way, is that this whole object sinks down to a point because remember, things inside the Schwab showed radius have to contract down to a point. So I can't be part way through it, no matter what I do. Dan, you know, if I'm outside this, uh, this tiny little thing, if I'm here, I have the same short showed radius because all of the masses interior to my position.

Speaker 1:          11:24          So the key thing is, is the objects smaller or bigger than its own? Schwab, chilled radius, all the mass is going to be closer. All yeah, all, well, all the math, if the, if the radius of the object is smaller than a truck showed radius, then all the masses inside the Schwartz drilled radius and any point in our universe where, you know, and so all are greater than our s is out somewhere. And, and it doesn't matter where you are, all that mass counts because it's all inside the Schwartzwald radius anyway. And then when you get to this point, you have this magic moment where our equals r s and everything blows up. Right. And that can't happen here because as you move in in the middle of the object, the Schwartz showed radius strengths down away from you as you get in because less and less mass counts counts towards it. Therefore it gets smaller.

Speaker 3:          12:33          Yes. Would it be possible to have an optic that there, there would be a point at which you do it?

Speaker 1:          12:43          Okay. So could you have some incredible density gradient where you're actually gaining more, uh, uh, you're actually catching up to the Schwab chilled radius as you go in, in principle, yes. But if you work out what that density gradient would have to be, it would be incredibly, uh, it would be incredibly steep. Remember there was a problem set at some point where we discovered that, uh, the last mass, there isn't a black hole, the denser it has to be in order to be inside each war, chilled radius. So as you're losing mass, as you get down, uh, uh, in here, the amount by which it has to be denser on the inside goes up really sharply. Uh, but yes, such a thing can be imagined, imagined, for example, uh, a black hole with an atmosphere. Imagine there's some orange, some just gas floating around out here.

Speaker 1:          13:38          If you think of that as one object, then when you're outside the gas, if you think of the outer edge of the gas is the edge of the object, then, uh, that's not a black hole. And if you come on, you, you know, if you go down, sink down into the atmosphere, eventually you'll find it. So that's an incredibly steep, uh, density change because you've gone from an atmosphere to some object. So in principle, that's possible, uh, in, uh, any kind of real object that's holding itself up, probably not because the density gradient would have to be so severe.

Speaker 3:          14:08          Yes. How would this work?

Speaker 1:          14:11          How does it work for non spherical objects? Excellent. Uh, okay. So, uh, let's see.

Speaker 1:          14:21          What happens is, uh, if you have a non spherical at first of all, the gravitational forces are sufficiently strong near a, if you're anything close to a black hole that you're likely to end up spherical. The only way you don't is if you're spinning because then, uh, then you know, you, you, you bulge out at the center, uh, spinning black holes exist. They have a different metric and the, uh, uh, uh, the angular term becomes important because you're spinning around and there's, and it's a different metric and the shape of the event horizon where R is equal to r s or the equivalent in this other metric is non spherical. And so you can have nonspiritual event horizons if the thing is spinning because that has the effect of making the mass distribution different. Uh, and there as this is called occur black hole, it has occur metric k, e r r a and that's a different metric and it's got a whole other set of terms that have to do with the row, with the rotational, the angular component. Uh, but again, the same thing happens when you get to some place. All the terms blow up. Uh, but it's a non spherical surface where that occurs. You have to do it in cylindrical coordinates. It becomes a mess. Not that it isn't a mess already. Other questions?

Speaker 1:          15:44          All right. Um, let me go back to the effects of, uh, of general relativity. Uh, we've already done one of these. The, so what I'm going to talk about is the Post Newtonian gravitational

Speaker 1:          16:11          effect. So these are things where it just barely starts to deviate away from what the predictions of Newton's laws would be. So, uh, just to, uh, just to go back, if you take that metric and you, uh, and you kind of expand it in, in small quantities where the, where the, uh, Schwab short radius is much, much smaller than wherever you are. And you take the first term of the expansion, uh, mathematically it turns into the same things as Newton's laws. Uh, and so when you're, when you're out there in more or less flat space or close to flat space, uh, then Newton's laws still apply because the expansion of the metric gives you the, it gives you the exact same result. As the gravitational forces become larger, you start to get a post Newtonian terms and things start to be a little bit different from Newton. Uh, and we've already had one of these. Uh, so post Newtonian effect number one is the precession of the Para Helion,

Speaker 1:          17:19          where unlike the prediction for Newton, the orbit doesn't exactly repeat. It sort of moves on a little bit each time. And you get one of these nice sort of spiral graph patterns, uh, as, as the orbit graduate as an elliptical orbit. Gradually precesses boot gradually moves around. So that was the first one. Um, and that was the first one that was seeing, that was seen, uh, in mercury, which is the planet you would expect to see such a thing because it's closest to the, uh, and therefore our s over ards, the largest number for mercury, uh, uh, for any planet in the solar system. So, uh, mercury.

Speaker 2:          18:00          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          18:01          no, it actually turns out to have been known before Einstein actually worked out the general relativity. Okay. So now post Newtonian effect number two is the deflection of light.

Speaker 1:          18:22          The whole idea remember, is that there's the, is that gravity works cause he curved space and objects moving along this curve space appear to have curved trajectories. That's true of light. Also, light is also moving across this curve space. So there's a prediction in general relativity, uh, that if you shine light near and a massive object, it's the path that that light will take. It's curved, uh, does if the light being gravitational, he attracted by this object. So, um, let's see here. Imagine the following situation here are you, you're, you're observing something. Here's a star. Uh, and the path that light takes to this star, uh, from the star to your eye as some kind of straight line. And so that's where you perceive the start to be. Now, supposing that along that between you and this star, uh, there's,

Speaker 2:          19:23          yeah,

Speaker 1:          19:24          some object. So here's a, here's an object with mass m. So a massive object. Now, uh, because the path is going to curve, uh, the path of the light takes from the start to your eye is going to now look something like this

Speaker 1:          19:45          and it's deflected by the presence of the mass, which curves the space that had 10. That means you think, because you're interpreting this as if the light is coming straight towards you, you think the star is here or it appears to be, uh, there because you say, all right, what is the, what is the angle at which the light is coming into my eye? It's coming from there and you don't realize that the, that the star is actually over there and the light has gone up toward the ceiling and bent deck down to your eye. So it's as if I'm looking up there and seeing the exit side, uh, because the light from the exit sign has gone up to the ceiling being bent around by some black hole or something up, up to up at the top of the classroom and come back down to my eye.

Speaker 1:          20:30          Yeah. On the other side of the, ah, it is possible. Yes, it is possible. Uh, in this particular case, probably not because there wouldn't be enough band in order to get it in here. So like going this way, for example, let me take another color before this gets too complicated, like coming this way would bend like that and it miss your eye. However, there are situations in which you see two images of the same object, one from each side. These are called gravitational lenses. Uh, many, many images, uh, in principle, if it's lined up exactly right, imagine that it's perfectly aligned. Uh, then, uh, you see this way, you see that way and you see out of the paper and you can see a whole ring. This has actually been observed, not the whole ring, but, but large parts of the ring because it's an, it's never perfectly aligned.

Speaker 1:          21:25          Uh, but, uh, you can see these things. These are called Einstein Einstein's ranks, and you can actually see them. Uh, you can see these kinds of multiple images, uh, in cases where, uh, this is a very distant galaxy or quasar. Quasars are, are, uh, uh, uh, very bright, very small extra galactic objects. And this is an intervening galaxy or galaxy cluster. And you can see these multiple images. I'll bring some pictures in next time. They're very, they're, they're amazing looking things. Uh, it's often true that you can see four images that comes about when the intervening mass is not spherical. Uh, and so you get weird deflections and they're multiple directions. You see the same object, a very spectacular thing. These were discovered only recently. Uh, but it turns out that there's, that you can observe this effect even in our own solar system because what you can do, I'll bring in some pictures of gravitational lenses. Those are, those are amazing things. Uh, and uh, what also happens is if you're looking at something big like a galaxy that has a shape, it distorts the shape. It's stretches the whole thing out. You get these amazing pictures. All right? In any case, in our own, in our own solar system,

Speaker 1:          22:50          you see this in the following way. Here's The sun,

Speaker 1:          22:55          and here's a star right behind the song. Uh, and the light from the star comes like this. And so you think the stories here. So if you look at, uh, at a star, when it's right next to the sun, right at the edge of the sun, it seems to be in a different position relative to stars further relative to other stars up here. Here's another star, uh, than it would if you looked at it at night when the sun wasn't in the way. Yes. How do you do daytime? Excellent question. I'm getting to that. Uh, okay. So, but the principle is supposedly the sun were dark. Okay. Uh, look at star behind the sun or right next to the sun. Really? You can't through the sun. I'm not that crazy. A star behind son. Uh, and it appears to be in a different place position then when observed, uh, at night without the sun in the way. Okay. So how do you, how do you do astronomy during the daytime? That's a good question. Eclipses, yes. You wait until there's a solar eclipse and then you do your observation. Uh, do this by observing during an eclipse.

Speaker 1:          24:33          And if you do this, the position, the change in position of the star, uh, if it's right at the edge of the sun and you've now blocked the sun, cause here's the moon, right? And the light from the sun doesn't come through. Uh, this change in position that's an ankle is around one arc second. And that, that's a positional change. Who can observe, remember the size of the apparent size of a star. When you look at it, it's about one arc second. So it seems like it's shifted a significant amount. Uh, and so you go, you take a, you take a picture of the sky of the stars behind the sun during a total eclipse of the sun. Now the problem with this is a practical problem. Uh, total eclipses of the sun happen only for very short amounts of time. And, uh, only occasionally and only in a small, over a small portion of the earth at any one time.

Speaker 1:          25:32          How many people have seen an eclipse of the sun? Pretty spectacular thing, Huh? Uh, but you know, you have to travel to get there. It doesn't come to you. So here's what happened. In 1917, Einstein publishes, uh, his theory of general relativity. And then in 1919, there's going to be an eclipse in Brazil. I think it was, uh, eclipse in Brazil. And, uh, it seems like a good idea that you should actually go and test this theory, which has made a very specific prediction about what, uh, what ought to be going on with these, uh, with these stars. So Eddington, we've heard of him before. He's the guy who trashed his student, Chandra Sacar some years later. Uh, but at the time he was young, up and coming, British scientist, uh, mountain expedition, uh, to Brazil to test this theory

Speaker 1:          26:35          to Brazil. And it works. Goes down there. He takes these pictures. It does just what Einstein, and this is the event that makes Einstein into a great international, uh, figure there. This is front page headlines around the world. And part of the reason why it was, is look at these dates. Uh, Einstein is a German scientist. This is the middle of World War One A. And so in the middle of World War One, the German side to seize later thought of as a Jewish scientist, but that, uh, but at the time, uh, Hitler was not yet on the scene. And so Einstein was thought of as a German scientist. So this German scientists publishes a grand, bizarre new theory of the universe right after the war, the Brits Mountain operation to go and check and see if this is right. And it turns out to be correct.

Speaker 1:          27:25          So this is now right after World War one in the era when everybody thought, well, we're never going to have a war again. There's going to be peace, a peace and justice and brotherhood throughout the world for the rest of time. And as part of this, the British, a mountain expedition to confirm a German theory of science. And this is regarded as a huge sign of the, a great new future that we're moving into of international cooperation. And a consequence of this, this is front page news all over the world and it makes Einstein famous. This is what makes Einstein famous. So, uh, uh, the fable here is the 1919 eclipse expedition. And the moral that was drawn at the time, uh, is the great international, uh, is how science is this wonderful, uh, international, maybe even universal, a quest. Uh, and in retrospect, what it is, it's a great demonstration of, uh, uh, you know, how scientists opposed to work new theory makes a prediction. You go out and measure the effect and it works. Uh, so this is, uh, uh, uh, science works as advertised,

Speaker 1:          28:55          except, you know, maybe it doesn't because, uh, subsequently in, in, in subsequent years, people looked back at the apparatus that Eddington and his team had put together and said, you know, you can't actually make measurements that accurate with this stuff. So how were they able to make this measurement? And oddly enough, for about 50 years, the photographic plates, what they'd done was taking photographs at the sky had disappeared. Uh, and so nobody could go back and check the original data at some point. Subsequently, that kind of reappeared in saw just recently actually inside, uh, the personal effects of a British astronomer who had gone to live in Chile and nobody quite knows how he got ahold of them. Uh, and I actually have to say, I'm not sure what the outcome of this is, whether people have actually gone back and tried to measure this again.

Speaker 1:          29:49          Uh, so, uh, and at the time, you know, Eddington who in in his subsequent life demonstrated a real propensity for, uh, believing his own theories, if you know what I mean, which in which served him poorly when he was dealing with Chandra Saker, who was thinking of other things Eddington had said before he went on the expedition that he was absolutely certain this was going to work. Uh, because he had studied Einstein's theory and had come to believe it because it was so beautiful and elegant. And so, uh, there's a famous, there's a famous story where somebody said, well, Mr Addington, what will, uh, or said to somebody else on the expedition, what will adding to do if it comes out wrong? And he said, well, addict, we'll just go in say, uh, and so there's a little bit of suspicion to attach to this particular, uh, experiment.

Speaker 1:          30:39          However, subsequent to that, this has been measured repeatedly, many times during many eclipses. And, uh, it's very clear that this works. And as I said, there's now evidence from other astronomical objects for the deflection of light. All of which confirms, uh, Einstein's theory. Yes. What is the second line? Say? Uh, let's see. Uh, eclipse expedition scientist and international universal quest, uh, science works as advertised. Maybe. Uh, that's what I was trying to write down. So that's the second post Newtonian test. And the fact that it works in 1919 is what makes people really believe relativity. And what makes people believe that Einstein's, this, this, uh, intense genius. Okay. There are a couple of other posts, Newtonian effect. So here's now a post Newtonian effect number three, and this is something called the gravitational red shift.

Speaker 1:          31:54          You've heard of a red shift, redshift and blue shifts. They come about because of the doppler shift. Something moves towards you. It's like gets shifted to the blue. Something moves away from you, it's like get shifted to the red. Turns out the wavelengths of light also change, um, due to gravity or due to being emitted in a curved space time. If you want to use the relativistic formulation, basically, here's how it works. Uh, you have some object with radius r, uh, mass m and you have a light source on the surface of that object. Uh, and you look at it from a distance. You're out here at infinity watching this light and, uh, the light, if you emit green light, uh, by the time it reaches you, it'll have shifted into the rep and there's an equation. Let me write down the equation. So this is Delta Lambda.

Speaker 1:          32:53          Oops, that one's not working anymore. Delta Lambda over lambda zero. That's, that's the shift in light. And remember that the doppler shift has some equation here. We'll, here's the equation, uh, for, uh, this shift due to the gravitation of an object are s over our, uh, where this is the distance to the given mass, uh, or, uh, if you're emitting light from the surface of an object, the distance to the masses, the distance to the center of the object. Uh, so in this particular case, it would be the radius of the object, uh, minus one. So you can see that if there is no mass, uh, then the swatch showed radius is zero, and this is one minus one, and there's no shift. Okay? Now, why does this happen? This has to happen. Uh, imagine that you're standing on the surface of an object and you throw an object up into the air.

Speaker 1:          34:02          I have an object here. Uh, I'm going to do this. What will happen as I throw it up into the air, it's going to, it's going to slow down. If I throw it faster than the escape velocity and I don't have a ceiling and stuff, then it'll go, it'll keep going away forever, but it will nevertheless slow down. Uh, if I throw it up slower than the escape velocity, then it's going to rise to some height, stop turning around and fall back. Right? So that's what, that's what happens with an object. Why is this happening? The reason it happens is because, uh, as it moves, as it tries to move away from the earth, it has to lose energy because it's pushing its way out of the gravitational field. Uh, and so it gradually slows down because it's kinetic energy decreases as it goes further away to balance the change in the potential energy.

Speaker 1:          34:52          For those of you who remember high school physics, it balances the change in potential energy though the total energy is zero. And so the kinetic energy has to slow down, uh, and whether it slows down enough to stop it or not, depends on whether it's moving faster than its escape velocity or not. Supposing I do this with a flashlight and instead of throwing a key chain up in the air, I throw a photon up in the air and the photon starts out at the speed of light. Now, uh, that too has to lose energy and it moves away from, from the earth. But light, as we know, always travels at the speed of light. It doesn't slow down. It can't slow down. So what it has to do is it to lose energy in some other way. And the trick is that the energy of a photon,

Speaker 3:          35:47          yeah,

Speaker 1:          35:47          is equal to a couple of constants. H Times see over the wavelets. So as the energy gets less, the wavelength gets longer, has to get bigger. And so what is happening here is as you shine light off of gravitating object, as it gets further and further away from the object, it loses energy, but it loses energy, not by slowing down as an ordinary massive objects would, but by changing its wavelength.

Speaker 1:          36:21          And now go back and look at this equation again. Supposing you're shining your flashlight from, uh, the, from the event horizon of a black hole, from a something where the, the distance to the object is equal to the Schwab chilled radius. Then you get down to the lambda equals infinity and you've read shifted your way out to an infinitely large wavelength. The consequence of that is that the energy of the light is equal to zero. And so this is how, uh, how it happens. That light can't escape from a black hole because you know, if you have the new Tony Envision of the escape philosophy in mind, then goes up, stops, turns around and comes back and you imagine shining a flashlight from inside the event horizon of a black hole. You imagine that the light would go up, stop turnaround and fall back, but like doesn't do that. Cause light always goes at the speed of light. So what happens instead? Is it red shift itself out of existence altogether? Uh, and so that's the way a light is prevented from leaving a black hole. Because if you shine from either inside or, uh, uh, at the event horizon, it'll red shift itself to infinity. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          37:38          still makes perfect sense.

Speaker 1:          37:44          Uh, okay. So, and then there is a, there is a Newtonian version of this. You can imagine how you expand this, uh, this thing. But this particular equation is relativistic. Uh, oh. The other thing is that of course in Newtonian physics, there's no reason for enlightened not to slow down.

Speaker 3:          38:05          Okay.

Speaker 1:          38:05          This business, that light always goes at the speed of light, regardless of the observer is a relativistic effect. So, you know, if you take a photon and throw it in the air in a Newtonian concept, there's no reason it can't slow down and turn around and come back.

Speaker 3:          38:21          Yes. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          38:28          Delta Lambda over Lambda Delta Lambda overlapped as this. Okay. So this is speed of light. Uh, and this is another famous constant called Planck's constant, uh, weren't, I don't think we're going to use that equation for anything in particular, but, but it's, it's a couple of constants. So basically the energy is proportional to one over lambda.

Speaker 3:          38:56          Yeah. Other questions?

Speaker 1:          39:04          Okay. Uh,

Speaker 1:          39:07          if you turn it around, if you sit on the surface of, I don't know, a neutron star or something and look at distant star light, that light will pick up energy as it comes towards you. And so if you sit on up gravitating object and look at a distance like distant light, that light will actually be blue shifted because it will gain energy falling down towards you. Uh, and so, uh, while this is always referred to as the gravitational redshift, cause we're always imagining that we're some distant observer in a flat space looking at some gravitating object in principle, if you could live on a neutron star, a, all the stars, all the stars would look bluer than they do to us because of this effect. So it works both ways.

Speaker 1:          39:50          This, by the way, has now been tested in the laboratory. Here's how you do it. Uh, you set up, you sit on top of a ladder and you look at light coming from the surface and uh, coming up towards you. And then you have somebody, you have some, some confederate or graduate student or something, uh, who sits on the ground and looks at light coming sideways, uh, and you determined that the wavelength detected here is slightly larger than the wavelength detected here. That's a really small effect because the Earth's gravitational field, you know, if you do this little calculation and you're trying to figure out our ass over our for the surface of the earth, uh, it's a really, really small, small difference from one. Nevertheless, because you're in the laboratory and we know how to measure the wavelengths of light with incredible accuracy, uh, this can, this effect can actually be measured, uh, in, in the lab and has been,

Speaker 3:          40:54          yes, if you're on a black hole or whatever, shining a light awkward and it, instead of doing the arc thing just stretches out and weeks out of existence at the top, then went back into the systems.

Speaker 1:          41:08          Well, it can't fall back, right? It can't, it can't fall back because he can't stop, turn around and come back

Speaker 3:          41:15          out of existence up here.

Speaker 1:          41:16          Well, notice what happened. Uh, supposing you go from, uh, from the event horizon only to slightly above the event horizon. Uh, the difference in, uh, in the wavelength you see is this quantity at the event horizon minus this quantity a little bit above the event horizon because it's still going to be red shifted. But this is infinite if the event horizon, so by the time it moves even a tiny bit off the event horizon has already gone.

Speaker 3:          41:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:48          Yeah. It's because this goes, this term becomes infinitely large. Uh, oh, but I should say, uh, this brings up a good point. Supposing, uh, supposing you're here and it's not a black hole, so it's not going to, it's not going to be disastrous, but you're observing it. Not An infinity but close. Uh, so here's this is that, uh, some are, and this is it r one a little bit further away. Uh, so what you would observe here is Delta Lambda over over lambda is equal to a Delta Lambda at our one minus delta. Let me write this so that there's some hope of reading it. Um, so this gives you, uh, the Delta Lambda you observe at our one, uh, over lambda is equal to Delta Lambda at our one calculated by that for me, a minus Delta Lambda at our, uh, because it red shifts a little bit from here to here. It would red shift more from here out to infinity. And so the way you calculate that as you calculate red shift from here to infinity minus redshift from here to infinity, uh, aunt, since for something that is at, uh, the event horizon, the red shift from there to infinity to infinity is infinite. Uh, even if you're observing it just a little bit higher, uh, it's already gone.

Speaker 3:          43:28          Does that make sense? How are we doing other questions? Yes.

Speaker 1:          43:43          Oh, the photons. Remember there's a relationship between the fo the, the whole way wave particle duality works for photon. There's a relationship between the energy of the photon and the wavelength that was this equals HC over lambda thing. So as the wavelength becomes infinite, the energy in that photon goes to zero. So it's still a photon. But if you've got a photon with zero energy and you're not going to notice it,

Speaker 3:          44:08          um, yes, you know, use the gravitational field. It was like the mercury or whatever miss slingshot probes is an outer space. Could light, like pick up energy by going around massive object.

Speaker 1:          44:26          Well, it pays like picks up energy as it falls towards a massive object. That's, that's the, the inverse gravitational redshift. Do you sit on the gravitating object? You watched light coming at you from a distance. So it does that. That slingshot effect only works if you add energy to the thing that kick yourself back out of orbit at just the right moment. You can't do that with light because you can't give it extra. Uh, uh, uh, you can't give it an extra velocity kick at any moment to, to, to push it back up. But it is true that if you sit and you can do this, uh, you can, you can do this experiment backwards, right? You have your light source up here, uh, and you observe it from down here and then you'll see a blue shift. It other questions. How are we doing? Okay. Uh, let me mention one last, uh, uh, post Newtonian effect. This is post Newtonian a fact. Uh, number four, and this is the existence of gravitational waves.

Speaker 1:          45:40          Uh, and the way this works is these over here, remember the, the, the, the bed sheet and the basketball over here from a few days ago. All right? Now imagine that that basketball, which is some massive object is moving back and forth. Um, the, it's orbiting some other thing on that bed sheet. What will happen? Well, the bed sheet, we'll, we'll, we'll ripple in different ways as the thing moves around. And this, uh, creates, uh, essentially a wave of distortions of spacetime. The propagates, uh, at, uh, propagates outward as it turns out at the speed of light. So, uh, the way this works is, uh, as a mass, uh, moves back and forth, perhaps because it's an orbit or for some other reason, it generates ripples in space time. These propagate outward at the speed of light. Uh, and we'll talk later maybe about how one, uh, what it means to have a ripple in space time and how one might detect it. But there's a more immediate effect, which is that the energy in these so called gravitational waves, they carry energy with them and the energy comes from is extracted from the orbit of the object that's moving back and forth. So the orbit gradually loses energy and that means the orbit gets smaller

Speaker 1:          47:33          gradually. So the orbit gets gradually smaller. Uh, and so in the Newtonian approximation thinks stay in orbit and they're perfectly stable forever and ever, and they just go orbiting around and around and around. But in general, relativity, there's a, if there's a gradual slow loss of energy and objects will gradually spiral in. Now this happens really slowly. It has not been detected in the solar system. That is to say, even the orbit of mercury. Uh, we can't measure it's orbital period accurately enough to see this slow down. Certainly all the planets in the solar system have been happily going in their orbits for four and a half billion years, uh, with no sign of this effect. But you can, uh, see us see this in certain kinds of binary stars, stars with which happened to have very short orbits. And in particular, uh, there's something called the, uh, binary, Paul Sahre, Paul, sorry, is a kind of neutron star, uh, and, uh, these gravitational wave effects, the gradual decrease in the orbit, uh, has been observed in binary pulsars. And we'll talk about that, I guess a next time.
