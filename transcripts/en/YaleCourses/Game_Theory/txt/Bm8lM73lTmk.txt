Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So last time we finished up by playing the game of Nim, I never remember, I hope that the game of men was a game where I would those two piles of stones are we, we may do with lions on the board and the winner was the person who who picked up the last stone, I'm gonna be Agile, you have to pick piles and I want to use the game of naming to make a transition here. So we'd pointed out about the game of Nim was it illustrated very nicely for us. That's a games can have first mover advantages or they can have second mover advantages, a very small change in the game. Essentially a suppose small change in it. And where we started from could switch a game from a game with a first mover advantage to a game with a second mover advantage. All right, now today I want to make it just draw a slightly grander lesson out of that game.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       So not only was it the case that that's the game sometimes has first mover advantages and sometimes has second mover advantages. But moreover we could tell when it had a first mover advantage and we could tell when he had a second mover advantage. It's not right. When we actually looked at the initial setup of those stones, we knew immediately that's a game in which player one is going to win. Or alternatively we knew immediately that's a game which player two is going to win. All right? Now it turns out that that idea is very general and actually has a name attached to it. And that name is de Mello.

Speaker 1:          00:01:35       So today we'll start off by talking about a theorem due to a guy called zoom mellow and the idea of this therapist. Next, we're gonna look at games more general than just Nim. And we're going to ask the question, uh, under what circumstances would you know about a game? I either the player one, the person who goes first can force a whim or the player to can force a win or what allow a third possibility, which is it's going to be a tie. All right, so here's the theorem. Suppose there are two players in this game, like the game we looked at last time, and suppose I won't to find this formally now, but suppose the game is a game of imperfect, infamous, or have perfect information. So we're only my perfect information. I'll define that later on the class. But for now, all I mean is that whenever play, whenever it player has his turn to move, that player knows exactly what has happened prior in the game.

Speaker 1:          00:02:32       So for example, all these sequential move gains, we've been looking at our moves of perfect information. When I get to move, I know exactly what you did yesterday. I know what I did the day before yesterday. I was so, all right, so it's a game of perfect information. I'm going to assume that the game has a finite number of nodes. So two things here. It can't go on forever. This game, and also there's no point at which it branches in an infinite way. All, all right? There's a finite number of nodes and we'll assume that the game has three possible outcomes. And actually there's a more general version of this therapy, but this will do for now. The three possible outcomes are either a win for player one, so I'll call it w sub one or a loss for player one, which is obviously a win for player too, or tie.

Speaker 1:          00:03:24       All right? So the game like name last time literally had two outcomes. So here we're going to go up for three outcomes or a three Oh three or fewer outcomes I should say. All right, so these are the conditions and here's the results. So I said three it could be three but it could also be to here. I'm just allowing for three. One is true. All right? So under these conditions, the following is true. Either play a one can force or win. So either it's the case that this game is a game that had player one plays as well as they can. They're going to win the game. All right. No matter what player two Dash Oh two oh sorry. Oh one can at least to tie.

Speaker 2:          00:04:19       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       All right. Which means player one complaints such a way that they can assure themselves of a tie regardless of what player too does. Oh, it could be a game in which to

Speaker 2:          00:04:33       can force a loss on one. All right, so when is this? All right. All right,

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       so this third, when you first look at it, it doesn't seem to save very much. I you're staring at this thing. You might think that we already knew that we're looking at games that only have three possible outcomes, win, loss or tie. All right, so it doesn't seem so surprising. If you look at this third minute says, why are they going to end up with a win or a loss or Tai Chi? But that's not quite what the Theorem says, right? The therm say is not, and you're going to end up there. We knew that already, but but games divided themselves get into these foam divide themselves into those games in which player one has a way of winning, regardless of what player too does, right? Or Games which pay one has a way of forcing a Thai regardless of what player one does. By two days or play a two as a way of winning, regardless of what our player one does. Ratchet, these games all have a solution. It's just go back to Nim to illustrate the point. All right, so in Nim, uh, actually there's no ties. We can forget the middle of the years and in Nim under certain circumstances, it is the case that player one can force a win. Who remembers what the case was for when player one can force a win? Anybody when people who played last time,

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       Oh

Speaker 1:          00:05:58       yes, I know some. Somebody here just, yeah, sure. I just shout it out

Speaker 3:          00:06:06       of,

Speaker 1:          00:06:07       all right, so if the, if the piles starts on the call, if the pile start on equal, then player one can actually force a win. So in Nim in them, if the piles are on equal, not the stars, then one can force a win.

Speaker 1:          00:06:28       It really doesn't matter what two does to his toast. All right. Or the alternative case is the piles are equal at the stars. And if that equal at the start, then it's play a one who's toast, right player to is kind of oh well the force, the loss on one. So to can force. I lost on one [inaudible]. All right everyone remember that from last time? Yeah, it just before the weekend and be so far. Let me go. All right, so, so this, this theorem applies to all games of this form. So what games are this fullness and think of some other examples. So one example is tic TAC toe. All right? Everyone knows the rules of ticked out. I didn't even know we call it noughts and crosses, but you guys call it a tic TAC toe. Is that right? Everyone know what Tic Tac toe is?

Speaker 1:          00:07:21       Yeah. So in Tic Tac toe, oh, which, which category is Tic Tac toe? Is it the game? Which player one can force a win or is it the category in which player one can only force a tie or is it a category? What you'd rather go second and play two could force it. Force of wind for buy a two or lost replay one, which just tic TAC toe. That's a show of hands here. Who Thinks Tic Tac toe is a game which play one can force a win. Who Thinks Tic Tac? That is a game which would play, won't get any force a tie. And I think it's probably one who thinks a player is going to win. I think you'll read most of you're right. It's a game. It's a game in which if people play correctly then it will turn out to be a tie. All Right, so tic TAC toe TGC TIC TAC toe is a game that leads to a tie.

Speaker 1:          00:08:06       All right? Play a one can still make a mistake, in which case they can lose, play a tube and make a mistake, in which case there would lose. But there is a way of playing that forces a tie. All right, so these are fairly simple games. Let's talk about more complicated games. So what about the game of checkers? Right? So the game of checkers meets these conditions. It's a two player game. You always know all the moves prior to your move. It's fine. I, it's all right. There's some rules and checkers that prevented going on forever and there are two or three outcomes. I guess there's a third outcome. If you've got into a cycle, you could tie, all right, it's a checkers is a fits all these disruptions and what this theorem tells us is that checkers has a solution, right? I'm not trying to know what that solution is or I think actually somebody did computer it quite recently, even though the last few months, I just forgot to Google it this morning to remind myself, but what the storm shelters, even before this, people have computed it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       Check has has a solution. All right, let's be a bit more ambitious. What about chess? Chess meets this description, right? Chest is a two player game. Everybody knows all the moves before them. It's sequential. All right? It has finite number of moves. It's a very large number, but it is finite. All right, and it has three possible outcomes, a win, a loss or a tie. That's been to be careful. The reason it's finite is that if you cycle, I forget what it is, three times, then they get them. The game is declared a drawer at a time. All right, so what's this there? I'm telling us, it's telling us that there is a way to soul chess. Tell just the is a way to solve test chest has a solution, right? We don't know what that solution is. It could be that solution is that player one.

Speaker 1:          00:09:45       Who's the Pi with the white. The white pieces can force awareness. It could be that probably one can only force a tie and it could even be that player Tuk and forced to win. All right? We don't know what it is, but there is a solution. All right? There's a catch to this. There are much the catch. The catch is it doesn't actually tell us. This term is not going to tell us what that solution is. It doesn't tell us how to play this through in it of itself doesn't tell us how to play chess. It just says there is a way to play chess.

Speaker 3:          00:10:15       Alright. Alright,

Speaker 1:          00:10:17       so we're going to try and prove this. We don't often do proofs in class, but the reason I would approve this particular one is because the proof is instructive as part of it, of the Qr at Yale. All right? So here's another example here and some other examples you could think of chess as being the most dramatic example.

Speaker 3:          00:10:40       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:10:48       All right. So the reason I want to actually spend some time proving this today is because we're going to prove it by induction.

Speaker 1:          00:11:02       We're gonna prove it. My induction. All right, I'm going to sketch the program, not gonna go through every possible step, but I want it. I want to give people here a feeling for what a proof by induction looks like. And the reason for that is my guest is, but it's find out how many of you seen a proof by induction before? How many have nots? Right? So for those who haven't, I think it's a good thing in life at one point in your life to see a proof by induction. And for those who have, my guess is you source and I'm awful math class in, uh, in high school. And it gets when, you know, it didn't take over your hay, but it kind of, the excitement of it doesn't catch on. I'm hoping to make this is a context where it might appeal. All right, so proof by induction, we're going to prove this by induction on the maximum length of the game.

Speaker 1:          00:11:55       Well, cool. That n n the maximum. Next look, it's what do we mean by this? If I write down a tree, I can always look at all the pause from the beginning of the tree, all the way through to the end of the trash that your wife and beginning of the tree all the way through to the end of the tree. And I'm gonna look at the path in that, in that particular tree that has the largest length. All right? And I'll call that the length of the game, the maximum length of the game. All right? So we're gonna do induction on the maximum length of the game. All right? So how do we start a proof by induction? It's just remind us to house. There's people who've seen the before. We're going to prove that this therom is true. The claim and the Theorem is true for the easy case when the game is only one move long.

Speaker 1:          00:12:40       All right? That's the first step and then we're going to try and show that if it's true for all games of length, less than or equal to n whatever n is, then it must therefore be true for games of length and plus one. All right? That's the two. That's the way you do a proof by induction. All right, so let's just see how that works in practice. All Ryan says, start with the easy step and we'll do it in some detail more detail than you really need to in a math class. So if any equals one, what are these games look like? Well, let's look at some examples here. So here's, I came, it's pretty triggered of KF and is equal to one, but let's do it anyway. All right, so the game might look like this. Play a one is going to move his player one moving the games or your length wanting to play.

Speaker 1:          00:13:24       One is the only player who ever gets to move. So the game might look like, like this, I'm not put in a fifth branch might look like this. All right? And at the end of this game, rather than putting payoffs, let me just put the outcome. So the outcome must either be a win or a tie or a loss. So I suppose it looks like this. Suppose it's a win or here we could have a tie or here we can have a win again or here we can have a loss and here we could have a tie. All right, so in this particular gay man, in this particular game, uh, I claim it's pretty clear this game has a solution. It's pretty clear what one should do. All right. What should one do? One should pick one of her choices that leads to a win to be careful.

Speaker 1:          00:14:12       I'll put one in here just to distinguish who it is. He's actually winning and losing. All right, so in this, in this game, I claiming that this game has a pretty obvious solution. Either play a one, it's going to choose this brunch that leads to a win or this Bronx that leads to awareness. And either way play a one is going to win, right? The obvious, it's all this. It's kind of painful. All right, so I claimed this game, we can actually replace this first node with what's going to happen, which is probably the one one's going to win. Is that right? That was easy. That's a good enough to example. We'll do three. All right, so here's a another possible example, and this is again play a one is gonna move here at this time, the possible outcomes or a tie or a loss or a loss.

Speaker 1:          00:15:00       All right? Once again, it's a one player game. This time he has three choices and the three choices need to a tie or he loses. So I claim on together this system, Paul, what player one should do is what choose. The tie isn't, it says no way of winning, but in that case you can actually force it and you can actually choose the tie, in which case he's going to die. So this game has a solution called choose the tie. And again, we could replace the first note of the game with what's actually gonna Happen, which is a tie. Everyone happy? Alright, there's one other possibility. I guess the other possibility is that if I want has a lot of choices, maybe, maybe four choices in this case. Once again, play a one, he's going to move. But in each case, unfortunately for player one, in each case the outcome is the player one loses. All right? So this is a game in which player one is going to lose no matter what they do. Once again, it has a solution. The solution is player one is toast and he's going to lose.

Speaker 2:          00:16:05       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:16:07       so I claim this is where he captured all the possibilities of games of length one. All right. I mean you can bet, you could imagine that they could be more branches on them, but basically they're doing these three possibilities. Either. It's the case that one of those branches leads to a win, in which case the solution is player one wins. Or it's the case that that none of the branches have wind in them, but one of them has a tie, in which case probably one was going to time orange. The case that all the branches have lost in them, in which case player one's going to lose. All right, so I claim I'm done for games of length one everyone. Okay, does that SAP is deceptively easy, but there it is. All right. Now we do the inductive step, the big step. All right. We're going to do is we're going to assume that the statement of the Theorem, which I've now hidden, unfortunately that, I mean that'd be on the height.

Speaker 2:          00:16:56       I can, let me easy. All right. It's now visible. Good.

Speaker 1:          00:17:06       So now let's assume that the statement of this theorem is true for all games length less than, less than or equal to add.

Speaker 2:          00:17:16       All right. I suppose that's the case. Suppose the claim is true for all games of this type of length,

Speaker 1:          00:17:37       less than or equal to some end. All right, well we need to show is we're going to try and show is therefore it will be true for all games of length. N Plus One. What we want to

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       show is we claim therefore therefore it will be true for games of length n plus one.

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       Wow, that's a key step in inductive proofs. All right, so how are we going to do that? Well, let's have a look at a game of length. N Plus One. All right? Now obviously I can't use thousands. He has, let me, let me choose some relatively small numbers, but the idea we'll go through. So let's have a look at a game. All right, so here's a game in which play a one moose first player to move second. That's supposed if player too does this, then one only has little choice here, uh, up here. Then one has a more complicated choice perhaps to could move again. One, two. Okay. All right, so this is quite a complicated little game up here and down here. Just make a little bit less complicated here. The game looks like this, and then comes to an end right to the tree.

Speaker 1:          00:19:03       Looks like this. I haven't put the end, I haven't with the outcomes on it, but the tree looks like this. All right, so how long is this tree? First of all, while I claim that the longest path in this tree from the beginning to the end has four steps. It's just check. All right, so one, two, three, fourth. I came as the longest, the longest path, and the path going down this way only has three moves in it. All right, so this is a game of length four. All right. All right. This is the game of length for so, so we can apply it to our claim. Let's assume that the theorem holes for all trees length three or fewer. So that n plus one is four for the purpose of our example. All right? All right, so here's in this example, in this example, I don't know if it hit after hit and this example and equals three.

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       So the n plus one equals four. All right, I'm going to have a happy with this and this and the example. All right, now what I want to observe about this is the following contained in this n plus one or the game of length four awesome smaller games. You could think of them as sub games, the games within the game. Is that right? So let's have a look I claim in particular, let's draw around them in pink. There's a game here that follows player one choosing up and there's a game here that follows play one choosing down. Is that right? All right, and I guess, okay, so these are both games. All right, and what do we have here? So this little game and here, the game and the top circle the game that follows player one moving up, that's a game and it has a length. All right, so this is the thing is a game.

Speaker 2:          00:21:10       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:21:11       this is a game and I'm going to call it a sub game. Some jargon we, well we're getting used to, they throw them this semester. It's a game within the game. It's based off. Again, this is a sub game and

Speaker 2:          00:21:23       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:21:24       this is a sub game following

Speaker 2:          00:21:29       one choosing op pets put up in here. Following up,

Speaker 1:          00:21:37       I claim that this game has a length. This sub game has a link. So we knew that we started from a game of length four we've taken one of the moves and it's meant Mesh. Make sure this is actually a game of length three right? It's the game started here. It's a big game of length three because you could go one, two, three moves that right? So this is a game of length three. Alright, so this is a sum game following one choosing up and it's the sub game has length

Speaker 2:          00:22:10       three.

Speaker 1:          00:22:12       All right and down here, down here, this is also a sub game. It's a game that follows play a wireman choosing down

Speaker 2:          00:22:30       following, one choosing down. And this little sub game has

Speaker 1:          00:22:41       Lincoln high. We have to be a little bit careful. You might think that since we started from a game of length for after the first move, we must be in a move of games of length three but actually that's not true. And if we don't carefully, we'll notice that this game down here, that game starting here, uh, actually, uh, isn't a blank three it's of length to that, right? So even though we started from a game of length four by going this way, we put ourselves into a game of length two. Is that right? Right. So one, two or one two. What up? All right. But it has length

Speaker 2:          00:23:15       two. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:23:19       All right. So in this example and his three and n plus one is four and our, our assumption, our induction assumption is what we've assumed that the claim of the theorem holes for all games less than or equal to n which in this case means less than or equal to three. All right. So what does that tell? That tells us, it tells us by our assumption, by our assumption, this game, which I've put a pink circle around on the top, this is the game of length three. This game has a solution, right? It must have a solution because it's the length, it's a length three or less. All right? So by the induction hypothesis as it's called by the induction,

Speaker 2:          00:24:14       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:15       Hypothesis. This is a technical term, but what's the induction hypothesis? Niche thing? Why? The assumption that we made this game has a solution. This game has a solution, right? It's a game of length. Three. Three is less than or equal to. And in this case, so this guy must have a solution. Now I didn't immediately know by starting at it what it is, but let's suppose it was w

Speaker 2:          00:24:46       yeah, say it was probably all right.

Speaker 1:          00:24:51       And the game down below. This is also a game and it's a game of length two but two is less than three as well too. Is that something equal to three? So this game also has a solution.

Speaker 2:          00:25:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:05       This game also by the same assumption,

Speaker 2:          00:25:13       I had the same assumption has a solution.

Speaker 1:          00:25:19       So it's solution is say, I don't know, maybe it's out. All right, so what does that mean to say that these games have solutions? In this case we're going to assume W is this one and is this word. What does it mean? It means that we could just, as we did with the games up there, we could put the solution at the beginning of the game. We know that if we get into this game, we're going to get the solution of this game and we know if we get into this game, we're going to get the solution of this game. All right? So we can replace this one with its solution, which by assumption was w and this one by it solution, which by assumption was owl. And here I want to be really careful. I need to keep track of which person it is.

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       It's a win or a loss for this was a win for player one and it was a loss for player too, and this was a loss for player one and it was a win for biopsy. All right? All right, so these games, each of them have some solution and this case, I've written down the solutions as w o l all right, so now what can we do? Let me just bring down this board again. I can translate this game into a very simple game. That's all I'm going to translate up here. So this game can be translated, just follows, play a one moves. If he goes up then he hits a w and if he goes down, he hits a loss.

Speaker 3:          00:27:04       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:27:06       So in this particular example, player one is effectively choosing between going up and finding himself in a game which has a solution and the solution is he wins. It's all going down and finding himself in a game which has a solution and the solution is he's toast. All right? But that's what, that's a one move game. That's a one move game. So we knew this is the solution in particular. He's going to choose up, right? This one has a solution. All right, this hi. Hey solution. It is a game off the length one.

Speaker 1:          00:27:55       So what do we do? All right. It's almost schematically we took a game of length n plus one in this case that was four and we pointed out that once play or one that has made her first move. In this game we are in a game or in a sub game if you like, that has length less than four. It could be three, it could be to whatever, whatever, whatever. Stop getting more in by assumption that game has a solution. So it's really effectively pay a one is choosing between going into a game with solution win or going into a game with Ellucian loss. And if there were 50 another sub games here, each one would have a solution in each one play. One will able about associate that solution with what he's going to get, what she's going to get. All right, so I claim that if it in fact is true that each of these sub games of a length, three or less how to solution, then the game of length four must have a solution, which is what? It's the solution which is play a one should pick the best sub game.

Speaker 1:          00:29:06       Alright. People convinced by that step. People are looking slightly, um, during the headlamps now. So I'm going to say it again. All right. All right. We started by assuming that all games have length three or last one and or less have a solution. We pointed out that any game that has length n plus one can we thought of as an initial move by player one followed by a game of length and or less and a few I should say. All right. Each of those games of an or fewer steps has the solution. So player one is just going to choose the game that has the best solution for her and we're done. All right. In this particular example, play I won is going to choose up and therefore the solution to this parent game, it's polite, it's player one witness.

Speaker 2:          00:30:04       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:30:07       Now the hard step, I think it improves by induction is realizing that you're dumb. So I claim when now dumb. Why are we done? While we know that was pretty easy that all games of length one have a solution that was pretty trivial and we've shown that if any game of length n or fewer has a solution, then games of end pass one have a solution. So now to see how we could proceed. We know that games of length one to have a solution. So let's consider games of length to write games of length to uh, two games. The like to have a solution. While that set any quarter one, we know that we know that if games or ninth one to have a solution that any game of length two could be thought of as an initial step followed by a game of length one but then as a solution.

Speaker 1:          00:30:57       So therefore games with links to have a solution, but I don't think of it that games have length three. All right. We've shown the games with length one of a solution and games were links to have a solution, right? And he gave him a blank. Three can be, can be thought of as a game in which there's an initial step followed by iser game of length one or a game of links to each of which have a solution. So once again, play a game, a game of length three has a solution and so on. All right, so games deduction, they work by building up on the length of the game and we'll run the APP knowing that we're done. All right. For those people who've never seen a proof by induction, don't worry, I'm not going to test you on a proven induction on the, uh, on the, uh, uh, um, on the exam. I just wanted you to see one once and it'll take a deep breath and try and digest this a little bit by playing a game. All right, so I'll leave it up there. I'll leave it up there as you can stare at it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:50       Yeah, I want it down and get it later,

Speaker 2:          00:31:56       right.

Speaker 1:          00:31:57       I, let's try and actually play a game and see if we can actually throw any light on this.

Speaker 2:          00:32:04       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:32:06       All right. So when I'm going to pick out volunteers like I did last time, but first of all, let me tell you what the game is. So once again, I'm going to, I'm going to have rocks in this game and once again, I'm going to approximate this rocks with marks on the blackboard. All right? So here's an example.

Speaker 2:          00:32:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:32:22       And the example is this, the game involves an array of rocks. So here the array has one, two, three, four, five rows, and three columns. So the rocks and all range as they were before in piles, but rather in a sort of pretty array, right? She made it more even. But this is one, two, three, four, five rows and one, two, three columns. That's in this example. All right, but in general, in general, there's an array of rocks and times n

Speaker 3:          00:33:01       alright. And

Speaker 1:          00:33:03       we're going to play sequentially with the players. And the way that, the way they, the game is gonna work is this is meant to be in this row. The way the world's going, the way the game is going to work is when it's your turn to move, you have to point to one of these rocks and whichever rock you points too, I will remove. I will delete that rock and all the rocks that lie above or to the right of it all rocks that to the northeast of it. So for example, if you pointed to this rock, right, then I will remove this rock. And also this one, this one, and this one. Right. And if the next person comes along and chooses this one, then I will remove this one and also that one. Okay. I'm gonna understand. All right. And the game

Speaker 3:          00:33:56       is,

Speaker 1:          00:33:59       the game is lost because we care. This is important. The game is lost by the person who ends up taking the last rock. The loser is the person who ends up removing the last rock. All right. Perhaps some volunteers. Can I volunteer people? One. How about the guy with the white tee shirt with the yellow on there? All right. Okay. Come on up front. All right. And uh, who else can I volunteer? Everyone's looking away from me. Uh, desperate looking away from me. Uh, okay. How about the guy with the Yale sweatshirt on the Yale Law? Yeah, the l football sweatshirt on. Okay. All right, so come on up. Your name is, I just get them. Let me get a mic up here. Thank you. Great. Your name is Noah Noah, and your name is to the when it Koran. Koran. Okay. So no, and Kronner our players. All right. Everyone understand the rules. You understand the rules. Good? Yup. All right, so what do we make that Noah go first and Noah, which rock are you going to removed from the last rock? Loses that one. That one. Okay, so no, it chose this one. So I'm going to move this one on the one above it.

Speaker 1:          00:35:21       All the rocks and and east or deleted all the rocks to the north and east of it. I believed it or wait, wait, that. That, that means you lost rock losers. Okay, last one. Ah, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, good. All right, so all right. That one, that one. Okay, so now we have an l shape.

Speaker 3:          00:35:50       Okay. No, that one. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:36:04       That one. That one. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right, so, so we're done. All right. All right. Okay. Everyone understand how that works. All right. Round of applause for our players,

Speaker 3:          00:36:12       please. All right, thank you.

Speaker 1:          00:36:17       Let me get to more volunteers now. Everyone's seen it. These, these guys had the hard job that to figure it out. Cold. Two more volunteers. Oh, I'd have to volunteer. I mean, there's somebody volunteering, volunteering. Great. I have one volunteer. You can pick an opponent to do bike.

Speaker 3:          00:36:35       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:36:36       there you go. Okay. Thank you. Uh, your name, what is this? Wait for the mixer here. So your name is Peter. Peter, and your name is Justin. All right. All right. Let me put some, a new array up here. All right, so let's put a newer array up here and it's telling us, make it, it doesn't have to be all, it doesn't make it this time it a bit more complicated. So I'll have

Speaker 3:          00:37:05       five,

Speaker 1:          00:37:10       that's a four rows and five columns this time. All right, so this time, okay, so last time I, last time I had five rows and three columns, and this, I'm going to have four rows and five columns, four rows, and five columns. All right? Uh, away you go. Move out the way. What did you stand a bit nearer the board? Make it a little easier for people to see what's going on. They go. All right. So Peter, you want to go first? Sure, that one. Okay, so this one goes, which means, which means, uh, all of the ego as well. All right. Then we're going to advice from the floor and we just shout things out.

Speaker 3:          00:37:49       Not too loud. I try. Go on here.

Speaker 1:          00:37:54       Okay. Well we're back to our l shape again.

Speaker 3:          00:38:01       Yeah. Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:38:09       all right. Now if you look can see what's going on. All right. All right. Oh, go here and speed it. All right. All right. All right. Thank you. All right, so round of applause again. All right.

Speaker 3:          00:38:20       Thank you guys.

Speaker 1:          00:38:25       So here's what I claim about this game first. And this is the formal pain. This is a lot harder than the game we played last time, right? Everyone convinced by that. All right, so here's going to be a, an exercise. Uh, I'll sell it as a challenge. I may even put it formally on the problem set this week, but if, if, if that's what just say, if I do put this on the problem set this week, I don't expect you all to solve it. All right? If I do put it on the promise that it's an optional problem, right? But here's the challenge. The challenge is I claim, Oh, I know from Somalia who's Theorem that no, most of what an is and no matter what em is, this game has a solution, right?

Speaker 2:          00:39:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:09       So there's a mother's theorem tells us

Speaker 2:          00:39:15       this game highs,

Speaker 1:          00:39:20       a solution. I notice it could have a different solution depending on the end and the amp depending on how many rows and how many columns is that right? So depending on an and a, each [inaudible] has a solution, is that right? Is that right? Right, right. So which could depend good. Depends on the m and m on the number of rows and columns. Just as a Nim. It depended on how there's piles started out. All right, so what's going to be the homework assignments? Find the solution, find the solution.

Speaker 2:          00:40:02       Homework. What is this?

Speaker 1:          00:40:12       All right, so I claim, let me give you a hint. I claim it is useful to remember that there is a solution. All right. It turns out to be useful to remember that that wasn't much of a hint. You knew that already, but then I just emphasize that. Okay. Okay. So I want to do a bit of a transition now. Where are you from these games like chess and checkers and like this game with the rocks or Nim and I want to be a little bit formal for a while. All right, so why don't we haven't done for a while. Actually we listened to the midterm is write down some formal definitions. So I'm going to do that now.

Speaker 3:          00:40:50       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:40:51       Oh, at least one of these boards back.

Speaker 3:          00:41:09       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:41:16       So as I warned right, very early on the class, there were some points of the day when we have to stop and do some work and the next 20 minutes or so is such a point.

Speaker 2:          00:41:37       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:41:41       So, okay, what is this? This is formal

Speaker 2:          00:41:44       stuff

Speaker 1:          00:41:48       and the first thing I want to do is I want to give you a formal definition of something I've already mentioned today and that's the idea of perfect and for the inflammation. So what we've been looking at, or listening to the mid term, our games have perfect information. So at gay men all have perfect information.

Speaker 2:          00:42:09       Game of perfect information is one in which at every node or each node, each node in the game, the player who's turn

Speaker 1:          00:42:38       it is to move with that note. All right, who's turn it is to move? No, it was which node she is at.

Speaker 2:          00:43:00       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:01       All right. It's just a very simple idea. Like every game we've seen since the mid term, how's this property? When you're playing this game, you knew where you are. You know where you are, so you know which node your ass. You know what, what's uh, you know what your choices are and what that means implicitly is

Speaker 2:          00:43:17       she must know how she got there.

Speaker 1:          00:43:26       All right? So the whole history of the game is observed by everybody. I'm, I'm, when I get to move, I know what you did yesterday. I know what I did the day before yesterday from playing with a third person that I know what they did the day before that. All right? So very simple idea, but it's turns out to be an idea that's actually allows us to a very simple idea. Did you use for things like backward induction? Very simply. All right. Now, so far all we've been doing is thinking about such games. The games like perfect competition kicks for games like a competition, contrary competition between firms or games like the games where we were setting up incentives or games like Nim and we've have been solving these games by backward induction rather informally. All right. What I want to add in now is the notion of a strategy in these games, right? When we had, when we had to simultaneous move games strategies, we're really unproblematic obvious what strategies were, but when we have games, there's sequential that go on over over a period of time and inflammation is emerging over a period of time. We need to be little careful what we mean by a strategy. All right, so what I wouldn't want to do is I want to define a pure strategy at least as follows, so a pure strategy,

Speaker 2:          00:44:40       a pure strategy that's apply. Hi,

Speaker 1:          00:44:50       in a game of perfect information.

Speaker 2:          00:44:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:44:58       Some of the Games we've been talking about games, if you can represent by trees is what? It's a complete, it's a complete, it's a complete plan. It's a complete plan

Speaker 2:          00:45:18       of action.

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       In other words, what it does is it specifies which action I should take.

Speaker 2:          00:45:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:45:38       Should take her, cause that's what make it should say gonna say we'll sake.

Speaker 2:          00:45:44       We'll take at each

Speaker 1:          00:45:50       of eyes nodes each of i's decision nodes 21st read this definition. It seems completely uninteresting and unproblematic a pure strategy for player. I just tells you in this game, whenever you might be called upon to move, it tells you how you're going to move, right? So you're going to move three times in the game. It tells you how you're gonna move the first time. It tells me how you're gonna move to the second time and it tells you how you're going to move the third time.

Speaker 2:          00:46:20       All right?

Speaker 1:          00:46:23       All right, so so far, none of this seems difficult, but actually it's a bit more difficult than it looks. So let's have a look.

Speaker 2:          00:46:36       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:46:41       What I want to do is I will look at an example, and this is all fine. I'm hoping it's going to illustrate some subtleties about this definition.

Speaker 2:          00:46:57       So here's an example,

Speaker 1:          00:47:03       and this example, polio one moves first and they can choose in or out or if you're like, that's quite an up or down to it. That's the way you've drawn it. So they can choose down or up. And I'll use capital letters,U and d. Then plant, if shoes is APP, then player two gets to move and play. A two can choose left or right. And if player one moves up, followed by a player to choosing left, then play a one gets to move. In which case player one could move up or down. I'll use little letters this time. Little U and D.

Speaker 3:          00:47:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47:45       All right, let's, that's some payoffs in this game. So the payoffs are one zero here, zero two here, three one here, and two, four,

Speaker 3:          00:47:57       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:00       All right, so on paper, on your, it's on the board, you first look at it. This is a perfectly simple game. It's just like many of the Games we've been looking at since the mid term. It has a tree, we could analyze it. My back had an induction. In a moment we will analyze it by backward induction. All right. But what I want to do first is I want to say what are the strategies in this game? All right? So let's start with player too, since it's easier. Play a tos strategies. Yeah. Oh, wash. I'm pretty simple. Play at two strategies. Prior to only has one decision node, here's player to his decision node, right? And the strategy has to tell a player to what he's going to do at that decision node. So there's only two choices left or rights. So player a WHO's trenches are either left or right. Okay. Newsies, however, already won state subtlety here, play a two may never get to make this choice. All right, so play a two is choosing left or rights. But player to me don't ever get to me to make this choice. In particular, if one shows down, it's really irrelevant whether a player too has chosen left or right, right? Nevertheless, that strategy has to specify what play out to would do, where he called upon to make that move. All right, now it's like a play on one strategies.

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       So what a player one strategies in this game. What to play? One strategist, I didn't take hers. Don't want to guess. So I claim it's tempting, it's tempting, but it turns out to be wrong to say that player one has three strategies here. It's tempting to say I either player one moves down, in which case we're done. Oh playing one moves up, in which case at some later dates she may be called upon to choose our pour down again.

Speaker 3:          00:50:20       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       it's very tempting to think the player one has just three strategies here down, in which case we're well up followed by either up or down, depending on what, a little bit, either up or down if she's reached to that point, right? But actually if we followed this definition carefully, we noticed that player one actually has four strategies here. Let me see what they are and you'll see why it's a little odd. So here's one of the strategies we talked about up followed by up. And here's another one we talked about up followed by down, but I claim there are two others down, followed by up and down, followed by down,

Speaker 3:          00:51:11       right?

Speaker 1:          00:51:11       So what's a little weird about this? What's weird is we know perfectly well that is player one chooses down. She's not going to get to me because the choice, the second choice up or down. But nevertheless, the strategy has to tell us what she would do at every node regardless of whether that note actually is reached by that strategy. Let me start again. The strategy has to tell you what payer one would do at that node regardless of whether that node is actually reached by playing that strategy. All right. Just a little weird, right? There's a bit of redundancy here. It's a bit redundant. All right, now why? Well, we'll see why in a second. Let's first of all, consider, uh, what, how this game will be played according to backward induction. All right, so how do we play this game according to backward induction? What do we start?

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       Shouldn't be a trick question, right? Where do we start the game according to backward induction at the end? Okay, so the end here is player one and player one will choose here to go down. It's not right because three is bigger than two. So if we roll back to play a tos move play a two. If she chooses left, she knows that she'll be followed by playing one going down. In which case she'll get one. But if you choose is right, she'll get to so play a two we'll choose right. All right, so play a one. So play a one here. If she chooses op then play a two. We'll choose rights and pay a one will get zero. And if you shoes his down she'll get one. So play on one. We'll shoes down. Alright, so backward induction suggests that player one will choose down and followed by player too. If pair two didn't get to move to choose rights for applied by one, if you do get to move again, choosing down again.

Speaker 2:          00:53:27       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:53:28       GNOSIS that backward induction had to tell us what player too would have done had she got to move and backward induction had to consider what player too would think that player one would have done. We're play or one that to get to move again to do backward induction play, a one has to ask herself what player two is going to do and play. It too has to therefore ask herself what player one would have done, which means play a one has to also vote player two things by a one would have done, which means we actually needed to say what player one did over here.

Speaker 2:          00:54:09       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:54:09       miss that again. So backward induction here tells us that play one chooses down, in which case the game is over. But to do backward induction, to think through backward induction, we really needed to consider not just what player two is going to do. We're here to get to move, but also what player too would think player one would do. We're player to to get to move on toward ordered shoes left. All right, so all of these redundant moves or actually part of our backward induction, right? We need them there so we can think about what people are thinking. All right, so backward induction tells us that the outcome of the game is down. All right? But it tells in terms of strategies, play out, one chooses down and worship. You get to move again, which shoes down again and play a two chooses, right?

Speaker 2:          00:55:07       Right

Speaker 1:          00:55:09       now let's analyze this game a totally different way.

Speaker 2:          00:55:13       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:55:13       we now know what the strategies are on the game play or two has two strategies left and rights and sorry, prior to I left and rights and play a one has four strategies up, up, up, down, down, up and down, down. All right, so let's write out the Matrix for this game.

Speaker 2:          00:55:33       All right, so here it is.

Speaker 1:          00:55:37       It must be a four by two matrix play a two is choosing between left and rights and play. A one is choosing between her four strategies up, up, up, down, down, up and down, down and we can put all the payoffs in. So up up left gets us to here, which is too full up, up, up right, gets us here,

Speaker 2:          00:56:15       which is zero to

Speaker 1:          00:56:17       up down left gets us here, which is three Oh put down, right, gets us here again, which is zero two and down, up or down up or gets us going right out of the game of Middle East. So we're going to go to one zero and in fact that's also true for down up right. And it's also true for down, down left and it's also true for down down, right. All right, so all of these four strategies at the bottom started off by player one choosing down, in which case the game is over. So once again in this matrix you can kind of see the redundancy I was talking about. All right. And this matrix, the third row, the down up row looks the same as the down down row. Everyone's happy with that. All right. So when we've had major season in the past, how have we sold the game and we've been doing this a backward induction stuff for a couple of weeks, but prior to the midterm, if effectively given you this on the mid term, what would you have done? You're just don't. You'd looked for Nash Equilibrium, right? So how does this, let's do that. Let's look for Nash Equilibrium. So if player two shoes is left, then player one player, one's best response is up, up, and if player to chooses rice, then play a one's best response is either down or up or down. Down,

Speaker 2:          00:57:54       right?

Speaker 1:          00:57:55       Conversely, if player one chooses up up, then play a tos, best response is left. If player one chooses up down, then play it as best response is rights. If player one chooses down up, then player two doesn't care because they're getting zero anyway. And if player one chooses down down, then again play a two doesn't care because they're getting a zero anyway.

Speaker 2:          00:58:23       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:58:25       so the Nash equilibrium in this game, how was so one of them is here. All right, so that's one nash equilibrium. One of them is down, down, followed by, right.

Speaker 2:          00:58:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:58:50       [inaudible] Nash Equilibrium. We actually found by backward induction, right? They, the Nash equilibrium down down rights corresponds to the one we found by backward induction. All right, but there's another nash equilibrium in this game. The other now she could have run this game. It is this one. All right. That's also a nash equilibrium. And what does it involve? It involves down, up and writes down. Up and right. Sorry. Down, down, up and right down. Up and right. All right. It's what w what? What happened in that equilibrium player? One went down which made everything else kind of irrelevant player to play to write and play a one in this, in that plan of action was actually going to choose up

Speaker 1:          00:59:51       right to it again, play a one in fact went down player to had they got to move would have chosen, right? Right. And playing one. How'd they got to move at this second time would have chosen up. So how can that be a nash equilibrium? It doesn't correspond to backward induction. I in particular player one player, one up here is choosing a strategy that seems silly, right? That's choosing up rather than down, which gets them to rather than three runs or how could it possibly be that that's an equilibrium strategy. The reason is the reason they can be in equilibrium strategy is it doesn't really matter what player one chooses up here from player one's point of view because it's never going to be reached anyway. As long as player two is going to choose little rights, one of the player two is choosing rights. It really doesn't matter. Master what player one decides to do up there from play one's point of view, it doesn't make a difference isn't reached anyway. All right, so we're highlighting here a danger and the danger is this. If you just mechanically find the Nash Equilibria in a game, you're going to find people choosing actions that if they ever were called upon to make them are silly.

Speaker 1:          01:01:14       Is that again, if you're just mechanically find the Nash equilibrium in the game just as we did here, you're going to select some actions in this case and action by player one that was she called upon and take that action would be a silly action and the reason it's surviving our analysis is because in fact she isn't called upon to make it all right. Now to make that more concrete, let's take this to an economic example. This same idea,

Speaker 3:          01:01:51       all right?

Speaker 1:          01:01:56       One or you want to imagine is a market and in this market that is a monopolist who controls the market entrance? Who is thinking of entering into this market? All right, so right now this market is a monopoly in it. All right? So in in the monopolist isn't incumbent, that's called them ink and an who is trying to decide whether or not to enter the market or whether just stay hours. If they stay out, then the entrance gets nothing and incumbent continues to get monopoly profits. I think that this is 3 million a year,

Speaker 3:          01:02:40       right?

Speaker 1:          01:02:40       If the entrant enters their name, common can do one of two things. The incumbent could choose to fight the entrance. By which I mean charge low prices, advertise a lot, try and drive them out of the market. You can pay very competitively, in which case the entrance will actually make losses from incumbents will drive higher profits down to zero. All right. Conversely, the incumbent could choose not to fight. If they don't fight, then they'll certainly share the markets and they'll move. They'll both make, let's say Cornell profits or duopoly profits of a million each.

Speaker 1:          01:03:22       All right? So in this game, as I say again, there's a market there. The monopolist is in the market and the monopolist is making 3 million a year, which seems pretty nice for the monopolist. Alright? The entrance is trying to decide whether to invade this market. If she invented this market, if she's fought, she's in trouble. But if the, if the monopolous accommodate sir, then they just go to [inaudible] profits and then in front does very well. It gets $1 million in profit. All right, let's have a look at this game analyzed at first of all this time. Let's analyze it by nash equilibrium. All right, so I claim in this game just pretty simple. The entrance has two strategies. You put it straight into the matrix. The entrance has two strategies there either to go in order to stay out, and the incumbent has two strategies. They are either to fight the entrance or not to fight. All right? And the payoffs of this game are as follows. It's been a minute in fights, was minus one zero in a not fights was one one and out led to the incumbents maintaining a monopoly profits. Let's have a look at the Nash equilibrium of this game. All right, so the first thing to do is to look at the best responses for the entrance. So if the incumbent chooses fights, then the entrance best response is to stay out. If the incumbent chooses not fights, then the entrance best response is to answer.

Speaker 1:          01:05:12       Alright, how about for the incumbent? If the entrance chooses to come in, then the incumbent's best response is not to fight because one is bigger than zero. But if the entrance space, it really doesn't matter what the income does, they'll get three either way.

Speaker 2:          01:05:31       All right,

Speaker 1:          01:05:33       so the Nash Equilibria here, I either in followed by not fighting. You end up with a duopoly or I out followed by fighting. Of course, the fight doesn't take place out followed by we would afford had you entered.

Speaker 2:          01:05:59       All right,

Speaker 1:          01:06:00       so these are the Nash Equilibria. Let's analyze this game. My backward induction, right from the incumbents point of view. If the incumbent gets to move, then as you're going to choose fight or not fight, she's going to choose not fight. So the entrance should do what,

Speaker 2:          01:06:22       okay,

Speaker 1:          01:06:23       somebody, they understood her cause if she ends up, she gets one. If she stays out to get zero. So backward induction, backward induction just gives us this equilibrium.

Speaker 2:          01:06:38       All right?

Speaker 1:          01:06:41       Now the question is what do we think's going on with this other equilibrium? Let's talk it through. All right? So here you are. You're about to enter the market. You leave Yale, you set up your business and your business is challenging some monopolist or cause a monopolist like um, Microsoft say, and you go out there and you put it, you, you're, you're about to put out your new operating system. And you knew that your offer, your new operating system will make plenty of money provided Microsoft doesn't retaliate and charged a drop its prices by half and advertise you out of the market. All right, so what does Bill Gates do? Bill Gates, the head of Microsoft, he says, wait a second, before you graduate from Yale, it goes up this company. Ah, let me just tell you, I'm going to fight. If you answer, I'm going to fight right? And if you believe him, if you believe that he's going to fights, what should you do? You're not going to bother to enter his market or you believe that you're gonna get fought by Bill Gates, then you, then you believe that if you enter, you're going to make losses. So you choose to stay hours. And this threat, this threat that that Bill Gates makes here is that it doesn't cost them anything. Provided you go out, he doesn't actually have to fight at all,

Speaker 2:          01:07:57       right?

Speaker 1:          01:07:58       That's why it is in fact an equilibrium to imagine you staying out, believing that you're going to get fought if you enter and it is the best response for the guy to fight, knowing that you're going to stay out, but this doesn't sound right. Why this sound right? It doesn't sound right because you really shouldn't believe the guy who says he's going to fight you when you know that if you did answer facing would cost the incumbent money. If you did answer, if he fights you get zero. If he doesn't fight, he gets $1 million. All right, so this threat that the guy is going to fight you, this threat is not credible,

Speaker 2:          01:08:43       okay?

Speaker 1:          01:08:44       Right? This isn't equilibrium,

Speaker 4:          01:08:48       but it realize it relies on believing. I'm believing

Speaker 1:          01:08:58       an incredible threat.

Speaker 1:          01:09:10       It's true that if you're, if you think about entering the markets that Microsoft is in, you're very likely to get a little email from bill gates. So it won't be an email cause that can be taken to court, but some of the freshman and remark and your air from Bill Gates, it's true if you entered into the market that the people who build airline aircraft to in the head of Boeing might pay you a call one day or send someone round, right? But these threats are not credible. France, is that right? Then not credible threats because we know that if you did into it isn't in their interest to fight that making a little noise about it, but you notice you did into backward induction tells us they're not going to fight.

Speaker 2:          01:09:50       All right. All right,

Speaker 1:          01:09:53       but now we're in slightly in obs situation. All right. Why are we in an odd situation? Two things. One, we seem to be finding that there are Nash Equilibria in Games. We found one here and one up here. There are Nash Equilibria that are not supported by backward induction. That's the first. That's the first reason we're, we're a little worried here and the second reasonable worried it's even the economics of this doesn't quite smell right. Right. For example, if you in fact did inter, sorry, if you did in fact announce you're going to operate a, you're going to build a new operating system and got a threatening phone call from Bill Gates. The might be a reason why you might actually believe that call. Why might you believe that call? Why might you believe that? Cool. Can we get it? Can we get a mic out? Let me, let me try it. I'll do it. I'll do it. So why might you believe a call from Bill Gates saying he's going to beat you up and not be, you are, but he's going to charge low prices. If you produced an operating system,

Speaker 4:          01:11:03       he looks at the, if you look at the future revenue streams, like for the next 10 years and he consistently gets $1 million for the next 10 years, you'll be better off if he just drove you out of the market for the first year and then get

Speaker 1:          01:11:13       $3 million for the next nine years. How that one? Yeah. Okay. That wasn't quite what I'm thinking. I'll be like, okay, it's true if we, if we cheats of base and make one of the, okay. So what you're saying is, uh, I could get three forever unless there's one from it. As soon. These are both present. This kind of devalues a future future cash Eddings right. So we've done, we've done the, we've done the future cash flow analysis of this, right? So this isn't an accounting mistake. All right? Not for accounting reasons. There's some other reason why gates, when gates threatens you, you might want to believe it. I'm gonna try up here first. You can afford to make an example of you so know other people in vain, right? Right. So one of the thing that's in Bill Gates mind is he's right now, he's thinking about competing with you, right?

Speaker 1:          01:11:55       But down the road there's a lot more of you guys coming, right? This, whatever it is, 280 view in this room and there's another 280 and next years passed and so on. And Bill Gates knows that each of you might come out and threatened his monopoly in his Microsoft monopoly and he wanted, he might think that by setting an example to one of you, he might be able to keep the others out and somewhere that kind of arguments, the argument of making an example of somebody is missing here missing completely, but it's going to be important, right? It's got to be an important idea. Alright, so we're going to come back and spend the first half of Wednesday's class picking up that just precisely that idea.
