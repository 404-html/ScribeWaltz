Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Last time we looked at how to apply our new ideas. I've perfect equilibrium to a whole bunch of games. And our general idea for how to solve for subgame perfect equilibrium was as follows. We looked at each sub game we solve for the Nash Equilibrium in the sub game. That's something we learned to do long ago. And then we rolled back the payoffs, we rolled them back up the tree and towards the end we learned something interesting. I don't know, I'm not going to go back to [inaudible]. That's one to emphasize it. We learned that strategic effects matter. So in that investment game we looked at last time when you were considering whether to rent a new piece of machinery, it made a very big difference whether you considered how, uh, how this action would affect the actions of the other side. In this case, how it affects your competition.

Speaker 1:          00:00:53       And this is a very general idea. Very general point. So just, just to give you a couple of more examples. When you're designing tax systems, I mentioned this last time, when you're designing a tech system, make some changes in the U s tax system. It's not good enough to look at how people are behaving and the old tax system and just calculating and accounting manner, how much more money you're going to raise. Well, how much money it's going to cost you. You have to take into account how that's going to lead to changes in behavior. And once again, that's a strategic effects. And in the homework that you're handing in today, uh, all of you would have had it nice example of that in the toll booth problem. So in the toll booth problem, when you're putting tolls on roads or more generally when you're building new roads, new bridges, new flyovers, new bypassed is you need to take into account how those new tolls, how there's new roads will affect all of traffic flow, traffic flow down the tree. We'll, we'll, we'll form a new equilibrium and you need to, you need to consider that in, in, uh, in designing your told in designing your road system. All right? So that's another example of sp. So today I want to do thing quite different a little bit like what we did with dual. I want to play a game today and probably spend the whole of today analyzing this one game. So it's quite a complicated game, but it's been a fun game. All right, so what's the game we're going to look at?

Speaker 1:          00:02:15       The game is going to involve two players,

Speaker 2:          00:02:20       okay?

Speaker 1:          00:02:20       Right in each, each play out in each period,

Speaker 3:          00:02:26       each period they shoes each chooses, I should say, each chooses, he chooses whether to fight or to quit.

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       All right? So ask me in his fights and Q means quit and they make this choice simultaneously. All right, I'm the game and this,

Speaker 3:          00:02:49       the game ends as soon as someone quits, as soon as someone quits all tell, there's good news and bad news for this, for this game. Let's do the good news first. The good news is

Speaker 2:          00:03:08       Vat.

Speaker 3:          00:03:11       If the other player quits first, if the other player quit first, you win a prize, you win a prize. And generally will call this Prize v but we'll play for it for some cash in a minute. The bad news is,

Speaker 2:          00:03:35       okay,

Speaker 3:          00:03:36       the bad news is each period in which both fights, sorry, in which both players choose to fight each player. Hey, he's a cost, so they paid minus c.

Speaker 2:          00:04:03       All right,

Speaker 3:          00:04:07       and just to keep things interesting, let's fill in the other thing here would cheese if both credit ones. So it's both quit at once, then they get zero that period.

Speaker 2:          00:04:22       All right,

Speaker 3:          00:04:24       so this is a game we've seen a little bit before. We start a little bit under the auspices of Hawk dove, those people in the Mba class sort of game a lot like this. But we're going to analyze this in much more detail than we did before as we can from the whole of today talking about it. So to start this out, let's actually play this game. All right? So I want to volunteers. Uh, let me just, uh, since this is a football, see college football season, let me see if I can play off the rivalries. So don't have anybody here from the great state of Texas. Whole Bunch of texts is all right. All right. What does keep your hands are on a, using a second and uh, I guess the rivalry here is Oklahoma. Anybody from Oklahoma?

Speaker 2:          00:05:04       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:05:04       Mirror Oklahomans are, what we'll do is we'll pull, pick two texts and then we'll just assume this is Texas and Texas a and m. All right. So texted them, trace their hands again. All right, we're going to pick out to Texas. All right. And uh, I'm going to give you a mic each. Uh, so your name is nick. Nick, why don't you keep hold of them or you can just point it towards you when you speak, but still shout because we know the rest of the, everyone here wants to hear you. All right, so this is nick. What was my other texts and back? Yeah, I just want to hear when they go for the poster one. All right. That's okay. We'll start here. And your name is Alec. Alec. So started at Alec. That's better. Okay. All right, so the game is this. All right, they're going to have to write down for the first period whether they choose a fight or quit.

Speaker 3:          00:05:52       Oh, with each player will have a referee for the person behind Alec, it's going to be Alex referee to make sure that, uh, the, uh, that Adec is actually saying what he says he's going to do. And what happened to my other texts, him, I've lost my Alexa there is, and your name again was nick and nick is going to write down fight or all quit. And uh, to make this real, let's play for some real cash. So we'll make the prize. Why don't we make the prize equal to a dollar and the costs equaled a 75 cents.

Speaker 3:          00:06:23       All right, so I've got some dollars to, here we go. This is a, uh, what did you call this in, in Texas? We called this a fistful of dollars. Is that right? Does that mean all right? So, okay, so where am I playing? Right when you stand out you guys so everyone can see you. All right. All right. Can I made this difficult night? No, no, no, no, no. You're going to write down your strategy. So we'd have to go grab a pen. And what I did, I didn't make that easy for you. Let me come down and make it easier for the camera person. All right. All right, so, so, uh, what did you, uh, write down what your strategy is going to be and tell your neighbor what it's going to be? I want to see what happened.

Speaker 3:          00:07:01       All right. Show you. Show you a referee. Have you found your referee? All right. And, uh, again, nick speaking into the microphone, what did you do? A quit. He quit. I quit as well. So much for the [inaudible]. What? I'm going to remember the Alamo. I mean this is all right. So Texas didn't work very well. Okay, fine. Let's try it. Let's try a different state. I have to say it. My, uh, my wife's from Texas and my wife's family is from Texas. And I had them had, I thought they had more fight in them than that. Maybe that's why they're sliding in the polls. Let's try somebody from Ohio. Anyone from Ohio? Nobody from Ohio and the whole class. That's no good. That's like, I'm going to pick, I'm going to pick a higher against Michigan. How about some people from some, from some of our own teams.

Speaker 3:          00:07:45       So are there any players on the football team other than the other than the two I picked on before? There we go now and got something. Here we go. So, uh, oh, I need a different team. Anybody from the hockey team? Anybody from the baseball team. Ah, okay, good, good, good. All right. So, uh, a friend from the baseball team, I get, uh, your name is Chris, Chris and our, our new football team player is Rollin Rollin Rollin. Okay. Okay. So Ryan and Andy and Chris are going to play this or seeing the need and easy use nearly as from Texas. I take it all right, so we have some hope or something happening here. All right. So, uh, uh, write down what it, what it is you're gonna do. You're gonna have to choose.

Speaker 2:          00:08:25       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:08:29       All right. Has both written something down? Yeah. All right. And uh, Ryan, what did you choose? Fight and Chris, I'm going to quit. Oh, well that was easy too. Okay. Okay. So the football team looking pretty good here. All right. All right, so we're getting not getting much in the way of, uh, of action going here. Anyone else want to try here? Another little state rivalry here? I don't suppose I've got anyone from Oregon that's asking too much. I went from,

Speaker 1:          00:08:57       you guys must be from somewhere. It's gotta be, it's gotta be a state where at least one of you is prom. All right. All right, well let's try something like New Jersey. How about that? Alright, so it doesn't play as from New Jersey. That's good. All right. All right. There we go. So, all right. And we'll try New Jersey in New York, that seems, but that seems like there's a bit of a rivalry that you're from New York. Excellent. Here we go. Here we go. So, and your name is Kiersten and your name is Andy. Andy. Okay. So guessing and, and these are show up. They'll send up. Someone comes to you on it. Let's see if, uh, if there's any fight in, in New York and New Jersey. All right. All right. Okay. So write down your strategies. All right, good. Now, so, all right. So, uh, uh, Andy, the, what did you choose? I'm going to fight. Fight. Ah, here we go. This is better now. Hey, worried there for a time. I know, I know it's there. The thanksgiving, what the has to be some sort of spark left in the class. That's okay. All right, so we have, we have both people facing, which means right now they're down 75 cents, but the prize is the dollar. So the game goes on. So write down again what you're going to do second period.

Speaker 2:          00:10:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:03       All right. The 75 cents is gone. So now we're just looking at the game for dollar. All right. And let's, let's go to New York. What does New York, I'm gonna fight. Fight. Fight. Okay. So this is, you have to stay on the east coast to get life. There's no point of going away. It's just that, that's not that. That makes sense. All right, so, so write down again what you're going to do.

Speaker 2:          00:10:25       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       Okay. And let's go though around a New Jersey fight. Fight, fight again. All right, so right now we're down with three 75 cents, whatever that is. And uh, it's a still this prize of a dollar out that plus perhaps a bit of pride here. All right, so write down again.

Speaker 1:          00:10:43       All right, let's try again. Let's go with the York. This time I'm going to fight, fight, fight. Okay. I'm guessing, I'm guessing we could keep this going for quite a while. Is that right? I'm going to think he's a good thing for quite a while now. It might make a difference by the way, if there are to talk to each other here. So let's see if it does. Okay, so let's allow New Jersey and New York to talk to each other. You can't insult each other about bridges and tunnels. Just regular Salk. All right? So, uh, anything you want to say to your friend from New Jersey here? I, I can't let New Jersey when it's just the New York pride. You guys are just every weekend, every round. So I'm sorry. All right, well I'm going to keep fighting your best choices to give up. All right. Let's see if that works. I see that we're getting out of that. So choose the strategies again.

Speaker 2:          00:11:29       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:11:30       York, I just can't let Jersey women fight. Bring it on. Fight. All right. All right. So it's clear that we kept this going for awhile. It would pay for my lunch. Is that right? Is that right? All right, well we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll hold it here a second. We'll talk about it a bit, but thank you. A round of applause for our team.

Speaker 2:          00:11:47       Feisty, feisty, Fyi. All

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       right, so what's doing on here? So clearly we can carry, we can see what can happen in this game. You can get people quitting early. All right. And, uh, uh, it could be that one side is quit and the other side doesn't equate that towards something can happen that can happen pretty quickly, but it's possible and we just saw it happen. It's possible that a fight could go on quite a while. All right? A fight could go on quite a while here. All right. Now why, what's going on here is this, I mean, the prize, the prize here was what was a dog and the cost was 75 cents. All right? I could have raised the stakes maybe on these guys and says that that meant that made a difference. But you know, I think, I think a dollar and 79 something my hands we'll do.

Speaker 1:          00:12:34       And by the time they'd fought the second time, they exhausted the possible pry pries of a dollar. Is that right? Right. So it's true that if you won this in the first period, then that's fine because you just got a dog and he wouldn't, he wouldn't have cost you anything. And even if you want in the second period, you'd be okay. You know he cost himself 75 cents for fighting in the first period, but you know you're getting a dollar. So that's good, but their arm and they're all went on for plenty of time. In this case they're on, you're just accumulating losses. So what's going on? So it, there are various conclusions possible here. One is that people from New York and New Jersey are crazy, right? That's a, that's a possible thing. All right, but what else could we w w why do we get involved in this fight? What happened here? Why do we tend to see fights like this emerging? I containing this isn't touch an implausible situation. Why don't we see the motor hits? Let's talk to our friend from New York.

Speaker 4:          00:13:26       Shout out. By the time she fought with me on the second round, I knew I was going to be losing money anyway. So why not just keep going? All right. There was no reason I wasn't going to win anyway. Somebody said just keep fighting so she quit.

Speaker 1:          00:13:40       All right. All right, so there's, I think there's two things. There's two parts that answer. All right. Part of the answer is I'm going to be, I'm sorry I have lost of money anyway. Right? It's hold that piece, that piece of it, and the other part of it is what the other part of it is, I really determined to win this thing. All right. All right, so there's two things going on there and they're quite different. Let's take the second one first. It's possible that the reason these fights emerge and can go on for quite a while is that even though the prize is only a dollar in honey, it could be that the actual thing that the players care about is, well, what are the players actually care about here? Somebody just raise your hand or put you on the mic. What do people tend to care about in these situations?

Speaker 1:          00:14:27       Winning. They care about winning or they care about pride. Is that right? It's not. Know that, that's why I started with Texas, but I couldn't find any pride in Texas, so we had to go to New York. Right? All right, so people care about, people care about winning per se. It's a pride thing. All right. So it could be that a dollar simply, isn't it a good description of the true payoffs here? It could be that the payoffs are actually about winning. All right? It also be that both of these guys know that they're going to be interacting with you at other times in the class or other times at Yale, and they want to establish a reputation, both of them as being the kind of guys who fight, right? In particular when they, when they got to talk about it, right? Both of them said, look, I'm a fight.

Speaker 1:          00:15:11       Since I was nothing we've seen before with ally and his peace and his a pizza shop, both of them said, I am a fighter. You bet it back out. Is that right? To both of them tried to signal the facts that they were going to fight to try and get the other side to quiz? All right? So that's about reputation. And that reputation could extend beyond this game. It could be that they're going to be involved in this kind of, uh, conflicts later on in life. All right? So both of those things are around. All right? Uh, there's another element to this and that's the other part of what are our friend from New York said, which is about the costs. What's true about the costs in this game as we move from period to period? What's true? If somebody said it, say it again. Say it loudly.

Speaker 1:          00:15:53       It's a sunk cost. All right? So all of those costs that you accumulate as the game goes on there. Irrelevance. Looking forward because they're sunk. The fact I've played this game for 10 periods and hence lost 10 10 times 75 cents, which even I can do that. Seven 50 right? The height I've lost 750 is irrelevant because I've lost it anyway. I can't get that back. That's a sunk cost. So the game 10 periods through looks exactly the same as the game did at the beginning when fighting seemed a good option. That right? Alright, he's a 10 periods through the game. You have the same view about facing as you did at the beginning. Now that's not quite true because at some point you're going to run out of money. All right? But do we ignore that? Basically those sunk costs are irrelevant. All right, so what we're seeing here is reasons why people fights and some of these reasons seem to be substandard economic reasons like sunk costs, and some of them seem to be about things that are outside the game, like pride or possibly reputation, right?

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       And it's certainly the case that in the real world we do see fights like this, or is it, let's just spell out what the key feature of this is. The key feature of this is in these fights over a period of time, even though you may only be losing a little piece in each period over a period of time, you could lose a lot. In fact, you could lose far more than the prize that was originally at stake, right? It's all right. So, so the, the, the, the lowest is you could accumulate and that our friend from New Jersey and New York, but Los isn't the accumulated vastly outweighed the prayers that was at stake after a while. All right. That's, that's a worry. That's a worry. Right? Okay. So this, this is gonna occur in real life, not just in the classroom. What do we call these kind of fight these fights where that's that they're holding out for this possibly small prize and incurring, possibly small, but they're humid into being large costs each period. What do we call those fights?

Speaker 2:          00:17:59       Okay?

Speaker 1:          00:18:00       Nobody, well, let's think about some examples if see if they would come side of examples. So one example, let's do some examples. He yet, one example is, uh, what happened in World War One?

Speaker 1:          00:18:20       All right. Two in Walmart as a, I'm assuming most of you know, uh, the, uh, on the, uh, on the western front at least the, uh, the, the, uh, German and allied and an to Germany armies faced off with the British and French and allied armies for an extraordinary long time fighting over extraordinarily small patches of land, little pieces of northern France and Belgium. All right? And you could argue that these pieces of northern France and Belgium, I didn't wish to offend anyone in French [inaudible] here, but you could argue that those few acres of northern France and Germany, one worth a whole lot. Anyway. All right? Nevertheless, the troops are the two sides kept on fighting for our firm from what 1914 to 1918 and enormous losses of wife were accumulated over that period. All right? So that, that was a really costly longterm battle. Neither side would quotes each year, huge numbers of lives were lost.

Speaker 1:          00:19:15       If you doubt that, go and look at the memorial and Yale that shows how many Yale American lives were lost and America was only in that war for about a year. All right? Okay, so that's an example. Another example, and more a business example. An example we talked about in our MBA class, but not in this class so far, is uh, examples in business where there's a market and that market is really only going to hold one from, all right? Well, that markets are you going to hold one firm? You can end up with an extremely long fights about who's going to end up being the one from in that market, right? So a famous example, actually it's a famous business school case, is the fight that, uh, that incurred, uh, to control satellite broadcasting, uh, in Europe. So there was a fight between Sky television and the British Satellite Broadcasting Company, uh, that went on for a number of years and these companies were doing things like charging zero prices and giving away satellite dishes and this, that, and the other.

Speaker 1:          00:20:16       And over the course of the fights, they accumulated so many losses that it would, if you did the accounting, the entire future projected profit flow of winning this fight vastly outweighed the amount of money that they'd lost during the fight. All right? That was a fight that involve on one side, Rupert Murdoch. And you could argue maybe Rupert Murdoch is a little crazy and had a reputation to keep up, but still it looks like another example of this. So that example was British satellite broadcasting versus sky. So with those two examples there, and they won't think of a general term, we call these fights. What do people refer to it? How do people refer to the, the method of fighting and well, the one or for that matter during the American civil war. Yeah. Somebody in the back, shout it out. It's a war of attrition. All right, so these are wars of attrition.

Speaker 2:          00:21:10       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:21:12       These are wars of attrition and what we know about wars of attrition is that they can go on a long time and a lot can be lost. A lot of life can be lost. In the case of real wars, I don't know if money can be lost in the case of business wars. All right. And actually it turns out a lot of games have this structure of a war of attrition. Let me give you one more example. Suppose that two companies are competing for a market, not in the manner of BCI be a of BSB and sky basically advertising or whatever, but in the form of paying bribes. All right, so I suppose there's a company, let's say in France and a company, let's say in Britain, and these two companies are trying to control a try. I tried to win a contract in some country where paying bribes is a, is a successful strategy.

Speaker 1:          00:21:56       And here I'm going to be careful about the film and not mentioning the real country. So let's call this imaginary country free Donia, which comes from a Marx brothers film. All right? So here's this French company, this British company, and they both want this contract to build a bridge in Fredonia and they start playing bribes to the general who controls for Donia. All right? And what happens when you're not going to get the bride back? So both sides, no pay a few thousand dollars to this general. And then the general comes back and say, what are you both pay the thousand dollars which of you wants to pay the bridge? So they'd go on and they put more money in and more money in. And you can see, once again, this is a war of attrition. There's Brian was that they've paid, they're never getting back. But once you've paid them, there are some costs, right? Once you pay that bribe, good luck saying, I paid you this bribe. You didn't let me build the bridge. Give me my money back right there. It doesn't the caught in the world that's going to enforce that. All right? So these bribery contests look a lot like this,

Speaker 1:          00:22:54       or there's a technical name for these bright contests. They're sometimes called, Ooh, pay auctions. All right, so what do we want to establish today? We want to establish, uh, what to talk about, why you fighting occurs here. And we wanted to do so in some details. So there maybe in his formal reasons why fighting a, and we've talked about that. It could be that one side is crazy. It could be the both sides are crazy. It could be that national or regional is at stake. All of these things could affect why we get fighting. But what I want to try and establish today is that you can get long fights emerging in what? Potential wars of attrition, even if everybody is rational, even if the payoff is just that $1. All right? And even if there's no reputation at stake. So again, my goal today is to try and convince

Speaker 3:          00:23:45       you that you can get huge loss of life and world war one, a huge loss of money in these business contexts without having to argue something outside the model, like a rationality or reputation. Alright? Even rational players can get themselves in trouble in wars of attrition, right? So that for the rest of the day, I want to try and analyze this and to get us started, I want to look, I had a version of this game at a simplified version, which only lasts for two periods. All right? So we'll do a two period version of the game we played just now and eventually by the end of today, I want to look at the infinite version. Okay? So we'll start, we'll start small. We'll start with a two

Speaker 2:          00:24:31       to pray,

Speaker 3:          00:24:38       right? The trick and analyzing these things is to be able to come up with a tree and the other come up with payoffs and apply the analysis that we know about to get us to where we want to be. All right? So here's, here's the game I claim I claim, but it has the following tree. So first of all, player a chooses and play. An hey can either fight or quit. And then we put a one in brackets, we'll see what the one is in a second, then play it. Then we got a mobile player too. But of course this is a simultaneous move game and he just hung on hangers move. So this is an information set. I'm not going to play a tournament player B to play a. B doesn't know what a has done that first period when B is making her choice. This is the simultaneous move and B is choosing between, between, uh, fighting or quitting. And just to distinguish them, let me use small letters for B for B. So once again, fight or quit

Speaker 2:          00:25:40       and fight or corns. All right,

Speaker 3:          00:25:46       now if both sides fights, then the game continues and everyone knows that both sides of sport at that stage. So at this point on, we're actually at a singleton information node and it's player a turn. Again.

Speaker 2:          00:26:01       Thank you. Thank you. Sorry. All right. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:26:06       All right. So here we go again. So in the second period, once again, we've got a choosing whether to fight or critic. And this time we'll put it to to indicate where in the second period and after player to his moves. Once again, uh, well off to a has moved. Once again, play a B is moving up to simultaneous move. And once again that choosing

Speaker 2:          00:26:31       Fido question,

Speaker 3:          00:26:35       I'll put twos to indicate that we're in the second stage. All right? So that's the structure of this two Ed gain. Okay. And let's write down what the payoffs are. Starting with the easy pay offs. So if both people quit in the first stage, they get nothing. If a quits and be fights than a gets nothing and be gets V if a fights and be quits, then a gets V and B gets nothing. And if they both fight, we go into, we go into the second stage. So it's right down the payoffs and the second stage. So the second stage, if they both quit on the second stage, then their payoffs are going to be for any minus c the cost they accumulated in the first stage plus zero and for B and for B minus c plus Sarah, if they, if a quit and be fights in the second stage than the payoffs are minus c plus zero and minus C plus B.

Speaker 3:          00:27:40       If a fights and be quits, then the payoffs are minus C plus B minus c plus zero. And if they both fight for two periods, we have a decision to make. But how we're going to end the game and this two periods in the super game. But let's just assume that what we'll get here is minus c minus c minus C minus C. Right? What are some of they both fights the game ends and no one gets the prize or just to make it just to make life simple. Alright, so this is a to period to period version of the game and the only change I've made other making it two periods is I have to put on a pay off. That's what happens if the game didn't resolve and I've assumed as the game didn't resolve, no one wants, no one got the price.

Speaker 3:          00:28:24       All right. Now there's another assumption I'm going to have to make before we analyze this. There are two possible cases to consider here. There's the case where the is bigger than C, which is the case. We just played it in the class and there's also the converse case when the cost is bigger than v. All right, so today we'll focus on the case the bigger than C, which is the case. We've just, we just played in class. I'm going to leave you to analyze the other case, the case when the cost is bigger than the prize as a homework assignment. All right? All right, so v bigger than c is the, is uh, is our assumption. All right? Is everyone okay with the tree or this tree, I hope describes the game? Uh, at least a two period version of the game. Now, the first thing I want to point out here is if we look at the payoffs that are incurred at the end of the second period game, we noticed that they all contain a minus C. All right? There's a minus c everywhere, all right? What is that minus c? It's the cost that you accumulated from having fought in the first stage, all right? But the observation I want to make straight away is that this cost, so here it is. Here it is. Here it is. Here it is. Here it is. Here it is, and here it is. And here it is. This cost is sunk. Hi, there's these objects here are sunk costs.

Speaker 3:          00:30:00       There's nothing you can do once you're in the second period of the game to get these sunk costs back. They've just gone there, there, but the fact that they enter everywhere is going to make them strategically irrelevant. All right? Okay, so what I want to do here is we want to find all of the subgame perfect equilibria of this level game. All right? So let me push this up quite high.

Speaker 2:          00:30:28       We'll see

Speaker 3:          00:30:35       and let me get rid of the rules. We all know the rules by now.

Speaker 3:          00:30:47       So our goal here is to use our solution concepts, which is subgame perfect equilibrium to try and analyze this gate. So how are we going to, how are we going to analyze this gay man in terms of subgame perfect equilibria. How are we going to start that discussion when I got a lot of work to do here? Where are we going to start and finding so perfect equilibrium. What's the first thing we should do? When I came, the first thing we should do is just figure out what the sub games are. Let's start with that. All right, so having just pushed it far away, I'm going to need to use the pointer, but I claim that the, the, the obvious sub game to it to analyze first is this sub game. It's the sub game. If you should end up in period two, I noticed that he's a sub game. It starts from a singleton node. It doesn't break up any information set and it contains all of the descendants of the mode from which it starts crying. That is genuinely messed start again. All right, so we're going to start our analysis by considering the second sub game.

Speaker 2:          00:31:59       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:32:00       the second slot game. All right, so let's write down the matrix that corresponds to that second sub game and I'm going to write it down in the following way. So I claim in this second sub game, each plan has two choices. They can fight well quits fights, oh wait. And I'm going to write the payoffs in a particular way. I'm going to write the payoffs as minus c plus this thing. All right? So rather than keep that in mind to see in all the which one to get, it's going to get boring after awhile. I'm going to pull that minus c out and just put it in front. Is that okay? Right. We had this, we had this sunk cost box everywhere and I'm going to pull out this sunk cost box and put it in front of here it is. If you get into the second period of the game, if you've incurred this sunk cost, all right?

Speaker 3:          00:33:02       And your payoffs in this game, if you both fight, then you incur minus c for the second time. If a fights and be quits, then a is going to win the prize. So they'll get the, and a player two will get nothing. If I, if I be gets nothing, if be fights and ache, which then conversely a gets nothing and play a bee gets the prize. And if they both quit, they just get nothing, right? She just knows what I did here. I could've written out in the box with minus c minus C here minus c minus c here, minus c Plus v here, minus C plus zero here, minus c Pissarro here, et cetera. But I just pulled out that minus c because it's just distracting everything. All right? So I pull out that minor seed and put it in the front. All right?

Speaker 3:          00:33:55       Okay. So now we can analyze this, uh, this little, this little game. And let's start off by talking about pure strategy equilibrate in this game. So again, our goal is to find subgame perfect equilibria. So the way in which we find some gaming equilibria is what we start at the last sub games. We look for Nash Equilibria in those last sub games and then eventually we're going to roll those back. All right, so there's our lost I've gained, there's the matrix for it lets us find the, it's fine, the Nash equilibrium. So if player B, player B is fighting, then pay it [inaudible] best response is to quit. And if Perrier is fighting, then play a bes best responses to quit. Conversely, if pay a be as quitting player A's best responses to fight and if B is fighting, play a [inaudible] a is quitting, then play a bes best responses to fight it didn't say that right? Let me try it again. So if a is fighting, uh, if the other side is fighting, you want to quit. If the other side is quitting, you want to fight right? That clip. All right. So there are actually two, there are two to be careful here. Your strategy, there are two pure strategy, Nash Equilibria in this odd game. And what are they? They are fight, quit and quit fight.

Speaker 3:          00:35:38       So if we get into the second some game and if we're gonna, if we know we're going to play up your strategy and the second sub game and this is what's going to happen,

Speaker 2:          00:35:44       that's our claim.

Speaker 3:          00:35:47       All right? All right. I noticed that it didn't matter. The Sun cost doesn't matter that I could have included the sunk cost in the payoffs, but I had to find exactly the same thing with or without, with or without the sunk cost. So as, as we, as we expect this one cost is irrelevant. All right, so we've gone, we've got both the equilibrate and the son game. Let's roll this back. Let's roll these back into the first stage of the game.

Speaker 2:          00:36:13       All right, well I do that.

Speaker 3:          00:36:19       The payoffs associated with these, the payoffs associated with this one Oh v and zero and the payoff associated with this one is zero and v one okay, well that, okay, let's revisit the first stage of this game and now things get a little bit more complicated. It's what I'm going gonna do is I'm going to redraw the first stage of this game.

Speaker 2:          00:36:53       So Harrison, there it is.

Speaker 3:          00:37:02       Hey Ken, fight walkways, justice before and following this beacon. Phyto just as before.

Speaker 3:          00:37:19       Well, this is a picture of the first stage of the game, but I'm going to chop off the second stage. All right, that's what the payoffs in. All right. What? So the payoffs down here, the same as they were before. Xero, Xero, rocking up zero V if a fights and be quick, then it's v zero but what about the payoff if they both fights? So what I want to do now is I want to get the pail for them when they both fight by considering what they would get if they both fight in the second period of the game. All right, Mariah idea is our idea is fine. The Nash Equilibrium in the second period of the game, I'm rollback these possible payoffs. All right, so here the payoffs are going to B minus C plus stage two.

Speaker 2:          00:38:16       Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:38:17       Nash Equilibrium. Hey offs the player one and minus c plus the same thing. Stage two Nash equilibrium payoffs for play B. All right, just understand what I've written here. Then I got the same pay office before but I've replaced can reach it back. I've replaced that enormous thing. That was the second stage of the game. Just with the payoffs that we know that we're going to get in the second stage of the game if we play Nash equilibrium on the second stage. All right, so these objects, these objects have a name and the name is

Speaker 2:          00:39:06       continuation pals.

Speaker 3:          00:39:13       These objects are the continuation power for the pals I'm going to get tomorrow and possibly forward in a more complicated case if in this case if I fight, if we both fight in the first period. All right? Now what want to do is we want to draw up the matrix that corresponds to this first stage game and we're going to have to do is to twice we're going to have to do so once for the case where the continuation payoffs are v zero whether equilibrium we're playing tomorrow is fight grid and we're going to have to do so again for the case where the continuation pay off tomorrow are Zero v namely the continuation payoff. The continuation play is quit fight. All right, I'll do it twice. All right, so let me, you've got this to do Asian power ups downs. I convinced them to give us a little bit of rum. All right, so the matrix is going to look as follows.

Speaker 2:          00:40:11       Nice big matrix.

Speaker 3:          00:40:14       Do you buy to play an a is choosing fights or quit the play? A two is choosing phyto quits and how much is easy? It's what we put in here that matters. So let's do all the easy cases first. So quit. Quit is zero zero quit fights is zero. V Fight. Quit is v zero. And in here it's going to depend which of these two games, which of these two equilibria is being played tomorrow. So that we're going to do here is where they do the case

Speaker 2:          00:40:52       for the equilibrium fight. Quit in Stage two.

Speaker 3:          00:41:04       All right. When we gonna write it in the Matrix for the case, we're going to pay fight quit tomorrow. So if we play fight,

Speaker 3:          00:41:14       okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. And try and keep, it's a good idea. Try and keep you consistent today cause it's very easy to slip. So that's good. So once again, I'm going to use capital letters for play. A and small us will play a beat. Thank you. All right, so what happens if we both fight? We both incur costs of c from fighting and tomorrow we're going to get the pay offs from the equilibrium fights equates that to this equal equilibrium. So we're going to get v zero tomorrow. That's add those in.

Speaker 3:          00:41:52       So this will be plus V and this'll be plus zero. All right. And this has put some short crown here to indicate that these are going to be continuation payoffs, right? So this is what they get. This is what the are. This is the matrix going to use to analyze the first age of the game. In the case where the equilibrium we're playing tomorrow is fight quit. And as they promised me, if you do this twice. So the other case of course is if the only other equilibrium tomorrow, so it's just do that. So once again, we have fight one quit one fight, one quit one and the payoffs are same as we had zero zero's viz there. And then here this time we're going to have minus C plus zero and minus c plus v. And the reason for the change is that we're now looking at the continuation game, the continuation play words player, what his player, Hey, who quits in the second stage.

Speaker 3:          00:43:03       This is for the case, quick to fight too in period two. All right, so let's just pause, make sure everyone's got that down one. Okay. So what we've done here is we started off by analyzing what's going to happen in period two and that really wasn't very hard. Is that right? That was a pretty simple game to analyze it. Pretty easy to find the equilibrium. Then what we did was we rolled back the equilibrium payoffs from period two, and we plunked them on top of the relevant. Uh, I taught on top of the relevant payoffs in period one. So in particular, if you both fight and you know you're going to play the fight, quit equilibrium tomorrow, then you'll pay. Payoffs will be minus C plus V and minus C plus zero. If you both fight and you know you're going to play the quit fights equilibrium tomorrow, then you'll pay offs will be c plus zero minus D, Pissarro and minus c plus v.

Speaker 3:          00:44:06       And just to emphasize, once again, these four boxes we created, these four boxes we created, correspond to the stage to Nash equilibrium pay. So the continuation payoffs of the gate. All right? Okay, so now we're ready to analyze each of these games. All right, so this isn't going to be too hard. All right, let's try and find out the Nash of this game. So it's not with the left hand one. This is the case where a player a is going to fight and win in period two. Alright, so if player, if player, uh, B, if plan B is going to quit in period one then if payer a fights, she gets a v if she quits, she gets zero. So she's going to want to fight,

Speaker 2:          00:44:55       never. Okay with that.

Speaker 3:          00:44:57       And if player B fights in period two, then if pat [inaudible] fights, she gets minus c Plus v and if she quits he gets zero. And here's where our assumptions going to help us. We've assumed what, what are, we are still using V as bigger than C, is that right? Just like we played in class. So because of the is bigger than, see this is going to be the best response. Again, fighting to of the best response. All right, so we know that in fact player a here has a dominant strategy. The dominant strategy is to fight in period one and this little in this analysis look, Amen. And Shinsei is fighting. Not surprisingly, but we're going to find that B is going to quit. All right? So, so, uh, bes best response is to quit. All right, so here, here is our Nash equilibrium in this. Okay. All right, so this, this, this game has a Nash equilibrium and he has one and that equilibrium is fight one

Speaker 2:          00:46:04       quick one

Speaker 3:          00:46:05       and let's just do what it intuitively you for a second. Intuitively, if I know I'm fine playing Jake, and I know that Jake is going to fight tomorrow and I know, uh, sorry I'll be around. I know that Jake's going to quit tomorrow. I know Jack's going to quit tomorrow and I'm going to fight tomorrow. I know that tomorrow I'm going to win. That prize is there for me tomorrow. So why would I want to quit today? Right? I don't, I'm, I'm going to get a dollar tomorrow, right? I just fight in this period. So why would they want to quit today when it, worst case scenario, I'm only going to lose 75 cents today. So I know Jake is quitting tomorrow. I'm going to stay on and fight and fight now. And conversely, if Jake knows he's quitting tomorrow and she knows I'm going to fight now, he might as well just quit.

Speaker 3:          00:46:52       It's what we're learning here is in this particular example, in this particular example, if we know that tomorrow I'm going to win, I'm gonna win the war, I'm going to actually going to win it today. Is that again, if we know that tomorrow I'm going to win the war, I'm actually going to win it today. All right? And the converse is true for the case where I'm the quitter and Jake's the fight tomorrow. So once again, it's pretty quick to see that if I'm going to, uh, uh, from [inaudible] point of view, if I'm going to fight, he's gonna want to fight. If I'm going to quit, he's going to want to fight. So in either case, he's going to want to fights. So I'm going to want to quit.

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       So the NASA could I run this game is, uh, is quit. It's quick. One fight to my show. He can write that in a better angle. That's probably, again, quit one fight too. All right.

Speaker 3:          00:47:53       So at this stage we found all of the pure strategy subgame perfect equilibria in the game. Let's describe them before I write them up, right? One pure strategy, Nash equilibrium has me fighting in period one and Jake quitting in period one and if we got to Paris to which about we won't, then I fight again and he quits again.

Speaker 2:          00:48:19       All right, so let's write that equilibrium up and we'll do it here. Uh, we do it on the top board actually. Thank you. Thank you.

Speaker 3:          00:48:38       So let, let, let, let me get it right when I write up as that. There's a whole equilibrium. So I claim I have now found all of the pure strategy, yes.

Speaker 2:          00:48:47       Coffee in this game.

Speaker 3:          00:48:56       One of them involves my facing in the first period and facing in the second period.

Speaker 2:          00:49:04       I'm Jake quitting in the first period and quitting in the second period.

Speaker 3:          00:49:14       And the other one just flips it around. I quit in the first parade that I got that I would quit on the second period

Speaker 2:          00:49:25       and Jake

Speaker 3:          00:49:27       fights in the first period. And if he got there, he would also fight in the second period.

Speaker 2:          00:49:33       All right?

Speaker 3:          00:49:35       So these are perfectly natural equilibrium to think about if you're wanting to get intuitively one of the, each of these equilibria involves a fighter and a quitter. The Phytel always fights. The quitter always quits. If I know I'm playing a quitter, I'm always going to fight. So that's the best response. If I know I'm facing a fighter, I'm going to want to quit. So that's the best response. And those are two very simple equilibrium, right? That's the good news. What's the bad news here? The bad news is we haven't achieved our goal. Our goal was to argue that rational players might get involved in a fight and notice that in each of these to pure strategy, subgame perfect equilibria in each of them, no real fight occurs. It's not right.

Speaker 1:          00:50:28       And each of them, one person fights the first pro, but the other person just runs away. That isn't much of a fight. All right? Say it again. In each of these equilibria, one side is willing to fight, but the other side isn't. So no fight occurs in a particular, no costs are incurred in either of these equilibria, but I claimed at the beginning I wanted to explain how we can have costs occur in equilibrium by Ryan. Rational players are going to incur costs. So what are we missing here? What should I do to try and find a more costly equilibrium? I claim I'm still missing some equilibria here. What kind of equilibrium I missing? I'm missing the mixed strategy equilibrium. So far all we've done is sold out the pure strategy equilibrium, but we need to go back and reanalyze the whole game. Looking now for mixed strategy, whatever.

Speaker 2:          00:51:29       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:51:30       so we're going to do the entire, take a deep breath because we won't take the whole analysis we just did. We're going to repeat the entire analysis we just did, but this time we're going to look at mixed strategy whenever. All right, everyone happy what we're doing. So first of all, we're going to go back to the second sub game. Here's the second sub game and we already found the pure strategy. You color breast. Let me get rid of them in your notes. You probably want to rewrite this matrix, but I'm not going to be ready to here cause we were a bit short of time. This is exactly the same payoff matrix we saw before. But now I want to look for a mixed strategy equilibrium in this game. How do I go about finding as good review this, how do I go about finding a mixed strategy equilibrium in a game like this? What's the trick for finding mixed strategy equilibrium? So we try our guys from New Jersey and new in New York. My God, let's try our guys from New Jersey, New York. How do I, whereas I'm like, where's my, uh, New York, right? We will have the true battle here with him in New York and New Jersey. How do we find a mixed strategy equilibrium?

Speaker 5:          00:52:43       Um, yeah, he's like, ah, the and q's and set them equal to one another. That's okay.

Speaker 1:          00:52:50       Crude thing. Okay. So the answer was we find the p's and q's and quotes sent to them. Are you called to one another? What is it? We're actually still equal to what? What are we saying equal to one? Let's try and get some response on this. What does that do it I knew Jersey pie fleet, whereas I it as the question, yeah, they fled. Uh, we could give our texting's and challenge was our tech. There was a text and down here somewhere. What does it like I said, have you called a what?

Speaker 5:          00:53:15       I guess the chances that one, that one would fail and yet or that d one more the other way to fight. Mm,

Speaker 1:          00:53:21       not quite. Not quite that. The remark about using and q's as

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       right, but what does that, this is a good review for the final, what is it I'm going to do with those p's and q's? Yeah, sure. You have it out. You use the other players, payoffs, you use the other players. Pay Offs, an indifferent between the strategies. Goods. Good. I'm going to choose, play a bees mix in such a way as to make player a indifference between choosing fight and quits. So as to make it plausible that be, is it a, is actually mixing. So again, the intuition is for a to be mixing. They must be indifferent between fighting and quit. So I'm going to choose the mix of B to make a indifference. That's good review. Let's do that. So here I've used a user that a cue, but to avoid confusion here, let me use the letter p. All right, we're going to choose P to make player a indifference. So if a, if a fight a fight, then their payoff is what? It's all like. It's minus C with probable OCP. And can I minus C with Probo, OCP and VI with problems c one minus p. All right? Is it just should be coming back. Now, this is before the midterm, but you guys were alive before the midterm, right? So you were should remember this, do they fight? They get minus c times p Plus v one minus P. Alright, if they quit, if they quit, then they get zero with problem OCP and zero again with probability one minus p.

Speaker 3:          00:55:16       So we know that if a is mixing, B must be mixing in such a way as to make these two numbers equal. So we know these two must be equal to one another. Students that equal, we can now solve for p. All right, so what's that going to give us? It's going to give us v one minus P is equal to p c. Okay. And that I think is p is equal to v Over v plus six is that right? I'm just check my order. And if you remember the game of Hawk dove that we saw just before the midterm, the game involving a two, it was the, it was a game we looked at. When we look at evolution, this is essentially the same game more or less as that game. And then you'll notice it's the same. How to make sure we've got here.

Speaker 3:          00:56:10       All right, so p is equal to v Over v Plus C, which means one minus P is equal to c over the bossy. I'm leaving it up there a bit, hoping that one of the Tas, he's going to just do my for me. I think that's right there. That's right. All right, so this game is symmetric. So both players are going to, we could do the same. We can do the same for B, but we'll find the same thing right to symmetric game. All right, so the mixed strategy equilibrium, the mixed Nash equilibrium in this game has both mix, both fights with probability equal to v Over v Plus C.

Speaker 2:          00:56:55       All right?

Speaker 3:          00:56:58       Now this is good news because they were getting some fighting going on, but we need to do something. We need to take this Nash Equilibrium we've just found, which is a nash equilibrium in the second sub game. It's a Nash equilibrium in the sub game way up here. And we need to roll back the payoffs from this sub game. The equilibrium payoffs in this sub game into the first stage. That's our method. How are we going to do that? Well, if not better, first of all, figure out what those payoffs are. So what are the payoffs in this equilibrium?

Speaker 3:          00:57:37       The payoffs in this mixed nash equilibrium. Oh, what do you want to see? What the payoffs are going to be if they post playing this mix while presumably the payoff from fights and the payoff and quit must be the same. Is that right? So we miss, we'll choose the easier one. So I claimed that the payoff from quit is zero times p plus zero times one minus P, which is zero ve over v Possy poss zero Cov posse, but that's equal to watch zero. Okay, good. So it's got to be the case kind of conveniently did. If they do play this mixed strategy equilibrium in Stage two, the payoff they'll get from playing it is zero. That's going to make life a little bit easier later on. All right, that's our new equilibrium in the second psalm game. Now let's roll that back to the first game.

Speaker 2:          00:58:36       Okay,

Speaker 3:          00:58:42       here's our first game again. Alright. And everything about this is is correct. Everything about it is correct except what's down here. Let's get rid of what's down here.

Speaker 2:          00:58:58       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:59:00       Our analysis from before is more or less than tax. It's still the case that if they both quit, they'll get zero. If they quit fight, they'll get zero Viavi zero and it's still the case was they both fight. They'll both incur costs of c and r both then get stage two continuation Nash Payoffs, is that right? But now instead of those continuation Nash Payoffs Being v Zero Zero v, those continuation Nash Payoffs are going to be what? They're going to be zero. They're going to be zero. So we're going to do here is we're going to backward and doctor rollback those zero pay offs and come up with the corresponding may to describe the first stage of the game and heritage is fight, quit

Speaker 2:          00:59:52       live, laugh.

Speaker 3:          00:59:54       Try and get it right without Jake having to correct me this time. A little laugh, middle laugh. It'll cue. This is a, this is B and the payoffs here, oh zero zero zero V v zero just as before and in this box. Now we've gotten minus C plus zero and minus C plus zero. All right, so it's exactly the same box we saw before, but now the continuation payoffs, how justice zero. All right, and again, what is this? This is for the Nash Equilibrium, as I say, for the mixed, for the mixed Nash Equilibrium in period two.

Speaker 2:          01:00:51       All right.

Speaker 3:          01:00:53       I want, I want to do is I want to find the mixed equilibrium in parade one, right? We found the premixed equipment period two. Now I want to find the mix equilibrium and her ed one. So what I could do here is I could spend a lot of time, I could put it a piano, a piano, one minus P and I could work out what mix of player B. We'll make a indifference. I could work at what point mixed of player hey would make be different. But does anybody notice something about this matrix? What do you notice about this matrix? Somebody, somebody help me out. Somebody got to help me out here. Tell me something about this matrix. W what? What? What? What's true at this matrix? The same as the one above. It's the same as the one above, right? The Matrix I just drew when I rolled back the pay offs, when I roll back, the payoffs is exactly the same matrix that I had here. It's exactly the same matrix. So we already know what the mix strategy you could ever have. Isn't this the mixed Nash equilibrium in this matrix

Speaker 2:          01:02:03       is

Speaker 3:          01:02:05       to fight is is both fight with probable a c p Equals v over v Posse. So when now ready, just show on new, on new subgame perfect equilibrium. It's dried it down. Here's our whole game. We found the pure group. Sorry we found a pure spes, but now we're ready to find the mixed sp. The mix of getting perfect equilibrium has player a while. Before I do that, let me just give this PNA. Let me call this p p star. Okay, so Vov Posse, that's quite Pete star. So the mix of getting perfect equilibrium has player one mixing, fighting with property, pea stone and the first stage. And then the second stage. Again, mixing fighting prop with proper OCP star. This is player one and player two does exactly the same thing. And while we're here, watch the expected payoff for each player. If they're playing this mixed subgame perfect equilibrium, what does that, it's zero. It's Sarah. The payoff from this, the expected payoff is all right, so now we're actually getting somewhere. Now we're really getting somewhere.

Speaker 3:          01:03:55       Let's just take a deep breath and see where we are. We, we broke this game down, this complicated game we played in class that it conceivably, for example, when it New York is playing New Jersey conceivably could go on all night. Apparently not when the Texans are playing each other or the football team's playing the baseball team, but when we have New York and Jersey, you could go on all night, hey, we could tell it to a two period game, but in a minute, want to go back to the infinite game, right? In this two period, gay man, I tried to argue that we could, I'm trying to convince you that you could get fighting occurring Justin equilibrate with absolutely standard rational players. Nothing to do with pride. It was reputation. Nothing to do with the fact that these guys are crazy guys who've drunk the wharf for Newt New York and New Jersey.

Speaker 3:          01:04:38       God held them all, right, you're going to s you can get fighting with ordinary people in equilibrium. All right, and what we've shown is the way which you can get fighting, is it a mixed strategy equilibrium in each period of the game. People fight with pro books. Eep. That's just enough fights to give the other side at an incentive to quit and just enough problems. You have the other side quitting to give the other side of a, an incentive to fight just exactly enough. If they play that equilibrium in every period there's some chance of the game ending. But with problems, the p the game goes forward to the next period. So you could potentially have fights per two prayers by the way. With what problem? See? Would there be a fight in both periods? That's a good homework question. I won't answer it here. Right? You can work it out at home.

Speaker 2:          01:05:32       Alright. Alright. Alright. So what do we do it here?

Speaker 3:          01:05:37       Anyone want to tell me that? So, okay. And what problem we will probably lose you do. We're going to fight in the first parade. A real fight to fight involving both players.

Speaker 3:          01:05:48       What do you both players to fights each a fighting with Bono. Cep. So the problem is you have both of them. Fighting is one p squared. All right, so we're going to fight in the first period, the problems he is p squared to get to fight in both parades. It's what better Pete Peters, the fourth. All right? But we get a fight with probably the of the fourth going through. All right? We get fighting and equilibrium. Moreover, we get some very intuitive things that we already learned in the Hawk dove game, right? The probability of fights, and they said the probability of fights occurring, the problems occurring, it goes, oh, how's the fee goes up? So the prize gets bigger. You're more likely to see fights. The car that seemed right, and it goes down and see the problems your fights occurring goes up in the size of the prize. That seems intuitively right and down in the cost of fighting.

Speaker 2:          01:06:52       All right?

Speaker 3:          01:06:54       No. Okay, that's reasonable. But I claimed I could show you this, not in a two period game, but in an infinite period game. So let me spend the last five minutes taking us to infinite parade games. All right? So everybody take a deep breath. We're now going to come to something we'd never done before. We're going to consider a gay man that could go on forever, could go on forever.

Speaker 2:          01:07:20       All right?

Speaker 3:          01:07:21       And the way we're going to do that is to use the following idea and the following picture. So I can't really draw a true tree for the infinite period game. And the reason they can't draw a true tree for the infinite parade gay man is one I would run out of shock and two, I'd run it lunch. Lunchtime. All right? But you could imagine what it looks like. It looks like this. Roughly speaking. Yes.

Speaker 2:          01:08:01       Uh hmm.

Speaker 3:          01:08:03       Can I get this right? It's not. Again, you can put a period game look, something like this

Speaker 2:          01:08:12       and that has again,

Speaker 3:          01:08:19       all right. And that goes again.

Speaker 2:          01:08:20       Okay,

Speaker 3:          01:08:23       that's so awesome. All right. How did it go right the way through the board and what? Right the way across whatever street that is right across campus. All right. That's what the infinite tree would look like. So I clearly can't really analyze that object, but what I want to show you is that we can still solve this game even though it's an infinite period game. How are we going to do that? Let's look at a particular stage. Let's call the stage stage 4,503 all right, whatever that number works right? For 4,503 whatever it was, right? So here is the stage, it's all arbitrary stage, and then the tree for this arbitrary stage looks like this.

Speaker 2:          01:09:02       All right?

Speaker 3:          01:09:03       And then what I'm going to do is this is, you know this, this is stage. What was it? 5,000 was it 4,503 all right, this, this is the stage, all right? And what I'm going to hide to this is that before you get into this stage, you're going to incur some costs,

Speaker 2:          01:09:24       all right?

Speaker 3:          01:09:25       And if you go on playing off to this stage, then you're going to get continuation values, all right? So going into the beginning of the game, you've incurred some sunk costs, and if you come out on the other side and go on playing, you're going to play some equilibrium and get continuation values. But otherwise everything else is the same. We still have zero zero here. We still have zero V v here. We still have visa zero here and here we still have minus C plus continuation values and minus c plus continuation.

Speaker 2:          01:10:09       All right,

Speaker 3:          01:10:11       and this is something we've seen before, right? They said the box is something we've seen before. Essentially we've got sunk costs in front, but they're relevance. We've got continuation values at the end, we know how to handle that and we just put them into the payoffs. All right, so suppose now suppose that in the continuation game people play the mixed strategy that we just found. Suppose that in the continuation game people makes with provosts VP, so they fight with problems. He p Star and quit with Aldi, one minus p stone, exposing the continuation game. They're playing a mixed strategy. In that case, what is the continuation value of the game? Miss that again? All right, what is it? It's zero, right? If I'm mixing in the future, they always had the option to quit. So it must be that the continuation value is zero. So if they mix in the future, then the continuation value

Speaker 3:          01:11:20       is zero. Zero. All right, so now let's go back to this board. All right. To make this board or call them to the board above, all they need to do is one thing I need to add on some sunk costs at the front. I've got sunk cost at the front. I'm going to play the game and then I'm going to get, isn't it a stage two values? I'm going to get stage, what was it, 4,503 in all stages in the future. Values in here and here, but otherwise it's the same thing and what's convenient is all of those is zero anyway, since they're all zero anyway, this matrix is still correct, right? The continuation values are zero and zero is another continuation values.

Speaker 2:          01:12:13       These are the continuation values

Speaker 3:          01:12:19       and so if I look for a mixed strategy equilibrium in this game, it's something I've sold already watched the mixed strategy equilibrium in this game.

Speaker 2:          01:12:29       Anybody?

Speaker 3:          01:12:31       It's tough. It's exactly what we found before justice before. I'm going to mix with pro se ve over v Posse,

Speaker 2:          01:12:44       right?

Speaker 3:          01:12:45       Let's summarize. We did something today just now that we've never done before. We've looked at an infinite or these potentially infinite period game I gained that could go on forever. And the way in which we handled the game that could go on forever was what we noticed. Two things. We noticed that part of the game that comes before that part of the game that was passed already, anything that happened there is just a sunk cost. It's irrelevant. It's just, I mean, it hurts. If it's a cost, it's nice if it's a gain, but it's sunk. You can't affect it now. Anything in the future, anything in the future can be summarized by the value, the payoff I'm going to get in the future by playing the equilibrium in the future, right? And this case, the future man mixing, mixing gave me a value of zero. So here I am getting a zero in the future and then I can just analyze the game in the stage of which I'm in, just as if it was an ordinary bog, standard, simultaneous move game.

Speaker 2:          01:13:54       All right?

Speaker 3:          01:13:55       When we did, so in this particular example, we're going to see more examples like this after the break. But in this particular example we found out something quite surprising. The thing we found out was in these war of attrition and settings, that is an equilibrium with rational players. Everyone mold, not common

Speaker 1:          01:14:12       knowledge or rationality. Everybody's rational. Everyone knows hypnosis rational. There are equal ever and which not only people fights but they could fight forever in every period they fight with some policy and we got an extra prediction out, a prediction that we weren't expecting and let me just give you that prediction and then we'll leave the class with the hat. The extra prediction is this. If we look at these wars of attrition and we keep track all the time in which the, hang on guys don't know rusty bags yet. One more thing. We look at the time at which the Games have gone on and keep track of the probability that a war will end at that time. So imagine this is, well, the one you could imagine, what would one going for one year or two years or three years or 20 years or whatever the problem is, distribution in this war of attrition is going to look like this in every period. The prevalency of continuing is just p star squared, so on every period, the chance as you get further into the future, there's a greater chance of the war will end. You can get very long, very costly wars. That's the bad news. The good news is it doesn't happen very often. All right. I guess we're all involved in a rather large and costly war right now, so I'll leave you that without pleasant thought over thanksgiving. Have a good break. Almost. See you afterwards.
