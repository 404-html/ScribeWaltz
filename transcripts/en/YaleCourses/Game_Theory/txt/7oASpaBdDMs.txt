Speaker 1:          00:00:01       All right. So last time we were talking about the investor game and this was a coordination game and we learned some things. There's been a recall from the things we learned too. I can highlight them events. One thing we learned was that communication can help in a coordination game. So I forget who it was, but someone down here who was disappeared, uh, was, uh, it was our Jimmy Stewart character and helped coordinate you on a better equilibrium simply by suggesting what you should do. And this, there's two lessons here. One is this is very different from the prisoner's dilemma.

Speaker 1:          00:00:47       So we learned the very first time it doesn't, the prisoner's dilemma communication per se won't help. But in the coordination problem, which could be just as serious socially as a prisoner's dilemma in a coordination problem, it may well help. And the reason it helps is you're trying to coordinate onto a nash equilibrium. And one way to think about now she equilibria is that they are self enforcing agreements. So it provided on believed that everyone else is going to go along with this agreement. Then, uh, everyone in fact, well, all right. I want to make another slightly more philosophical remark associated with this and it's to do with the idea of leadership. So leadership is kind of a big word that you see written probably too often these days in too many newspaper articles and it comes up in too many Yale classes and I don't claim to know anything about me to ship. All right. Bought and under they get game theory is going to contribute. Anything to understanding about leadershape bots. One thing we can do is tell you where leadership may help. All right? And then the coordination game, we are where the, the idea is to try and get people to coordinate on a particular equilibria rather than an another equilibria or worse. Still all just be uncoordinated entirely in those kinds of games. Leadership can help tremendously in little bit of leadership can help tremendously. So these games, these coordination games are games where there is a scope

Speaker 2:          00:02:15       for leadership.

Speaker 1:          00:02:18       And just to see that, uh, in a very simple example, again, we didn't need a such a complicated example is the one we looked at last time. You could imagine a game, a really trivial coordination game,

Speaker 2:          00:02:30       which looked like this.

Speaker 1:          00:02:35       All right? One one zero, zero is there a zero one, one? And clearly in this game, what matters is coordinating, you either want to coordinate on Aarp left or you want to coordinate on down, right? You don't want to end up, uh, to d. You don't want to end up uncoordinated on down, left or upright. Everyone see that? So in this game, if you just played it, it's quite likely going to end up uncoordinated. But if a little bit of leadership can say, okay, let's make sure this is where, this is where we coordinate all, let's make sure this is where we coordinate. All right? So this matters a lot and I don't want to overplay the social importance of this, but go back a couple of years to what was happening in the aftermath of Katrina and realize how important, how, how bad things get when things fail to be coordinated.

Speaker 2:          00:03:24       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:03:25       One other remark before we leave this in the game we played last time in the investment game. One feature of that game was that the more you thought other people were going to invest, the more you wanted to invest that, right? The more you thought, oh, he'll going to invest, the more likely you are going to invest and he'd go back to the time before that. We talked about this partnership game and the partnership game. You were contributing efforts to a joint project. It could have been a law firm, it could have been working in a study group on a homework assignment and that game, if you remember what the best response is, look like,

Speaker 2:          00:03:58       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:03:59       they look like this or this was the effort of player one and this was the effort of player to this was this was the best response of player one and this was the best response of planets to this game. Also has the feature that the more effort, the other person, the more the other person does, the more you want to do, right? The more efforts your partner provides into this projects, the more effort you want to provide in this project. And was when they introduced a bit of jargon here, these games in which the more the other person does, the more I want to do these are called Games of strategic compliments, right? These are games of strategic compliments,

Speaker 2:          00:04:37       strategic how funds.

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       All right? So both the investment game and the game with the partnership, the partnership from game or games or treated components, we can call the strategies strategic compliments. And we'll come back to this later on today. All right, so before we leave coordination games, I want to look at another one and a little bit more complicated one perhaps that we mentioned briefly last time. Uh, so we're looking at that. We'll look at an play another game and we'll call this game going to the movies.

Speaker 1:          00:05:21       All right. So I always regard one purpose of this class to help hapless Yale students in their dating strategies. Uh, that seems like a good thing to do. Uh, and, uh, how many of you just don't, uh, we didn't need to show the camera on this, but how many of you are econ majors? There's a lot of people who probably did a lot of help with our dating strategies. Right, right, right. Okay. So the idea of this game is a couple is going to meet up at the movies and, uh, well let's have a look at the movies, uh, concerned here and we'll draw the three possible movies.

Speaker 2:          00:05:57       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:05:59       All right. Well the is we're going to look at our, um, the born Alto Mason and the, uh, movie called Good Shepherd and a movie called Snow White.

Speaker 3:          00:06:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:06:20       And I'll explain the game more detail in a second. I used to be in the old days before I had kids, I could list off for 15, uh, current movies and help you a bit more with your dating strategy by giving you instant movie reviews. But now I have kids, I get to see precisely two movies a year. Uh, and the toolkit moves I've got to see this year where, uh, the Bourne ultimatum and, uh, the good shepherd. And now I think about it, both of those have Matt Damon in it and my wife chose both. So maybe I need to work out some more.

Speaker 1:          00:06:51       So just to give you some idea about how many, how many of you saw Bourne ultimatum? Quite a lot of you. This is a movie. It has pretty good action. Virtually no plots. A basic lesson of this movie is a, uh, if you, if you take home lesson, it's that all spy is a psychos or something like that. And then I how many so good shepherd, a lot of used to that as well. That's actually a pretty good, it has a lot of plots and no actions. It's helping other way around. And uh, the basic lesson of this movie is, and nobody knew this already, uh, everyone at Yale, at the technical yell, everyone at Yale is a spy. And by the way, also a psychos. And the third movie is, um, is Snow White, which I haven't gone out to see. But, uh, my, uh, four year old daughter has seen on 24 of the last 27 lates on video.

Speaker 1:          00:07:38       Uh, and this movie, um, I don't know if I'd recommend it that much. Uh, it's, um, as I'm being too PC, but I'm not convinced that for the modern woman hanging around, waiting for your printers to come is really a good strategy. Um, by the way, for those of you who are, you are, but if you were ordering that strategy, I'm gonna get in trouble. Then mind if you're in that strategy, take it from a Brit. Most printers are as dumb as toast, not worth way. All right, so let's, let's put the payoffs in here. So the idea here is that these people are going to move. They're going to meet at the movie. I'm going to go, went to a movie, and they've, they've decided to go to the, to the criterion or the local movie house. And there were these three movies showing and they're all excited to this movie excepts being economics majors and not very good at dancing. They have to gotten to, to tell each other which movie they're actually going to go to. Aren't they going to meet in the, you know, in there on the back row? Probably and uh, um, uh, but they're not, they're not telling us, uh, which movie there's a problem and it's put in the payoffs and we'll put in the payoffs that roughly I think would correspond to my preference is, and we'll talk about it, what these preferences mean in a second.

Speaker 3:          00:08:47       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:08:47       So here we go. So minus one, minus one zero minus one zero minus minus two. So here are the preferences for these movies of player one and player two. And you can see from these preferences, I have heard from these payoffs that uh, the, the best thing for player one is for both players, both people to meet and go to the Bourne ultimatum. This is the action movie. All right, so, so as not to be sexist, I assume this is the, this is the she and this is the heat. So she would like to go and see a Matt Damon beat people up and coordinate that, how her favorite thing, uh, and she gets nothing if they fail to coordinate, uh, and uh, so on and so forth. Uh, her second choice is at a managed to coordinate at Matt Damon being a gale spy. Uh, all right.

Speaker 1:          00:09:39       And then she really doesn't want to go and see snow white. And the worst thing of all, actually this is for both buyers, the worst thing of all is to coordinate it snow white because then you've got to talk about it afterwards at coffee. All right? And some of the other person, same thing exactly except that uh, he would rather meet at a of the good shepherd. Uh, you know, since he's a Yale Guy, he probably thinks of themselves as the Matt Damon character that'll perhaps knock coming, but, and uh, you know, failing that you'd like to coordinate at the Bourne ultimatum. But again, the disaster is to fail to coordinating, go to the different movies. All right, so these are the provinces. What can we, what can we tell immediately if, if any of you are stuck in this situation, what can you tell immediately about this, about this game? What God wants? An easy first step is get the,

Speaker 3:          00:10:24       the guy in red here

Speaker 1:          00:10:26       snowy, it was snow white is dominated by both players. Good. So for both plans, for both planners, Snow White is a Dominique is strategy. So both players having taken this class, I told you I was helping with her dating, but right. So both planners will realize that they shouldn't at least not going to Snow White, is that right? Right. Great animation, but not pat. Not perhaps a good date movie. So, uh, it's gone. All right, everyone see that? So that leaves us just with these two options, uh, the two Matt Damon movies, Bourne ultimatum and good shepherd. And here are the remaining payoffs. And let's, let's see how we play this out. So, so again, let's, let's pick on some people. I don't want to pick on somebody. Okay. It kind of goes on as well.

Speaker 3:          00:11:12       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:11:14       All right. So, okay. Okay. So we would pick on somebody that, uh, when do you, the person who Alec picked on you understand up.

Speaker 1:          00:11:23       Okay. And your name is, say again, loudly, Nina, Nina, and enter the shout out to run his Aina. And Carl, did you pick on a guy? Nina. Nina. Okay. Nina. I'm sorry, Nina and car you get, get, get your guy to stand up there. And your name is David. David. So do you know each other? No. No, you're okay. So your practical on a date. So this is all right. All right. So Nina's preferences mean his preferences. I'll play a one's preferences here. So she, uh, her best thing now is to successfully meet David at the Bourne ultimatum. And David's preferences are a payer. Twos preferences are his favorite thing is to successfully meet at the good shepherd. And why didn't you write down, uh, a second, uh, on the corner of a new pad? What it is you're going to choose to do with my tas watching cause you really can't cheat. All right. Both written down. All right. We have good luck here. We go to a good look at them. So we just embarrassment of it. We looked at them already, I guess. Okay. Okay. So, uh, Nina's a shout out to the crowd. What it is, you've went where it is. You've chosen to go or an ultimatum, but what else makes him and David, why don't you choose to go? I also put down born ultimately I can think in the coordinator. That's attention. Very good.

Speaker 2:          00:12:44       Alright.

Speaker 1:          00:12:47       I don't, I don't know what this test, I don't know what this tells us about David and Nina, but don't, no, nothing off the hook quite yet. So now, um, that was good. We managed to coordinate all the way. I think we can all see that we might not have done right. We all see we might not have done it. All right. Let's, um, let's try some communication in this game. We said the coordination games are helped by communication. All right, so let's imagine we're playing the game again. Once again, you're going to the movies. Once again, these are the first one didn't happen. So you didn't have somebody that was council that night. Someone had a bad cold or something. And then you are about to go off on a Friday night to see these movies and, uh, let's allow some communication ahead of time. So, so David, uh, uh, uh, he brought it to get, Oh, you know, you realize you've got this coordination problem, so you phone meaner up and you can say whatever you like. So what would you say to Nealon? Uh, it looks like you want to go to Bourne ultimatum.

Speaker 2:          00:13:37       Okay. Uh, I'd rather I'd rather go

Speaker 1:          00:13:40       and if you're going to be stubborn, I'd rather go see the board ultimately

Speaker 2:          00:13:43       with you then, uh, then not knock on a date. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:48       So here's another clue. Stubborn is not a good first date. Right. All right. But okay. So Nina, what would you say in response to that? I'll go to Bourne ultimatum. Alright. Alright. All right. So write down where you're going to do this time.

Speaker 2:          00:14:05       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       All right. And Nina, what did you do for an ultimatum? David Bourne ultimatum. They're still managing to coordinate, but you can. Okay. So, so thank you. Thank you. Thank for this couple. I was giving a round of applause.

Speaker 1:          00:14:24       We may come back and pick out you later on in the course, but we'll, we'll, we'll leave it for now. All right. So in this case, could look at the communication worked alright, but how am I liked him thinking that the communication isn't, isn't such an instant solution as it was in the game we saw last time, this games a little bit harder to get communication to work. And why? I mean is, is that right? First of all. So what's, what's the problem here? Why is this a slightly more difficult game? Let's get the handy a second. Why is this a more difficult game to attain coordination and um, yeah, that's it. That's the case you get. Can You well I know, hang on a second. Hold on a second. That's a good, that's a good one. That's, let's start with that. What are the national, what are the Nash Equilibrium in this game?

Speaker 1:          00:15:09       What are the Nash Equilibrium this game? Uh, somebody that says pick on somebody. Just pick on anybody. K. Yeah. What are the Nash Equilibrium? This game? Both players doing Bourne ultimatum in both players doing good shepherd. All right. So, so in fact if we, if we check the notion, the magic whatever in this game, the Nash Equilibria, and you can check that they are in fact best responses are both people doing the Bourne ultimatum or both people doing the good shepherd. And the reason for that is if the other person's going to go to Bourne ultimatum, I want to do that. And if the other person is going to go to good shepherd, I wanted to do that. So these are both Nash Equilibria. That isn't too much. The problem. That was true last time as well. There were two well coordinated Nash Equilibria. The one of them was better than the Alba, which the tricky thing here, what's, what's the extra tray? Yeah. Somebody uh, yeah. Uh, it's real camera. It's built with Mike on this side.

Speaker 1:          00:16:04       Sorry. It was me. There was a handout that, yeah, Yup, Yup, Yup. Go, go, go, go. Yeah, you go stand up. Great. Prefers a different Nash equilibrium. All so, so unlike the other game that the two dead zone was a coordination game. If we saw so far, we're really pure coordination problems. That right there were pure coordination problems. There was no conflict at all in, in the case of the investor game last week, every plan preferred one equilibrate to the other, right? In the game. I just put up this a triggered example. It didn't really Massa which equilibrium we played here, we just wanted to play an equilibrium. Is that right? Is that right? But here, there's a potential source of conflict here. Both people would rather be at an equilibrium than to be mal coordinated, uncoordinated, but play a one wants to go to Bourne ultimatum and play a two wants to go to good shepherd.

Speaker 1:          00:17:01       And actually I thought Nina's strategy there was pretty good. Nina's version of communication was, I'm going to Bourne ultimatum, right? Right. That that basically fix things. Right? But you could imagine that a communication could break down here. There could be a negotiation going on. All right. So think about, uh, I mean, I don't think, I don't want to push this too hard, but think about other games where people are communicating to feel an or to avoid a feeder of, of coordination. There's a strike negotiation going on as we speak. Events. It's a critical moment this morning, uh, up in Detroit between General Motors and the United auto workers. And I didn't want to say that strikes only about ms coordination, but clearly, uh, everyone's better off if they come to some agreement. Uh, rather than strike, there's at least some agreement is going to be better for everybody than a strike. And yet, because they personally were conflicting interests that basically in that case, conflicting interest about health and pension payments. It could well be that you end up failing to court.

Speaker 3:          00:17:59       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:18:01       All right, so this game has a name and actually somebody mentioned it last time and one who is the person who mentioned this last time, somebody, somebody mentioned this. What, what, what was the, what is this game called? W shattered out battle of the sexes. That's good to this game is called the battle of the sexes.

Speaker 3:          00:18:20       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:18:22       I will. We'll see it in various forms over the course of the semester. It's actually very interesting game games like it, they are coordination games, but different people disagree about where you'd like to coordinate.

Speaker 1:          00:18:36       All right, so, so much for talking about coordination games and helping you real dating strategy, um, this being a game theory class, there's at least one game we have to discuss. Uh, and we, we'll come to it now. So we're going to spend most of the rest of today, uh, talking about, uh, [inaudible]. And before I do that, let me just check. How many of you have seen Cornell duopoly before? Raise your hand. The sentence just for me year. I said maybe at half of you, so those of you who have, don't worry. I mean, this will be a bit review, but we'll see it more through the eyes of game theory this time. And for those of you haven't, don't worry, we're going to go through it. Okay. Okay. So this is a classic game habits, one of the most famous games. And therefore, uh, we're studying in the class. That was a purely game theory exercise. One reason for studying Kono do you openly

Speaker 1:          00:19:38       is that so far we've discussed how to find Nash equilibrium when there are a few players, each of whom has few strategies and we've discussed how to find Nash equilibrium where there are many players, each of whom has few strategies. And this is a game where there are few players and be too, but they have many strategies. All right? They actually have a continuum of strategies. All right? All right. For those people who aren't familiar with this and are worried about the economics of it in particular, it's gone over in considerable detail in chapter six of the textbook in chapter six of the textbook.

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       All right, so just motivate this a little bit. So there's two reasons why this game is interesting. So I say what would it is? So this is a game in which there are two firms who are competing in the same market and we'll give a bit more detail in a second. And one reason this game is interesting from the point of you of economics is this game lies between the two extreme cases that you learn about in your interaction. Omics pass, one extreme case is perfect competition or the other extreme case is monopoly. So this isn't, this is really the first attempt way back in the late century to study a market that somewhere in the middle of what had happened, most markets are all right, there are two firms and we're interested in two things here. We're interested in what's going to happen in these markets.

Speaker 1:          00:21:03       And then from a welfare point of view, from a policy point of view, we're interested about whether this is good for consumers or good for uh, producers or what, right? How, how this relates to profits and consumer surplus. All right? So with that in mind, let's just set the game up. So the players in this game are two phones, two firms, and the strategies in this game for the firms, and this is going to turn out to be important. The strategies are the quantities that they produce of an identical products. All right? So they have the quantities they produce. So each of them producers,

Speaker 3:          00:21:50       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       Oh, of an identical product.

Speaker 1:          00:21:55       So front, as far as the consumers are concerned, these two products are perfect substitutes. You could think of these as two companies producing bottled water. And now I'm going to get hundreds of letters saying novel bottled waters are the same, especially from it, uh, Italians and the French. But nevermind does a switch to pretend that they are. All right. So just to emphasize that the strategies are quantities rather than using s, let me use Q today to be the strategist. So, so Qai and, and uh, a Q minus sigh oh Q one and Q two will be the strategies. All right? Now I need to give a little bit more structure on the payoff when I get to the pay offs. So in particular, I need to tell you what is the cost of production

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       and the cost of production in this game is simply going to be c times cute. All right? So if I produce one unit, it costs me. See if I produced two units, it costs me to see if I produce a hundred units, it costs me a hundred c and high produce, uh, 0.7, three five units like cost me 0.7, three, five, six. Awesome. All right, so for those people who took intro economics, which is most of you, this is a game. This is a, a setting in which we have constant marginal costs, constant marginal cost, the constant marginal costs. It's, see, all right, and I'll need to tell you about how prices are determined in this market.

Speaker 1:          00:23:24       So prices are determined as follows. Uh, prices depend on some parameters. I'm just going to call a and B. Uh, I looked it up. Let me write the equation and then we'll see what it looks like. So basically the idea is that the more these firms produce, so the more of the total quantity produced Q1 plus Q two, the lower is the price in the marketplace for this product. All right. I, let's just draw a picture of the hat. We'll come back to this in a minute. Let's draw a picture which we can keep for later. Actually that's saved myself some time and written this down.

Speaker 3:          00:24:06       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:24:08       so this, this, uh, Mr Equation I've just written, you can imagine Q1 plus Q2 total quantity on the horizontal access and you can imagine price on the vertical access. And basically what we're saying is that prices depend on total quantities as follows, where the slope of this line smoke with this line is minus B. All right? Now for those of you who took economics one 15 or coolant, what is the name of this lion? I've just drawn because that was, that was way fewer responses and they wanted, all right, let's try again. What's the name of this downward sloping hint, hint line that I've just drawn? It's a demand Kat. Thank you. So demand curve.

Speaker 3:          00:24:57       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:25:01       This is the demand it tells me, but they'll be around and look at the, look at how prices correspond to quantities. It tells me the quantity demanded at any given price. All right, we'll come back to that in a second. But meanwhile, let's just finish up what we're doing here and put in payoffs. So payoffs for these firms are going to depend on, uh, on profits or pay off the farms. Aim to maximize profit and profit is going to be given by p times Q minus. Sorry, it's just to throw this dude. Let's do this for from one. Alright, let's be careful. Let's do this. The Fun one I'll do if I want us to come to in a second. So the payoff for from one as it depends on the quantity that she produces and the quantity that the other firm produces is going to be prices times the quantity that foam one producers minus costs times the quantity that she produces. All right? All right, so this is, this term here is revenues.

Speaker 3:          00:26:28       It's Tom. Here

Speaker 1:          00:26:31       it's revenues. And this term here is total costs, right? Revenues minus costs makes profits. And again, those people who are less familiar with economics, I'm hoping this is not gonna be too hard, but you read up on the, okay. All right. I want to going to do here is I'm going to substitute in for prices. All right? So I've got this expression for prices here. Here it is. And I want to plug it into that p that. Okay. All right, so let's, I'm going to want to rewrite it now with that, with that p expanded hours. All right, so I'm going to get, and I'm going to multiply out at the same time. So I'm going to have a Q one minus B squared.

Speaker 3:          00:27:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:27:23       Minus B Q one Q two minus c Q one. All right, so all I'm doing here, nothing, nothing particularly exciting. I'm simply plugging this expression then for p and then I multiplied the whole thing out cause I, cause it was all multiplied by Q one and I should warn you again, I'm very likely to make mistakes when doing this kind of thing. So please catch me if I do. All right? So here I have a new expression for from ones profit and I could do the same for from too, but I'm not going to because it's, that would get boring. Okay. All right. So this is, this is just from one spot. Okay. Now with this in hand, what I want to do is, I mean for him to have a similar expression. What I want to do is I want to figure out the Nash equilibrium of this, of this game. I know I won't get down on the board. I want to figure out the Nash equilibrium off this game. Both firms are producing quantities. Both firms are trying to maximize profit. And I want to find out the Nash Equilibrium. How do I go about that exercise? What's the what? What do I need to do to find each firm's Nash Equilibrium? How do we always find Nash equilibrium when we're not guessing?

Speaker 3:          00:28:48       What are we doing? Anybody?

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       So when you were over there, who's gonna be way off camera, but we can perhaps, I'm going to make him mad quick. I'm, I'm sorry. I see he's way in the corner that come, come, come this way a little bit. It's a bit closer to the aisle.

Speaker 3:          00:29:03       There you go.

Speaker 4:          00:29:04       Well, we would just delete the, uh, we would eternal iterative lead, delete, dominated.

Speaker 1:          00:29:10       Could do that. We could do that. We could try it for the domain. His strategies and see if I can see that process converged high and something else in mind here. Something that's more of more straight forward. What else? What else does that, so the guy in red,

Speaker 3:          00:29:23       mmm.

Speaker 4:          00:29:24       Identify the best responses of each player as a function of the others and find out where they intersect. I guess that more that was correct. I sent more loudly shouting, um, identify the best responses of each player as a function of the others and find out where they intersect. Okay, good. So what we're gonna do is we're going to figure out play or one's best response quantity to each possible

Speaker 1:          00:29:42       choice to flare to. And then we're going to flip it around and figuring out player twos best response quantity to each possible choice of player one. And then we're going to see where they were. They were, those were those coincide where they cross. All right? So just like we've done several times from four, all right. It's only ordained to do then is I need to figure out what his player ones best response for each possible choice. Q2 of player too. All right. So how do I do that? How do I do that? I wanted to find the best response. How do I do that? Everyone's looking like this is a bit your Mo. Really?

Speaker 3:          00:30:22       Anybody, anybody to cold call somebody? No?

Speaker 1:          00:30:27       Yeah, I the thought of that. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Uh, sorry. Athletic Day for you. Somebody that way at the back there.

Speaker 3:          00:30:34       Sorry

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       that up. And shout. Find the best response function by differentiating this and maximizing the function for every Q two. Okay, good. Good, good. So what we're going to do is, all right, good. We're good. We're going to, we're trying to maximize the best response is going to maximize these, uh, these prophets. All right, so in particular, what we're going to do to find out what, what quantity Q1 maximizes this profits for each choice of, of Q2. We're going to differentiate this with respect to Q one and then what? And then still equal to zero. Okay. So again, let me just take a look out there. How many of you remember this? We did this once before I did this bus. How many of you remember this from, from your, uh, high school calculus days or from one 12th? Quite a. Quite a number of you actually were on it, right? Okay, good. So we're gonna do is we're going to differentiate this thing to find a first order condition. We're going to differentiate,

Speaker 3:          00:31:32       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:31:33       With respect to Q1, right? The thing we're trying, the, our control variable, they were trying to maximize the thing with those back to and set it equal to zero. All right, so what I'm going to get, so this, this term here, a Q one is going to become an ae and this term here minus B Q squared is going to become a to B Q one and this term here minus B Q one Q two is gonna become a minus B Q two and the last term minus CQ one is going to become a minus c. All right? And we're happy with that. I don't want to, there was a differentiated, this fairly simple function with respect to key one. And since I want to find them a maximum, but I'm going to do is I'm going to set this equal to zero. All right? At my maximum up to Hato retro indicate this is the Arg Max, uh, at my maximum, I'm going to set this thing you will deserve now, but it's just, it is in some sense we're being nerdy in this class despite our attempts to go dating, we're being nerdy. Lex Actually, uh, be a little bit careful. This was a first order condition or first on a necessary condition actually need to check the second order condition. So how do I check the second order condition?

Speaker 2:          00:32:51       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:32:52       I differentiate again, right? I differentiate a second time and check the sign. The second oral condition, I differentiate this expression again with respect to Q one, the early phase Kuwan appears here is here. So when I differentiate again, I must going to get minus two B and sure enough that's negative, which is what I wanted to know. That's just to check that what I'm finding this thing, I'm finding a maximum and not a minimum. All right, good. Good. Okay. So this is our key expression and I'm going to use this expression, I'm going to solve it for Q one. So the best response for player one as a function of what player to chooses Kutu is just equal to the Q one Hatton, this expression. And if I solve that out carefully, I will no doubt make a mistake when it's dry. It, uh, I'm going to have a minus c over

Speaker 2:          00:33:47       to be

Speaker 1:          00:33:50       minus

Speaker 2:          00:33:53       Q two over two.

Speaker 1:          00:33:58       All right? So try that at home. But I think I did that right? So I took the, I took this to the other side and I have divided through by two B and the B here, counsel. All right, I want to just start that a second. Make sure I don't right. And very, very capable of getting this things wrong. All right, good. So what I have here is an equation that tells me player one's best response for each possible choice of player too. All right? And I could do the same thing for player to, to find player two's best response for every possible choice of player one or the other hand. We know it, you know the math is going to be the same. So let's cheese.

Speaker 2:          00:34:43       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:34:43       I know that play a his best response for every possible choice of player one, which if we'd done it would be Q two hat is going to equal a minus c over to B minus Q. Want over to right? So I'm just, I'm just flipping around the twos and the ones.

Speaker 1:          00:35:04       So at this point I found player one's best response as a function of Q two I found player two's best response as a function of Q one and the way I did it, just remember the way he did it was I applied a little bit of one 12 and our high school calculus, right? Essentially single variable. All right. Now before we could just solve at this point, but it's not, let's draw this. Let's draw this. Okay. So what I'm going to do is I'm gonna go back to my picture and draw these functions. I'll just remind us what is function.

Speaker 1:          00:35:45       It's a minus c over to B minus Q two over two as equivalently for a plan to all right. That's it. That's the thing, I it just hidden by the board. Now what I want to do is I want to draw a picture I little bit like we did for the partnership game. Turn the partnership game. We put efforts on these axes and now I'm going to put quantities on these axes. So this is going to be the choice of player one and this is going to be the choice of player too. And what I want to do is I want to figure out what, what this looks like, what, uh, for each Q two that you give me or that player to chooses. I want to find out and draw what is player ones. Best response. All right, everyone happy what I'm doing here? All right, so let's start somewhere. And what we're gonna do is we'll refer back to this other picture, which is why I left it here. All right, so in particular, what would be player ones? Best response if a two. It didn't produce it all. How we find that without worrying about the economics of it? A second. How will we find that? This is a math exercise. Just oppose play a two doesn't produce it. All right. What is player one's best response? Someone read it off of me.

Speaker 1:          00:37:11       Wait when we cold call somebody out or you can,

Speaker 2:          00:37:16       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:37:17       Hey mine minus c over to B. All right, so so shout that out over two weeks. If I plug it, plug it Q two equals zero and to hear this term disappears, right and I just get a minus c over to be so of that's what's that? What's that telling me? I mean put the 45 degree line in here. What's that telling me? It's as if play a two chooses not to produce, then play a one's best response is a minus c over to be. Now I claim it that conscious, a minus c over to be actually has another name. What's the name of that quantity?

Speaker 1:          00:38:02       What's the name of the quantity? A minus C of a to be. Once we, once we escape the Algebra, just think about it in terms of economics. What does thinking about it the best? Let's go back to the previous picture. If player two is producing nothing, player two is producing nothing. Then what is player one? Oneness. Effectively, he's a monopolist or she's a monopolist. All right, so we know how to figure out monopoly quantities from what we did in one 15 or equivalent courses. Let me just finish the picture here. Here's my demand curve. Here's my constant Marshall cost at, see. All right. I want to, I want to use this picture on the left now to figure out what the monopoly quantity is. Can anyone tell me out? It's cold. Call Tom Buddy again. Ah, well raise your hand if you took one 1501 10 oh one 50 oh no, no, no, no. I know more. He took it than that. It's so it's, it's a Prereq for the class, right? Raise your hands if you didn't take any of those things. Right. All right, so keep your hands up a cocoa. Do you haven't got the hand up?

Speaker 2:          00:39:06       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:39:07       Anybody, anybody? Go ahead passing the buck yet. Do you door to tell me what the, where's the, where's the monopoly quantity on this picture?

Speaker 1:          00:39:22       No, try it. Try to work with that. The one with the woman and woman one in there. Yeah. That's where you are. There's a woman here. Yeah. Oh really? Don't remember. I don't remember. I don't remember who else. Who else doesn't remember? What was it? Somebody I don't remember is a good reply. Or if you're, if you're auditioning for it to be the attorney general, but it's not such a good offer. Anybody, somebody hit somebody help me out. Hey, where's, where's the monopoly quantity on this picture? It's good review exercise. Yeah. It's where the marginal revenue is equal to the marginal cost. Oh, it's where marginal revenue equals Marshall because I should have picked him out of there. So when people, by the way, it's where marginal revenue equals marginal costs. Right. The reason I speak on the SOM people, if they their, their ambition in life is to Ronald Monopoly, right?

Speaker 1:          00:40:07       Say, alright, couple days I haven't drawn the marginal revenue curve yet. Right? Right. You can't actually see the marginal revenue here. What is the marginal revenue look like? And this pitch, I don't even go to the same guy. The guy in in Brown. Where's, where's the marginal revenue look like? What's the most, whenever you look back on this picture on the left, it's one half the slope of the price. Yeah. Oh, it's, I guess it's twice the slope, but that's fine. And I know what you mean. All right. So the marginal revenue here that's been in a different color, the marginal revenue look, something like this. Alright. And as, I don't know what your name is as the guy who said the monopoly quantity, monopoly quantity, it's when marginal revenue equals marginal costs. All right. And as we know, this line here has twice the slope of the original line of the [inaudible] cove. So the slope of this thing is minus two

Speaker 2:          00:41:04       B.

Speaker 1:          00:41:06       I know I'm going to claim that this monopoly corner, the I claimed before, it's like our intuition says if the other firm isn't producing, my best response must be produced by monopoly quantity, which I can see on this shut. And I also planned, but the math is telling me just to kind of nerdy math is telling me that that quantity is a minus c over to B and I claim that they're the same thing. How can I see that? The same thing. Well, look here I have a line of slope minus two how far down does it have to go? It has to go a minus c down as pink line has to drop off from a all the way to see how far along do I have to go to drop off a minus c when I have slope minus to be honest, a minus seat over to be right. That's not even calculus something he really all at the high school. Okay. All right. Okay, so this monopoly quantity is indeed. Hey, minus c over TV. All right, I'm going to ask again if some of this being coming out of the fog, I mean you mental sent with the Algebra before, but some of this sort of pictures have you seen before as good review exercise for some of you who have taken one 50 and are about to take one 50 or that now.

Speaker 1:          00:42:16       All right, so we found precisely 1.0 this best response picture and there's a lot of points to find and it's 20 past 12 so we're gonna get going. All right, so let's try and find another point. All right, so it's a different question. How much quantity would from to have to produce in order to induce from one, not to produce it all. That again, how much quantity would from two half to produce in order to induce from one's best response to be zero. All right. There's that. That helped me out. [inaudible] it's Katy, right? Is that right? The woman in green and it's going to make to Katie. Oh, there's Mike posted buyers. No of mine. Sorry. Yeah, yeah. Hey, mine is c over to B. All right, so, so that's just solving out the Algebras. We're saying, we're saying what, what? Q solves 80 minus c over to B minus Q two over two equals zero, right? What Q to Purdue makes the sink? Well, does zero and Katie's answer is solving out the Algebra. Here is the Q two. The soul is, this must be a minus c, uh, over over B. All right, that's right. Why can I see that one on the picture though? Let's go back to the economics. All right, so I'm claiming that the song quantity up here, I claim this quantity is a minus c Overbey such that if from two producers that much quantity from one we'll just produce nothing,

Speaker 1:          00:43:59       right? But that's just kind of Algebra and math. What can I say it on this picture? What quarter? See if produced by from two would cost from one to shut down on this picture. Yeah, it's going to Mike and in here, sorry, again, that's where the marginal cost and the demand thing demand lines intersect. All right, so, uh, it's here, right? It's here. It's where it's where marginal. It's where the marginal cost and the demand curve intersects and watch Dan tuition. Well, let's work it out, I suppose from two has produced all of this quantity up to here. All right? So from two is already producing all of this quantity. So already just from, from two's production, the price has been driven all the way down to costs.

Speaker 1:          00:45:00       All right? So if I, I'm from one, if I produce any more quantity, what's going to happen to the price fibers? Any quantity at all in addition to what's out there already. What's going to happen to the price? It's going to be pushed below. Cost. All right, so I'll be producing this stuff is water at cost. See and only getting P, which is isn't going to be less than. So you in return, Toby losing money on any product, any product that I produce, I want to see that and I'll say it again. So from to from to produce is all the way up to here.

Speaker 2:          00:45:33       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:45:34       That any product produced by from one is going to push prices even lower in particular. There'll be lower here than costs and so you'll make losses on that product. All right. What's the name of going back to economics one 15 what's the name for this? Quantity. The quantity where demand and Marshall costs equal. That's the, that's the competitive quantity. All right, so this is the perfect competition quantity in a perfectly competitive market. That's exactly where prices are going to end up. This is not a perfectly competitive market, but if it were, that's where price is going to end up. All right? So we have the monopoly quantity here and we have the competitive quantity here and in between. What does this best response curve look like? Somebody, it's a straight line. It's a straight line. Thank you. All right, so in between, this is just a spray line. All right, so here is the best response of from one to each possible choice of I'm too. All right. Everyone's looking really like this was hard, but it can't be that hard. You see in most of you seen this before. All right, so don't, if you haven't seen before, don't panic. All I did was I did a little bit of calculus. It's a bit of Algebra and then I drew the thing.

Speaker 2:          00:47:01       I just drew the thing.

Speaker 1:          00:47:04       Okay, so this is from one's best response as a function of Q two what is from two's best response as a function of Q one let's just get that. Just to remind you, the way we read this is you give me a quantity of from too, I find from one's best response by going across to the pink client and dropping down, so a from to produces this amount. Then one's best response is this amount if from Jupiter is, is this amount than foam ones? Best response. Is this. Alright. Now conversely, how do we find from two's best response as a function of Q one what does that look like? Yeah, to take it to get the, I guess two guys in front of you, shout it out. It's a symmetrical across the 45 degree. All right. Right. It's reflected across the 45 degree line. So let's reflect these two points.

Speaker 2:          00:48:02       That's will be here. This will be what would be a bit more careful, but miss by a mile. Let me just try again.

Speaker 1:          00:48:18       I missed by a mile, which is, which is a problem in drawing my lines, but never mind.

Speaker 2:          00:48:21       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:48:27       All right, so this will be the monopoly quantity for from to, and this is the competitor quantity. All right, so if I draw on that better, it would look as if this was half of this distance, right? I didn't draw it. Well, try and draw it better in your notes.

Speaker 2:          00:48:49       All right. All right? So this is

Speaker 1:          00:48:54       a minus c over B and this is anyway a c of a to B. So this distance and this distance and had to be the same. And the way I've drawn it this donut at the same at all. All right?

Speaker 2:          00:49:09       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:49:09       And the way we read this green graph is you give me a choice of from one he won. I go up to the Green Line and go across, and this tells me the best response

Speaker 2:          00:49:22       for fun too. All right?

Speaker 1:          00:49:26       So at this point, how many of you have seen this picture before? Good. Many of you have seen it before. All right? So, uh, I think we can really cold call somebody for this one. All right? So, uh, uh, somebody tell me and pick some time to cope, but when you cold call somebody alia, anybody can close by.

Speaker 1:          00:49:47       Okay? Okay. Okay. So here's the tough question. Watch the Nash Equilibrium on this picture where the green and the pink line intersect. All right, where are the green and the pink line intersect? Right? All right, so this must be, this must be the Nash Equilibrium, right? That wasn't hard. Right. Okay. Okay. All right. Now. Okay, so why, what was, go back again. Why is this the Nash Equilibrium? Because at this point as in the partnership game, was there a similar thing as on the partnership game where the best response is Intersex is where player Wong is playing a best response to play a two and play a two is playing a restaurant supplier one. So this is the Nash Equilibrium in this corner of game, right? Let's do a little bit of, just to make sure we can find this thing. All right, so we're going to do is set these two things are equal to each other.

Speaker 2:          00:50:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:50:42       Put in stores here.

Speaker 2:          00:50:43       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:50:46       so at at the national equilibrium quantities shouldn't really do this, but never mind at the Nash Equilibrium. Quantity's I'm going to have Q one star is equal to a minus CEO to be Q two stars that Dra and Q two star is equal to amen. A C of a to B you one star two. All right, and I'm going to solve this out by sending [inaudible] since I know the game is symmetric and they weren't on the 45 degree line. All right, so all I have to do here to do this algebraically is to solve out these equations. So let's try and do that. So putting Q1 in here, right? If I substitute Q one in here, what would it give me? It'll give me Q one star is equal to a minus c over to B minus Q one. Start over to, let's multiply both sides by two. I'll get to Q one star is equal to a minus c over B minus Q one star. Take that to the other side. They have three Q one star is equal to a minus c over B and finally divide by three Q one star is equal to a minus C

Speaker 2:          00:52:11       I have a by three B.

Speaker 1:          00:52:18       All right, so that crossing point actually occurs at a minus c over three B and they're going to look desperately. My ta is, it didn't make her to did. I didn't screw that up, I think. I think, I think I didn't screw that up. All right, so this is sometimes called the corn Oh, quantity. This game, this game of imperfect competition between two firms competing in court disease was thought up and, and and uh, studied by a French economist called core know, uh, almost a hundred years before nash. And I said a hundred is really before the invention of Game Theory, right? Someone had figured out this arm stuff for this guy.

Speaker 2:          00:52:58       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:53:02       Okay. So what do we know so far? I'll leave the Algebra. They're transferred up here. You stuck. He one star equals Q two star equals a minus c

Speaker 2:          00:53:18       over three B. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:53:28       So so far we've hit, we've been working pretty hard and we haven't, I guess moon's a lot. We just kind of solve the thing out. Now we get to draw some lessons on this thing. All right? So everybody who's feeding a little bit shell shocked from having been doing Algebra and calculus and drawing pictures and feeling like they've been cheated into taking a class that looks far too much like economics. Calm down. We're going to actually talk about it now.

Speaker 3:          00:53:49       Okay. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:53:54       So one thing to remark about this gay, why don't we learned immediately is that this game is different in a significant way to different from the partnership game. I mean, obviously it's different because it's about to make a difference, but I mean in terms of the game theory is different. It's different from the partnership game. It's different from the investment game. What is it that's different about this came from the Po? What's the obvious thing I was looking at this picture that makes it different from the partnership? Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:18       In the partnership game, the best response lines sloped up. Is that right? The more I did have my strategy, the more the other player did is a best response in the investment game. The more likely I was to invest, the more likely you are, the more you want to do invest. Right? But in this game, we have the exact opposites. The more player one produces, the more player one produces the less player to wants to produce and the more player to producers, the less player one wants to produce. All right, so this game is a game, not a strategic compliments, but a strategic substitutes.

Speaker 1:          00:55:10       I don't want to be careful here. It's not, it's not that these goods are substitutes. I mean clear. That's also the case, right? If both your firms are producing bottled water and it's identical, right, then, then the goods themselves are substitutes. That's not the point I'm making here. Strategic substitutes as a strategy is, is a statement about the nature of the game. So strategic substitutes is telling me that my strategy is the strategic substitute of your strategy. If the more I do have my strategy, the less you want to do of yours, and conversely, the more you want to do of your strategy, the less I want to do.

Speaker 3:          00:55:48       Right? Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:55:54       Well, let's come back to the question we started with, which has to do with profits and so on and society. We know that if these players play these games, if we, at least if we believe in Nash equilibrium it, then they're going to produce these quantities they're going to produce here.

Speaker 3:          00:56:09       Right?

Speaker 1:          00:56:11       Well, let's ask a different question. He usually these firms is trying to maximize profit. All right, but how about the total profit in the industry? Whereas each of these firms, we know where the, that playing a bass response is maximizing their profits. Taking this, given what the other firms doing, but how about total industry profits? Are they being maximized here? Who thinks total industry profits are being maximized? Who thinks total energy profits and not being maximized? All right, good. Good. So not to shout out. Okay, so total ownership of it to not being maximized. Where on the picture? I don't know. Getting on a bit of cold calling in here. Where on the picture maximize this total industry profits.

Speaker 3:          00:56:55       Hmm. We're on the pitch of maximizes total industry profits. We had, we had it before. That's what else? Yeah, no, no idea. No idea. People taking the fifth. Yeah. Yeah. The guy in there. Yeah. Is it at the monopoly,

Speaker 1:          00:57:11       right? Monopoly. Exactly. So clearly if we punish the monopoly quantity, by definition the monopoly quantity maximizes total industry profits. And for example, if from to shut down and from one produced it's monopoly profits, it's monopoly quantity that would maximize profits. And conversely, if from one shot down and from to produced it's monopoly quantity, that would maximize industry profits. All right, where else in ms pet shop maximize energy profits. So this point maximized industry industry profits and this point maximizes industry profits. Where else maximizes industry profits?

Speaker 3:          00:57:55       Anybody?

Speaker 1:          00:57:57       Well, how about all the points in between here from one produced nothing and from to produce the monopoly quantity and hear from to produced nothing. And from one produced the monopoly quantity. But you could also just split the monopoly quantity for example, half half at this point here.

Speaker 3:          00:58:16       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:58:17       so the first, what did to make more money? One thing they could do is they could sign an agreement saying, why don't each of us produced not our core, no quantity but produce half monopoly profits. Sorry, half monopoly, half a monopoly quantity. And that would produce this much. All right? It's a foam one would be producing half its monopoly property quantity in fem. Two would be Buddhism, Hellfest monopoly quantity. All right. So what's wrong with that agreement? So he had to have that, whether they there, uh, to water companies are that Poland Spring and uh, and uh, um, cocacola I guess these days of signing this agreement saying that each one's going to produce Hoffman off like one did eat and what's gonna go wrong with that agreement?

Speaker 3:          00:59:09       Yeah, the got the guy in red.

Speaker 1:          00:59:12       First of all, it's illegal. It's illegal. It's illegal, right? So, so even without the being an attorney general, somebody might be awakened the Justice Department and know and notice that actually illegal. All right? It's illegal to sign an agreement, uh, to, uh, to sign a contract saying you're going to restrict a quantities. It's illegal. So they can't sign that as a contract, but hey are they could just agree in the doers, right? So Coca Cola in Poland spring, it could just agree to produce half the quantity of water each day.

Speaker 3:          00:59:39       All right,

Speaker 1:          00:59:41       what's going to go, what, what might go wrong in that agreement? It's just, let's just suppose that that game is just being played once for now. Hi. And suppose that this is Coca Cola is quantity and this is Poland springs quantity. And suppose your, the, your, the manager of Poland Spring, right? So water is coming out of the ground in Maine for you. All right. And you, you know that it's Coca Cola guy is going to produce this quantity here. Alright, so this is Q m those are two. Do you ever receive? All right, so let's, let's pick on our two managers. It's have to people who've spoken before. So the guy in the red shirts name is Steve and I guess in red he should be the coca coca cola gay. Right. All right. And uh, let's pick on our, our Jimmy Stewart from last week, whose name is Patrick, right?

Speaker 1:          01:00:24       Uh, and again, can I get a mic? Come on, Patrick. All right. All right. So Steve and Patrick of the art respectively, the managers of Coca Cola and uh, and Poland spring. And uh, here it is, right, right. And Patrick Patrick believes that the coca cola manager he's going to is just make this coke and Pepsi's, it's two identical that near enough of identical, right? So there's a coke and Pepsi went that, that will confuse me last. All right, so Patrick, our manager of Pepsi believes that Coca Cola is going to produce this quantity and he's agreed to produce this quantity. What is Patrick actually going to do? Patrick, are you going to do? Huh?

Speaker 4:          01:00:59       So I should cheat and, and picnic on me on my best response line. It's much farther out so I'll, I'll produce it more than that. Quantity.

Speaker 1:          01:01:06       All right, so Patrick, just being Jimmy's do it or not? Actually, when he's in the, in the, when he's playing, the manager of Pepsi is going to produce more of this, uh, undrinkable liquid and produce this quantity here. All right, so what is this? This is Patrick's best response to the other guy producing the monopoly quantity.

Speaker 3:          01:01:33       Alright.

Speaker 1:          01:01:34       All right. So Patrick's response and Pepsi is to overproduce rolls up to the monopoly quantity. Actually overproduce even roads into the corner quantity, right? And produce all the way out of here. Okay, so Patrick's producing here, but what about Mister Coca Cola guy? All right. Now, Mr Coca Cola Guy knows Patrick pretty well, but you know there've be in the same industry for a while. I missed uh, uh, Mr. Koch, Hilda, his name is Stephen. Stephen. Stephen Presumably knows that Patrick is actually going to produce this quantity. Sorry, this quantity.

Speaker 3:          01:02:11       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:12       So Steven, what do you, what, what, what, what should you produce?

Speaker 4:          01:02:14       Increased my own production to, to match my of my best response line.

Speaker 1:          01:02:18       Good. So anticipating

Speaker 3:          01:02:21       that Patrick is going to think that Steven's a sock habit and to Patrick's going to cheat on him and produce too much. Steven's going to produce the best response to that and he's going to produce

Speaker 1:          01:02:33       this quantity here. So what is this? This is player twos best response. So player ones, best response to play it to producing half monopoly out but

Speaker 3:          01:02:51       alright.

Speaker 1:          01:02:52       But Patrick knows Steven pretty well. He knows those guys who run in Coca Cola are pretty snow mark guys. So Patrick knows that the guy who runs coca cola is going to anticipate that the guy who runs Pepsi is going to cheat on the guy who runs coca cola. And hence the guy Runscope of color is going to be our best response to Patrick's cheese in quantity. So what quantity is, uh, is Patrick and a produce auction then out on a pretty close to the Cornell, you delivery. All right, so you're going to go to here to this point here is don't even write this. This is the best response of planning one to the best responsive player to, to the best response of player one to play or to producing half monopoly output and the lots of brackets. Yeah. All right. Hey, can anyone see where this process is going through?

Speaker 1:          01:03:40       This process is going right? It's going back. It's going back to the Nash Equilibrium, right? Each of them is trying to buy a best response. What we anticipate the other person's going to do, and in this game, if they keep on doing that, it's going to drag them back to Nash equilibrium to be careful here. This will be true of all games, but in this game playing best response to each other, figuring out that in fact the other guy is going to going to cheat on me or the other guys or anticipate that I'm going to cheat on him with other guys and I anticipate that I'm going to anticipate that he's going to cheat on me, et Cetera, et cetera. We'll eventually drag us back to the court. Oh, quantity. All right, so it's going to be pretty difficult for us to sustain this joint monopoly output. There's collusive agreement. We can't let the courts enforce it. What Coca Cola and Pepsi is, we really don't want to bring the math yet again, although maybe we do, I don't know. All right? So basically we're stuck with this verbal agreement and we both have an incentive to cheat and produce more whatever it is, sugar water.

Speaker 3:          01:04:36       Right? Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:04:39       No, in practice, this is not the only problem facing two firms who are producers who are trying to produce the monopoly output, right? In practice when firms trying to have these, uh, agreements, which are not contracts to try and produce joint monopoly output. What else goes wrong?

Speaker 1:          01:04:58       What else goes wrong? So here you could imagine some firms trying to have an agreement. We know they can't sign the legal agreements, but let's, let's take that off the table. So for example, in around 1900 and America, or a little bit earlier, let's say, let's say a eight and 18 in America, it really isn't clear that it was illegal to write agreements to say, we'll restrict what it is. Right? Firms didn't use to write that kind of agreement, but still something went wrong. What went wrong? So we're getting a little bit further away from the game and more back into the real world. Yeah. What kinds of things went wrong? I want to get some news nearer. Mike, can I, can I, can I get the woman here they are the Yale shut

Speaker 2:          01:05:36       without a contract. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:05:37       There's no means of enforcement. All right. So, so it might be, again, there's a problem with enforcement, although actually in each and each year in America, it's not clear that they couldn't have enforced that contract. All right, so one problem is unenforceable se, right. But no new far I'll go with that. Might have been a problem. What else? The guy next, next time.

Speaker 2:          01:05:55       Yeah. If they're not at the competitive outcome, they could undercut price and take the entire market.

Speaker 1:          01:06:03       Let's be careful. I will come back that next time, but right now we're competing in quantities, right? So, so we're not, we're not fixing prices here and even leaving prices, we're just producing coca cola and Pepsi and for want of a better word, spewing it out into the market. All right. What? What else goes wrong here?

Speaker 1:          01:06:21       Well, one thing that goes wrong is it supposed coke and Pepsi? Why able to either to write a contract or whatever just to stay in giant monopoly outputs at this high price is price, which is, oh, I'm sorry. I just called con presumed positive profits and the industry and he's going to turn out. Therefore, the price is going to be above costs. These firms making a lot of profits. What is going to happen in this industry? It's interesting. It's got a lot of profit or a around that. What's gonna Happen in this industry? Yeah, the the guy in the blue shirt here. I like this guy here.

Speaker 2:          01:06:53       I know

Speaker 1:          01:06:54       editor could join the market. All right. Another foam is going to come in and produce similar products. So Dr Pepper or something that the same is that the third one? Someone else is going to come in and Produce Cola and this industry and that's exactly, that's exactly what happened in the u s at the turn of the last century companies did Bruce agreements to restrict, for example, the production of paper and the production of rubber and the production of steel and the production of iron and the production of, of uh, of a railway lines. Actually he didn't quite complicated things and sure enough, what you see very quickly emerging is new entrants entering the market to say, hey, these firms restricting that their quantities, we can get in there and make money. All right, so new and a competitive fringe of firms is going to enter and drive prices down. Now, I talked about that in 1900 America. Where is that happened in the 20th century? More dramatically. So we know the early example in sort of sort of Golden Age America, but what else did we see a competitor fringe enter when there was a collusive agreement to keep prices, keep quantities down

Speaker 2:          01:07:55       airlines

Speaker 1:          01:07:56       to airlines. Okay, good. The airlines as an example, we've seen that. What, where else? Oh, y'all is probably the classic example of airlines is a good example. Okay, so an oil, we all know that in the s and the late sixties early seventies OPEC was formed precisely to restrict quantity among the major oil producing countries. And very quickly we see, take it, other countries take advantage of this, just start producing oil profitably. So who, who are the competitive French against OPEC

Speaker 2:          01:08:26       anyway?

Speaker 1:          01:08:28       Well, the bread swa for a start, the Brits, uh, England and Scotland, I should say Britain. Anyway, started producing oil in the North Sea. Lots of countries in Latin America started looking and finding oil. And of course, Russian oil, uh, uh, started being a very, very profitable. All right, so there's two, there are various reasons why it's hard to maintain this collusive agreement. One is there's an incentive to cheat and another is that other firms are going to enter. But before we leave this, let's just pose the question we started with suppose. In fact, we do end up back at the corn. Oh, quantity. So here we are back at the corner quantity, right? How does this quantity compare and how does that for the prices compare and how to profits compare with monopoly prices on the one hand and competitive prices on the other? All right, so we know, we know the courts did. It's going to be produced. We figured that out. Here it is. We know that the contract is going to be produced. Each firm, each firm is going to produce a minus c over three B and there are two such firms. So the total quantity produced in the market,

Speaker 1:          01:09:46       total quantity will be to a minus c over three B.

Speaker 2:          01:09:52       All right.

Speaker 1:          01:09:53       How does that compare to the monopoly quantity? Well, the monopoly quantity was a minus c over to be, the competitive quantity was a minus c over B to remind you of those that are on a picture. Here's a minus t a Tubie and here's a MSC over B. So this is the total quantity produced on this equilibrium in this corner, Nash Equilibrium. How does it compare to the monopoly quantity? Enter the competitive quantity.

Speaker 2:          01:10:33       Anybody

Speaker 1:          01:10:35       a little bit of just staring at the board, which, which of these is bigger? So I claim that this total quantity being produced is less than the competitive quantity, but more in total than the monopoly quantity.

Speaker 2:          01:10:50       All right.

Speaker 1:          01:10:52       I was about to hit it the wrong way round. That's right. So the total quantity being produced is less than will be produced on the perfect competition, but more than we produced under monopoly. And consequently prices are going to go the other way, right? And consequently prices are going to be highest on the monopoly. Lowest under competition. I'm somewhere in between in this corner situation. All right, so from the point of view of, of point of view of the producers, this corner equilibrium is worse than monopoly, but better than perfect competition and but what have you have the rest of us, the consumers, this corner quantity is worse than perfect competition, but better than monopoly.

Speaker 1:          01:11:36       All right there he ride on that being, if that producing Coca Cola and you have any kind of concern for your teeth, maybe you can, maybe you shouldn't produce so much. Anyway. All right, so so far what we've done is we've looked at this classic, if I had, it's not the most exciting game in the world, but it he'll classic and the application of Game Theory to imperfect competition. Next time, I'm actually going to take us a bit further, but I'm going to leave this game behind and look at other ways in which we can study imperfect competition using game theory.
