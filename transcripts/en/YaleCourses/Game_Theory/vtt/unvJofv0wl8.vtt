1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.120
So last time we saw this,
we saw an example of a mixed strategy,

2
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.050
which was to play a third,
a third,

3
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:14.940
a third in our rock,
paper,
scissors game.
All right.

4
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:16.950
And today we're going to be formal.

5
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.490
We're going to define mixed strategies and we're going to talk about them and

6
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:24.660
it's gonna take a while.
All right,
so let's start with a formal definition

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.293
<v 1>definition,</v>

8
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.210
<v 0>a mixed strategy and develop notation.
As I'm going along,</v>

9
00:00:34.211 --> 00:00:37.870
just let me call it piece.
I buy,
I being the person who's playing it.

10
00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.800
Piece I buy is a randomization.

11
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.250
Randomization
over eyes,

12
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.080
pure strategists.

13
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.763
<v 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.211
<v 0>All right,</v>

15
00:00:56.211 --> 00:01:01.211
so in particular we're going to use the dictation piece of pie of SSI to be the

16
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:07.631
probability that player I plays Sii given that he's mixing using Pi.

17
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.320
All right?

18
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.320
So pis PSI is the probe in the sea

19
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.330
<v 1>that Pii assigns to the pure strategy</v>

20
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.240
<v 0>s I and it's immediately refer that back to our example.
So for example,</v>

21
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.230
if I'm playing third,
a third,
a third in rock,
paper,
scissors,

22
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.270
then Pii is a third,
a third,

23
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:47.200
a third and Pi of a rock that would pee.

24
00:01:47.201 --> 00:01:51.870
Ai of Ar is a third.
All right?
So without belaboring it,

25
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.370
that's all I'm doing here is developing some of the station.
All right?

26
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.940
It's immediately counter.
Two things do you might have questions about,

27
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.150
so the first is that in principle pis,

28
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:07.280
cy could be zero.

29
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.633
<v 1>Okay?</v>

30
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.780
<v 0>All right?
So just cause I'm playing a mixed strategy,</v>

31
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.640
it doesn't mean I have to involve all of my strategies.
All right?

32
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.490
I can pick and mix strategy on two of my strategies and leave the other one with

33
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:23.960
zero properly.
Prevalency so for example,
again in rock,
paper,
scissors,

34
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.970
we could can think of the strategy are half a half zero,

35
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.220
right?
And this strategy I assign,

36
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.380
I play rock half the time I play paper half the time,

37
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.180
but I never placed scissors.
All right.
[inaudible] to understand that.

38
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.590
And while we're here,
it took at the other extreme,

39
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.000
the prevalency he assigned by men by mixed strategy to a particular,

40
00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:52.370
SSI could be one.

41
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.040
It could be that I assign all the privacy to a particular strategy.

42
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.470
What would we call mixed strategy?
That eScience problem.

43
00:03:01.471 --> 00:03:05.020
Was he one to one of the PR strategies?
What's a good name for that?

44
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.290
That's a fuel strategy,
right?
That's a pure strategy.
All right,

45
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.380
so now just so we can think of pure strategies as the special case of a mixed

46
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:17.470
strategy that assigns all the weight to a particular pure strategies route.

47
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.460
So for example,

48
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:23.520
if p I rock was one that's equivalent to saying that I'm playing,

49
00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.720
I'm playing the pure strategy rock.
Hi,

50
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.620
eee up your strategy.
All right,

51
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:33.401
so there's nothing here.

52
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:37.540
I'm just being a little bit nerdy about developing notation and making sure that

53
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:41.560
everything is in place.
All right,
and just to point out again,

54
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.700
a one on one consequence of this is we've now got our pure strategies embedded

55
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.340
in our mech strategist,
right?

56
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:51.190
When I've got a mixed strategy I already am including in those,

57
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.310
all of the pure strategists.
All right,

58
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.590
<v 2>so let's proceed.</v>

59
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.200
I push that up a little higher.
Sorry.

60
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.250
<v 0>All right,</v>

61
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.680
so now I want to think about what are the payoffs that I get from mixed

62
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:23.780
strategies.
And again,

63
00:04:23.781 --> 00:04:26.510
I'm going to go a little slowly cause it's a little tricky at first and we'll

64
00:04:26.511 --> 00:04:29.750
get used to this.
Don't panic.
We'll get used to this as we go on.

65
00:04:29.751 --> 00:04:33.740
And as you see them in homework assignments in class.
All right,

66
00:04:33.741 --> 00:04:37.880
so let's talk about the pay offs from a mixed strategy

67
00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.580
payoffs from mixed ranches.
Alright,
and in particular,

68
00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:53.560
what we're going to worry about our expected payoffs.
So the expected,

69
00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.080
<v 2>hey off
all of the mixed strategy p,</v>

70
00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.580
<v 0>let's be consistent and call it pie.
The mix strategy.
Pei is what?</v>

71
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.910
It's the weighted average.

72
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.960
It's a weighted average or weighted mixture if you like.

73
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.083
<v 2>Oh,</v>

74
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.170
<v 0>the expected payoffs</v>

75
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.800
<v 2>of each of the strategies</v>

76
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:43.790
<v 0>in the mix.</v>

77
00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.843
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

78
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.361
<v 0>All right.</v>

79
00:05:47.361 --> 00:05:49.790
So this is a long way of saying something and again I think is a little bit

80
00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:51.320
obvious,
but let me just say it again.

81
00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.310
The way in which we figured out the expected payoff of a mixed strategy is we

82
00:05:55.311 --> 00:05:59.100
take the aptly,
appropriately weighted of the expected payoff.

83
00:05:59.101 --> 00:06:02.270
So I would get from the pure structures over which I'm mixing.
All right,

84
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.480
let me let,
let's abstracts,
let's immediately look at an example.

85
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.000
So here's an example.
We'll come back to you several times,
but just ones today.

86
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:14.240
And this is a game that you've seen before.

87
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.380
Here is the game battle of the sexes and which play at,

88
00:06:20.381 --> 00:06:21.970
hey can choose capital play,

89
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.980
one can choose a capital a and B and play it too can choose little a and B.

90
00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.820
All right.
And what I want to do is I want to figure out,

91
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.980
I want to figure out the payoff from particular strategies.
So suppose

92
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.383
<v 2>p,</v>

93
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.430
<v 0>it's what's being played by player one and p is uh,
let's say,</v>

94
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.960
um,
one fifth,
fourth,
fifth.

95
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.490
So what do I mean by that?

96
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.550
I mean the player one is a signing a fifth to playing a and for fifth to playing

97
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:06.300
B.
All right,
and suppose that cue get it.

98
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.100
I'm going to use p and Q because it's convenient to do so rather than calling p

99
00:07:10.101 --> 00:07:10.970
one and p two.

100
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.260
So I suppose that cue is the mixture of that player two is choosing and she's

101
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:17.360
choosing a half half,

102
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.780
so she's putting it [inaudible] a half on little Aa and prophesy a half on

103
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:25.300
little B and just the Lucius.

104
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.390
I switched notation on you a little bit for this example to keep life easy,

105
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.480
I'm going to use P to B rose mixtures and queue to be columns mixtures.

106
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.620
Right out of the question I want to answer is what is the expected payoff in

107
00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:41.180
this case of p,

108
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.830
what is peace expected payoff.

109
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.820
<v 2>All
right,</v>

110
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.670
<v 0>and the way I'm going to do that is I'm,
first of all,</v>

111
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:59.690
I'm going to ask what is the expected payoff of each of the pure strategies that

112
00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:05.821
p that p involves over which p p is the pure strategies involved in p.

113
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.760
Right?
So to start off,
I just,

114
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:13.770
the first step is asked what is the expected payoff for player one of playing a

115
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:20.770
against queue

116
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:27.330
and what is the expected payoff for player one of playing B against queue?

117
00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:32.170
That'll be our first question and we'll come back and construct the payoff for

118
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:36.700
Pete.
All right,
so these are things we can do.
I think so.

119
00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:41.510
The expected payoff of a against queue is what?
Well,

120
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:44.320
how half the time if you play a,

121
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.580
you're going to find your opponent is playing little Aa,

122
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.220
in which case you'll get two and half the time when you play a,

123
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:55.980
you'll find her opponent is playing B,
in which case you'll get all right,

124
00:08:55.981 --> 00:08:57.120
so let's just write that up.

125
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:02.300
So I'm going to get to with problems see a half plus zero with probable

126
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.690
probability a half.
All right.
Everyone happy with that and back?

127
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:15.120
That gives me one.
Okay.

128
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:18.270
Please correct my math unless it's very easy at the board to make mistakes,

129
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:22.800
but I think that one is right.
Okay.
Conversely,
what if I played B?

130
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:27.801
What's the expected payoff for the row player of playing B against Q or Q is a

131
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:32.970
half half.
So how for the time when I played B,

132
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:38.060
I'll meet a player to playing the lay and I'll get zero and half the time I'll

133
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:43.740
find player two is playing mental B and I'll get one.
All right,

134
00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:44.820
let's write that up.

135
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.240
So I'll get zero half the time and I'll get one

136
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:56.730
half the time,
uh,
for an average of

137
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.820
a half.
All right.
Okay.

138
00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.160
That's the first thing I ask him now to finish the job,

139
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.400
I now want to figure out what is the expected payoff for player one of using p

140
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:16.490
against Q.
That what the question I already wanted to start off with.
All right.

141
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:21.300
What's the way to think about this?
Well,
peers,
one fifth of the time,

142
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.240
P uh,

143
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:28.300
couldn't to p one fifth of the time play a one is playing a and forfirst of the

144
00:10:28.741 --> 00:10:33.270
time player one is playing B.
Is that right?

145
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.010
So to work out the expected payoff,

146
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:39.120
what we're gonna do is we're going to take one fifth of the time.

147
00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:44.820
And in which case he's playing a and he'll get the expected payoff he would have

148
00:10:44.821 --> 00:10:47.130
got from playing a against Q

149
00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.300
and forfirst of the time

150
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:55.510
he's going to be playing be,

151
00:10:55.511 --> 00:11:00.511
in which case he'll get the expected payoff from playing be against cue.

152
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.550
All right.
And now just plugging in some numbers to that from above.

153
00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:10.870
So we've got one fifth of the time he's doing the expected payoff from a against

154
00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:15.700
Q.
And that's this number we worked out already.
All right,

155
00:11:15.701 --> 00:11:19.890
so this number here
can come down here.

156
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.953
<v 1>One</v>

157
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.760
<v 0>and four.</v>

158
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.550
First of the time he's playing be against queue in which case is expected.

159
00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:31.170
Payoff was a half.

160
00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:35.853
<v 1>Okay,</v>

161
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.180
<v 0>so this
comes in here.</v>

162
00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.880
All right,
everyone.
Okay?
So far,
how I construct it so far?

163
00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:50.640
Is this podium in the way of you guys?
Are you okay?
Let me push it slightly.
Okay.

164
00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.030
All right.
And so the total is what it's going to be.
Uh,

165
00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.580
one fifth of one plus four fifths of a half.

166
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.060
A forfirst of a half is too fast.
So I've got a total of three fifths.

167
00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:11.630
All right,
so the total here is three fifths.
Alright,

168
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:12.840
everyone understand how I did that?

169
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.333
<v 1>Okay.</v>

170
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.930
<v 0>Now,
while it's here,
let's notice something.</v>

171
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:24.070
When I played PE some of the time I played a and some of the time I played B.

172
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:28.240
All right,
and what did I paid it when I ended up paying,
hey,

173
00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:31.420
I got A's expected payoff when I paid ba got B's expected payoff,

174
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.960
so the number I ended up with three fifths must lie between the payoff I would

175
00:12:38.721 --> 00:12:41.230
have got from a,
which is one,

176
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.940
and the payoff I would have got from B,
which is a half.

177
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.820
Is that right?
Is that right?

178
00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.140
Three fifths lies between a half.

179
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:56.790
On one hand,
we're okay with that?
Yup.
Yup.

180
00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.860
Now that's a very,
that's a simple but very general and very useful idea.

181
00:13:01.861 --> 00:13:06.520
It turns out I had the idea here,
is it the payoff?

182
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:11.590
I'm going to get must lie between the expected payoffs I would have got from the

183
00:13:13.561 --> 00:13:18.090
pure strategist.
Let me say it again.
In general,
when I play a mixed strategy,

184
00:13:18.810 --> 00:13:23.810
the expected payoff I get is a weighted average of the expected payoffs of each

185
00:13:25.171 --> 00:13:27.120
of the pure strategists in the mix.

186
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:32.810
And weighted averages always lie inside the pay offs that are involved in the

187
00:13:33.541 --> 00:13:34.374
mix.

188
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.720
<v 1>All right.
All right.</v>

189
00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:41.990
<v 0>Let me try and push that simple idea a little harder.</v>

190
00:13:41.991 --> 00:13:46.991
I suppose I was going to take the average height in the class average height in

191
00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:51.380
this class.
All right,
so let me just,
uh,

192
00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.150
rather than use the class that must use some tas here.
So let me get the,

193
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:59.070
let me get these three ta is to stand up for a second.
All right.

194
00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:04.000
And suppose I wanted to figure out the average height of these three TA's.

195
00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.200
All right,
so it's not as close together is to see what's going on here.

196
00:14:07.201 --> 00:14:10.730
So I think from where I'm standing,
uh,
I've got that uh,

197
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.230
ally as the tallest and mercy,
the smallest does that,
right?

198
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.130
So I don't know instantaneously what this average would be,

199
00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:22.310
but I claim that any weighted average of their three heights is going to give me

200
00:14:22.891 --> 00:14:27.720
a number.
That's somewhere between the smallest height height of the three,

201
00:14:27.721 --> 00:14:30.960
which is matters height and the tallest height of the three,

202
00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:35.310
which is allies height.
Is that right?
That correct.
All right,

203
00:14:35.311 --> 00:14:37.350
so that's a pretty general idea and thanks.
Thanks guys.

204
00:14:37.351 --> 00:14:39.450
We'll come back to in a second.
All right.
All right,

205
00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.790
and let's think about this somewhere else.
I think about the,

206
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.460
the batting average of a team.
All right?

207
00:14:44.461 --> 00:14:46.800
It's got the team batting average in baseball.

208
00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.830
I just think that's used the Yankees for example,
we know that the team average,

209
00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.390
the average batting average of the Yankees,
I don't know what it isn't.

210
00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:56.510
I didn't look it up this morning,

211
00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:01.220
but I know it lies somewhere between the player who has the highest batting

212
00:15:01.221 --> 00:15:05.160
average,
which I'm guessing is Geeta,
I'm guessing,
uh,
and uh,

213
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.690
the lowest and the person on the team has the lowest batting average who's

214
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.300
probably one of the pictures you played who bad it a few times.

215
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:14.270
One of those into league games.
All right.
It'd be better if I'd used the mets,

216
00:15:14.271 --> 00:15:17.270
but I,
I feel I should take pity on mets fans this week and not mention them.

217
00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:23.330
All right.
All right,
so this is a very simple idea.
It's deceptively simple.

218
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:28.480
It says average is weighted averages lie between the highest thing over which

219
00:15:29.451 --> 00:15:32.540
are averaging and the lowest thing over which are averaging.
All right?

220
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:34.850
Everyone okay with that idea?
All right.

221
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:39.970
Now this very simple idea is going to have an enormous consequence and here's

222
00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:44.810
the enormous consequence,
right?
Simple idea,
big consequence.

223
00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:52.620
So there's going to be a lesson that follows from this incredibly simple idea

224
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.030
and this is the lesson is a mixed,

225
00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.640
a mixed strategy.

226
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.200
If a mixed strategy is a best response [inaudible] she is the best thing you can

227
00:16:07.921 --> 00:16:11.790
be doing.
Then

228
00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:17.460
each of the pure strategies

229
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.770
<v 1>you should have the pure strategies in the mix.</v>

230
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.650
<v 0>I'm being a little bit loose tear,</v>

231
00:16:27.651 --> 00:16:31.540
but I mean assign positive policy in the mix for those people who are nerdy

232
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.820
enough to worry about it.
Each of the pure strategy is in the mix,

233
00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:41.460
<v 1>must
themselves</v>

234
00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.950
be best responses.
So in particular

235
00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:51.510
in particular,

236
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.740
each must yield

237
00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.710
the same expected payoff.

238
00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:05.631
<v 0>All right,</v>

239
00:17:05.631 --> 00:17:10.631
so here's a big conclusion that follows from that incredibly simple idea about

240
00:17:10.761 --> 00:17:15.120
averages lying between the highest one in the lowest one and it's draw samples

241
00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:19.910
from that lesson to this big conclusion,
right?
What does the conclusion,

242
00:17:19.911 --> 00:17:22.880
the conclusion is if it,
if it makes strategy is the best response.

243
00:17:22.881 --> 00:17:25.610
If it's the best thing I can do is to play,
I'm it strategy,

244
00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.260
then each of the pure strategies which I'm playing in,
that makes one,

245
00:17:30.261 --> 00:17:31.400
am I signing positive problems?

246
00:17:31.401 --> 00:17:35.420
He too did that mix must themselves be best responses.

247
00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:38.480
All right.
In particular each of them,

248
00:17:38.481 --> 00:17:42.890
therefore Mr yield the same expected payoff.
So let's go back to our example.

249
00:17:42.891 --> 00:17:45.710
It's gonna Kinda,
I'm sorry guys.
Can I steal my three TA's again?

250
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:50.100
I suppose the game,
I suppose the thing I'm involved in,

251
00:17:50.101 --> 00:17:51.930
I should have made this easier before it would come down a little bit.

252
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.060
I'll stand above here.
Yeah,
this is good.
It's good.
Okay.

253
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:55.770
So suppose the game I've been,

254
00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.800
I'm involved in the payoff and the game is a game in which I have to choose the

255
00:18:00.811 --> 00:18:03.780
tallest group of my tas,
right?

256
00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:08.780
So my payoff is going to be the average height of whichever subgroup of my TA's

257
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:12.150
I pick.
All right?
And these are my three choices.
All right?

258
00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:14.580
So if I pick more than one of them,
right?

259
00:18:14.581 --> 00:18:16.800
I think I'm going to get a weighted average that that's a mixed strategy.

260
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:18.110
All right?

261
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:22.590
My aim here is to maximize the height of whatever subgroup I pick.

262
00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.240
All right?
So in this game,
here's my three choices.

263
00:18:26.241 --> 00:18:30.930
He's my threes pure strategies,
my three pillar structures,
Myrto,
ally or Jake.

264
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.110
All right?
There's my,

265
00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:35.340
there's my three PR strategies and my mixed dry could mix these two.

266
00:18:35.341 --> 00:18:39.060
I could mix these two.
I can mix all three.
All right?
But remember,

267
00:18:39.061 --> 00:18:44.061
my payoff here is to get the group the average as high as I can.

268
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.950
So how am I going to get the average as high as I can?

269
00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.050
I'm I to average as high as I can.
He said cheating.
Yeah,

270
00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:55.230
they get the average is high as I can.
I'm going to kick out Moroto for start.

271
00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:55.811
All right.
Sorry.

272
00:18:55.811 --> 00:18:58.860
So he was all right because motors just motors just bringing down the average,

273
00:18:58.861 --> 00:19:02.640
is that right?
All right.
Average height,
I should say.
All right.
There's nothing,

274
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.170
right,
right.
And actually,
all right.

275
00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.810
And I think I'm going to kick out Jake as well.

276
00:19:06.811 --> 00:19:09.630
I think can hit people over the writing a portico kickout Jake as well,

277
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.050
because that way I just have ally,
right?
So if it was the case,

278
00:19:13.051 --> 00:19:16.620
I was picking both of them,
it would have to be,
they were equally tall.
Right.

279
00:19:16.621 --> 00:19:18.720
But since,
since they're not equal at all,

280
00:19:18.721 --> 00:19:21.000
I should just pick them to the best one.
Right.

281
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:25.560
Let's go back to my Yankees example.
If I want to pick a sub team of the Yankees,

282
00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.490
I'm gonna have to pick any number of people to have the highest average batting

283
00:19:29.491 --> 00:19:33.210
average in that sub team.
The way to do it is to find the Yankee.

284
00:19:33.211 --> 00:19:38.190
You has the highest batting average,
and just pick him.
All right.

285
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.810
Let's do one more example.
Let me use the front row of students here.

286
00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.550
All right,
so here's my,

287
00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:48.660
can I get this front row of students to stand up a second?
All right,
so this,

288
00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.580
this,
this,
this part of the row.
All right.

289
00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.640
And suppose my aim in life is to construct the highest average GPA.

290
00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.550
I'm not gonna embarrass these guys and ask them what their Ghg PA's are.

291
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:02.090
All right?
So,
so,
so my,

292
00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:06.960
my aim in life here is to pick some subgroup of these.
One,
two,
three,

293
00:20:06.961 --> 00:20:08.070
four,
five,
six,
seven,

294
00:20:08.071 --> 00:20:12.340
eight students such that the average of the average GPA,

295
00:20:12.341 --> 00:20:16.770
yet that subgroup is as high as I can make it.
All right?

296
00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:19.920
So what would I do here?
So this being Yale,

297
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:25.010
I'll just find the people who have the 4.0 GPA is and just pick them.

298
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.110
It's not right.
All right?
You might think,
well,

299
00:20:28.111 --> 00:20:33.020
why not include somebody who has a 3.9 GPA?
That's pretty good.
So why nots?

300
00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:37.350
Because if there's anybody in this group who has a 4.0 GPA,

301
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:39.270
I do better just to pick that person.

302
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.600
The 3.9 person would just be pulling down the average.

303
00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:48.220
And I suppose there's nobody with a four o GPA and it's the case that three of

304
00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:52.480
these guys,
three of these people,
let's say the three people have a 3.9 GPA,

305
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.980
right?
So these three,
half,
3.9 GPA,
imagine that.
And these other people,

306
00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.810
they've got horrible grades like B plus somewhere.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.

307
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.040
Alright.
So these are our future law school students.

308
00:21:03.041 --> 00:21:04.030
And these are the people who are,

309
00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.540
who knows what they're going end up doing being president probably.
Alright.

310
00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.400
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
So to the constructor,

311
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.000
the group with the highest average GPA,
what am I going to do?

312
00:21:13.001 --> 00:21:16.390
Well first I'll throw out all these guys with low GPA so they can all sit down.

313
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:22.030
I look at these last three and these last three.
If they're all in the group,

314
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.980
they better all have the same GPA,
right?
Why not?
If,
if,
if,

315
00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:29.440
if,
if I'm trying to maximize the average of my group,

316
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:33.610
if any of them had a lower GPA,
I should kick them out.

317
00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.790
And if one of them has a higher GPA than the other two,

318
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:38.080
I should kick out both the other two.

319
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.440
So I'm including all three of them in my constructing of the average.

320
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.570
All of them must have the same GPA,

321
00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.310
which I'm going to assume it's 3.9 to assume you can still make it into,

322
00:21:46.311 --> 00:21:50.890
you'll enter law school.
All right,
everyone understand that?
Yup.
Yup.

323
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:56.090
Okay,
thanks.
Thanks guys.
All right.
All right,
so that's,
that's the,
uh,

324
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.000
that's the way I want to think about this.
All right,

325
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:03.240
so the idea here is if I'm using a mixed strategy as a best response,

326
00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.420
right?

327
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:10.420
It must be the case that everything on which I'm mixing is it self best and the

328
00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:16.570
can,
the reason is if it wasn't kick out the thing that isn't best and my average

329
00:22:16.571 --> 00:22:20.020
will go up.
All right.
All right.

330
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:24.100
So that leads us to the next idea.
But before I do,

331
00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:28.510
just for formality,
let me add a definition.
The definition is this,

332
00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.110
<v 1>a mixed</v>

333
00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:39.170
<v 0>strategy profile and I'm going to do,</v>

334
00:22:39.171 --> 00:22:41.420
now I'm going to define Nash equilibrium again.

335
00:22:41.421 --> 00:22:42.680
That's what we have it on a note somewhere.

336
00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.710
So a mixed strategy profile to be a hyphen there.

337
00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:52.050
P One star p two star all the way up to p n star is a mixed strategy.

338
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.200
Nash equilibrium.

339
00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.493
<v 1>If</v>

340
00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:11.180
<v 0>for each player I,</v>

341
00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:15.360
so for each eye we're going to be here for each player I,

342
00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.210
<v 1>let's play it I</v>

343
00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.270
<v 0>that players mixed strategy.</v>

344
00:23:23.271 --> 00:23:28.271
Pi Star is a best response for player I

345
00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.150
to the strategies.
Everyone else is picking p minus I star.

346
00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.820
So I'm exploiting our buy now.

347
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:39.740
Well developed notation for play a strategist.

348
00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.960
<v 1>Let me get some more short.
All</v>

349
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.010
<v 0>right,
so this definition of Nash equilibrium,</v>

350
00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.820
it's exactly the same as the definition of Nash Equilibrium.

351
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:56.210
We've been using now for several weeks except everywhere,
right?

352
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:59.870
Where before we saw a pure strategy I've ripped,
which was an ass,

353
00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.910
I have replaced it with a p,
right?

354
00:24:01.911 --> 00:24:05.630
It's the same definition except I'm using mixed strategies instead of pure

355
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:06.464
strategies,

356
00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:10.840
but an implication of an implication of our lesson is what?

357
00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.750
It's that if p I star is part of a national equilibrium.

358
00:24:15.751 --> 00:24:20.600
So if pis thought is the best response to Pete to whatever else is doing p minus

359
00:24:20.601 --> 00:24:21.434
ice bar,

360
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:27.010
then each of the pure strategies involved in Pii star must itself be a best

361
00:24:29.481 --> 00:24:33.260
response.
All right,
so an implication of the lesson is

362
00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.070
<v 1>the lesson implies the following.</v>

363
00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:40.793
If

364
00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:45.180
<v 0>Pis star of a particular strategy is positive,</v>

365
00:24:45.181 --> 00:24:48.310
it's in other words I'm using this strategy in my mix,

366
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:54.770
<v 1>then that strategy is also</v>

367
00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:57.920
a best response

368
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:04.390
to what everyone else is doing.
Right?

369
00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.753
Okay.

370
00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:10.880
<v 0>So from a,
from a math point of view,</v>

371
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:13.100
this is the big idea of the day,

372
00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:14.823
<v 1>this board,</v>

373
00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:19.090
<v 0>okay.
And I,
and if you're having trouble reading this,
the back,
trust me,</v>

374
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.240
I've written that up on the handout that will appear magic beyond the computer

375
00:25:22.241 --> 00:25:23.074
at the end of class

376
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.550
and about at the moment you're staring at this and it's all a bit new and as

377
00:25:27.551 --> 00:25:30.070
well as being new,
you are saying,
okay,
but so what?

378
00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:31.870
Why do I care about this Steve?

379
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:36.790
Seemingly a mundane fact.
All right.

380
00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.350
And the reason,

381
00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:42.550
the reason we're going to turn out to care about this seemingly mundane fact is

382
00:25:42.551 --> 00:25:47.551
that this fact is going to make it remarkably easy to find nash equilibrium.

383
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:54.130
All right?
This facts right?
This,
this,
this lesson,

384
00:25:54.131 --> 00:25:57.940
this idea that if I'm applying a pure strategy is part of the mix,

385
00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:00.280
it must itself be a best response.

386
00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.790
That's going to be the trick we're going to use in finding mixed strategy,

387
00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:07.770
nasty equilibria.
All right?

388
00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:11.850
And the only way I can illustrate that to you is to do it.

389
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:16.500
So I'm gonna spend the rest of today,
uh,
just doing that.

390
00:26:16.501 --> 00:26:17.100
I'm going to look at them.

391
00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.190
I'm going to look at a game and we're going to go through this game.

392
00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:23.970
We'll discuss it a little bit because it's a fun game and we're going to find

393
00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:27.810
the mixed strategy equilibria of this game.
Okay?

394
00:26:27.811 --> 00:26:31.350
We know we're going that just not me.
I want to make sure before I go on,

395
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.650
are people looking very sort of a deer in the headlamps?

396
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.530
That was a lot of formality to get to get through in a,
in a short bit of time.

397
00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.940
So how,
how,
um,
they might want to ask a question at this point.
UK.

398
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.310
Okay to go on.
All right.
Just remember that the,

399
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.240
the conclusion here comes from this very simple idea.

400
00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:53.241
The simple idea is the payoff to a weighted average must lie between the best

401
00:26:53.251 --> 00:26:55.650
and worst thing involved in the average.
And therefore,

402
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.040
if I'm including things in there as part of the best response,

403
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:03.930
they must all be good.
That's the simple idea.
This is the dramatic conclusion.

404
00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:08.220
All right,
so any way to prove this,
you don't know,
I need to prove you.

405
00:27:08.221 --> 00:27:10.330
There's this is useful is to go ahead and do it.

406
00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:14.880
We're not going to do is I'm going to clean these boards and I'm going to start

407
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.190
showing an example.

408
00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:22.970
All right?
And again,
don't panic.

409
00:27:22.971 --> 00:27:26.060
I think a lot of people at this part of the class have a tendency to panic

410
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.940
because it's a new idea and seems like a lot of math around.

411
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:32.570
None of it's really hard math.
It's all kind of arithmetic.

412
00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:34.490
It's just this idea of not panicking.

413
00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:36.623
<v 2>All right,</v>

414
00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:39.850
<v 0>so things don't play.
Want to look at?</v>

415
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:43.183
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

416
00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.530
<v 0>it's going to be from tennis.</v>

417
00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:47.043
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

418
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:52.120
<v 0>And I'm going to consider a game within a game played by two tennis players and</v>

419
00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:57.140
let's call them a Venus and Serena Williams.
All right,

420
00:27:57.141 --> 00:28:00.560
so Venus and Serena.

421
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:04.090
<v 2>Oh William.</v>

422
00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.810
<v 0>So a couple of years ago we used to use Venus and Serena Williams for this</v>

423
00:28:06.811 --> 00:28:07.560
example.

424
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:11.130
And then for awhile I worry that you wouldn't even remember who Venus and Serena

425
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:15.270
Williams where until we picked any two random Russians.
But now we're back.

426
00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.350
It seems like we're back to picking Venus and Serena.
Alright,

427
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.360
so the game within the game is this,

428
00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:26.310
suppose that they're playing and Serena is at the net,

429
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.990
right?
Is that the net?

430
00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.200
And the ball is on venuses courts and Venus has reached the ball and Venus has

431
00:28:34.321 --> 00:28:38.220
to decide whether to try to hit a passing shot,

432
00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:43.690
a past Serena on the Serena's left or on Serena's rights.

433
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:48.750
And notice I'm going to exclude the possibility of throwing up a lobe for now.

434
00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:50.580
All right.
Just make the get dust to make this manageable.

435
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.250
So basically the choice facing facing Venus is,

436
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:58.470
should she try to pass Serena just arenas left.
Which is the is backs,

437
00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.880
backhand side order,
Serena's writes,
which is through Serena's forehand side.

438
00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:05.013
Alright everyone,

439
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.770
people if I'm in love with tennis to understand what I'm talking about.
Yeah.

440
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.840
Yeah.
So we're going to assume this is Wimbledon.

441
00:29:09.841 --> 00:29:11.460
Otherwise no one will be at the net to start with.

442
00:29:11.461 --> 00:29:15.360
I guess this is it when we're done.
All right.
And let's try and put up some,

443
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:20.300
some payoffs here.
All right,
so these are going to be the payoffs.

444
00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:24.590
I think that this example is originally due to,
uh,

445
00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:28.150
to it.
Uh,
but it,
you know,
it doesn't,
it's not a big deal I think.
I think it's a,

446
00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.980
I think this example is due to Dixit and skis.

447
00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:37.830
Right?
So here's some numbers
and I'll explain the numbers in a minute.

448
00:29:37.831 --> 00:29:41.380
So this is 50,
50,
80,

449
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:46.420
2090 10

450
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:52.180
and 2080.
Okay.

451
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.640
So what are these numbers?
So first of all,

452
00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:59.170
let me just explain what the strategies are.
So I'm assuming the row player is,

453
00:29:59.171 --> 00:30:02.020
be honest,
and the column player is Serena.

454
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:06.670
I'm assuming that if venuses Venus chooses l,

455
00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:11.830
that means she attempts to pass Serena to Serena's left.

456
00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:16.330
Alright,
well,
orange things from Trina's point of view.
And if she hits right,

457
00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:21.370
that means she's attempting to pass Serena on Serena's right,

458
00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.190
right?
And it's the Rena chooses owl.

459
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:28.060
That means she cheats slightly towards her left.

460
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.220
Not Cheats in the sense of breaking the rules,

461
00:30:30.221 --> 00:30:34.390
but cheats in terms of where she's standing or leaning.
And if she chooses,
right,

462
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:36.790
that means he cheats slightly towards her,
right?

463
00:30:36.791 --> 00:30:38.560
So this is cheating towards her backhand.

464
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:42.040
Now this is cheating towards her forehand,
assuming she's right handed,

465
00:30:42.041 --> 00:30:46.450
which she in fact is okay.
And what do these numbers mean?

466
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:50.000
So let's start with the easy ones.
So,
uh,

467
00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:55.020
if Venus chooses left and Serena chooses rights,

468
00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:00.520
then Serena has guessed wrong.
Is that correct?
Right.

469
00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:01.480
So many just guessed wrong,

470
00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.600
in which case Venus winds the points 80% of the time and Serena winds it 20% of

471
00:31:08.501 --> 00:31:11.050
the time,
right?
And conversely,

472
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.130
if Venus chooses right and Serena chooses left,

473
00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:18.430
then again,
Serena has guessed wrong.

474
00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:22.780
And this time Venus winds the point 90% of the time.

475
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.820
And Serena wind to the point 10% of the time.
All right.

476
00:31:27.821 --> 00:31:29.680
And this should be a familiar idea by now,

477
00:31:29.681 --> 00:31:33.850
but why is it the case that these nineties and eighties and not 100%?

478
00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:36.790
Why is it the case that if Serena guesses wrong,

479
00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:41.790
Venus doesn't win 100% of the time?
Anybody's approximate can show hands.

480
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:46.670
We get some mics at work.
Why isn't it 100% here?
Somebody's,
yeah,
uh,
um,

481
00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:51.030
Patrick,
wait for the mic.
Sometimes she hits it right?

482
00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.040
This isn't even a serve.
This is a passive job.

483
00:31:53.041 --> 00:31:55.730
It would be the same as the same is true.
So some,
sometimes you're just,

484
00:31:55.970 --> 00:32:00.100
you're gonna hit it past arena,
but the ball was going to say aloud.
All right,

485
00:32:00.101 --> 00:32:05.101
so that happens 10% of the time here and 20% of the time here [inaudible] look

486
00:32:05.681 --> 00:32:07.590
at the other two boxes.
If sir,

487
00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:12.660
if Venus hits to Serena's left and Serena guesses left,

488
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:17.020
then we're going to assume that Serena's going to reach the ball and make a

489
00:32:17.021 --> 00:32:20.570
volley.
But her volley only manages to go in,

490
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:25.480
get over the net and go in half the time.
So the payoffs are 50,
50,
half the time,

491
00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:28.900
venous wounds.
The point and half the time Serino ends the point.

492
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.430
And conversely,
if Venus hits the bolters arenas,
right,

493
00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.630
and Serena gets is correctly and chooses rights,
then we're in this box.

494
00:32:37.631 --> 00:32:38.290
Once again,

495
00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:42.620
Serena has guessed correctly and she's going to successfully reached the volley

496
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.680
and this time she gets it into 80% of the time.

497
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:50.800
So Venus Williams the point 20% of the time and Serena winds it 80% of the time.

498
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:53.630
<v 1>Right?</v>

499
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:55.850
<v 0>So just to finish up the description of the game here,</v>

500
00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:01.120
notice that we're assuming that Serena is a little better at volleying,

501
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:07.040
uh,
to her,
right?
Then she is volleying to her left,
right?

502
00:33:07.041 --> 00:33:08.720
So this is her forehand volley,

503
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:12.080
and we're going to assume that that's stronger than her backhand volley.

504
00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:13.210
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

505
00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:14.750
<v 0>All right.
And conversely,</v>

506
00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.940
we're assuming that Venus is passing shots is a little better when she shoots it

507
00:33:19.941 --> 00:33:23.810
to Serena's left the,
when she shoots it just as arenas,
right?

508
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:27.890
This is her crosscourt passing shots and this is her down the line passing shot.

509
00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:31.160
All right?
So none of that fine detail matters a great deal,

510
00:33:31.161 --> 00:33:32.870
but just a good interested,
that's where the numbers come from.

511
00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:34.713
<v 1>Okay.</v>

512
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:38.150
<v 0>I'm not claiming this is true data.
By the way.
I made up these numbers.
Actually,</v>

513
00:33:38.151 --> 00:33:42.350
I think Dixit made up these numbers.
I forget why I got them from.
All right,
so,

514
00:33:42.351 --> 00:33:45.170
okay,
everyone understand the game.
All right,

515
00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:50.320
so now imagine either imagine you are Venus or Serena or imagine perhaps more,

516
00:33:50.721 --> 00:33:54.380
more realistically that you've become Venus or Serena is coach.

517
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:58.700
Do you have any men have been members of the tennis team here?
No.
No.
Well,

518
00:33:58.701 --> 00:34:00.260
I imagine you've become their coach,
right?

519
00:34:00.261 --> 00:34:04.550
So take this class and then you apply to replace their father as being that

520
00:34:04.551 --> 00:34:08.960
coach.
All right.
That's a tough assignment,
do you think?
All right,

521
00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:12.710
so an obvious question is,
you know,
here you are coaching Venus.

522
00:34:12.711 --> 00:34:15.800
Before we move on,
you know this situation is going to arise and you weren't,

523
00:34:15.801 --> 00:34:18.590
might want to coach Venus on.
What should she do here?

524
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:24.280
Should she try and pass Serena down the line or should she try and hit the cross

525
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:28.880
court of volume across CrossCorp passing shot?
All right.

526
00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:32.530
And notice that this is a question of should I,
shouldn't,

527
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:35.990
should you Venus play to your strength,

528
00:34:36.410 --> 00:34:41.410
which is the cross court passing shot or should you play to a Serenas,

529
00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:43.550
uh,
Serenas weakness,

530
00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:45.770
<v 1>right?</v>

531
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:49.540
<v 0>Uh,
which is,
which would be to hit,
hit it to Serena's backhand,
right?</v>

532
00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.690
Playing to your strength is,

533
00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.600
is to choose rights and playing to Sabrina's weakness is to choose left.

534
00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:59.610
And conversely for Serena,
should you lean towards your strength,

535
00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.100
which I guess is leaning to the right or should you,
uh,

536
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:07.990
lean towards a Venus is weakness,
which I guess is meaning,
right?

537
00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:11.400
And when you look at coaching manuals on this stuff,

538
00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:15.960
or you've listened to the terrible guys who commentate on tennis for Espn,

539
00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.380
uh,
oh,
not getting in trouble again,
very nice guys who come to the tennis,

540
00:35:19.381 --> 00:35:24.200
but ESPN,
they say just incredibly dumb things at this point,
right?

541
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.350
They say things like,

542
00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:28.650
you should always play to your strengths and don't worry about the other

543
00:35:28.651 --> 00:35:30.090
person's weakness.
Right?

544
00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:33.690
I think it won't take much time today to figure out that to not great advice.

545
00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.690
All right.
What can people can,
at least you,
this is a,

546
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.830
this is a difficult problem,
right?
There's not a,

547
00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:43.350
it's not an immediately obvious problem.
That correct.
Is that correct?

548
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:48.930
One reason it's not immediately obvious is not only is no strategy dominated

549
00:35:48.931 --> 00:35:53.100
here,
but there is no pure strategy.

550
00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:57.090
Nash equilibrium in this game.
All right?
And this little sub game,

551
00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:02.100
there is no pure strategy,
Nash equilibrium.
And there's that.
I did the qualifier.

552
00:36:02.101 --> 00:36:04.580
Now previously I would just to said Nash equilibrium it.

553
00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:07.280
But now that we have mixed strategist in the picture,

554
00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.120
I'm going to talk about pure strategy,

555
00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:13.590
national Culebra to be those that are only involving pure strategies.
Okay?

556
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.610
So why is the no pure strategy Nash Equilibrium?
Well,
let's have a look.

557
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.930
So if Venus,
if Serena thought that Venus was going to choose left,

558
00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:26.040
then her best response,
not surprisingly,
is to lean left.

559
00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.510
And if Serena thought that Venus was going to choose rights,

560
00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:35.750
then her best response is to teach the rights.
All right,

561
00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:40.260
so 50 is bigger than 20 and 80 is bigger than 10.
Right?

562
00:36:40.261 --> 00:36:41.460
And conversely,

563
00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:46.590
if Venus thought that Serena was cheating a bit to the left,

564
00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:51.830
then her best response is to hit it to Serena's rights and if Venus thought

565
00:36:53.661 --> 00:36:55.320
Serena was leaning to the right,

566
00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.430
then Venus is best response is to hit it to Serena's laughed.

567
00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.350
Okay,
so I think that's not at all surprising when you think about it,

568
00:37:04.351 --> 00:37:06.600
not to talk to pricing.
You're going to get this little cycle like this,

569
00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:10.980
but we can see immediately that these best responses never coincide.

570
00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.260
So there is no pure strategy

571
00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:17.480
<v 1>equilibrium
that</v>

572
00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:24.340
up.
There's no pure strategy actually equilibrium.

573
00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:27.350
All right,

574
00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:33.040
<v 0>so that leaves us a bit stuck,
accepted.
I guess it's,</v>

575
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.320
I guess you know what the next question is going to be,
you know,

576
00:37:35.321 --> 00:37:38.290
I shouldn't even in too much expense.
The next question is going to be okay,

577
00:37:38.291 --> 00:37:41.110
there's no pure strategy,
Nash Equilibrium,

578
00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.750
but we've just introduced a new idea,

579
00:37:43.751 --> 00:37:47.260
which was what it was naturally pull Liberman mixed strategies.

580
00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:51.240
Maybe there's going to be a mixed strategy national could have,

581
00:37:51.241 --> 00:37:54.010
but in fact there is.
There is going to be one.
All right,
so all right.

582
00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:56.830
Our exercise now is let's find,

583
00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:01.450
<v 1>let's find a</v>

584
00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:05.830
mixed strategy,

585
00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:08.943
Nash equilibrium

586
00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:13.000
<v 0>before we find it.
That's just interpret what it's gonna mean.
A mixed strategy.</v>

587
00:38:13.001 --> 00:38:18.001
Nash equilibrium in this game is going to be a mix for Venus between hitting the

588
00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:20.951
boulders,

589
00:38:20.951 --> 00:38:25.951
arenas left and Serena's right and he makes for Serena between leaning left and

590
00:38:28.541 --> 00:38:32.350
leaning writes such that each person's mix,

591
00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:37.410
each person's randomization is a best to the other person's randomization.

592
00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.440
<v 2>Alright,
alright.</v>

593
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:44.490
<v 0>And since these players are sisters and I've played each other many,
many times,</v>

594
00:38:44.491 --> 00:38:46.710
not just in competition,
but probably in practice,

595
00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:50.400
it seems like a reasonable idea that they might have arrived in playing each

596
00:38:50.401 --> 00:38:54.620
other at that makes strategy.
Now shake,
whatever.
All right,

597
00:38:54.621 --> 00:38:57.140
that's what we want to try and do.
Now how are we going to do that?

598
00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:04.640
Okay,
so what we're gonna do is we're going to exploit,

599
00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:09.320
we're going to exploit the trick that we have here.
The lesson here.

600
00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:14.650
The lesson we have here says if players are playing a mixed strategy as part of

601
00:39:16.101 --> 00:39:17.210
a Nash equilibrium,

602
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:22.100
each of the pure strategies involved in the mix,

603
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:27.110
each of their pure strategies must itself be a bass response.

604
00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:28.910
We're going to use that idea.

605
00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:37.440
All right,
so let's try and do that.
All right.

606
00:39:37.441 --> 00:39:38.730
Tell me hoping that by doing this,

607
00:39:38.731 --> 00:39:41.040
I'm going to illustrate to you immediately that this,

608
00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:43.080
this idea is actually useful,

609
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:46.560
least useful if you end up coaching the Williams sisters.

610
00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:51.761
All right,

611
00:39:51.761 --> 00:39:54.700
so I want to keep this so you can still read it up and bring it down a bit.

612
00:39:54.701 --> 00:39:55.540
Can people still read it?

613
00:39:58.770 --> 00:39:59.603
<v 2>Okay,</v>

614
00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.530
<v 0>so what I want to do is I want to find a mixture first,</v>

615
00:40:04.531 --> 00:40:08.660
Serena and a mixture for Venus that our equilibrium.
All right,

616
00:40:08.661 --> 00:40:10.880
and I could have just put it up there.
Let me bring it down again,

617
00:40:10.881 --> 00:40:14.440
this was not too intelligent of me.
I actually want to bring in some notation.

618
00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:16.220
So as before,

619
00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:21.280
let's assume that v Serena's mix is it's used Q and one minus Q to be Serena's

620
00:40:23.931 --> 00:40:28.920
mix and let's use P and one minus P two B business.

621
00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.220
This mix.
Okay,
let's just establish that notation.

622
00:40:40.350 --> 00:40:44.790
So here's the trick.
All right,
so this is the slightly magic bit of the class.

623
00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:47.820
Okay,
so pay attention.
I'm about to pull a rabbit out of a hat.

624
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.270
<v 2>Trick
to find.</v>

625
00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:58.450
What should I do first?

626
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:05.270
<v 0>The find Serenas Nash equilibrium mix.</v>

627
00:41:08.010 --> 00:41:11.010
So that's Q one minus Q.

628
00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:16.940
What I'm gonna do is I'm going to look at Venus's payoffs just to find Serenas

629
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:25.230
Nash equilibrium makes.
The trick is to look at

630
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:28.080
Venus's

631
00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:36.450
pay offs.
That's going to be my magic trick.
All right,

632
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:40.980
let's try and see why.
So let's look at Venus.
This payoffs,

633
00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:47.410
penises,
payoffs,
uh,
against.

634
00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:49.820
<v 2>Okay,</v>

635
00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:52.940
<v 0>cute,
right?
So three new is choosing Q one minus Q.</v>

636
00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:57.470
So what is what a Venus is payoffs?
So if she chooses,

637
00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.400
if she chooses
left,

638
00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:08.200
then pay off is 50 with probability Q.

639
00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:17.130
And I'm going to use the pointer here and hope that the camera can see this too.

640
00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:22.250
She gets 50 with probability Q

641
00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:25.940
and she gets

642
00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:32.060
a c with provosts,
one minus key.

643
00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:36.610
Okay.
If she chooses right,

644
00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:45.580
then she gets 90 with probability Q.

645
00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:52.520
All right.
[inaudible] with problems the queue

646
00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:59.110
and she gets 20
with provost,

647
00:42:59.111 --> 00:43:00.890
even one minus Q.
Oh,

648
00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:05.630
I meant to point to that 20 with Pelosi,
one minus key.

649
00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:11.090
All right,
so what,

650
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:17.340
so what is this?
We're looking for a mixed strategy.
Nash equilibrium.

651
00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:22.400
So in particular,
not only Serena is mixing,
but in this case what we're,

652
00:43:22.401 --> 00:43:26.880
what we're claiming is Venus is mixing as well.
All right?

653
00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:32.370
So if Venus is mixing as well,

654
00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:37.640
that means that Venus is using the strategy left with some probability p and

655
00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:44.640
using the strategy writes with some probability one minus B.

656
00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:50.900
Since Venus sometimes chooses left and sometimes chooses rights

657
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.910
as her best response to queue,
does that best responses to Rena?

658
00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:59.040
What must be true?

659
00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:02.830
All of the payoff to left and the payoff to right.

660
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.900
Let's go through it again,
right?

661
00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:11.010
So we're going to assume that Venus is mixing.

662
00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.490
So sometimes you choose his left and sometimes she chooses,
right?

663
00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:16.470
And she's going to be,
she's a Nash Equilibrium,

664
00:44:16.471 --> 00:44:20.910
so she's choosing a best response.
So whatever that mix p woman as peers,

665
00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.620
it's a best response.
Right.
Since,
since,
since she's,

666
00:44:25.770 --> 00:44:26.190
she's,

667
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:30.360
since she's putting your best response of p and that that sometimes involves

668
00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.550
choosing left sometimes involves Tuesday writes,

669
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:37.970
it must be the case that what it must be the case that both left itself and

670
00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:44.490
writes itself are both themselves best response.

671
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:46.503
<v 1>Right?</v>

672
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:48.040
<v 0>Right.
If she's mixing between them,</v>

673
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:53.190
it must be that both choosing left or choosing reits are themselves best

674
00:44:54.161 --> 00:44:56.800
response is if they weren't,
she should just drop them out of the mix.

675
00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.200
That would raise her average payoff.
Right.

676
00:44:59.201 --> 00:45:02.450
Just like we dropped out the short two yeas to get a high,

677
00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:07.530
a high height and we dropped out the feeling Yale students to get a high GPA.

678
00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:12.670
Sorry.
All right.
All right,
so if,
if if Venus,

679
00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:16.390
if Venus is mixing

680
00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:23.710
<v 1>in this Nash Equilibrium,
then</v>

681
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:26.800
the payoff

682
00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.670
to left and turn right

683
00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:40.070
<v 0>must be equal.</v>

684
00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:44.240
They must both be best with both,
both left and right.

685
00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:49.460
Must be a best response.
So in particular,
the expected payoffs must be the same.

686
00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:56.070
Is that right?
Is that correct?
Okay.
So w what,
what does that allow me to do?

687
00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:58.650
It allows me to put an equal sign in here.

688
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.630
It allows me to put an equal sign in here,
right?

689
00:46:03.631 --> 00:46:06.050
The payer since laughter's the best response and right,

690
00:46:06.080 --> 00:46:08.400
the best response is that booth best responses,

691
00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:11.880
they must yield the same expected payoff.
Here's the expected payoff.

692
00:46:11.881 --> 00:46:16.080
They must be the same.
And now I've got one equation and one on known,

693
00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.640
and now I'm down to Algebra.

694
00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:23.450
So let me do the Algebra I claim this expression is equal to that expression.

695
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:28.630
So simplifying a bit,
uh,
I'm going to get,
and you should watch,

696
00:46:28.631 --> 00:46:33.080
make sure I don't get this wrong.
I'm going to get 40 cubes.

697
00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:38.100
This implies 40 Q is equal to 61 minus Q.

698
00:46:41.101 --> 00:46:46.050
So I took this 50 onto this side and this 20 onto that side.

699
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:49.800
So I have 40 Q equals 61 minus Q,

700
00:46:50.010 --> 00:46:55.010
and that implies that Q is equal to 0.6.

701
00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:00.040
All right,
so those last two steps,
we'll just Algebra.

702
00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.273
<v 1>All right.</v>

703
00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:08.120
<v 0>So what was the trick here?
The trick was I found queue,</v>

704
00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:13.330
which is how Cirina is mixing by looking at Venus.

705
00:47:13.771 --> 00:47:18.660
Is Payoffs knowing that Venus is mixing it and hence I can set Munis.

706
00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:23.420
Is Payoffs uh,
equal to another?
All right.
Say it again.

707
00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:28.660
I found the way in which Cirina is mixing by knowing that if Venus is mixing her

708
00:47:30.041 --> 00:47:32.170
expected payoffs must be equal.

709
00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:36.320
And I sold out for Serena's mix.
This is arenas mix.

710
00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:42.543
<v 2>Okay,</v>

711
00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:47.580
<v 0>let's do it again.
Let's do it again
here.</v>

712
00:47:47.581 --> 00:47:49.760
I'm wishing I had another board and maybe I

713
00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:53.510
don't want to lose those numbers entirely.

714
00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.470
So I'm going to try and squeeze in a batch.

715
00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.870
I know I can do,
let's get rid of this one entirely.
There we go.
Well Alex,

716
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:12.650
let's get rid of this one at tiny.
I can still see my numbers

717
00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.110
and let's do the converse.
Let's do the trick again.

718
00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:23.350
This time what I'm gonna do is I'm going to figure out how Venus is mixing.

719
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.950
I know how Serena's mixing now.
So now I'm going to work out how Venus is mixing

720
00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:36.100
now to figure out how,
uh,

721
00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:39.020
I would say it didn't have to figure out how Serena was mixing.

722
00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:41.840
I used Venus is payoffs.

723
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:46.040
So to find out how Venus is mixing it,
what am I going to do?

724
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:50.840
I'm going to use Serena's payoffs.
Alright,
so

725
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:55.760
to find venuses

726
00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:58.723
makes,

727
00:48:59.420 --> 00:49:03.140
which is p one minus p.

728
00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:06.380
Just be careful and it's her nash equilibrium.
Makes

729
00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:11.240
use Serenas

730
00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:14.420
payoffs.
Here we go.

731
00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:21.540
Surf Serina if Serena chooses,
this is ss payoffs.

732
00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:26.900
If Serena chooses l,

733
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:31.850
then her payoffs will be watched.
So,
and again,
what?
Just what?

734
00:49:31.851 --> 00:49:34.430
I don't want to try to get this wrong and I'll point to the things to try and

735
00:49:34.431 --> 00:49:35.330
help myself a bait.

736
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:41.950
So with probability p she'll get 50.

737
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:48.200
All right,
so 50 with problems,
EAP,

738
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:50.600
um,
with privacy,

739
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:55.070
one minus p she'll get 10.

740
00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:01.490
All right?

741
00:50:01.490 --> 00:50:06.470
And if she chooses to lean to the right to lean towards her forehand,

742
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:10.790
then with provosts he peed,
she'll get 20.

743
00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:15.633
<v 2>Okay.</v>

744
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:20.310
<v 0>And with probability one minus P,
she'll get 80.</v>

745
00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:27.153
<v 2>Okay.</v>

746
00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:32.060
<v 0>And we know that Serena is mixing.</v>

747
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:34.550
We know that Serena is mixing.

748
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:41.030
So since Serena is mixing,
what must be true of these two payoffs?

749
00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:43.103
<v 2>Okay.</v>

750
00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:47.400
<v 0>Oh,
it must be true of the to payoff the payoff to little owl and the payoff,</v>

751
00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:48.293
the little r.

752
00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:52.200
What must be true about them since to Rena is using a mixture of these two

753
00:50:52.201 --> 00:50:53.910
strategies in Nash Equilibrium.

754
00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:58.920
It must be the case that both little Al is the best response and [inaudible]

755
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.863
response,

756
00:50:59.970 --> 00:51:04.770
in which case the payoff must be someone tried it out equal.

757
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.190
Thank you.
They must be equal.
These must be equal.

758
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.460
He's supposed to be equal.
They must be equal.

759
00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:16.110
Since Serena is indifferent between choosing left or right and hence his mixing

760
00:51:16.111 --> 00:51:18.180
over them.
All right,
so again,

761
00:51:18.210 --> 00:51:22.590
using the fact that they're equal reduces this to Algebra.
And again,

762
00:51:22.591 --> 00:51:24.360
I'll probably get this wrong,
but let me try.

763
00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.600
So I claim and state 20 away from here.

764
00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:32.660
I've got 30 P equals 71 minus P.

765
00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:38.960
I hope that's right.
That's what that looks right.
Again,

766
00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:40.350
this is just Algebra at this point.

767
00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:43.680
So I took 20 away from here in 10 away from there.

768
00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.940
And this implies that p equals o into seven.

769
00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:54.570
Alright,
so I claim I have now found the mixed strategy.

770
00:51:54.571 --> 00:51:56.760
Now whatever hair it is,

771
00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:02.550
the nash equilibrium is as follows.
Let's be careful.

772
00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:05.820
This is venuses,
this is venuses

773
00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.900
mix.
So Venus is mixing

774
00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:17.090
0.7 0.3 0.7 on left and 0.3 on rights and Serena is mixing 0.6 0.4 all right,

775
00:52:26.911 --> 00:52:31.200
so this is Venus is mix and this is Serena's mix.

776
00:52:31.890 --> 00:52:36.500
Venus is is uh,
shooting to the left of center.

777
00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:41.550
We've probably 2.7 and Serena is leaning that way with privacy 0.6

778
00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:44.483
<v 2>all right,</v>

779
00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:53.820
<v 0>so we were able to find this nash equilibrium by using the trick before.</v>

780
00:52:55.830 --> 00:52:59.020
And let's just reinforce this a little bit by talking about it.

781
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:02.980
So I suppose it with a case,

782
00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:08.130
suppose it with a case that Serina instead of leaning to the left 0.6 of the

783
00:53:09.581 --> 00:53:13.930
time lend to the left more than 0.6 at the time.

784
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:17.650
And I suppose your Venus is coach,
your Venus is coach.

785
00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:23.100
And suppose you know that Serena leans to the left more than 0.6 of the time,

786
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:27.690
what would you advise beingness to do?

787
00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:36.080
All right,
let me try it again.
So suppose your Venus is coach,

788
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:41.230
and suppose you've observed the fact that Serena leans to the left more than 0.6

789
00:53:41.751 --> 00:53:44.240
at a time,
what would you advise me as to do?

790
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:51.120
Yeah,
still the right thing.
Yeah.
So it out yet as to the right pass to the right.

791
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:52.770
Exactly.
So if Serena,

792
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:56.190
she's to the left more than 0.6 of the time,

793
00:53:56.550 --> 00:53:59.940
then Venus is best response is always to shoot to the right,

794
00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:04.080
always to shoot to the right.
That maximizes her chance of winning,

795
00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:08.880
winning the point.
And conversely,
if Serena leans to the left,

796
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.760
left less than 0.6 at the time,

797
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:16.470
if Serena leans to the left less than 0.6 at the time,
then Venus should do was

798
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:24.380
shoot to the left all the time.
All right,
so Serena,

799
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:27.290
if Serena doesn't choose exactly this mix,

800
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:29.720
it's really didn't choose exactly this mix,

801
00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:34.100
then Venus is best response is actually a pure strategy,
right?
Say it again.

802
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:38.060
If Serena lean to the left to Austin more than 0.6,

803
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:39.590
then Venus would just go,
right.

804
00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:44.900
And if Serena leans to the left to nipple,
then Venus should always go left.

805
00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:46.280
Right?

806
00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:51.280
And we can do exactly the same the other way round if Venus shoots to the right.

807
00:54:52.060 --> 00:54:56.000
So it does how cross the hand passing shots more than 0.7 at the time.

808
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:59.840
And your Serena's coach,
what did you tell Sabrina to do?

809
00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:08.030
Yeah,
go that way all the time.
Go that way all the time.
All right.

810
00:55:08.031 --> 00:55:12.530
So if Venus is hitting it to Serena's left more than 0.7 at the time,

811
00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:15.230
so we need to just always go to her left.

812
00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:20.690
And if Venus is hitting to the,
uh,
to the left,
less than 0.7 at the time.

813
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:23.180
So to the right,
more than 0.3 of the time then.

814
00:55:23.181 --> 00:55:24.860
So we should always go to the right,

815
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:27.303
<v 2>right?</v>

816
00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:28.060
<v 0>So that's,</v>

817
00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:31.350
that's how this kind of comes back into the sort of coaching manuals and you're

818
00:55:31.351 --> 00:55:35.410
like,
okay,
so how,
how am I doing so far?
People?

819
00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:37.600
Have I lost everyone yet or are people still with me?

820
00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.950
How many of you play tennis ever?
All right,

821
00:55:41.951 --> 00:55:46.240
so all know tennis is going to dramatically improve after today,
right?
All right.

822
00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:50.590
Okay,
so now let's make life more interesting.

823
00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:54.880
Let's go back to the stars.
We figured out this isn't equilibrium.

824
00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:59.170
This is how Venus and Serena,
Venus and Serena know each other perfectly well.

825
00:55:59.171 --> 00:56:02.000
They know that they mixed this way.
They're going to best respond to it.

826
00:56:02.220 --> 00:56:05.320
He's going to where they at,
where they end up.
But in the meantime,

827
00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:10.560
Serina hires a new coach and Serena's new coach is just very,

828
00:56:12.071 --> 00:56:17.071
very good at teaching the Serena how to play at the net and in particular how to

829
00:56:18.161 --> 00:56:22.630
hit the backhand volley.
Alright,
so Serena's new,

830
00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:24.970
let's say it's Tony Roche or somebody.

831
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:30.060
It's just a brilliant coach and Tony Roche is able to improve Serenas backhand

832
00:56:30.731 --> 00:56:35.250
volley and that changes this,
these payoffs.
So I usually use it,

833
00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:37.690
we write the whole Matrix,
but I'm going to cheat.
All right?

834
00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:42.900
So the new game is exactly the same as it was everywhere else except for now.

835
00:56:44.050 --> 00:56:47.170
When Serena gets to the backhand volley,

836
00:56:47.740 --> 00:56:52.480
she gets it in 70% of the time.
All right,
so they used to be 50,

837
00:56:52.481 --> 00:56:55.360
50 in that box and now it's 30,
70.

838
00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:02.470
All right,
so the game has changed because Serena has got better.

839
00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:03.880
I hit him backhand volley is,

840
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:09.460
and we want to figure out how is this going to effect play at Wimbledon?

841
00:57:12.090 --> 00:57:15.270
All right.
How's this going to affect play at Wimbledon?
No,

842
00:57:15.271 --> 00:57:20.100
it doesn't take much to check that there is still no pure strategy,

843
00:57:20.101 --> 00:57:22.320
Nash equilibrium.
It's still the case.
In fact,

844
00:57:22.321 --> 00:57:27.321
even more so that Serena's best response to a venous choosing left is to lean to

845
00:57:29.131 --> 00:57:30.270
the left.
All right?

846
00:57:30.271 --> 00:57:34.830
So it's still the case that the best response is do not go inside.

847
00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:37.670
There is still no pure strategy,
whatever.

848
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:39.763
<v 2>All right,</v>

849
00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:40.901
<v 0>what we're going to do,</v>

850
00:57:40.901 --> 00:57:43.120
of course it's going to find a mixed strategy equilibrium.

851
00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:47.140
But before we do so let's think about this intuitively,

852
00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:52.990
but see if we can intuit announce that.
All right.
I'm guessing we can't,

853
00:57:53.410 --> 00:57:56.040
but let's see if we get intuition.
The old set.
All right.

854
00:57:56.050 --> 00:58:00.490
So Serena has improved her backhand,
Lena,

855
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:04.350
how backhand volley and hence,
uh,
uh,
when she reached it,

856
00:58:04.351 --> 00:58:06.880
she gets it in more often.
All right.

857
00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:11.860
So one affects you might think is what we might want to call a direct effect.

858
00:58:11.861 --> 00:58:13.150
And there's two effects,
yet

859
00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:17.800
there are two effects.

860
00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:24.370
One of these I'm going to call the direct effect.
And by effect,

861
00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:29.260
I mean in particular an effect on how Serena should play the game.

862
00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:30.723
All right?

863
00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:35.650
So since Serena has improved her backhand volley,

864
00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:39.490
when she reaches that Bali,
she gets it in more often.

865
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:44.320
So one might say,
in that case,
you'll Salinas coach.
In that case,

866
00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:49.190
you should lean to the left more often than you did before,
right?

867
00:58:49.191 --> 00:58:50.800
Because at least when you get that backhand volley,

868
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:52.060
you're going to get it in more often.

869
00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:56.680
So the director facts says Serena

870
00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:03.710
should lean left more.

871
00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:06.330
In other words,
he should go up.

872
00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:09.411
Is that right?

873
00:59:09.411 --> 00:59:13.180
So Serena's now better at playing this backhand volley so she might as well

874
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:16.420
favorite a bit more.
Uh,
and hemp Q will go up.

875
00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:21.190
So I asked the director facts,
but of course there's a box coming.

876
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:25.310
What's the box again?
That's a see my tennis players.
Yeah.
Raise,

877
00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:27.390
raise your hands or your place tenants or something.

878
00:59:27.391 --> 00:59:29.540
Suddenly nobody plays 10 it's going to raise it.
All right.
Okay.

879
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:30.620
What's the box here?

880
00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:35.660
We think Serena's backhand improved so she might be tempted to play towards her

881
00:59:35.661 --> 00:59:37.940
back end a bit more often.
What's the bus?

882
00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:43.133
<v 2>Just the part here.</v>

883
00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:48.640
<v 0>So I cleaned the butters.
This you told me if I'm wrong,
the bus is that Venus?</v>

884
00:59:48.790 --> 00:59:50.350
She's a sister after.
All right.

885
00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:54.340
So Venus knows that Serena's backhand has improved,

886
00:59:55.180 --> 00:59:57.370
so Venus is going to hit it.

887
00:59:57.430 --> 01:00:02.250
Just arenas left less often than before.
Is that right?

888
01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:06.000
Since Serena's backhand is improved,

889
01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:10.860
Venus is going to hit it to three in his backhand less often than before.

890
01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:15.640
And that might make Serena less inclined to cheat towards her backhand because

891
01:00:15.641 --> 01:00:18.660
the ball is coming that way less often.
All right,

892
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:22.350
so this is a indirect or a strategic effect.

893
01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:25.350
The strategic effects,

894
01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:31.740
the strategic effects is Venus hits owl less often.

895
01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:41.370
So Serina

896
01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:49.580
should reduce the number of times that she leans to the left because the ball's

897
01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:51.930
coming in that way a few fewer times.

898
01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:57.210
Now notice that these two effects going opposite directions.

899
01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:02.030
That right?
All right.
One of them tends to argue that Q would go up.

900
01:01:02.031 --> 01:01:06.170
That's the director of facts.
And the other one is more subtle.
It says,

901
01:01:06.171 --> 01:01:09.320
we now think about not just how my players improved,

902
01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:12.450
but also how the other person's going to respond to.

903
01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:15.710
It's a knowing that my players improves as the more subtle effects.

904
01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:20.530
And that's going to push queue down.
That's gonna make it less lately.
Uh,

905
01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:24.540
argue against leaning to the left.
All right,

906
01:01:24.541 --> 01:01:26.820
so imagine you're going to be Serena's coach.

907
01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:29.760
Which of these effects do you think is going to want to have a poll?

908
01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:33.780
Which of these effects you think's gonna win the direct effects or the indirect

909
01:01:33.781 --> 01:01:36.880
rate?
The direct effect of the strategic effects.
Who thinks?
Who is,

910
01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:38.340
who thinks the direct effect?
Who thinks?

911
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:43.260
Who would advise Serena to play to her strength a bit more and lean left a bit

912
01:01:43.261 --> 01:01:46.050
more?
Who thinks the director facts?
Raise your hands.
That type of pole

913
01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:50.520
and who thinks the indirect effect?
The effect of Serena head.

914
01:01:50.521 --> 01:01:54.720
It gets that way less often.
It's going to win.
And who's abstaining?

915
01:01:54.721 --> 01:01:57.420
And basically refusing to be a coach.
Okay,
great number of you.
All right.

916
01:01:57.900 --> 01:02:00.180
All right,
well we're going to find out.
We're going to find out.

917
01:02:02.050 --> 01:02:02.370
<v 2>Okay.</v>

918
01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:04.660
<v 0>Without,
by resolving</v>

919
01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.630
for the Nash Equilibrium

920
01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:18.220
we're going to do is redo the calculation we did before starting

921
01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:22.163
with Serena.

922
01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:27.470
So to find Serena's mix to find Serena's new equilibrium mix.

923
01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:29.330
What do we have to do,
right?
Wait,
wait.

924
01:02:29.331 --> 01:02:33.620
The question is in equilibrium is through either going to going to lean to the

925
01:02:33.621 --> 01:02:37.280
left more so cute is going to go.
Got up or less accustom to go down.

926
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:41.570
So I need to find out what is Serena's new equilibrium mix.
What's the new queue?

927
01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:45.620
How do I go about finding Serena's equilibrium queue?
What's the trick here?

928
01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:47.390
Shout it out.
One,
two,
three.
What's the

929
01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:53.480
use VTCs payoffs,
right?
To find,
to find,

930
01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.290
<v 2>okay.</v>

931
01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:57.360
<v 0>To find the new Hugh</v>

932
01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:04.980
for Serena use.
Venuses

933
01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:11.970
payoffs I.
Let's do that.
So from Venus,

934
01:03:11.971 --> 01:03:15.410
his point of view,
if she chooses left,

935
01:03:15.980 --> 01:03:20.480
then her pay offs are now,
and again I should use the pointer

936
01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:26.490
thirsty with problems.
The Queue,

937
01:03:26.491 --> 01:03:30.730
this is the new Q and Athe with problems you one minus Q

938
01:03:33.250 --> 01:03:38.250
thirsty but property Q plus 81 minus Q.

939
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:43.480
Again,
this is the new Q.

940
01:03:43.481 --> 01:03:46.180
I should really give it actually called Q prime or something.
What I work

941
01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:49.780
and if she chooses rights

942
01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:56.230
then her pay off is what
it's going to be.

943
01:03:57.450 --> 01:03:59.700
90 with provosts,

944
01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:04.030
Dq and 20 with property.
One minus Q

945
01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:12.210
90 with probably the Q and 20 was privacy one minus Q.

946
01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:16.210
And what do we know about these two pay offs?

947
01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:20.150
If Venus is mixing an equilibrium and we know she's mixing any Gremlins,

948
01:04:20.151 --> 01:04:22.380
which as we saw there was no pure strategy color room.

949
01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:25.170
So what do we know about these two payoffs?

950
01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:27.810
Since Venus is using both the strategies and equilibrium,

951
01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.980
they must be the same as,
and she's using both of these strategies.

952
01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:35.310
These strategies must be equally good.
They must both be best responses.

953
01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:40.730
So these two payoffs are equal since they're equal.

954
01:04:40.890 --> 01:04:43.620
All I have to do is solve out for cues.
So let's do it.

955
01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:49.040
So I'm going to guess 90 minus 30 is 60 queue is equal to 80 minus 20 which is

956
01:04:54.370 --> 01:04:58.870
61 minus Q.
So Q equals

957
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:06.170
0.5
all right.
So then if I,
if I,
if I did the Algebra you quickpay,

958
01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:09.880
just trust me,
I think.
I think I got it right.
Right from here on it.

959
01:05:09.881 --> 01:05:14.240
And it was just an Algebra.
All right,
so what am I found out?

960
01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:18.190
Did Q go apple go down?
What?

961
01:05:18.191 --> 01:05:23.191
It used to be Q used to be 1.6 and now it's 0.5 let me ask what I think is an

962
01:05:24.911 --> 01:05:28.750
easy question.
Did it go up or down?
It went down.
It went down,

963
01:05:28.751 --> 01:05:33.700
right then it went down,
right?
Queue went down,

964
01:05:33.701 --> 01:05:37.450
the equilibrium queue went down.
All right,

965
01:05:37.451 --> 01:05:39.160
so which affects turned out to be bigger?

966
01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:44.690
The direct effects of playing more to your strength or the indirect effect I've

967
01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:48.540
taken to account that your opponent is going to play less often to your springs,

968
01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:52.570
which affect turned out to be the bigger effect.
The indirect,
right?

969
01:05:52.571 --> 01:05:54.550
The strategic effects.
Of course,
I rigged it.

970
01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:57.940
I want the strategic be bigger because this is a course about strategy,
right?

971
01:05:58.210 --> 01:06:01.440
All right.
All right,
but the strategic effects actually want to hear,

972
01:06:02.820 --> 01:06:03.590
<v 2>okay.</v>

973
01:06:03.590 --> 01:06:06.710
<v 0>The streets are strategic.
In fact,
the indirect effect is bigger.</v>

974
01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:11.870
All right.

975
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:16.130
That's good news for me because it says the slightly dumb coach who didn't

976
01:06:16.131 --> 01:06:19.910
bother to take game theory would have stopped at this director of facts and they

977
01:06:19.911 --> 01:06:21.680
did told Serena to go the wrong way,

978
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:25.460
but the smart coach who takes my class and therefore somehow contributes to my

979
01:06:25.461 --> 01:06:28.640
salary and an extraordinary indirect way gets it.
Right.

980
01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.473
<v 2>All right.</v>

981
01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:36.900
<v 0>All right.
The strategic bigger now we can also solve out for Venus is new mix,</v>

982
01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:40.440
but I am.
I will do it in a second,
but before I do it,

983
01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.290
let me just point out that we actually can,

984
01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:46.220
we really can now intuit Venus is a effect.

985
01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.810
Maybe not the exact numbers,
but we can intuit it.

986
01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:51.780
I claim I claim if we think this through carefully,

987
01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:56.990
we know whether Venus is shooting more to the left when she was before or more

988
01:06:57.631 --> 01:07:00.510
or less to the left than she was before.
All right?

989
01:07:00.511 --> 01:07:02.310
Notice that in the new equilibrium,

990
01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:07.640
Cirina is going less often to her left even though she's better at hitting the

991
01:07:08.791 --> 01:07:11.190
backhand is better at hitting the ball when she gets back.

992
01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:15.600
So since Serena is leaning left less often,

993
01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:18.510
what must be true about Venus and this new equilibrium?

994
01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:23.340
It must be the case that Venus is hitting the ball to the left last offer.

995
01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.290
All right,
that makes that,
that,
that,
that makes sense.
We kind of,

996
01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:28.560
we have enough information already on the board.
Tell us that.
Nevertheless,

997
01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:32.190
let's do the math.
Let's do the math.
So,
um

998
01:07:33.530 --> 01:07:35.350
<v 2>hmm.
All right,</v>

999
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.510
<v 0>let's go and retrieve a board.</v>

1000
01:07:51.140 --> 01:07:55.460
Just the completeness.
Let's figure out exactly what Venus does do.

1001
01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:09.080
All right,
so to figure out what Venus is going to do,
what's our trick?

1002
01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.250
I want to figure out how this is going to mix.

1003
01:08:11.251 --> 01:08:14.250
I'm going to find out Venus is new.
P,

1004
01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.240
how do I out Venus is new equilibrium mix.

1005
01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:21.440
I look at Serena's payoffs.
Alright,

1006
01:08:21.770 --> 01:08:26.640
so if Serina chooses left,
her pay off is,

1007
01:08:26.641 --> 01:08:31.641
and I'll read off quickly this time is 70 p plus s hen one minus p.

1008
01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.020
And if Serena chooses,
writes,

1009
01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:44.320
her pay off is 20 p plus 81 minus p.

1010
01:08:46.641 --> 01:08:49.790
And I'm just praying that the ta is going to catch me if I make a mistake here.

1011
01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:55.270
And I know these have to be equal because I know that in fact Venus is mixing,

1012
01:08:56.250 --> 01:09:01.220
uh,
sorry.
I know that Serena is mixing.
All right,
so I know these must be equal.

1013
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:02.600
So since they're equal,

1014
01:09:02.601 --> 01:09:06.590
I can solve a out and hope that I've got this right.

1015
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:12.100
So I've got 50 p equals 71 minus P,

1016
01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:21.400
so p is equal to a seven 12th so again,

1017
01:09:24.141 --> 01:09:28.280
that's just Algebra.
I rushed in Tibet,
it's just Algebra.
Same idea,
just Algebra.

1018
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:33.500
So seven 12th is indeed smaller than what it used to be because it used to be a

1019
01:09:33.501 --> 01:09:36.950
seven tenths.
All right?
So that confirms our result.

1020
01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:40.293
Okay.

1021
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:42.630
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1022
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:46.240
<v 0>So the strategic effect dominated Venus shot,</v>

1023
01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:50.910
does arenas backhand the less often and as a consequence so much,

1024
01:09:50.911 --> 01:09:51.291
so much.

1025
01:09:51.291 --> 01:09:56.291
It's so that's Terina actually found it worthwhile going more to the right than

1026
01:09:56.401 --> 01:09:59.070
she used to before.
All right.

1027
01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:01.710
Now let's just talk this through one more time.

1028
01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.610
This was a comparative statics exercise.
We looked at a game,

1029
01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.830
we found an equilibrium,

1030
01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.390
we change something fundamental about the game and we looked again to look at

1031
01:10:12.391 --> 01:10:15.810
the new equilibrium that's called comparative statics.

1032
01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:20.640
And let's talk through the intuition before we made any changes.

1033
01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:25.380
Venus was indifference right before maybe it changes.

1034
01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:26.700
Venus was indifferent,

1035
01:10:27.150 --> 01:10:31.200
she was indifferent between shooting to the left and shooting to the rice,

1036
01:10:32.730 --> 01:10:37.730
then we improved Cirina his ability to hit the volatile her left or even

1037
01:10:39.381 --> 01:10:41.190
improved her backhand volley.

1038
01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:46.980
If we had not changed the way Serina played,

1039
01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:49.610
if we'd not changed the way arena played,

1040
01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:53.850
then what would Venus have done?
Just oppose.
In fact,

1041
01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.270
Serena's Q had not changed.

1042
01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:00.990
If Serena Q had not changed Roman,

1043
01:11:00.991 --> 01:11:04.770
that Venus was indifferent before,
how would Venus or changed her play?

1044
01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:10.350
[inaudible].

1045
01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:15.350
So if we started from the old cue and then we improve Serena's ability to pay

1046
01:11:15.571 --> 01:11:20.190
the backhand belt volley.
And if Q didn't change,
what would Venus had done?

1047
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:24.510
She never ever shopped with afternoon more.
She'd only have shot to the right.

1048
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:29.850
Only a shock to the rights,
which can't possibly be in equilibrium.

1049
01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:35.510
So something about Serena's play has to bring Venus back into equilibrium and

1050
01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:40.200
mess.
It brings Venus back into being indifference.
And what was it?

1051
01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:44.100
It was Serina,
uh,
moving,
uh,
to the,

1052
01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:48.030
to the left less often and moving to the,
to the right more often.

1053
01:11:49.450 --> 01:11:54.210
All right.
Say again.
If we didn't change cue,
Venus would only go to the rights.

1054
01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:56.250
So we need to reduce queue,

1055
01:11:56.310 --> 01:12:00.870
have Serina go to the right to bring Venus back into equilibrium.
Matt.

1056
01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:04.830
And conversely,
if Venus hadn't changed her behavior,

1057
01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:09.210
if Venus had gone on shooting exactly the same as she was p and one minus p s

1058
01:12:09.211 --> 01:12:12.540
before then,
Serena would have only gone to the left.

1059
01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.310
And that can't be an equilibrium.

1060
01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:17.970
So it must be something about Venus is play brings Serena back into equilibrium.

1061
01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:22.290
And what is it?
It's that Venus start shooting to the rights more often.

1062
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:27.780
All right,
so does two reminders to,
are you leave two reminders?
Wait,
wait,
wait,

1063
01:12:27.781 --> 01:12:30.990
wait.
First.
In about five minutes' time,

1064
01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:35.490
a handout will magically appear on the web websites that goes through these

1065
01:12:35.491 --> 01:12:39.420
arguments.
Again,
all of them in two other games.

1066
01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.880
So you can have a look at the handout.
Second thing,

1067
01:12:42.090 --> 01:12:46.050
a problem sites has already appeared by magic on that website that gives you

1068
01:12:46.051 --> 01:12:49.200
lots of examples like this to work on.
All right.

1069
01:12:49.201 --> 01:12:51.750
Play tennis over the weekend for practice and we'll see you on Monday.
