1
00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:01.761
All right,

2
00:00:01.761 --> 00:00:06.350
so last time we did something I think substantially harder than anything we've

3
00:00:06.351 --> 00:00:07.850
done in the class.
So far.

4
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.090
We looked at mixed strategies and in particular we looked at mixed strategy

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.230
equilibrium,
right?

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.280
And there was a big idea last time.

7
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.460
The big idea was if a player is playing a mixed strategy equilibrium,

8
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.420
then every pure strategy in the mix,

9
00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:34.250
that's to say every pure strategy on which they placed in positive weights must

10
00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.550
also be a best response to what the other side is doing.

11
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.890
And then we use that trick.

12
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.210
We used it in this game here to help us find Nash Equilibria.

13
00:00:44.211 --> 00:00:47.690
And the way we helped it,
the way it allowed us to find nasty but I bra is,

14
00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:52.691
we knew that if in this case Venus Williams is mixing between left and right,

15
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.910
it must be this case that our payoff is equal to that of rights.

16
00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.150
And we use that to find Serenas mix.
And conversely,

17
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.680
since we knew that Serena is mixing,
but Ken Between Little Alan Liddle,
ah,

18
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.510
we knew she must be in different between little Allen at La and we use that to

19
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:11.750
find Venus is mixed.

20
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.860
So I want to get back to this example just for a few moments just to make one

21
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:17.660
more point and then we'll move on.

22
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.570
But we'll still be talking about mixed strategies throughout today.

23
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.170
So this was the mix that we've found before we changed the payoffs.

24
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.560
We found that Venus's equilibrium mix was 0.7 0.3 and three is equilibrium mix

25
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.200
was 0.64 and a reasonable question at this point would be how do we know that's

26
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:41.990
really an equilibrium,
right?

27
00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:44.510
We kind of found it but we didn't kind of go back and check.

28
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.830
So I want to do now is actually do that missing step.
We rushed it at last time.

29
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:51.830
Just want to get thrown out of material.
Let's actually check that.

30
00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:56.390
In fact p star is a best response to Q star.

31
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.070
So what I want to do is I want to check
that Venus is,

32
00:02:01.071 --> 00:02:06.071
makes peace star is a best response for Venus against Serena's makes Qstar and

33
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.260
the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to look at payoffs that Venus gets.

34
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.230
Now she knows she's right.
Now we know she's playing against Q star.
All right,

35
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.520
so let's look at Venus is pay offs.
I'm going to figure out how,

36
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:26.690
how payoffs for al her payoffs for our,

37
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.410
I'd also her pay off what she's actually doing.
P Star.
All right,

38
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.440
so Venus is payoffs.

39
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.140
If she chooses l against Q star,

40
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.980
then she gets stolen.
It's what we had on the board last week.

41
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:47.700
But now I'm going to put in what Q star is explicitly.
She gets 50 times.

42
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:48.720
Point six

43
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.470
is Q star and this is one minus Q star.

44
00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.560
She just gets 50 times 0.6 and AC times one minus 0.6 which is 0.4 AC times 0.4.

45
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.550
All right,
and we can work this out and I worked it out at home,

46
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.050
but if somebody has a calculator that can please check me.
Uh,

47
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.430
I think this comes to 0.62.
All right,
I'm going to just check that.

48
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.120
All right.

49
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.380
And if Venus chose right when they're right here means shooting to Serenas right

50
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:31.660
to Serena's forehand.
If she chose rights,

51
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.050
then her pay offs are 90 queue starts and 90.6 plus 21 minus Q starts at 20.4

52
00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.140
so 98.6 plus 20.4 and again,

53
00:03:51.511 --> 00:03:56.511
I worked that out at home and fortunately that also comes out at 0.62.

54
00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.130
All right,
so what's Venus is pay off the piece star.

55
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.670
We've got high payoff for both our PR strategies.

56
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.590
So her pay off from actually choosing peace dollar is what?
Well,

57
00:04:14.591 --> 00:04:19.591
p Star is 0.7 so 0.7 of the time she would actually be playing left and when she

58
00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:23.710
plays left,

59
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.570
she'll get a pay off of 0.62 and

60
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.420
three of the time,

61
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.930
0.3 of the time she'll be playing,
right.
And once again she'll get,

62
00:04:39.931 --> 00:04:43.850
you can't get paid off of 0.62 and do I have a calculator?

63
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.010
Yes.
Sorry.
Thank you.
So ps p star is 0.7 I'm,
yes,
you're actually right.

64
00:04:53.011 --> 00:04:56.620
So this is p Star and one minus P.
Stop.
All right,
so let's,
let's,

65
00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.510
let's make that clearer.

66
00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.590
I sure what the equilibrium is but p stone itself is point stuff.
Thank you.

67
00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.470
All right,
so in vias plays,

68
00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:09.471
plays left with property 0.7 that 0.7 the time she'll get an expected payoff of

69
00:05:09.841 --> 00:05:14.841
0.62 and 0.3 of the time she'll get them to pay off again a 0.62 and that's the

70
00:05:15.601 --> 00:05:17.070
kind of math I don't have to do at home.

71
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.180
That's going to come out at 0.62 again,

72
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:23.360
assuming my math is correct.
All right,

73
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.640
it's all I've really done here is confirm what we did early last time.

74
00:05:26.641 --> 00:05:31.641
We knew that we in fact shows Serena's mix queue to make Venus in difference

75
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.370
between left and right.
And that's exactly what we found here.

76
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.670
Getting going laugh gets points 0.6 to go going right,

77
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.350
it gets a 0.62 and hence piece star gets 0.62 but I claim we can now see

78
00:05:46.351 --> 00:05:48.180
something a little bit a little bit else.

79
00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.710
We can now ask the question is p Star?
In fact,
our best response,

80
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.060
while for it not to be a best response for this not to be an equilibrium,

81
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.120
there would have to be some deviation that Venus could make that would make us

82
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:06.560
strictly better off.
Let me repeat that.
If this were not an equilibrium,

83
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.220
there would have to be some deviation for Venus that would make her strictly

84
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:15.320
better off.
Right?
By playing p Star,

85
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.380
she's getting a return of 0.62 so one thing she could deviate too is playing

86
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:25.550
left all the time.
If she deviates to playing left all the time,

87
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:30.910
her pay office still 0.62 so she's not strictly better off.

88
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.880
That's not a strictly profitable deviation,
right?

89
00:06:34.881 --> 00:06:38.960
Another thing she could deviate too,
if she could deviate to playing rights.

90
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:40.670
If you deviate to playing,

91
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:44.930
writes her pay off will be 0.62 once again,

92
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:48.290
she's not strictly better off just the same as she was before.

93
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.550
So that's not a stripy profitable deviation.
All right,

94
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:53.990
so what have I shown so far?

95
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.080
I've shown that piece star is as good as playing left and p stars as good as

96
00:06:59.871 --> 00:07:01.700
paying right about now.
That's how he constructed it.

97
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.210
So deviating to left is not a strictly profitable deviation and deviating to

98
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:11.060
rights.
It's not a strictly proper profitable deviation.

99
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.020
But at this point somebody might ask him,
say,
okay,

100
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.080
you shown me that there's no way to deviate to a pure strategy in a strictly

101
00:07:21.141 --> 00:07:21.980
profitable way.

102
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.720
But how about deviating to another mixed strategy?

103
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.430
All right,
so we're so far we've shown,
we've shown just to up here,

104
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.300
we can see that Venus has no strictly profitable

105
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.600
pure strategy deviation.

106
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.620
<v 1>Your strategy
deviation.</v>

107
00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.400
<v 0>She has no strict portables,
pure strategy creation,</v>

108
00:08:02.401 --> 00:08:06.870
cause each of our PR strategies yield the same payoff as did her piece of meat

109
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.400
mixed rap sheet.
Uh,
you have the same as p Star,

110
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:17.120
but how do we know that she doesn't have a mixed strategy that would be strictly

111
00:08:17.281 --> 00:08:18.114
batter?

112
00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:23.350
<v 1>How do we know that?
Anybody,
how do we know that?</v>

113
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.550
No,

114
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.530
<v 0>no,
no.
Hands going.
Oh,
it was,
it was a hand up.
Good.</v>

115
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:32.531
Good mix between left and right will still yield 0.62 good,

116
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.570
good.
So any mix,

117
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.720
any mixed venous deviates too will be a mix between left and right and any mix

118
00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:46.721
between left and rights will be a mix between points six to 1.62 and hence will

119
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:50.600
yield 0.62 all right,
so we're going to use,

120
00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:53.300
again this fact we developed last week.

121
00:08:53.301 --> 00:08:58.301
The fact we developed last week was that any mixed strategy yields a payoff.

122
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.570
That is a weighted average of the pure strategy pay offs.

123
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.820
The payoff to the pure strategies in the mix,

124
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:10.980
any mix strategy yields a payoff that is a weighted average of the payoff to the

125
00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:14.460
pure straps in the mix.
That was our key fact last week.
So here,

126
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:19.470
if we've shown that there's no pure strategy deviation that's strictly

127
00:09:19.471 --> 00:09:20.304
profitable,

128
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.640
then the con be any mixed strategy deviation that stripey profitable.

129
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:31.020
Why?
Because the mixed strategy variations must yield pay offs that lie among the

130
00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:35.910
pure strategy deviations.
Right?
So this is a great fact for us.

131
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.050
What does it,
what's the lesson here?
The lesson is

132
00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.780
we only ever have to check

133
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.610
for strictly profitable

134
00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.450
pure strategy

135
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.060
<v 1>deviations.</v>

136
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.150
<v 0>That's a good job.
Why?
Because if we had to check for mixed strategy,</v>

137
00:10:16.151 --> 00:10:17.770
deviation is one by one,

138
00:10:17.771 --> 00:10:20.170
we'd be here all night because there's an infinite number of possible mixed

139
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.880
traffic deviations.
All right,

140
00:10:21.881 --> 00:10:23.770
but the ultimately pure strategy do you guys do you have to check it.

141
00:10:23.771 --> 00:10:25.090
It's just repeat the idea.

142
00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:30.330
Suppose suppose that isn't any pure strategy vacation that's profitable.

143
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.500
Then the Colby,

144
00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:36.910
any mixed strategy deviation that's profitable because the met the highest,

145
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:41.770
the highest expected return you could ever get from a mixed strategy is one of

146
00:10:41.771 --> 00:10:44.020
the pure scratches in the mix and you've already checked that none of those are

147
00:10:44.021 --> 00:10:47.710
profitable.
All right,
so this simple idea,

148
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:52.300
it's an idea we developed last time.
Not only helps us to find Nash Equilibria,

149
00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.130
but also to check for Nash Equilibrium.
All right?

150
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:03.090
Now a lot of people I gathered from feedback from sections were left pretty

151
00:11:03.341 --> 00:11:06.100
confused last time.
It's a hard idea.
Actually.

152
00:11:06.101 --> 00:11:09.980
I looked at the tape over the weekend,
you know,
I can see it.

153
00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:11.740
I could see where it can be confusing,

154
00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:13.810
but it's actually I think what's really confusing.

155
00:11:13.811 --> 00:11:15.310
Hey it wasn't so much I think this,

156
00:11:15.311 --> 00:11:18.100
no it wasn't too much that I could have been clearer.
I'm sure I could have been.

157
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.060
It's this is really a hard idea,
this idea of make strategies.

158
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.010
So we're going to work on it again today,

159
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.460
but I think one of the ideas that gets people confused,
it's the following idea.

160
00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.990
They say,
look,
we found venuses equilibrium mix,

161
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:37.140
my choosing a p and one minus P to make Serena and different and we found

162
00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:42.480
Serena's equilibrium makes by finding a Q and a one minus Q like Venus and

163
00:11:42.861 --> 00:11:43.450
difference.

164
00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:48.450
And a natural question you hit people ask then is why is Venus quotes trying to

165
00:11:48.581 --> 00:11:53.581
make Serena in difference and why is Serena quote trying to Venus and different

166
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.920
and that's not really the point here.

167
00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.640
It isn't that Venus is trying to make Serena and difference.

168
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.870
It's that in equilibrium she is going to make 300 different actions.

169
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.800
It doesn't have goal in life to make Serena and different between left and
right.

170
00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.950
And it isn't Serena's goal in life to make Venus and different between left and

171
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:15.970
right.
But in equilibrium it ends up that they make each other in different.

172
00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:17.580
Alright.

173
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:22.120
And the way that we can see that is that if Venus puts something you said last

174
00:12:22.121 --> 00:12:25.650
time,
it's repeated.
If Venus puts too much weights,

175
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:30.460
more than 0.7 on the left,
on left,
then Serena,
Serena,

176
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.640
just chiefs to left all the time.
And that can't possibly be an equal number.

177
00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.030
And if Venus puts too much weight on right,

178
00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.810
then Serena cheats to the right all the time.
And that can't be an equilibrium.

179
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:45.180
So it has to be that what Venus is doing is going to make story.
No,
exactly.

180
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.870
And different and vice versa.

181
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:48.300
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

182
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.690
<v 0>All right.
Now let's see that idea in some other applications.</v>

183
00:12:52.691 --> 00:12:56.110
Just talk about this a bit before we move on.
All right,

184
00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:01.290
so it turns out that some very natural applications for mixed strategy,

185
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:05.680
whatever.
Yeah.
Or rise in Games and sports.
All right.

186
00:13:05.681 --> 00:13:08.120
So let's talk about a few now.
Ah,
can I,
yeah.

187
00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.880
Can anybody suggest some other places where we see randomisation or it's mixed

188
00:13:12.881 --> 00:13:16.030
strategy?
End Equilibria in sporting events.

189
00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.240
<v 1>Okay.</v>

190
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.620
<v 0>Let me,
let me actually grab the mic myself.
So come out of it.
Anybody?</v>

191
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.570
Anybody here?
Uh,
and I know we hit anybody here to play football.
For example.

192
00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.270
I'm going to fucking American football now.
Gridiron game.
Not,

193
00:13:30.271 --> 00:13:33.810
not the civilized vapor,
right?
I don't play it.
Yes.
Just don't you play football,

194
00:13:33.811 --> 00:13:38.760
right?
So,
so where is the mixing?
Where's the mixing involved in playing football?

195
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.240
Where an equilibrium where we expect to see mixed strategies.
Yeah.

196
00:13:42.241 --> 00:13:47.010
There's somebody down that be come and get them.
All right.
So shout it out.

197
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.300
Running game and passing game.
All right.
The running game in the passing game,

198
00:13:51.301 --> 00:13:51.451
right?

199
00:13:51.451 --> 00:13:56.451
So very simple idea whether to run or whether the past when you have the ball is

200
00:13:57.091 --> 00:13:59.730
likely to end up as a mixed strategy equilibrium.

201
00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:03.330
The defense is also randomizing between,
for example,

202
00:14:03.331 --> 00:14:06.450
rushing the pasta or playing a run defense.
That right.

203
00:14:06.451 --> 00:14:07.890
This is not exactly a game.
I know a lot about it,

204
00:14:07.891 --> 00:14:10.800
but I'm hoping I'm getting close enough here.
Right,
right.

205
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.040
It couldn't possibly be a pure strategy equilibrium,
right?

206
00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:17.610
Other than very extreme parts of the game,
like at the end of the game perhaps.

207
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:19.020
But for most of the game,

208
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:22.330
it's very unlikely to end up as a pure strategy equilibrium.

209
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.790
Much more likely that the office is mixing between passing and running.

210
00:14:26.791 --> 00:14:28.670
And for that matter,
between going into the left,

211
00:14:28.671 --> 00:14:30.930
going to the right and going to the center.
And uh,

212
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:35.490
the defense is awesome mixing between,
uh,
over it's types of defense.

213
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:39.480
All right?
So we see that those people who are watching guests today,

214
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:44.310
we see that in football games.
All right,
why don't we see it in sport?

215
00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.253
So other sports,

216
00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.930
I can't have a room full of non sports fans.

217
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:53.750
How many of you ever watch any sport?
It's let's raise raising hands here.

218
00:14:54.950 --> 00:14:58.430
All right.
Some of you do.
Some of you do.
All right,
so this is,

219
00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.040
this is baseball playoff season,
right?
Right.

220
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:03.020
How many of you been watching the baseball playoffs?

221
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:06.260
Raise your hands and watching the baseball past.
Can we,
I,
I'll let you off.

222
00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:07.370
And I knew she'd been doing my homework.

223
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:08.840
How many of you were watching the playoffs and sped,

224
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.840
how many watch the Yankees game last night,
right?
Quite a few of you.
All right.

225
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:14.760
All right.
So there hadn't been very exciting yet,

226
00:15:14.761 --> 00:15:17.960
but we hope against gonna get more exciting.
Right?
So what is,

227
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.770
what do you do when you're watching baseball?

228
00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:24.270
What kind of things do you see where you just know that the must be mixed

229
00:15:24.271 --> 00:15:26.860
strategies involved in must be randomisation involved.

230
00:15:26.861 --> 00:15:28.080
Now I've got a few more hands on.
Good.

231
00:15:28.081 --> 00:15:31.980
So you start choosing how to pitch the ball,
choosing how to pitch the book,

232
00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:33.760
Go and enlarge a little bit more.
So,

233
00:15:33.761 --> 00:15:38.610
but more fast ball versus slider versus change up all sorts of,
all right,

234
00:15:38.611 --> 00:15:41.640
so there's different ways of throwing the ball.
All right?

235
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:45.990
And there's going to be randomization from the picture or this doesn't look like

236
00:15:45.991 --> 00:15:47.050
there's randomization,
uh,

237
00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:52.250
by the pitcher over whether to throw a fastball or a curve ball or whatever.

238
00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.170
How has the hitter randomizing that?

239
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:55.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

240
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:58.720
<v 0>How's the hit of randomizing?
Cause it hit her.
Randomizing it.
Oh,</v>

241
00:15:58.721 --> 00:16:00.280
what's the head of doing?
What?
While this is going on?

242
00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.480
<v 1>Anybody?
Yeah.</v>

243
00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:08.210
<v 0>He's choosing whether to swing or not to swing.
Oh,
he's okay.</v>

244
00:16:08.211 --> 00:16:10.190
He's choosing what to swing or not to swing or they'll put it on what you can do

245
00:16:10.191 --> 00:16:12.320
that just after the ball thrown.
Right.

246
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:15.770
So you sometimes hear the commentators say that that guy that hit her was

247
00:16:15.771 --> 00:16:19.010
looking for a fast balls.
That right.
We're looking for a curve ball.

248
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.070
That hit is trying to anticipate the pitch.
Is that right?

249
00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.740
There's not a game I played a lot of either.
I'd be a little bit right.

250
00:16:24.741 --> 00:16:26.810
Your financial and you're trying to anticipate where the ball is going to be

251
00:16:26.811 --> 00:16:27.644
thrown.

252
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:28.743
<v 1>Okay,</v>

253
00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:33.960
<v 0>so the type of bullying throw in baseball and the way in which the,
the,
the,</v>

254
00:16:33.961 --> 00:16:36.900
the pitch being anticipated by the header is lightly.
We make strategy.

255
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.880
What else is likely to be mix strategy in baseball?

256
00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.463
<v 1>What else?</v>

257
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.930
<v 0>Anybody here on the Yale baseball team.
Ah,
okay.
Okay.
I've got one.</v>

258
00:16:47.931 --> 00:16:51.440
I've got one volunteer here.
All right.
All right.
All right,
so what else?

259
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:55.250
I mean a stand up a second that says let's have a baseball team member.

260
00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.720
All right.
All right.
What's your name and where do you play your picture?
Okay.

261
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.180
He's not gonna give them based on notes he's looking at,
I'm going to ask this.

262
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.260
Suppose you did get on base,
which is or no,
we've got an amazing,
I dunno.

263
00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.220
Let's assume that's the thing that happened is right,
right.
Well,

264
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.920
what might you ran into mind that you're standing on base.

265
00:17:12.921 --> 00:17:16.290
What might you randomize about whether the steal second or not right where the

266
00:17:16.291 --> 00:17:18.280
just steal them or whether they're trying to steal them on it.

267
00:17:18.281 --> 00:17:20.660
It's to have a second.
Second.
All right,
so the decision,

268
00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:25.430
what is trying to steal a nod is,
is likely to end up being random.
Right?

269
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.160
And if you're the picture,
if you're the picture,

270
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.200
what can you do in response to that?
But here's a picture,
right?

271
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:31.310
What can you do in response to that?

272
00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.580
Either choose to try to pick them off or not.
All right,
what else can,

273
00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.850
the one thing you can try and pick them off with us to be quicker and quicker to

274
00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:40.760
the plate?
What else you can pitch out.
What else?

275
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.823
<v 1>Hm.</v>

276
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.780
<v 0>At least those three things.
Right?
And these,
those three things.
Okay.
Okay.</v>

277
00:17:45.781 --> 00:17:49.050
Thank you.
Thank you.
All right.
Hey,
I have an expert here.
I'm bad.
I had an expert.

278
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.030
All right.
So in this case,
in this case,

279
00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:54.990
we can see there's randomisation going on from the,
from the run I,
whether he,

280
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.870
whether he attempts to steal the base or not,

281
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.750
and by the picture or whether he throws the pitch out or whether he tries to

282
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.210
throw it to get to the plate faster.
All right.
Okay.

283
00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.270
So we see this in sport,

284
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:13.020
we don't see it well anticipated by sports commentators.
I mean,

285
00:18:13.021 --> 00:18:17.040
give this put down a second.
So in baseball for example,
you'll sometimes,

286
00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:22.041
he seemed quite sophisticated statistical analyses of baseball in which somebody

287
00:18:22.861 --> 00:18:26.400
will have looked at base stealers,
are across the majorly use,

288
00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:31.170
and they'll look at all the instances in which a player was on first base and

289
00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.590
having in a position where you think they might steal and a look at what

290
00:18:34.591 --> 00:18:36.420
happened on every attempt to steal,

291
00:18:36.421 --> 00:18:38.920
whether they were in fact caught stealing or not.
All right?

292
00:18:38.921 --> 00:18:40.980
And they'll try and measure the value of these things.

293
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.830
And you'll see the conclusion not come to something like this.

294
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:48.950
They'll conclude that whether the guy stolen or whether the guy has attempted to

295
00:18:49.261 --> 00:18:50.220
steal an op,
sorry,

296
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.820
or whether just sat in first base doesn't seem to make much difference.

297
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:58.160
I'll say I was,
I think the payoff for it,
for you,
for even great base.

298
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.050
There's I've attempting to steal or not.
All right.

299
00:19:01.051 --> 00:19:04.890
When you take into account the pickoffs,
uh,
versus just staying put,

300
00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:09.150
turns out the payoff in terms of the impact on the game is Rafa equal.

301
00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:10.351
And then they'll draw that.

302
00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:13.890
These analysts will then draw the following conclusion.
They'll say,
oh,
look,

303
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:18.150
speedo,
the ability to steal basis is therefore overrated in baseball.

304
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.150
How have they made a mistake?
What's the mistake?
They made that,

305
00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.810
all right.
So the premise was,
let's give them the premise.

306
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:31.380
The premise was that when a base stealer is attempting to steal at art,

307
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.970
the expected return in terms of outcome of the game is roughly equal.

308
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Whether they attempt to steal or don't attempt to steal the conclusion is

309
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.290
therefore,
stealing doesn't seem such a big deal.
What's the mistake they've made?

310
00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.640
Yeah.
Let me borrow it again.
Sorry.
Yeah.

311
00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:51.691
Hit your hat.

312
00:19:51.691 --> 00:19:55.380
And the pitcher has to react differently and pitching when he knows that there's

313
00:19:55.381 --> 00:19:58.810
a fast guy on.
Good.
Good.
So I'll pitch a has to rectify.

314
00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:00.630
It's talked about petro again,
right?

315
00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:04.490
So one thing got picture stayed was he wants to get to the plate faster,
right?

316
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:06.510
Right.
What does that mean?
Getting to the pipe foster,

317
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.180
let's just means just shout it out.
People going,
hey,

318
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.450
you getting the ball to the catcher as fast as possible so that he has the best

319
00:20:12.451 --> 00:20:14.800
chance to throw out the runner.
Right,
right.
So you're gonna,

320
00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.120
you're gonna pitch from what's,
you're not gonna do that funny wound up thing,

321
00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:19.860
right?
You're going to thank you.
Got a pitch from the stretch.

322
00:20:19.861 --> 00:20:23.490
I knew it was a term that some way I'm noting American by hate being here.
Right.

323
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:25.200
And you're more likely to throw a fastball,
right?
There's not,

324
00:20:25.201 --> 00:20:27.450
there's some advantage and throwing a fastball rather than the curve ball.

325
00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:29.370
All right.
Both of what?
Both.

326
00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:34.000
Both actions of which both having to move more towards hospitals and pitching to

327
00:20:34.001 --> 00:20:37.800
the stretch are actually costly.
For the Pitcher,
but we'll get there in a second.

328
00:20:37.801 --> 00:20:39.900
Let's just back up a second so then that was good.
That's right,

329
00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.100
but it just back up a second.

330
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:46.400
The premise of these commentators was what it was that the return to stealing,

331
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:50.080
attempting to steal seems to be roughly a wash.

332
00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:53.170
It seems to me that the expected return when this quite based on our team,

333
00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:57.730
Mr this a base is roughly the same as the return when they don't attempt to

334
00:20:57.731 --> 00:21:01.360
steal a base,
but I claim we knew that was going to be the case.

335
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:02.680
We didn't have to go and look at the data.

336
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.870
Why do we know that was going to be the case?

337
00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.243
<v 1>Gosh,</v>

338
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:10.210
<v 0>how do we know that the,
that you were bound to find a return</v>

339
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.350
in that analysis that finds those things roughly equal.

340
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.940
<v 1>Wow.
Yeah,</v>

341
00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:26.210
<v 0>just do one or the other.
Good.
Good.
Excellent.
Excellent.</v>

342
00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.380
Since we're in a mixed strategy equilibrium,
since she's randomizing,

343
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.270
it must be the case that the returns are equal.
All right.

344
00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.370
I might look for right off the big idea here.
Right with it.

345
00:21:37.371 --> 00:21:38.510
That's the thing we learned last time.

346
00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.780
If this player and he's a professional baseball,
by US doing this,

347
00:21:41.781 --> 00:21:43.040
they've been very well trained.

348
00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:46.760
Lot of money has been spent on getting the tactics right.
All right,
let's,

349
00:21:46.761 --> 00:21:49.970
there's people sitting there who are paid to get the tactics,
right?
Right.

350
00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:54.770
If it was the case that the return to base stealing wasn't roughly equal,

351
00:21:54.771 --> 00:21:58.130
when you attempt to steal or didn't attempt to steal,
right,

352
00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:00.950
then you shouldn't be randomizing.
Since you all are randomizing,

353
00:22:00.951 --> 00:22:03.920
it must be the case that the returns are roughly equal.

354
00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:05.490
<v 1>All right,</v>

355
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.880
<v 0>so that's the first thing to observe and the second thing to observe is what we</v>

356
00:22:08.881 --> 00:22:12.000
just pointed out.
I in fact,
the,
the,

357
00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:17.210
the value of having a fast base speed on the team doesn't show up in the

358
00:22:17.851 --> 00:22:22.440
expected return on the occasions on which he attempts to steal or which he does

359
00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:23.310
not attempt to steal.

360
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:27.960
It shows up where it shows up in the fact that the pitching team changes their

361
00:22:27.961 --> 00:22:32.430
behavior to make it harder for this guy to steal by going faster to the plate or

362
00:22:32.431 --> 00:22:35.520
throwing more fastballs.
And where will that show up on the statistics?

363
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.250
If you're just a statistician like me,
you just look at the data.

364
00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:41.250
Where will that show up?
It's supposed I can't keep track of every single page.

365
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.020
I don't connect to observe all these basketballs.

366
00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:47.940
Well I see the effect of all these extra fastballs and pitching from the stretch

367
00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:48.983
in the data.

368
00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.673
<v 1>Somebody,</v>

369
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:57.020
<v 0>it's going to show up in the batting average of the guy who's hitting behind the</v>

370
00:22:57.021 --> 00:22:57.854
base stealer.

371
00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:03.770
The can I using behind the base dealer is going to have a higher batting average

372
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.270
cause he's going to get more pictures,

373
00:23:05.271 --> 00:23:08.060
which are fast balls to head and more pitches out of the stretch.

374
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.810
If you ignore that effect,
you're going to be in trouble.

375
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.720
But we knew we handle as this properly using gain through,

376
00:23:14.721 --> 00:23:16.520
we know where to make snapchat equilibrium.

377
00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.030
We know in facts the pitching team must be reacting to it.

378
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.800
We know that must be a cost in doing that and the cost turns up in the head or

379
00:23:23.801 --> 00:23:27.970
behind.
So when you're watching the playoffs and the,
and the north node,
no,

380
00:23:27.971 --> 00:23:29.120
now I'm giving you permission to work with,

381
00:23:29.121 --> 00:23:32.030
which were the TV at night after I've done my homework assignments.
All right.

382
00:23:32.031 --> 00:23:34.520
But before anyone else's homework assignment,
you can have a look at these,
uh,

383
00:23:34.521 --> 00:23:38.270
these baseball games and have a go at being a little bit better than the

384
00:23:38.271 --> 00:23:41.540
commentators who are,
who are working on.
All right.

385
00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:45.550
So one application for Ihc strategies is in sport,

386
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.750
but not the only application.

387
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.630
Let's just talk about another application or slightly more scary application.

388
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.000
So often nine,
11,

389
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.360
there was a lot of talk in the u s about the placement of a baggage checking

390
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:02.060
machines at airports.
All right.
Actually it's still going on at all,

391
00:24:02.061 --> 00:24:06.500
but there was a lot of talk then about the placement of machines to search the

392
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:08.090
luggage that goes on.
That goes on board.

393
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:09.890
The hand luggage was being searched anyway,

394
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.610
but to search luggage going into the cabins.
Right.
And it was pointed out,

395
00:24:13.611 --> 00:24:16.160
and at the time,
this has changed since the word,

396
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:19.190
actually enough machines in the u s uh,

397
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:24.470
the day after nine 11 to search every single bag that went into the hole and

398
00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:28.800
you'd hear discussions of the following type,
you'd hear these experts on,
um,
uh,

399
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:31.730
Nightline or whatever,
and they'd say,
look,

400
00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:36.790
there's no point trying to do this because if we put all our baggage searching

401
00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:40.430
machines at Logan Airport in Boston,
for example,

402
00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.090
then the terrorists will simply move their attack to O'Hare.

403
00:24:44.330 --> 00:24:47.570
And if we put them on her hair,
then they'll move their attack to Logan.

404
00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:49.610
If we put there,
we have enough to do both Logan and her hair,

405
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.420
then they'll move their attack to some third airport.
Right?

406
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.730
So th th th there was a sense of doing in the,

407
00:24:55.731 --> 00:24:57.170
I was kind of a depressing time anyway,

408
00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:01.460
it ends and do in the air saying that when you,
if you put your,

409
00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:06.110
uh,
your,
uh,
baggage searching machines somewhere,

410
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.820
all you do is caused the attempted a terrorists terrorist attempting to block

411
00:25:10.821 --> 00:25:14.000
the planes to go elsewhere.
And you hear the same things today.

412
00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.000
About searching individuals as they go on the plane.
For example,

413
00:25:17.001 --> 00:25:21.310
you hear discussion that says,
if we only search,
uh,

414
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:25.550
main traveling alone and let's say,
then you'll quickly,
uh,

415
00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:30.510
end up with all the people carrying bombs being capitals or women,
right?

416
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.710
And again,
there's this sense of doom,
the sense that says it's hopeless.

417
00:25:33.711 --> 00:25:34.790
Wherever we do that,

418
00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.740
what that's going to force the terrorist to do something else.

419
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.570
We wouldn't have gained anything.
So once again,
that's wrong,

420
00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:46.670
right?
What's wrong about that one?
What,
what should we be doing in that sense?

421
00:25:46.671 --> 00:25:49.870
Maybe you come,
come down again.
And what should we be?
Just what,

422
00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:54.690
what should they have done if they did do with those luggage,
baggage,
baggage,
uh,

423
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:58.280
searching machines when they were in short supply after nine 11.

424
00:25:58.281 --> 00:26:00.560
And what do they do with searching people as they get on planes?

425
00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:07.760
Why haven't they didn't do,

426
00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.840
they didn't just put them at certain airports and announced they're just at

427
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.790
these apples.
Right.
That would have been the crazy thing to do.

428
00:26:13.791 --> 00:26:18.110
That would have been hopeless.
Tiny,
hopeless,
but not,
not why's,

429
00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.880
what should they have done?
What did they do?
Anybody want a gas?

430
00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:26.963
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

431
00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.560
<v 0>In namely randomized who they were checking.
Right?
Right.</v>

432
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:36.270
So when they're checking passengers,
they're gonna randomly check passengers.

433
00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:39.390
Right when they're checking.
When I think about the baggage machine,

434
00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:43.890
there's a sensible thing to do is to put a big metal box that every app ports

435
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:48.460
and say,
we're not going to tell you which of these boxes actually have,
uh,
have,

436
00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:50.250
uh,
have baggage checking machines,

437
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.190
which effectively is randomizing right from the point of view of the terrorists.

438
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.980
They don't,
they're not going to know where the,

439
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.610
where the baggage checks are going on.

440
00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:58.670
<v 1>Alright.
Alright.</v>

441
00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.130
<v 0>That's worth doing.
It doesn't,
it doesn't get a perfectly eliminates.</v>

442
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.460
Well unfortunately it hasn't probably going to perfectly eliminate all terrorist

443
00:27:05.461 --> 00:27:09.270
attacks,
but it does make it harder for the terrorists.
Alright,

444
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.860
so randomisation there,

445
00:27:10.861 --> 00:27:15.480
whether it's literally randomizing over who is checked or whether it's as it

446
00:27:15.481 --> 00:27:18.270
were,
randomizing by concealing,
we're in fact,

447
00:27:18.271 --> 00:27:21.090
you have placed those machines can be very effective.

448
00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:26.900
The hard thing both in sports and in these military examples is really mimicking

449
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.790
randomization.
It's very hard for us as humans to do it.

450
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:36.360
And there's a famous story about a military commander,

451
00:27:36.361 --> 00:27:37.380
actually an English metric,

452
00:27:37.381 --> 00:27:41.130
Amanda during an insurgent war in I think it was Malaysia,

453
00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:45.060
uh,
I think it was laser after World War Two,
where again,

454
00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.500
he had to worry about randomizing which convoys to protect and the way in which

455
00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:50.550
he,
uh,

456
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.090
he figured out the randomizing it was the right thing to do to try and protect

457
00:27:54.091 --> 00:27:57.210
these convoys as well as he could with small numbers of,
of troops.

458
00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:01.200
And the way in which he randomize was he literally randomized every morning you

459
00:28:01.210 --> 00:28:03.150
put a bit of paper in his hand and he had,

460
00:28:03.151 --> 00:28:06.870
somebody had one of his sergeants pick which hand the peanut butter paper was

461
00:28:06.871 --> 00:28:11.340
there.
All right.
So we do actually see these random strategies used.

462
00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:14.580
The reason we have to literally randomized it's cause it's very difficult to do

463
00:28:14.581 --> 00:28:16.440
so unless you're a professional sports player.

464
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:18.853
<v 1>Okay.</v>

465
00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:23.700
<v 0>But it turns out that mixed strategy equilibria and mix strategies in general</v>

466
00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:27.870
are relevant beyond just these contexts in which you think of people literally

467
00:28:27.871 --> 00:28:30.690
around.
Amazing.
And I want to look at a different context now.

468
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.700
All right.
So I want to go back to a game we started a few weeks ago.

469
00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:43.070
Uh,
this isn't the same game.
It's a sequel.

470
00:28:43.071 --> 00:28:47.420
It's a followup in our exciting adventure of our dating couple in the classroom.

471
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.760
Who were our dating couples?
We still have them here.

472
00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:55.640
That was the guy who is,
who is the,
yeah.
There they are.
Their,

473
00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:58.640
they even sitting closer.
I want to success here.
Alright.
Alright.

474
00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:02.590
Can we get the camera on them or seconds?
I start up a second.

475
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:07.690
Uh,
yeah.
Sign up for a second sentence.
Thank you.

476
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:12.880
And your name was Chad to just repeat it yet.
David?

477
00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:16.330
Yeah.
Can you actually go and look at this?

478
00:29:16.331 --> 00:29:21.130
Does this romantic of what David and I and your name is?
Nina.

479
00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:23.890
Nina and David.
Okay.
And I think,
I think we just,

480
00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.820
I think we've pretty much figured out last time that Nina's player one and

481
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:31.570
David's plan to that,
right?
That's right.
And that,
yeah,
I just remember last time,

482
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:33.790
well,
I'll pick on you in a second.
You can sit down and say,
all right.

483
00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:38.470
So we'd figured out last time they were trying to go on a date and they were,

484
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:43.210
they hit a range to go to the movies.
They out a two and half,
three movies,

485
00:29:43.211 --> 00:29:48.070
but two that remains viable.
And the problem was being typical economics majors.

486
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:50.140
Who are you both economics majors.
I think they can pick that out.

487
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:53.680
They all look at that.
So being typical economics majors,
just hopeless it dating,

488
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:57.010
they'd forgotten to tell each other which movie they're going to so that you

489
00:29:57.011 --> 00:29:58.960
know that that works.
I don't know if that worked out well on not,

490
00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:02.500
but now then life has moved on.
They're going to try it again.

491
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:06.670
But this time taking advantage of fall in,
in New England,

492
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:10.540
rather than go to a movie,
they've decided on some new activities.

493
00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:13.840
So they might either go apple picking

494
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.370
or they might go to the Yale Rep.

495
00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:24.750
All right.
Whoops.
Rap War Rep and see a play.
All right.

496
00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.190
And uh,
so apple picking is,
has its advantages and the full,

497
00:30:29.191 --> 00:30:33.870
whether it's local flavor,
it's uh,
uh,
you know,
it has certain,

498
00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.360
uh,
undertones about the garden of Eden or something.
It hasn't yet.

499
00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:42.780
I don't know if we can use the term flavor local,

500
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:47.370
otherwise we're doing American apples,
but that's all right.
And the Yale Rep,

501
00:30:47.371 --> 00:30:49.870
you know,
Europe is a good thing to do in new haven.
Go to a play.

502
00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.270
But I think it's Richard.

503
00:30:51.271 --> 00:30:54.870
The second is showing now is that it put on a great date play.
But you know,

504
00:30:54.871 --> 00:30:58.260
economists are trying to show they have culture.
So,
uh,
you know,
there it goes.

505
00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.500
And,
uh,
it's just thing the payoff.
Sir.
I like this

506
00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:04.830
as they were before,

507
00:31:04.890 --> 00:31:09.750
where by we mean Nina wants to meet David.
Uh,

508
00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.120
but she would,
you know,
give him the choice.
You'd rather meet David,
uh,
uh,

509
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:17.070
in the apple feels all right.
And,
uh,
David,
who's a,

510
00:31:17.071 --> 00:31:21.630
who's a dark personality,
likes the sort of darker side of Shakespeare and,
uh,

511
00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:25.470
he would,
he also wants to meet Nina,
but he would rather meet at the Yale Rad.

512
00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:29.080
All right.
I don't know if that's backwards.
I apologize to that preference.

513
00:31:29.081 --> 00:31:31.470
It's all right.
All right.
Um,
but once again,

514
00:31:31.471 --> 00:31:33.600
because they're still in competent economics majors,

515
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:37.700
they've again forgotten to tell each other where they're going.
Yeah.
All right.

516
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.750
All right.
I forgot to tell each other where they're going.

517
00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.670
So let's analyze this game again.

518
00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.870
We figured out this was a coordination game last time,
ah,

519
00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:49.890
or several weeks ago and we know in this game we know what the pure strategy,

520
00:31:50.881 --> 00:31:55.350
national whatever.
All right,
so no prizes be able to spot them.
Uh,

521
00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.980
one of the Nash Equilibria and pure strategies,

522
00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.360
let's put this in pure strategist.

523
00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:08.980
So one of the pure strategy Nash Equilibrium Equilibria is for them both to go

524
00:32:08.981 --> 00:32:12.530
apple picking and meet up in the bishop tortured or whatever.

525
00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:17.080
And another pure strategy equilibrium Islam both to choose the wreck.

526
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:26.590
All right?
And we'd figured out that if they were able to communicate,

527
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:30.730
there's really a pretty good chance of the managing to coordinate that one of

528
00:32:30.731 --> 00:32:34.000
these equilibria bots we suspect.

529
00:32:34.001 --> 00:32:36.550
I think that this is not all that's going on here.

530
00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:41.730
It looks quite likely that come your next Saturday afternoon when we send these

531
00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:45.440
guys out on that date,
they're going to fail to meet.
It's at least plausible.

532
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.440
Right?
And to test the plausible.
Is it that,
let's ask them,
have you been,

533
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:52.810
have you managed to meet on a date yet?
They know,
no,
haven't managed to be today.

534
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:54.890
See you.
So I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm proving the point.

535
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:57.950
I'm proving the point that in fact they haven't managed to create this

536
00:32:57.951 --> 00:33:01.350
coordinated equilibrium yet.
All right.
All right.
So it's,

537
00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:05.720
it seems at least plausible that they going to fail to coordinate his plausible

538
00:33:05.721 --> 00:33:10.160
that going to fail to coordinate.
And we'd like to sort of capture that idea.

539
00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.170
And the way we're going to capture that idea is,

540
00:33:12.171 --> 00:33:16.100
let's see if there's another Ricola bourbon this game.
Well,
the certainly isn't.

541
00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:19.490
Another pure strategy equilibrium in this game is that we know that.

542
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:24.620
So if there's another equilibrium,
it better me mixed.
So let's try and find

543
00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:27.050
a mixed

544
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:31.490
nash equilibrium in this game.

545
00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:34.400
And remember this game is called Battle of the sexes.

546
00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:37.973
<v 1>That's a famous game.</v>

547
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:45.110
<v 0>This is battle of the sexes revisited.
Alright,</v>

548
00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:50.850
so how are we going to go about finding this mixed Nash equilibrium again?

549
00:33:51.330 --> 00:33:54.520
What we'll,
we'll,
we'll interpret it later but let's just work on finding it.

550
00:33:55.120 --> 00:34:00.120
So in particular I'm going to post like the idea that Nina is going to mix p one

551
00:34:03.331 --> 00:34:08.331
minus p and David is going to make Hugh one minus Q.

552
00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:17.080
So how do we go about finding David's equilibrium mix Q one minus Q.

553
00:34:17.791 --> 00:34:19.230
What's our trick from last week?

554
00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:23.790
She got a cold call at this point but it's not half to how am I going to find

555
00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:27.840
cue the equilibrium queue.
Somebody

556
00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:33.330
now.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Use Venus.
Is Payoffs good?
Good,
good.

557
00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:37.560
So to fine isn't Venus's payoffs.
It's Nina's payoffs.
Okay,

558
00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:39.630
fair enough to defined,

559
00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:46.070
sorry to find the Nash equilibrium cue to find the mix that David's using.

560
00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:53.760
We use Minas payoffs,
use Minas payoffs.
All right,

561
00:34:53.761 --> 00:34:54.720
so let's do that.

562
00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.960
All right,
so in particular for Nina,

563
00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:10.410
if she goes apple picking then her pay off is to with problems.

564
00:35:12.881 --> 00:35:17.881
He Q if she meets David and zero otherwise

565
00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:26.970
and if she goes to the rep then have pay off is one.

566
00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:32.470
If she meets David.
Uh,
sorry.

567
00:35:32.471 --> 00:35:36.820
That's what I to be careful it's got again,
it,
she gets the Rep.

568
00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.190
How is zero?

569
00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:43.200
If David goes apple picking with property Q and a payoff is one if she meets

570
00:35:43.201 --> 00:35:47.610
David at the rep,
which happens with probability one minus Q.
That correct.

571
00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:50.403
Alright,

572
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:53.700
so this is the payoff from apple picking and this is her pay off from seeing

573
00:35:53.701 --> 00:35:54.660
Richard the second.

574
00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:59.120
And what do we know if Nina was indeed mixing,

575
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:04.050
what do we know about,
what do we know about these two payoffs?

576
00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.960
They must be equal,
right?
If Nina is in fact mixing,

577
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.790
then these two things must be equal.
And that means what?

578
00:36:13.791 --> 00:36:17.910
What we're seeing is two Q equals one,

579
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:21.090
one minus Q or

580
00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:27.380
Q equals,
uh,
them,
uh,
two thirds I guess it is.

581
00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:37.500
<v 1>No,
it's one third.
Sorry,
one sec.</v>

582
00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.350
One Sec.
Sorry.
That right.
Here's one third.

583
00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:44.770
<v 0>Okay.</v>

584
00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:49.770
So our guests is that if there's a mixed strategy equilibrium,

585
00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:53.190
it must be the case that David is assigning a property,

586
00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.990
a third to going apple picking,

587
00:36:56.230 --> 00:37:01.230
which means he's assigning prevalency two thirds to his more favorite activity,

588
00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:07.500
which is going to see Richard the second
right.

589
00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:08.943
What about,

590
00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:15.700
<v 1>I'm going to hold these both down.</v>

591
00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:20.883
Okay.

592
00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.790
<v 0>How do we find Nina's mix?
All right,
so to find,</v>

593
00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:28.403
<v 1>yeah,</v>

594
00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:33.690
<v 0>defined the Nash equilibrium p to find Nina's mix.</v>

595
00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:39.930
What do we do?
What's the trick?
Somebody use David's payoffs,

596
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:43.030
these David's payoffs.
So David's payoffs.

597
00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:45.310
If he goes apple picking,

598
00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:51.060
then he gets a payoff of one if he meets Nina that and zero.

599
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:58.510
Otherwise,
if he goes to the rep,

600
00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:03.750
he gets a pay off off zero.

601
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:07.500
If Nina has gone apple picking and he gets a pay off of too,

602
00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:13.130
if he meets Nina at the Rep.
All right.

603
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:18.110
And once again,
if David is indifferent,
it must be these are equal.

604
00:38:18.740 --> 00:38:20.320
So if these are,
if they,

605
00:38:20.350 --> 00:38:23.660
it is in fact mixing between apple picking and going to the Rep.

606
00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.040
It must be that these two are equal.
And if we set this out carefully,

607
00:38:28.041 --> 00:38:29.170
we'll get a,

608
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:34.930
we'll get one p equals to one minus

609
00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.980
which is p equals two thirds and one minus p

610
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:44.950
equals one third.

611
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:50.890
So here we have Nina assigning two thirds to going apple picking,

612
00:38:50.891 --> 00:38:55.891
which in fact is her more favored thing and one third to going to the Rep.

613
00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:58.043
<v 1>All right.</v>

614
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.790
<v 0>Okay,
so we just use the same trick as last time.</v>

615
00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.050
Let's check that this is in fact an equilibrium.

616
00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.780
All right,
so in particular,

617
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:15.840
let's check that it is in fact an equilibrium for Nina to choose two thirds,

618
00:39:17.350 --> 00:39:20.140
one shirt.
All right,
let's check.

619
00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:26.640
It's a check that p equals two thirds is in facts.

620
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:33.560
The best response
for Nina,

621
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:38.440
let's go back to Nina's payoffs for Nina.

622
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:40.840
If she chose to go apple packing,

623
00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:46.470
her pay off now is two times Q but Q is equal to third

624
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:53.720
plus zero one minus one minus Q.

625
00:39:55.670 --> 00:40:00.670
And if she shows this chooses to go to the rep that her pay off is zero with

626
00:40:02.361 --> 00:40:06.050
problems in your third and one with prophecy.

627
00:40:06.051 --> 00:40:07.810
Now two thirds organize.

628
00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:12.440
I've taken the lines I had before and substitute it in now what we know it must

629
00:40:12.441 --> 00:40:14.990
be the correct Q and one minus Q

630
00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:21.780
and this gives her a pay off of two thirds in either case.

631
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:23.703
<v 1>All right,</v>

632
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:27.800
<v 0>if she chooses p a pay off to p</v>

633
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:34.300
will be two thirds of the time she'll get the payoff from apple packing,

634
00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:41.740
which is two thirds and one third of the time she'll get the payoff from going

635
00:40:42.771 --> 00:40:45.560
to the rep,
which is two thirds

636
00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:48.350
for a total of two thirds.

637
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:50.980
<v 1>All right?</v>

638
00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:54.900
<v 0>So Nina's payoff from either her pure strategies is two thirds.</v>

639
00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:59.370
Her pay off from our claimed equilibrium.
Mixed strategy is two thirds.

640
00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:04.580
So neither of her possible pure strategy deviations were profitable and then

641
00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.620
lose anything either,
but they weren't profitable.

642
00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.900
And by the lesson we started the class with,

643
00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:14.760
that means it cannot be any strictly profitable mixed deviation either.

644
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:18.930
So indeed for Nina,
p is a best response to queue,

645
00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.890
right?
Well,
we can do the same for David,
but that's not bothered.
It's symmetric,

646
00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.840
isn't that?
All right?

647
00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.530
So in this game we've found another equilibrium.

648
00:41:29.610 --> 00:41:30.930
The other equilibrium.

649
00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.910
The new equilibrium is Nina mixed,

650
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:37.760
two thirds,

651
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:43.930
one third and David mixed one third,

652
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:47.323
two thirds

653
00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:52.190
and we also know the payoff from this equilibrium.

654
00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:57.490
The equilibrium for this pay off the both players was two thirds.

655
00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.870
There are three caliber in this game.
They managed to meet an apple picking,

656
00:42:07.871 --> 00:42:11.380
in which case the payoffs are two and one they managed to meet at the wrap.

657
00:42:11.381 --> 00:42:13.620
That's the pure as the second pure strategy equilibrium,

658
00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:17.560
in which case the payoff.
So one and two or they mix both.

659
00:42:17.561 --> 00:42:20.830
The mix in this way and their pay are two thirds.
Two thirds.

660
00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:22.870
<v 1>That's
right.</v>

661
00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:29.400
<v 0>Why is the payoff so bad in this mixed strategy equilibrium?</v>

662
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:33.560
Everyone agree?
This is a pretty lousy pay off,
right?

663
00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:34.620
The other equilibrium pay off.

664
00:42:34.621 --> 00:42:37.530
The worst you've got was one and if someone's got to,

665
00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:41.610
but now he you are playing at a different equilibrium and this different

666
00:42:41.611 --> 00:42:44.160
equilibrium,
you're only getting two thirds.
Wait,

667
00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:47.760
why are you only get to what happened?
Why is the payoffs got pushed down so far?

668
00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:52.740
What's happening to our poor hapless couple or not happens?
I don't know

669
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:57.530
<v 1>what's happening to our capital.
Yeah,
ash.</v>

670
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.820
Okay.
Relevant.
Yeah.

671
00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:04.950
<v 0>Sometimes they don't meet that failing to meet.
Right.
The reason what's,</v>

672
00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.910
what's forcing these payoffs down is they're not missing very often.

673
00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:13.050
How often are they actually meeting?
How often are they meeting?

674
00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:16.380
Let's have a look.
Let's go back to the previous

675
00:43:16.730 --> 00:43:17.563
<v 1>bored.</v>

676
00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:27.390
<v 0>Here it is.
Alright,</v>

677
00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:32.130
so they meet when they end up in this box or this box.
Is that right?

678
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:35.610
All right.
So what's the promise you of them ending up in those boxes?
Well,

679
00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:40.020
ending up in this box is prevalency two thirds,

680
00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:41.910
one third,

681
00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:46.770
and ending up in this box is probably the one third,

682
00:43:47.850 --> 00:43:50.040
two thirds.
Is that right?
You're up,

683
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:55.190
you end up meeting apple picking the two thirds of the time when Nina goes there

684
00:43:55.300 --> 00:43:59.130
times the one third of the time when David goes there and you end up meeting at

685
00:43:59.131 --> 00:44:02.280
the rep,
the one third of the time Nina goes to that at times,

686
00:44:02.281 --> 00:44:05.890
but two thirds of the time that David goes that,
all right,

687
00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:09.990
so this is the total prevalency of meeting.
This is the privacy of meeting

688
00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:14.260
and it's equal to

689
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:22.510
<v 1>uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,</v>

690
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:27.230
four nines,
four nines.
That's fine.

691
00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.353
All right,

692
00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:34.120
<v 0>so four ninths of the time they're missing,</v>

693
00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.600
but five ninths of the time and more than half the time,

694
00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:41.470
more than half the time they're scoring up and failing to meet.

695
00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:43.800
This is why I call them hopeless dating couple.

696
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:46.030
<v 1>Right?
All right.
All right.</v>

697
00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.380
<v 0>All right.
So this is a very bad equilibrium,</v>

698
00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.560
but it captures something which is true about the game.

699
00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:57.490
What is surely true about this gay is that if they just played this game,

700
00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.420
they wouldn't meet all the time.
In fact,

701
00:44:59.421 --> 00:45:01.360
what we're arguing here is that meet the rest of them half of the time.

702
00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:04.221
All right?

703
00:45:04.221 --> 00:45:07.610
But certainly this idea that we're given from the pure strategy Culebra but they

704
00:45:07.611 --> 00:45:10.940
would magically always managed to meet it seems rather unlikely.

705
00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:15.050
So this does seem to add a little bit of realism to this analysis of the game.

706
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:19.550
However,
it leads to a bit of an interpretation problem.

707
00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:24.500
You might ask the question,
why on earth are they randomizing in this way?

708
00:45:24.501 --> 00:45:28.280
Why are they doing this?
It's bad for everybody.
Why are they doing this?

709
00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:30.663
<v 1>All right,</v>

710
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:36.120
<v 0>and this leads us to think about a second interpretation for what we think mixed</v>

711
00:45:36.121 --> 00:45:41.121
strategy equilibrium rather than thinking of them literally as randomizing.

712
00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:46.980
It's probably better in this case to think about the following idea.

713
00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:52.130
We need to think about David's mixture as being a statement about what Nina

714
00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:57.610
believes David's going to do.
David Been,

715
00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:01.800
we literally randomizing but his mixture.

716
00:46:01.801 --> 00:46:06.801
Q one minus Q we could think of as mean as belief about what David's going to

717
00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:10.050
do.
And conversely,

718
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.990
Nina may not literally be randomizing,

719
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:19.040
but her p one minus p we could think of as David's belief about what Nina is

720
00:46:20.581 --> 00:46:21.414
going to do

721
00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:26.250
and what we've done is we found the beliefs,

722
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:31.370
we found the beliefs such that these players are exactly in different over what

723
00:46:32.581 --> 00:46:35.800
they do.
We found the beliefs for,

724
00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:39.750
for David over what Nina is going to do such that David doesn't really quite

725
00:46:39.751 --> 00:46:43.950
know what to do and we found the beliefs Nina holds about what David's going to

726
00:46:43.951 --> 00:46:45.990
do,
something he doesn't quite know what to do.

727
00:46:47.930 --> 00:46:50.880
<v 1>That makes sense.
All right,</v>

728
00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:54.030
<v 0>so it's probably better here to think about this,</v>

729
00:46:54.031 --> 00:46:56.130
not as people literally randomizing,

730
00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:00.510
but these mixed strategies being a statement about what people believe in

731
00:47:00.511 --> 00:47:01.344
equilibrium.

732
00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:04.423
<v 1>All right,</v>

733
00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:08.600
<v 0>we'll come back and look at this game some more later on to are our couple,</v>

734
00:47:08.601 --> 00:47:10.370
I'm afraid I don't quite out of the woods yet,

735
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:16.550
but I want to spend the rest of the day looking at a yet another interpretation

736
00:47:16.551 --> 00:47:18.800
of mixed strategy equilibrium.
So far we have to,

737
00:47:19.070 --> 00:47:21.800
we have PPO that people are literally randomizing.

738
00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:27.290
We have thinking of these as expressions about what people believe in

739
00:47:27.291 --> 00:47:29.270
equilibrium rather than what they're literally.

740
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.950
And now I'm going to give you a third interpretation.

741
00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:47.100
So for now we can get rid of the Venus and Serena game.

742
00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:59.980
So to motivate this third idea,
I wanted to think about tax audits.

743
00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:01.421
All right?

744
00:48:01.421 --> 00:48:06.421
So none of you here have ever probably ever had to pull out a tax form except

745
00:48:06.671 --> 00:48:09.750
for the fact that the lot of parents in the room today,
is it parents weekend?

746
00:48:09.751 --> 00:48:10.870
And that was going on.
All right.

747
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.750
So what are the parents from and where you want to wave your arms and the

748
00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:15.870
outdoor parent here?
Yeah.
Okay.

749
00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:18.640
So at least these guys are probably someone in their life filled out a tax form.

750
00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:22.780
All right.
All right,
so come tax day up.

751
00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:27.550
The parents and the Roman face a choice and the choice is are they going to

752
00:48:27.551 --> 00:48:30.280
honestly fill out their taxes or are they going to cheat?

753
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.350
I'm not going to ask them what they do.
Well,
maybe I will,

754
00:48:32.351 --> 00:48:36.450
but for now I would ask them what they did.
All right.
And

755
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:43.420
so they can choose one of two things.
They can choose to pay their taxes.

756
00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:46.210
Honestly,
we'll call it h or to cheat.

757
00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:49.140
This is the tax payer.
The parents.

758
00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:57.000
All right?
And at the same time,
the audit office,

759
00:48:58.490 --> 00:49:01.340
the auditor can,
it has,
it has to make a choice.

760
00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:06.050
And the auditor's choice is whether to audit you or not.

761
00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:10.460
This is not literally true because literally the auditor can wait til your tax

762
00:49:10.461 --> 00:49:14.150
return is,
comes in and then decide whether an audit you all right,
but for now,

763
00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:15.920
let's think of these choices being made,

764
00:49:15.921 --> 00:49:19.010
some multi Nestle and we'll see why that makes it more interesting.

765
00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:20.310
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

766
00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:24.040
<v 0>All right,
so let me put down some payoffs down then I'll explain them.</v>

767
00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:32.340
So two zero four minus ten four zero zero four.

768
00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:37.290
All right,
so how do we interpret this?

769
00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.810
Let's look at the auditor's payoffs first of all.

770
00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:45.140
So the auditor is very happy not having to audit your parents and having your

771
00:49:46.201 --> 00:49:47.850
own,
your parents pay taxes.

772
00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:52.670
So we'll get that a power for four and it'll turn out in this game and we'll,

773
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:53.580
we've decided,
uh,

774
00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:58.460
in the payoffs did the auditor is equally happy if she actually audit to your

775
00:49:58.461 --> 00:50:00.440
parents in the year that they cheated.

776
00:50:01.370 --> 00:50:02.240
<v 1>All right.</v>

777
00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:07.040
<v 0>And we'll get the,
we'll say that makes the auditor equally happy.
All right.</v>

778
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:11.780
Now the auditor is not so happy if she audit your parents when they're honest,

779
00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:12.980
because auditor costly.

780
00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.150
<v 1>All right.</v>

781
00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.340
<v 0>And,
uh,</v>

782
00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:22.340
the auditor is really unhappy if she fails to audit when the parents cheated.

783
00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:25.430
<v 1>All right,</v>

784
00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:29.230
<v 0>let's look at the I wanting parents.
I'm parents,
let's call them taxpayers.</v>

785
00:50:29.490 --> 00:50:34.130
All right?
So the,
for the taxpayers,
what are their payoffs will normalize things.

786
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:39.050
So if they're honest,
will give them a payoff of zero.
All right,

787
00:50:39.051 --> 00:50:40.100
let me say correctly,

788
00:50:40.101 --> 00:50:42.170
fill in their tax form and pay what they're supposed to pay.

789
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:47.090
But if they can feel some of the income or they pretend to have a whatever it
is,

790
00:50:47.091 --> 00:50:51.740
a third child,
all right?
All right,
then,
then they might be in trouble.

791
00:50:51.741 --> 00:50:54.920
If they audited,
if they're audited,
they're going to have to pay a big fine,

792
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:59.330
maybe even go to jail.
That's minus 10 course.
If they're not audited,

793
00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:04.090
they get to keep a chunk of money as well.
Call out for
all right?

794
00:51:04.091 --> 00:51:07.870
Everyone was down.
But the basic idea of this game,
right?
In reality,

795
00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.450
we could add more complications if you think of different ways to cheat on your

796
00:51:10.451 --> 00:51:13.250
taxes.
But I don't want to give tutorials and how to cheat your tax on.

797
00:51:13.251 --> 00:51:15.190
She did her taxes here.
All right.

798
00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:19.840
So it's not going to take a long staring at this gay man to figure out that

799
00:51:19.841 --> 00:51:23.770
there are no pure strategy equilibrium in this game.
Lets us do that.

800
00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:27.460
So from the taxpayer's point of view,

801
00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:31.810
if they're going to be audited,
then they'd rather pay their taxes than not.

802
00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:36.610
And if they're not going to be audited,
then according to these payoffs,

803
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:37.750
they'd rather cheat.

804
00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:40.620
<v 1>All right?</v>

805
00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:43.150
<v 0>Um,
from the auditor's point of view,</v>

806
00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:45.820
if they knew everyone was going to pay taxes,

807
00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:48.540
then if they wouldn't bother auditing,

808
00:51:50.130 --> 00:51:54.750
and if they knew it almost on a cheat,
then they'd off bought it.

809
00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:56.871
All right?

810
00:51:56.871 --> 00:52:01.790
So you can quickly see that there's no box in which the best responses coincide.

811
00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:05.410
There's no pure Strachan Nash equilibrium.
All right?

812
00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:08.990
Well those people who I think who this is seeming otherworldly,
uh,

813
00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:11.990
you will have to pay toxic taxes and a couple of years and trust me,

814
00:52:11.991 --> 00:52:16.070
your parents are paying taxes now.
All right?

815
00:52:16.550 --> 00:52:21.200
So what we want to do here is we're going to solve out and find a mixed strategy

816
00:52:21.201 --> 00:52:21.920
equilibrium,

817
00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.420
but we're going to give it a different interpretation to the Internet.

818
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:26.300
The Equilibria we've found so far.

819
00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:29.860
But the basic initial exercise is what we're going to find that we're going to

820
00:52:29.861 --> 00:52:31.610
try and find the equilibrium here.

821
00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:40.690
So find the Nash equilibrium here.
We know it's going to be mixed.
All right?

822
00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:46.500
So to find the probability with which tax payers pay their taxes and have you

823
00:52:49.241 --> 00:52:54.010
already start getting ahead of myself and to say to find the proportion of tax

824
00:52:54.011 --> 00:52:58.030
payers who are going to pay their taxes,
what do we do?

825
00:52:59.080 --> 00:52:59.680
What must be,

826
00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:04.630
what must be true of that equilibrium proportion queue of tax payers who pay

827
00:53:04.631 --> 00:53:09.190
their taxes?
How am I going to find that cute shout out somebody.

828
00:53:11.350 --> 00:53:13.630
Yeah,
look at the auditor's payoffs.
All right,

829
00:53:13.631 --> 00:53:18.220
so from the auditor's point of view,
if the auditor audits,

830
00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:23.490
their payoff is to Q plus four one minus Q,

831
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:28.620
and if they don't audit,

832
00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:34.220
that payoff is for Q plus zero

833
00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.120
one minus Q.
All right,
I want to say I did this.

834
00:53:40.121 --> 00:53:45.121
This is too cute for one minus Q four Q zero one minus Q.

835
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:48.480
And if indeed the auditor is mixing,

836
00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:54.540
then these must be equal.
Ms Must be equal.

837
00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:59.810
And if they're equal as us do a little bit of Algebra here and we'll find that

838
00:53:59.821 --> 00:54:04.821
two Q equals four one minus Q,

839
00:54:08.010 --> 00:54:12.870
right?
So whew.
Uh,

840
00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:17.630
equals a boom two thirds that right.
Four of us,
yes.
Two thirds

841
00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:21.160
<v 1>cubicles to feds.</v>

842
00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:23.960
<v 0>All right,</v>

843
00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:28.960
so our claim is to make the auditor exactly indifferent between whether to audit

844
00:54:29.571 --> 00:54:30.230
or not.

845
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:35.230
It must be the case that two thirds of the parents of the parents of the kids in

846
00:54:35.811 --> 00:54:39.200
the room are going to be paying.
They're paying their taxes honestly,

847
00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:43.310
which is a third aren't just going to worry.
And if my mind,
all right,

848
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:48.480
let's have a look at the taxpayer to find,
to find,
sorry,

849
00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:50.930
I'm sorry.
We found the taxpayer.

850
00:54:50.931 --> 00:54:54.110
We found the proportion of taxpayers who are paying the taxes.

851
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:56.360
Now I want to find out the problems of being audited.

852
00:54:56.630 --> 00:55:01.370
How do I figure out the equilibrium probability of being audited in this model?

853
00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.950
How do workout the equilibrium privacy of being audited,

854
00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:09.563
<v 1>shout it out.</v>

855
00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.370
<v 0>Equilibrium publicly being audited.</v>

856
00:55:12.371 --> 00:55:16.440
I going to use p and one minus piece of it's gonna be the property of being

857
00:55:16.441 --> 00:55:21.350
audited.
How do I find p?
Yeah,

858
00:55:21.351 --> 00:55:25.250
I mean,
look at the tax payers pay offs from the taxpayer's point of view.

859
00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:31.280
If the tax payer pays their taxes,
that pay off is just zero.

860
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:33.470
And if that,
and if they cheat,

861
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:36.740
their payoff is minus 10

862
00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:39.433
<v 1>p</v>

863
00:55:41.530 --> 00:55:45.700
<v 0>plus four
one minus p.</v>

864
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:49.103
All right.

865
00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:54.310
And if indeed the taxpayers are mixing or another saying that is not all

866
00:55:55.131 --> 00:55:59.540
taxpayers are cheating and not all tax payers are honestly paying their taxes,

867
00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:03.950
then these must be equal.
So if these are equal,

868
00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:08.600
I'm going to get four p equals

869
00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:14.410
14
no it doesn't.

870
00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:16.690
I'm gonna get four equals 14 psi again,

871
00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:21.960
four equals 14 peer requiring four equals 14 p which is the same as saying p

872
00:56:22.421 --> 00:56:23.770
equals two sevens.

873
00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:29.650
Someone can just check my Algebra and that's right.
That's right.

874
00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:31.890
All right,

875
00:56:31.890 --> 00:56:36.890
so my claim is that the equilibrium here is for two thirds of the taxpayers to

876
00:56:39.731 --> 00:56:42.130
pay their taxes and for the audit,

877
00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.280
for the auditor to audit two sevenths of the time.

878
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:47.540
<v 1>All right.</v>

879
00:56:48.050 --> 00:56:51.500
<v 0>Now we could go back in here and we could check.
I could do,</v>

880
00:56:51.501 --> 00:56:55.760
I get before I could plug the p's and q's in here and check that.
In fact,

881
00:56:55.761 --> 00:56:59.210
this isn't equilibrium,
but trust me that I've done that.
All right,

882
00:56:59.211 --> 00:57:01.610
trust me that it's okay.
Okay,

883
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:07.210
so here we have an equilibrium as just write down what it is from the auditor's

884
00:57:07.281 --> 00:57:08.150
point of view,

885
00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:13.420
it is that they audit two sevenths of the time or two sevenths of the population

886
00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:19.100
and from the tax payer's point of view,
it's if they pay their taxes,

887
00:57:19.101 --> 00:57:23.060
honestly two thirds of the time and not otherwise.

888
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:25.970
<v 1>All right.</v>

889
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:29.230
<v 0>Now,
without focusing too much on these exact numbers for a second,</v>

890
00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:34.650
I want to focus first for a minute on how do we interpret this mixed strategy

891
00:57:35.021 --> 00:57:35.854
equilibrium,

892
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:37.783
<v 1>right?</v>

893
00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:39.820
<v 0>So for the point of view of the auditor,</v>

894
00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:44.070
we're really back where we were before with a base stealer or the person who

895
00:57:44.071 --> 00:57:46.930
search searching baggage on the act at the airports.

896
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:50.710
We could think of the officer literally as randomizing.

897
00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:54.260
All right?
In fact,
there's some truth to that.

898
00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:58.850
It actually is the case by law that the auditor's literally have to random acts.

899
00:58:00.310 --> 00:58:03.590
All right,
so this two seven,
five,
seven is,

900
00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.750
this has the same interpretation as we had before.

901
00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:07.280
This is really a randomization,

902
00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:09.700
<v 1>right?</v>

903
00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:10.720
<v 0>But there's two thirds.</v>

904
00:58:10.721 --> 00:58:14.650
One third has a different interpretation and a potentially exciting

905
00:58:14.651 --> 00:58:15.484
interpretation.

906
00:58:16.210 --> 00:58:20.440
It isn't that we think that your parents get to tax day,

907
00:58:20.670 --> 00:58:25.390
work out what their taxes would be and then toss a coin.
Right?
Wow.

908
00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.171
They made me do that.

909
00:58:26.171 --> 00:58:29.120
I'm looking at the parents and I don't think that's what they're doing.
Right.

910
00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:32.200
The interpretation here is that the parents,

911
00:58:32.201 --> 00:58:35.170
some parents are paying the taxes and some parents aren't paying the taxes.

912
00:58:35.350 --> 00:58:37.060
There's a lot of parents out there,

913
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:41.140
a lot of potential taxpayers in the population in equilibrium.

914
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:42.580
If these numbers were true,

915
00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:47.530
two thirds of parents will be paying their taxes and one third would be
cheating.

916
00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:51.700
So this is a,
a randomization by a player,

917
00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:55.390
and this is a mixture in the population.

918
00:58:57.790 --> 00:59:00.460
The new interpretation here is we could think of the MEC strategy,

919
00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:02.690
not as players randomizing it,

920
00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:07.360
but as I mix in a large population in which some people are doing one thing and

921
00:59:07.361 --> 00:59:12.220
the other group are doing the other,
it's a proportion of people paying taxes.

922
00:59:13.810 --> 00:59:14.600
<v 1>Alright,</v>

923
00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:15.610
<v 0>so I don't know if there's two thirds.</v>

924
00:59:15.611 --> 00:59:19.270
One third is an accurate number for the U S it's probably not very far off

925
00:59:19.271 --> 00:59:23.270
actually for if Leah,
I'm to say that number,
that number,

926
00:59:23.271 --> 00:59:27.150
people to pay taxes is more like 40% maybe even lower.
Now.
Uh,

927
00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:32.290
and there are countries I think where it gets as high as 90% I think the US rate

928
00:59:32.781 --> 00:59:37.760
when they end up auditing is a little higher than this,
but not much.
All right.

929
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:43.400
Okay.
So again,
we're going to think of this not as randomization,

930
00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:48.760
but as a prediction of the proportion of American tax payers who are going to

931
00:59:48.981 --> 00:59:51.470
pay their taxes.
All right?

932
00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:56.930
Now I want to use this example in the time we have left to actually think about

933
00:59:56.931 --> 01:00:00.830
a policy experiment.
All right,
so let's put this off somewhere.
We can see it.

934
01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:07.053
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

935
01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:13.500
<v 0>And let's think about a new tax policy.
Just oppose that.</v>

936
01:00:13.501 --> 01:00:18.501
Congress gets fed up with all these newspaper reports about how two thirds of

937
01:00:18.901 --> 01:00:21.940
Americans don't pay their taxes or whatever,
whatever the true report.

938
01:00:21.941 --> 01:00:23.670
Do you think it's actually a little higher than that one in mind?

939
01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:28.440
They get put up with all these reports and they say,
this isn't fair.

940
01:00:28.441 --> 01:00:30.210
We should make people pay their taxes.

941
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:33.810
So we're going to change the law and instead of paying,

942
01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:38.930
instead of being in jail for slipping in jail for 10 years,

943
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:44.680
or their colons are fine of of minus 10 if you're caught,
she's saying,

944
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:50.190
we're going to raise the fine all the time in jail so that it's now minus 20% so

945
01:00:53.161 --> 01:00:54.810
the policy experiments is

946
01:00:58.210 --> 01:01:01.270
let's raise the fine,

947
01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:03.760
find the cheating.

948
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:10.210
So minus 20 and the aim of this policy is to try to determine cheating,

949
01:01:10.230 --> 01:01:14.320
right?
Right.
It seems a plausible thing for government.

950
01:01:14.321 --> 01:01:18.210
Want to want to do?
All right,

951
01:01:18.211 --> 01:01:21.030
let's redraw the Matrix.
So here's the game,

952
01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:26.330
two zero four minus 24 zero zero four audit,

953
01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:36.480
not audit.
And
Hey,
honestly,
or cheat.

954
01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:41.160
All right.

955
01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:46.160
So here's our new payoffs and let's ask the question with this new fine in place

956
01:01:46.261 --> 01:01:47.760
that we've raised the fine,

957
01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.110
<v 1>okay</v>

958
01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:53.470
<v 0>to being caught,
not paying your taxes in the long run.</v>

959
01:01:53.471 --> 01:01:56.530
Once things have worked their way back into equilibrium again,
right?

960
01:01:56.531 --> 01:01:57.610
After a few years,

961
01:01:57.940 --> 01:02:02.940
do we expect American tax paying compliance to go up or to go down or what do we

962
01:02:04.151 --> 01:02:09.130
expect?
What do we think's going to happen?
So who thinks it's going to go up?

963
01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.260
Who thinks is going to go down there?
Was going to stay the same?

964
01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:18.440
Here's a painting here and these are the parents were staining.

965
01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:21.480
Not really to have state.
You have to have just so vote here.

966
01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:23.410
Well how are we gonna figure this out?

967
01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.460
How we're going to figure out what's going to happen to compliance.

968
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:29.790
What happens

969
01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.540
to tax compliance?

970
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:42.230
Pectin plant that that was our,
that was our p no it wasn't.
Sorry.

971
01:02:42.231 --> 01:02:47.210
It was our,
it was our kid.
It's our cue,
right?
Well anyway,

972
01:02:47.211 --> 01:02:48.530
we're going to figure this out just to work it out.

973
01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:53.150
So let's work out the new Q.
An equilibrium.

974
01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:58.760
All right,
let's do this.
Alright,
so to find out the new Q and equilibrium,

975
01:02:58.761 --> 01:02:59.181
once again,

976
01:02:59.181 --> 01:03:03.040
we're going to have to look at the auditor's payoffs and the auditor's payoffs.

977
01:03:03.050 --> 01:03:04.070
If they audit,

978
01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:09.460
they're going to get to Q plus four one minus Q,

979
01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:10.760
and if they don't audit,

980
01:03:10.761 --> 01:03:15.761
they're going to get four Q plus zero one minus Q four Q part zero one minus Q

981
01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:20.660
two Q plus four one minus Q.

982
01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:24.470
And if the auditor is indifferent to that mixing,

983
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:26.780
it must still be the case that these are equal.

984
01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:32.170
And I want to ask you a question where have you seen that equation before?
Yeah,

985
01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.040
it's still there.
I didn't delete it.

986
01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:38.640
It's the same equation I said top down.

987
01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:43.430
Is that right?
From the orders,
his points of view,

988
01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.210
given the payoffs to the officers,
nothing has changed.

989
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:52.630
So the tax compliance rates that makes the auditor exactly indifference between

990
01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:58.400
audit and your parents and not auditing your parents is still exactly the same

991
01:03:58.401 --> 01:03:59.660
as it was before.

992
01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:07.360
Cut Two thirds in equilibrium tax compliance hasn't changed at all.

993
01:04:10.290 --> 01:04:11.290
Miss Heather again,
right?

994
01:04:11.370 --> 01:04:16.370
The policy was we're going to double the fines for being caught cheating and in

995
01:04:17.981 --> 01:04:18.814
equilibrium.

996
01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:23.960
It made absolutely no difference whatsoever to the equilibrium tax compliance

997
01:04:24.661 --> 01:04:25.494
rate.

998
01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.230
<v 1>All right.</v>

999
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:33.110
<v 0>How?
Why did it make no difference?
Why did it make a difference?
Well,
let's just,</v>

1000
01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.930
let's have a Techie,
I'm sorry,
in the nurse and then a better,

1001
01:04:35.290 --> 01:04:38.040
more intuitive upset.
The techie answers this.

1002
01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:43.650
What determines the equilibrium tax compliance rate?

1003
01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:48.740
What determines the equilibrium mix for the column player is what is the rose

1004
01:04:52.081 --> 01:04:54.810
payoffs,
right?

1005
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:59.250
What determines the equilibrium mix for the column player are the Rose Pay.

1006
01:04:59.251 --> 01:05:03.960
I'll row players' payoffs.
We didn't change the role players payoffs.

1007
01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:09.210
So when north is going to change the equilibrium mix for the column player,

1008
01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:14.580
say again,
we changed one of the payoffs for the column player,

1009
01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:16.920
but the columns,
players,

1010
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:21.960
equilibrium mix depends on the row players' payoffs and we haven't changed the

1011
01:05:23.201 --> 01:05:27.910
rope hires payoffs,
so we won't change the equilibrium compliance rate,

1012
01:05:27.911 --> 01:05:30.310
the equilibrium mix by the column player.

1013
01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:36.740
What will have changed here?
What will have changed in the new equilibrium?

1014
01:05:38.550 --> 01:05:41.890
So we've pretty much established that people are cheating as much as they were

1015
01:05:41.891 --> 01:05:46.030
before and equally Rehmann roll.
Can I get Henry here and w wait for the mic.

1016
01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:46.990
Wait.
Say again.

1017
01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:50.230
The probability of audit will have the problems of audit will have changed.

1018
01:05:50.290 --> 01:05:52.810
What's going to change is not the queue,

1019
01:05:52.811 --> 01:05:57.520
but the p the prevalence with which you're audited is going to change in this

1020
01:05:57.521 --> 01:06:00.940
marvel.
All right.
As check heads to find the new P,

1021
01:06:00.941 --> 01:06:05.260
I need to look at the tax payers pay offs and the taxpayers pay offs are now

1022
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:11.530
zero.
Uh,
if they,
sorry,
if they pay their taxes honestly,

1023
01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:17.460
then they get zero and if they cheats they get minus 20 with probability p and

1024
01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:24.400
four with privacy,
one minus P

1025
01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.020
if they're mixing,
if some of them are paying and some of the knock,

1026
01:06:29.021 --> 01:06:33.160
this must be the same.
And uh,
being more careful than I was last time.

1027
01:06:33.161 --> 01:06:38.161
I hope this gives me a 24 P is equal to four or p equals

1028
01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.433
<v 1>a sick.</v>

1029
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:45.931
<v 0>All right,</v>

1030
01:06:45.931 --> 01:06:50.931
so the audit rate has gone down from two seventh to one sick.

1031
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:55.860
I'm guessing that probably wasn't the goal of the policy or there isn't

1032
01:06:55.861 --> 01:06:59.050
necessarily a bad thing.
Right?
There is some,

1033
01:06:59.070 --> 01:07:03.030
there is some benefit for society here cause audits are costly both to do for

1034
01:07:03.031 --> 01:07:05.100
the auditor and the unpleasant to be audited.

1035
01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:09.600
So the fact we've managed to lower the audit rates from two sevenths to a sick

1036
01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:12.240
is a good thing.
All right.

1037
01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:17.220
But we didn't manage to raise the compliance rate.

1038
01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:20.193
<v 1>All right.</v>

1039
01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:25.730
<v 0>I don't wanna make this model to literally cause it's,
you know,
it's just,</v>

1040
01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:27.950
it's just a toy model.
But nevertheless,

1041
01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:32.170
let's try and draw out some lessons from this model.
All right,

1042
01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:36.890
so here what we did was we changed the payoff to cheating.
We made it,

1043
01:07:36.930 --> 01:07:41.750
made it worse,
right?
But a different kind of change is we could have changed,

1044
01:07:42.590 --> 01:07:47.410
sorry,
we changed the pay off negatively to being caught cheating.
Right?

1045
01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:51.620
But a different change we could have done is we could have left the minus 10 in

1046
01:07:51.621 --> 01:07:56.330
place and we could have raised the pay off to cheating and not getting course.

1047
01:07:56.510 --> 01:08:00.680
We could have left this 10 in place and change this for,

1048
01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:03.290
let's say to a six or an eight.
All right.

1049
01:08:03.291 --> 01:08:06.710
We had increased the benefits to cheating.
If you're not caught,

1050
01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:10.100
what would that have done in equilibrium?
What?

1051
01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:14.210
What would that have done in equilibrium?
So I claim once again,

1052
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:19.160
that would have done in equilibrium to the probability of people paying their

1053
01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:22.940
taxes,
but that would have done what to the audit rate.

1054
01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:27.520
The audit rate would've gone up.
You could have an audit rate would have gone up.

1055
01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:28.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1056
01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:32.440
<v 0>All right.
Let's tell that story a second,
right?
So rich people,</v>

1057
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:37.180
people who will well paid have a little bit more to gain from cheating on their

1058
01:08:37.181 --> 01:08:40.930
taxes.
If they're not course there's more money at speak.
All right.

1059
01:08:40.931 --> 01:08:44.800
So my colleagues were finance professors in the business school have more money

1060
01:08:44.801 --> 01:08:48.460
on that to,
on their tax returns than I do.
So in principle,

1061
01:08:48.490 --> 01:08:49.930
they gain more if they cheese.

1062
01:08:50.730 --> 01:08:51.563
<v 1>All right.</v>

1063
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:54.350
<v 0>Does that mean that they cheat more than me and he could have room?</v>

1064
01:08:56.530 --> 01:08:59.230
No,
it doesn't mean that they cheat more than many clever and what does it mean?

1065
01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:00.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1066
01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:05.390
<v 0>It means they get audited more often,
right?
And equilibrium.</v>

1067
01:09:05.830 --> 01:09:09.430
Richer people aren't necessarily going to cheat more,

1068
01:09:09.670 --> 01:09:14.390
but they all going to get audited more.
And that's true,
right?
The,
the,

1069
01:09:14.391 --> 01:09:18.280
the federal audit rights are designed so they audit the rich more than they

1070
01:09:18.281 --> 01:09:19.300
audit the poor.
Again,

1071
01:09:19.301 --> 01:09:22.790
it's not because they think the rich are inherently less honest or the poor are

1072
01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:24.700
inherently more on us or anything like that.

1073
01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:27.940
It's simply that the games to cheating and not getting caught a bigger if you're

1074
01:09:27.941 --> 01:09:31.480
rich,
so you need to audit more to push back into equilibrium.

1075
01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:35.410
<v 1>All right?
Now</v>

1076
01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:40.880
<v 0>suppose we did in fact want to use the policy of raising fines to push down,</v>

1077
01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:45.990
to push out the compliance,
right?
To push down cheating.

1078
01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:47.170
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1079
01:09:47.170 --> 01:09:51.490
<v 0>How would we change the law?
Because I suppose when we want to,
we want to get,</v>

1080
01:09:51.491 --> 01:09:54.640
we want to raise the fines for cheating.
We don't make people cheating,

1081
01:09:54.641 --> 01:09:57.700
so we raise the fines,
but we're worried about this result.

1082
01:09:57.701 --> 01:10:00.220
But worried about this result that didn't push up compliance rates.

1083
01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:04.420
How can we change the law or change the incentives in the game?

1084
01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:08.850
So it actually would change compliance rates.
What could we do?

1085
01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:11.913
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1086
01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:20.570
<v 0>auditing two,
four from two to four.
Good,
good,
good.</v>

1087
01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.880
If we want to change the compliance rates,

1088
01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:26.060
we should have changed the payoff to the auditor.

1089
01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:27.620
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1090
01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:28.110
<v 0>All right.</v>

1091
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:32.640
The problem with the way the oldest her is paid here is that the auditor is paid

1092
01:10:32.641 --> 01:10:36.730
more if they manage to catch people.
Right.
But audit it's a costly.

1093
01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:37.960
All right.

1094
01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:40.480
And the problem with that is when you raise the file on the other side,
all that,

1095
01:10:40.481 --> 01:10:43.240
all that happens is it's the auditor's audit less often and equilibrium.

1096
01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.760
So if you want to get a higher compliance rate,

1097
01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.210
one thing you could do is rate is changed.

1098
01:10:48.211 --> 01:10:52.120
The payoff to the auditor to make orders saying less costly for them or making

1099
01:10:52.150 --> 01:10:55.150
or making,
catching people,
uh,
uh,
nice stuff for them.

1100
01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:59.740
Give them a reward or you could simply take it out of game three altogether.

1101
01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:00.670
You could enforce,

1102
01:11:00.671 --> 01:11:05.050
you'd have a congressional rule law that sets the audit rates outside of

1103
01:11:05.051 --> 01:11:09.640
equilibrium.
And that's been much discussed in Congress over the last five years.

1104
01:11:09.730 --> 01:11:12.760
Somebody is sitting audit rates as it were exogenously by Congress.

1105
01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:16.400
Why might that not be a great idea?
Leaving aside economic theory for it,

1106
01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:17.370
even just like game theory,

1107
01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:21.720
why might it not be a great idea to have congress at the audit rates rather than

1108
01:11:22.050 --> 01:11:25.630
rather than a summer office?
Yeah,

1109
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:31.400
they're going to lower the audit rate.
Right?
So,
so the,
the,

1110
01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:34.500
the lady in the front is saying a lot of congressmen or rather rich.

1111
01:11:34.501 --> 01:11:37.560
So maybe they have particular incentives here.
I don't,
I don't,
I don't,
I don't,

1112
01:11:37.610 --> 01:11:39.980
I don't want,
I can put it a particular political stones here,

1113
01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:42.960
but it could be whatever side of the political spectrum you guys this on.

1114
01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:47.280
All right.
It could be that you might not trust Congress to get this right.
Right.

1115
01:11:47.281 --> 01:11:49.530
You might think they're going to come political considerations going on in

1116
01:11:49.531 --> 01:11:53.910
Congress other than just having an efficient tax system.
All right.

1117
01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:57.630
Okay,
so what do I want to draw out as lessons here?

1118
01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:02.760
The big lessons from this class are there are three different ways to think

1119
01:12:02.761 --> 01:12:05.520
about randomization and equilibrium or out of equilibrium.

1120
01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:07.950
One is it's genuinely randomisation.

1121
01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.710
Another is it could be something about people's beliefs.

1122
01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.700
And a third way and a very important way is it could be telling us something

1123
01:12:14.701 --> 01:12:19.680
about the proportion of people who are doing something in society,

1124
01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:24.990
in this case,
the proportion of people who are paying tax.
All right,

1125
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:29.700
and a second important lesson I want to draw out here beyond just finding

1126
01:12:29.701 --> 01:12:32.880
equilibria,
right?
Two other things we drew out today.

1127
01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:36.090
One lesson was when you're checking equilibria,

1128
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:38.490
checking mixed strategy equilibria,

1129
01:12:38.550 --> 01:12:43.260
you only have to check for pure strategy deviations.

1130
01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:47.790
Be careful.
You have to check for all possible pure strategy deviations,

1131
01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.400
not just the pure strategies that were involved in the mix.

1132
01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.640
If the guy has seven strategies and there's only mixing on too,

1133
01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:57.080
you have to remember to check the other five.
All right.

1134
01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:00.930
And the third lesson I want to draw up today is because of the way equilibria

1135
01:13:00.931 --> 01:13:02.670
work with mixed strategy,
equilibrium of work,

1136
01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:06.760
if I change the column players' payoffs,

1137
01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:10.470
it changes the role players,
equilibrium mix.

1138
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:13.680
And if I change the role players pay offs,

1139
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:17.010
it changes the column players equilibrium mix.

1140
01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:22.170
Next time we're going to pick up this idea that mixed strategies can be about

1141
01:13:22.171 --> 01:13:26.340
proportions of people playing things and take it to a totally different setting,

1142
01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:30.690
namely evolution.
So on Wednesday,
we'll start talking about evolution.
