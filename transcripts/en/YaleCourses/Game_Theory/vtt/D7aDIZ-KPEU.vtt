1
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.930
So today we have a lot of stuff to get through,

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.480
but it's all going to be fairly formal and we're not,
we're not,

3
00:00:06.481 --> 00:00:08.040
we're not gonna have time to play a game today.

4
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.980
So there's going to be a day we have to learn some new ideas.

5
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.040
So the reason we need to go through some new formal ideas today is we've kind of

6
00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:19.980
exhausted what we can do with the ideas we've gathered so far.

7
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.940
So just to bring us up to date where we are in the first half of the semester.

8
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:28.840
So before the midterm we looked at simultaneous move games and what,

9
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.910
where do you want this simultaneous move games were games where when I take my w

10
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:35.940
we're not,
when I make my choice,
I don't know what you've done.

11
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.870
And when you make your choice you don't know what I've done.
All right?

12
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.370
And since the mid term we've been looking at a simple examples of sequential

13
00:00:44.371 --> 00:00:45.204
move games,

14
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:50.130
sequential move games under perfect information in which I typically do know

15
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.270
what you did when,
when I get to make my choice.
All right.
And you know,

16
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:57.090
I'm going to know what you did when I get to make my choice.

17
00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.430
And what I want to be able to do moving forward is I want to be able to look at

18
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.280
strategic situations that combine those two settings.

19
00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:10.050
I want to go to analyze games which involve both sequential moves and

20
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.960
simultaneous move games.
All right?
Oh,

21
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.670
and in particular I want to see how we can extend the technique we've been

22
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:20.400
focusing on for the last few weeks,
which is backward induction.

23
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.480
I want us to see how we can extend the notion of backward induction to cope with

24
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:29.481
games with some parts of sequential and some parts are simultaneous.

25
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.450
Alright,

26
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.140
so we can look at a lot of examples and we're going to introduce some new ideas.

27
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.870
And I know you're trying to walk you through that today.
So that's our goal.

28
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.150
Let's start with an example.

29
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.190
So here's a very simple game in which player one moves first and has three

30
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:49.980
choices.
Let's call them upper,
middle and down,

31
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.020
and then play a two moves.
And player two has two choices

32
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.120
from each of these nodes and we'll call the choices suggestively up and down,

33
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.680
up and down,
and he will just call them left and right.
All right,

34
00:02:07.681 --> 00:02:09.210
in the payoffs are as follows,

35
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.930
four zero 0404401200 so this is just a standard game of perfect information,

36
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.350
much like all the games we've seen since the mid term effect.

37
00:02:27.351 --> 00:02:30.750
It's a relatively easy one.
So we know how to solve this game.

38
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.860
We sold this game using what?
Using backward induction.

39
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.930
And that isn't so hard here.
We know that play a to uh,

40
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.770
if pay or two finds herself up here,
she will choose for rather than zero.

41
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.160
If she finds herself here,
she'll choose for other than zero.

42
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.580
And if he finds herself here,
she'll choose two rather than one.

43
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.120
So player a one won't want to go up here because he'll get zero and he won't

44
00:02:56.611 --> 00:03:00.000
want to go into the middle because he'll get zero and he won't want to get.

45
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.750
And if it goes down a play,
one more shoes left and,
and play play one.

46
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.640
We'll get one play,
one more shoes down.

47
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.240
So backward induction predicts that player one chooses down and play at two

48
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.280
responds by choosing left and just staring at this a second notice that the

49
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:21.460
reason in this game,
it's taking a step back from back conduction a second.

50
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.730
The reason play a one did not want to choose either AARP or middle was because

51
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.970
that move was going to be observed by player too.

52
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.330
And in either case play it too was going to crush by a one,
right?

53
00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.270
So if player one went up,

54
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.560
play a two was playing this sort of stripping competitive game with player play

55
00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:44.620
a wine and play it play a two could design it could make a choice that God gave

56
00:03:44.621 --> 00:03:48.780
to four and one zero.
And conversely,
if player,
uh,

57
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.220
one shows middle player two could crush plant player one by choosing Aarp,

58
00:03:53.221 --> 00:03:56.860
which gave once again play a two four and player one zero.

59
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:01.420
So there was good reason here to avoid going into the part of the game following

60
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:03.970
up or middle.
And the reason was two weeks.

61
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.190
Two has a huge second mover advantage in those parts of the game that clear to

62
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:10.024
everybody.

63
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.920
So I now want to consider a similar but importantly different game.

64
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.240
So I'm going to draw the came again before joined him.
He said we're going to do,

65
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.050
so I want to,

66
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:25.050
I I want to introduce a new idea and the new idea is going to be that player to

67
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.520
player two will not be able to distinguish between AARP or metal just to say it

68
00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:32.884
again.

69
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.150
If player one chooses down play it too will observe that just as we've done

70
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:40.060
before and they'll put under in our standard perfect information games.

71
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.160
But if player one chooses either up or middle,
I want to capture the idea,

72
00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.240
the player to doesn't know which of those two choices was made,
right?

73
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.920
That's clearly going to change the game a lot.

74
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.610
And the first question is how do we represent that idea in a tree?

75
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.790
So let me try and show a good way to represent that in a tree.

76
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.520
The game has the same structure to it.
Play a one is again,

77
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:07.870
choosing between our Midland or down and play a two.

78
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.300
Once again,
it's choosing here,
up or down,

79
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:17.980
up or down and here,
left or rights.
And the payoffs haven't changed.

80
00:05:17.981 --> 00:05:22.981
They're still four zero 0440041200.

81
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:29.830
So that's exactly the same as you have in your notes already.

82
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.110
But now I want to to,

83
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.240
to adapt this tree to show how he indicates that plant to cannot distinguish,

84
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:42.511
cannot observe whether one shows up or middle but can observe if player one has

85
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:48.970
chosen down.
And the way we do that,
very simply,
we draw a dotted line

86
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.830
between the two nodes of player to between which two cannot distinguish.

87
00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:58.440
So this idea here,

88
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.470
what this dotted line indicates is that these two nodes are say in the same

89
00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.760
information sets.

90
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.980
So a new idea here is the idea of an information set.

91
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.910
<v 1>Uh,
I did.
I did.
I did,
I did.
Thank you.</v>

92
00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.420
Observe a four four zero.
Thank you.

93
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.460
<v 0>All right.
Pay For pay.
I was meant to be the same on the left is on the rise.</v>

94
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.670
All right,
so the idea here is that too

95
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.710
<v 1>play a two</v>

96
00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.930
<v 0>cannot distinguish</v>

97
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.670
<v 1>these two notes.</v>

98
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.520
<v 0>Plants,
who knows that she's in this information sites.</v>

99
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.810
She knows that player one must've chosen either up or metal.
She knows the play.

100
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:55.640
One did not choose down but she doesn't know whether she's really here

101
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:58.470
<v 1>or here.
Okay.</v>

102
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.540
<v 0>Now what happens in this game?
This game is a very different game.</v>

103
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.280
Why is it a different game?
What does trying to apply that loosen format,

104
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.620
that loosened tuition we applied,
we talked about before,

105
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:14.770
we said previously in the old game that if player one shows up to knew that

106
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:20.630
player wanted shows mop and observed that by choosing down play or two could

107
00:07:20.631 --> 00:07:25.300
crush one and if player one chose middle player too could observe that player

108
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:28.730
wanted chose metal and this time by choosing op could crush one.

109
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:34.690
The problem is that now in this new game play a two doesn't know whether he's

110
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.800
here,
whether she's here.

111
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.750
In which case you would want to choose down or here in which case you'd want to

112
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:42.584
choose out.

113
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.050
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

114
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.890
<v 0>Right.
So play as twos.
Choice is not so obvious anymore.
That's simple.</v>

115
00:07:47.891 --> 00:07:51.580
Backward induction arguments has disappeared.
Moreover,

116
00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.290
player one knows that player two will not be able to reserve between upper

117
00:07:56.291 --> 00:07:57.010
middle.

118
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.390
So it isn't necessarily the case that player one will want to choose down

119
00:08:01.391 --> 00:08:02.020
anymore.

120
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:06.340
It's still true that if plan one did shoes down that play a two would be able to

121
00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:09.700
observe that and we'll choose laughs.
So that part of the arguments are the same.

122
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:10.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

123
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.570
<v 0>What do you think's going to happen here?
Well,
we don't know,</v>

124
00:08:13.571 --> 00:08:17.620
but let me give a suggestion.
What might happen here.
Play a one might say,
hey,

125
00:08:17.621 --> 00:08:20.290
I could randomize between upper and middle.

126
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.070
I could choose half the time up and half the time.

127
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:26.980
Middle if I choose half the time up and half the time.

128
00:08:26.981 --> 00:08:30.610
Middle play a two isn't going to know in general isn't gonna isn't gonna know.

129
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.450
What I've done isn't quite clear what players two's going to do and since I'm

130
00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:37.000
randomizing between upper middle,
whatever player two is going to do,

131
00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.850
I'm going to get half the time,
four and half the time.

132
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:44.590
Zero for an expected value of two.
Right.
Just say it again.

133
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.600
So play a one might decide in this game to randomize 50,
50 between upper middle,

134
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.310
knowing that half the time,

135
00:08:51.311 --> 00:08:56.311
therefore he will get to over four and half the time he'll get for an expected

136
00:08:56.521 --> 00:09:01.350
value of two,
which notice is better,
is better than he got my choosing down.

137
00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.600
Alright,
so this change in this game,
changing the inflammation in this game,

138
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.590
not only the to a different game,
it led to a very different outcome.
All right,

139
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:13.560
so here,
here,

140
00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.850
one might for example,

141
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.250
might randomize

142
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:26.560
between up and middle.

143
00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.040
And over here we know exactly what one does.
One

144
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.900
chooses dialogue,
run,
chooses down.

145
00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:39.130
If we get very different outcomes because of this change information in the
gate.

146
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.940
And the theme of today is that inflammation is going to matter.

147
00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.540
The way we're going to model information is by thinking about these information

148
00:09:46.541 --> 00:09:48.310
sets.
And as we go through today,

149
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.610
I want to start giving you some formal definitions.
So this is the idea.

150
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:56.640
Now let's look at the formal definition.
Is he a lot of writing today?
So I hope,

151
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.620
hope.
Uh,

152
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:04.110
I hope you brought a notepad with some room on it.
Alright,

153
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.010
so the first formal definition of the day comes off that last example.

154
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:13.610
The full definition is the idea that I want to capture.

155
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:18.650
I want to capture the idea that players down the tree may not know exactly what

156
00:10:18.651 --> 00:10:22.430
was done up the tree and the formal definition is gonna is gonna go through the

157
00:10:22.431 --> 00:10:25.100
idea of an information session.

158
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.050
So an information set
off player.

159
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:37.970
I in this case,
both planning to but more generally of player.
All right.

160
00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:43.180
Is a collection or a set if you like,

161
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.440
it's a collection of player eyes.

162
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.043
<v 1>No,</v>

163
00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:59.180
<v 0>between went or I guess it could be more than two.
So let's say a manwich</v>

164
00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.500
among which I

165
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.050
cannot distinguish.

166
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.280
<v 1>All
right.</v>

167
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.940
<v 0>It's the turnout that by clever use of information stats,</v>

168
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.300
we're going to be able to use our technology.
Yeah.

169
00:11:19.301 --> 00:11:24.170
Technology of drawing trees to capture all sorts of interesting and increasingly

170
00:11:24.171 --> 00:11:28.880
complicated information settings.
All right.
In this particular game,

171
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:33.940
it's the case the player one knew that player to was not going to be able to

172
00:11:34.191 --> 00:11:38.990
distinguish within upon metal in this tree and player one knew the player too

173
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.770
would be able to distinguish and the lefthand tree we can even use information

174
00:11:42.771 --> 00:11:46.760
sets in a more laboratory to capture the idea that player one may not know what

175
00:11:46.761 --> 00:11:48.740
patty was going to know and I won't do that now.

176
00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:53.410
I'll lead that later and you'll see some examples of that on the homework,
right?

177
00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.420
So we have our formal definition.

178
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.970
This is going to be all the first of our big tools of the day.

179
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.170
But let me just put down a few things that we have to be careful about.

180
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:05.920
A couple of rules.
So these information sets have to obey certain rules

181
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:12.100
and certain things are not allowed,
certain things are not allowed.

182
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.680
So in particular the following is not allowed.

183
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:20.160
Here's a tree in which plan one moves first and play at too does not observe

184
00:12:20.771 --> 00:12:24.820
player ones move.
So these two nodes are player two's nodes.

185
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.130
Between where they are.
The same information stats,

186
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.040
which means player two is not meant to be able to distinguish between these two

187
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:33.790
nodes and suppose new over the tree looked like this.

188
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:36.303
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

189
00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.680
<v 0>Okay,
so I claim that this is,
this is crazy.
We couldn't allow this.</v>

190
00:12:40.681 --> 00:12:43.590
It wouldn't make any sense to allow this.
Can you want to see why?

191
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:47.310
Why wouldn't it?
Why?
Why is this not really a sensible tree?

192
00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:48.990
You want to see that?

193
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.650
<v 1>Okay.</v>

194
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.080
<v 0>Why is that not a sensible tree?
Here's the,
yeah,
don't want to grab somebody.</v>

195
00:12:53.081 --> 00:12:55.840
Yeah,
it was just the guy behind his.
Yep.
That's okay.
That's great.

196
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.660
Shout out a player to knows that he has three choices.

197
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.620
Then he'll know he's at the top.
Knowed exactly.
Exactly.
In this tree you haven't,

198
00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.500
but the payoff sin.

199
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:08.820
But if player to play at Psu observes that she has three choices,

200
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.170
she knows she must be at the top node.
If she observes she has two choices,

201
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.320
she must be at the bottom node.
All right,
so in this,
in this tree,

202
00:13:17.321 --> 00:13:22.270
it was supposed to be the case that two didn't know whether she was here or
here,

203
00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.150
but merely by observing how many choices she has,

204
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.090
she could infer whether she was at the top note on the bottom node.

205
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.190
So that can't make any sense.
So this is not allowed.

206
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.020
So we'll put a great cross through that one.

207
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:36.370
Now the second thing that's not allowed is a little bit more subtle and actually

208
00:13:36.371 --> 00:13:38.950
it's an interesting thing mean this is just kind of bookkeeping.

209
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.370
But the second thing is more interesting.
So let's have a look at it.

210
00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.210
Here's a more interesting tree.

211
00:13:45.211 --> 00:13:50.211
You play a one loose first player to observes that move Orion player to move

212
00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:52.194
second

213
00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.480
and then at the bottom of this

214
00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.000
play a woman may have another shelter to move again.

215
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.020
So again,
I haven't been payoffs in here.

216
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.983
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

217
00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.290
<v 0>wait,
one moves first,</v>

218
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:13.670
play a tooth loose second and if play out two shoes is down here or up there,

219
00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:15.590
then player one gets to move again.

220
00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.220
Now I claim again that this is not a sensible tree.

221
00:14:19.221 --> 00:14:22.100
It's not a sensible arrangement of information.
Sense.

222
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:26.550
Can anyone see why this isn't a sensible,
why has this not sensible?
Yeah,
Stephen.

223
00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:27.530
Yeah.
Shout it out.

224
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:31.880
Player one knows what node he's at based on the first choice anyway.
Exactly.

225
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:36.900
Exactly.
So to get to the upper node here,
for player one player,

226
00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.240
one must have chosen up before and to get to the lower note here,

227
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.670
player one must've played down before.

228
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:48.620
So provided the player one remembers his or her own move.

229
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.710
She knows where she is that I have to provide the player.

230
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.570
One can recall what she herself did earlier on the tree.

231
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.500
She should be able to distinguish these things.
So we're going to rule this out,

232
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:02.660
but I just want to make a remark here.

233
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:07.070
There's an assumption in rolling it out and the assumption is we're assuming,

234
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.650
perfect recall or perfect memory.

235
00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:11.853
<v 1>Okay.</v>

236
00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:16.940
<v 0>We're assuming perfect recall.
And people don't always in the real world,
uh,</v>

237
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.070
players don't always have perfect recall.

238
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:21.530
There are two reasons and we we're always going to assume this.

239
00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:22.550
Let me just make a remark.

240
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.580
There are two reasons why people might not have perfect recall.

241
00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.810
One reason is like me,
they're getting old,
right?

242
00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:32.210
They simply can't remember what they did yesterday.
All right?

243
00:15:32.211 --> 00:15:33.350
So when I'm driving home,

244
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:37.950
I know roughly how many traffic lights I have to go through before I turn
rights.

245
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.340
Uh,

246
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:41.930
but I sometimes forget which traffic late I'm at and I turned right too early or

247
00:15:41.931 --> 00:15:44.480
too late.
All right,
that doesn't happen to you guys.

248
00:15:44.481 --> 00:15:46.340
What happens to me as I'm getting a bit?
So,
you know,
all right,

249
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:51.341
so old age would rule out perfect recall and more important example perhaps is

250
00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.730
if players of games are themselves institutions,

251
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:59.660
it's sometimes useful.
And we'd often talked about it in this class to a mansion,

252
00:15:59.661 --> 00:16:04.661
a player of a game being a firm or a country or some kind of institution in

253
00:16:05.331 --> 00:16:09.610
which the actual decisions maybe being taken by different plans,

254
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:13.520
different actual people within the firm,
institutional country.
Right?

255
00:16:13.521 --> 00:16:18.020
And this assumption of perfect recall is saying that the players within the

256
00:16:18.021 --> 00:16:21.890
institution knew what the other players within that same institution we're
doing,

257
00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.910
right?
So if we,
if we're modeling a General Motors,
there's one player.

258
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:30.440
This assumption is assuming that the chief financial officer and the chief

259
00:16:30.441 --> 00:16:34.310
executive officer of GM or observing each other's actions are on the same page.

260
00:16:34.311 --> 00:16:36.660
The left hand knows what the right hand's doing.
All right.

261
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:38.840
We are typically going to assume that,
but just to make the point,

262
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.780
it isn't assumption.
All right,
and it's quite interesting.

263
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.350
Just see what happens if you were an accent.
All right,
so with that in mind,

264
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:47.060
we can move to our next definition,

265
00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.380
and this is something I've referred to early on in the class,

266
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.720
but I want to be format.
I know he can be formal.

267
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.430
We've talked to her on this class about the idea of perfect

268
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.300
<v 1>information.</v>

269
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.320
<v 0>So for example,
when we talked about zoom mellows Theorem,</v>

270
00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.370
we talked about games have perfect information and we sit in formally what this

271
00:17:10.371 --> 00:17:15.230
was a game of perfect information is a game where each player in the game can

272
00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:19.370
observe all previous moves.
All right?
That's it.
That was our informal definition,

273
00:17:19.580 --> 00:17:21.710
but we can now give a formal definition.

274
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:27.010
Very simply perfect information as to is is a setting where all information sets

275
00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.860
or information sets

276
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:35.730
in the tree

277
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.730
games have perfect information games where all inflammation sets in.
The

278
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:41.683
<v 1>Trey</v>

279
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:48.490
<v 0>contain just one note.</v>

280
00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:55.430
All right?
It will be a clear head.
So what we're saying here is here,

281
00:17:55.431 --> 00:17:58.550
if we have a tree in which every information said is a single tenant,

282
00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.680
we basically never bother with any dotted lines.

283
00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.360
That's a game of perfect information.

284
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.000
And that shouldn't be a surprise to anybody here cause that's exactly how we

285
00:18:05.001 --> 00:18:07.430
drew trees since the mid south.
Is that right?

286
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:12.050
Of course the novelty is we're now going to be allowed to look at games of

287
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:17.290
imperfect information,
right?

288
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:21.960
The reason we're doing this is because it will be interesting as an example,

289
00:18:21.961 --> 00:18:25.650
we just see you to think about games where information is not perfect.

290
00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.760
So what is the definition of imperfect information?
Imperfect information.

291
00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:33.240
Formal definition is not perfect.
Inflammation,

292
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.040
all right?
We define what perfect information is.

293
00:18:40.041 --> 00:18:43.850
Imperfect information is the rest high.
In the real world.

294
00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.880
There's a lot of games,
the turnout to have imperfect information.

295
00:18:46.881 --> 00:18:50.720
There's lots of strategic situations where I'm going to be able to observe some

296
00:18:50.721 --> 00:18:52.670
of the things that you've done,
but other things,

297
00:18:52.671 --> 00:18:53.750
I won't know quite what you've done.

298
00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:55.803
<v 1>Okay.</v>

299
00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:00.260
<v 0>Okay.
Let's go straight to an example.
All right,
so I,</v>

300
00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.480
I don't think we really need to keep that definition very focal so it's get rid

301
00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:04.314
of that mod.

302
00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:08.373
<v 1>Okay.</v>

303
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.060
<v 0>All right.
Let's do an example in many examples today.</v>

304
00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.010
All right,
so this example is going to be a tree

305
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.150
in which player one of the moves first.

306
00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:23.560
<v 1>Okay.</v>

307
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:28.120
<v 0>Plant to cannot observe this move and sometimes rather than leaving both of</v>

308
00:19:28.121 --> 00:19:32.440
these nodes with a two,
I'll just put a two on the information set,
right?

309
00:19:32.441 --> 00:19:36.580
So just to indicate that both of these nodes along to play or to supply or to

310
00:19:36.581 --> 00:19:38.780
move seconds and we'll call player ones,

311
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:43.830
move up or down and we'll call play a tos move left or right,

312
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.410
kind of suggestively

313
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.580
<v 1>left or right.
Okay.</v>

314
00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:53.140
<v 0>So what's the information said here?</v>

315
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.200
The information set is indicating the fact that player to cannot observe whether

316
00:19:58.781 --> 00:20:03.781
player one moved up or down player to cannot observe whether player one shows up

317
00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:10.570
or down.
I know what does that mask,
I hadn't with the payoffs in yet,

318
00:20:10.571 --> 00:20:15.430
but I want a second it masters because had this game in the game of perfect

319
00:20:15.431 --> 00:20:19.470
information had this information set.
Had there been two information sets here,

320
00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:20.920
this dotted line not been there.

321
00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:26.280
Then player two could have chosen separately whether to choose left or right at

322
00:20:26.771 --> 00:20:29.950
this node or left or right and left or right at this mode,

323
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.500
but since player to doesn't know whether she's at the upper node or the lower

324
00:20:35.501 --> 00:20:38.110
nodes,
he doesn't know where the player one she's up or down.

325
00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:41.650
She really only has one choice to make here.
She's,

326
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.720
Oh the choosing it left at both nodes or she's choosing right at notes and just

327
00:20:48.671 --> 00:20:51.100
to pull it back to our first example in the class

328
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:55.960
we saw this same feature.

329
00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.960
Then when we moved from a game of perfect information to a game of imperfect

330
00:21:01.361 --> 00:21:02.194
information,

331
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:07.530
we reduced the choices available for player to hear play two could choose

332
00:21:07.781 --> 00:21:11.590
separately up or down at these two different nodes,

333
00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:14.860
but here play a two only makes one choice.

334
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:19.000
That has to apply to both nodes because player too can not distinguish those two

335
00:21:19.001 --> 00:21:21.040
notes.
All right,

336
00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:24.220
so let's have a look and see once we put some payoffs on it,

337
00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:28.410
what it does in this particular game.
All right,
so here's some payoffs.

338
00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.920
Two to minus one three three minus one n zero zero

339
00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:40.750
all right.
Once again,

340
00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:45.730
play a two cannot separately choose at the upper node or the lower node.

341
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:49.120
She's either choosing left or she's choosing,
right,

342
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:55.120
but it turns out that this game is a little easier than the game we started
with.

343
00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.600
Why is it easier than the game we started with?
It's easy.

344
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:02.260
The game that we started with because from player to his point of view,

345
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:07.470
whether she thinks she's up here or whether she thinks she's down here,

346
00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.980
she has the same best choice.
Any of the case.

347
00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.160
If she thinks she's at the upper node,

348
00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.240
then by choosing left she'll get to and right,
she'll get three.

349
00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.170
So rates seems better if she thinks she's at the lower node,

350
00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:27.640
then choosing left gets minus one and right get zero.
So once again,

351
00:22:27.641 --> 00:22:30.430
right is better.
So in fact,
in this particular game,

352
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:35.480
regardless of whether a player to thinks that play or one shows up and hence

353
00:22:35.481 --> 00:22:39.160
she's at the upper node or the thick player to thinks the player one shows down

354
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:42.520
and hence is at the lower node play a two is going to make the same choice in

355
00:22:42.521 --> 00:22:44.710
this game,
namely,
right?

356
00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:49.720
So notice that this particular game actually souls out rather like backward

357
00:22:49.721 --> 00:22:51.540
induction rather light back from March.

358
00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.850
We actually know even though even though play a tos choice is a little bit more

359
00:22:54.851 --> 00:22:56.410
complicated that she doesn't know where she is,

360
00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.690
it's actually clear what player were to,
we'll do a at this inflammation status.

361
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.700
Now we pushed this forward a little bit harder.

362
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:08.760
We can see why play a one in this game has two strategies are up or down and

363
00:23:09.671 --> 00:23:11.890
play of two has two strategies.

364
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.610
She either shoes his left or right and there's just only has two strategies

365
00:23:15.611 --> 00:23:17.980
cause he has to choose the same thing at these two nodes.

366
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.790
It doesn't know where she is.
All right?
Okay,

367
00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.150
so let's turn up the Matrix for this game and see if it looks familiar.

368
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:32.560
All right.
It's a play.
A one is choosing between up or down and play.

369
00:23:32.561 --> 00:23:37.240
It too is choosing between left or rights and the payoffs are as follows.

370
00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:42.300
Up left is two two uprights is minus one three down left is three minus one and

371
00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.570
downright is zero zero

372
00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.713
<v 2>right?</v>

373
00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:55.770
<v 0>Is there as the rest of,
what game is this?</v>

374
00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.030
It wasn't meant to be a trick question.
So somebody uh,

375
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:04.580
somebody wave at I'm an hour.
What game is this?
Shout it out here.

376
00:24:04.581 --> 00:24:07.470
Like this,
this prisoner's dilemma,
right?
This is a,

377
00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:12.380
this is an old friend of ours is this prisoner's dilemma.
Again,

378
00:24:12.381 --> 00:24:17.210
we were sort of very first day,
but notice what are we seeing here?

379
00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:21.050
This is prisoner's dilemma that we have seen many,
many times.

380
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:25.880
That's almost a unbearably familiar to most of you,
right?

381
00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:29.570
In the hinge prisoner's dilemma as represented the way in which we've talked

382
00:24:29.571 --> 00:24:31.160
about games before the midterm,

383
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:34.910
but here is the same game.

384
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:37.280
This is also prisoner's dilemma,

385
00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:42.170
but now I've drawn in a tree here I do it in a matrix and here I drove in a

386
00:24:42.171 --> 00:24:44.510
tree.
Now that we have information sets,

387
00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:49.050
we can represent all the games that we studied before the mid term.

388
00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:51.560
All the games that were simultaneous move games.

389
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:55.730
We can study using trees by building inflammation says,

390
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:58.850
I watch the key observation here.

391
00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.880
It doesn't really matter whether player one moves first or pay or two moves

392
00:25:04.551 --> 00:25:08.690
fast.
It doesn't really matter what's happening temporarily in this game.

393
00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:13.910
What matters is inflammation.
When player one makes her move,

394
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:18.790
she doesn't know what player is going to do,
alright,
and Po,
it doesn't do it to,

395
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:21.350
is doing.
And when player too,
he makes her move.

396
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:25.460
She doesn't know what one is doing right?
And that's a simultaneous moved game.

397
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:30.210
Even if time is passing,
the key is information,
not uh,

398
00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:34.580
not time.
All right?
Now on the way here,

399
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.420
I snuck something in and I should just tell you what I smack him.

400
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.130
I snuck in what a strategy is.

401
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:44.060
I went from a tree or an extensive form game,

402
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:45.950
two or normal form game,

403
00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.380
and we've already done that a couple of times before in the class.

404
00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:52.490
We did it with the entry game for example,
uh,
about a week ago.
All right?

405
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.480
But they're,

406
00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:58.010
all we did was we defined what a strategy was in a game of perfect information.

407
00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.510
And just to remind you a strategy and a game of perfect information is a

408
00:26:02.511 --> 00:26:04.190
complete plan of action.

409
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:09.490
It tells the player and question what they should do at each of the nodes high.

410
00:26:10.911 --> 00:26:15.310
But now we have to be more careful.
We can't have a strategy.
It works.

411
00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:16.790
Once we moved to imperfect information,

412
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:20.360
we can't have a strategy tells you what to do at each of your nodes because you

413
00:26:20.361 --> 00:26:23.480
yourself can't distinguish between those nodes.
All right?
It's,

414
00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:25.250
we need to adapt our motion,

415
00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:29.240
our definition of a strategy to make it appropriate for these more complicated

416
00:26:29.241 --> 00:26:34.010
games.
So let's just adapted in the obvious way.
Definition

417
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.740
definition.
I'll just define pure strategy has been help.

418
00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:44.340
A pure strategy,
a pure strategy,

419
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:47.340
all plan.
I

420
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:50.003
<v 1>is</v>

421
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:53.290
<v 0>a complete plan of action.
So this is the same as before.</v>

422
00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.540
It's a complete plan of action.

423
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:00.690
It's a complete plan of action.

424
00:27:00.810 --> 00:27:02.810
What does it mean to be a complete plan of action?
It cold.

425
00:27:02.811 --> 00:27:06.320
Tell me what to do at every single node.
Uh,
it,
that,

426
00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:08.610
that can't be the right definition because I cannot distinguish node.

427
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:13.470
So all it can be doing is telling me what to do at each information set.
Alright,

428
00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.790
so it's specifies,

429
00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.130
<v 1>it specifies</v>

430
00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.540
what
player I

431
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:27.960
should do

432
00:27:30.770 --> 00:27:33.140
<v 0>should,
perhaps this is the wrong word as I say.
We'll do,</v>

433
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:39.020
<v 1>we'll do
at each</v>

434
00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.750
of eyes.
Information says,

435
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.980
<v 0>all right,
so you go back,
uh,</v>

436
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.110
about a week you'll see almost exactly the same definition of a strategy,

437
00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:01.520
but the previous definition told I want to do at each node.

438
00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:04.150
And this one just tells you what to do at each information center.

439
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:08.480
What I'm doing is tidying up the previous definition so we can apply it to the

440
00:28:08.481 --> 00:28:13.190
more interesting games.
We're going to look out for an hour.
All right,

441
00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:18.370
so now we have the definition of a strategy.
We can,
uh,
we can,

442
00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:21.410
we can carry on the idea we've just seen here.
So what's the idea here?

443
00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:25.040
Any game you give me in the form of a tree,

444
00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:29.930
I can rewrite the game in the form of a matrix.
All right,

445
00:28:29.931 --> 00:28:31.520
so let's see some other examples.

446
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.633
<v 1>That idea,</v>

447
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.360
<v 0>that's a lot of new ideas today,</v>

448
00:28:52.361 --> 00:28:56.710
but some of them are just tidying up and kind of bookkeeping and some of them

449
00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.370
are more interesting.
All right?

450
00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:04.690
So let's start with a tree that's make a slightly more interesting tree than the

451
00:29:04.691 --> 00:29:06.910
one we've seen before.
Actually,
that's too interesting.

452
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.033
<v 1>That's,</v>

453
00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:14.010
<v 0>let's go back a little bit slower.
So let's have player one have two choices</v>

454
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.260
and play a to have three choices.

455
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.360
All right,
so here's a simple tree and let's put some payoffs in.

456
00:29:24.450 --> 00:29:27.270
But let me just put some letters in for payoffs rather than putting in numbers.

457
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:27.811
All right.

458
00:29:27.811 --> 00:29:32.811
So we'll call these actions upon down and we'll call this action left middle and

459
00:29:32.941 --> 00:29:35.430
right and left middle and right.

460
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:40.790
And we'll call the payoffs a one a two B one B two c one c two d one d two e one

461
00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:50.300
e two e and f one F two.
Alright,

462
00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:55.380
so just to keep track of it and I want to show you how we take this tree and

463
00:29:55.571 --> 00:29:59.110
turn it into a matrix.
All right,
so how do we,

464
00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:02.890
how do we turn into a matrix where we look and say how many strategies is play a

465
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:06.920
one God and how many strategies player to got?
So play a one.

466
00:30:06.921 --> 00:30:11.320
The here just has two strategies up or down and play.

467
00:30:11.321 --> 00:30:15.580
A two has three strategies,
either left,

468
00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:19.780
middle or right.
Again,
they can't choose separately at these two nodes.

469
00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:23.170
So they really just have three choices left,
middle or right.

470
00:30:23.550 --> 00:30:25.790
Leave a space here in your note book.

471
00:30:25.791 --> 00:30:29.860
Leave a space to the right here and it's draw the Matrix for this tree down
here.

472
00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.030
All right,
so here's my matrix.

473
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:40.960
Player two is choosing left middle or right,
and play on.

474
00:30:40.961 --> 00:30:45.940
One is choosing up or down.
All right?

475
00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:49.900
And the payoffs are go in as a in the obvious way.
So a one,

476
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:53.950
a two B,
one B,

477
00:30:53.951 --> 00:30:58.951
two c one c two d one d two e one e two e and f one F two.

478
00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:07.150
All right,
so everyone understands.
That was a simple exercise.

479
00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.760
Just show we can to go from an extensive,

480
00:31:09.761 --> 00:31:14.320
for a tree to the normal form,
the matrix.
All right?

481
00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:18.190
However,
I guess that was easy,
right?
However,

482
00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:20.110
there's an interesting thing here.

483
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:25.480
It isn't all of this that this is it.
If I just gave you the matrix,

484
00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:29.290
it isn't obvious that this is the tree from which it came.

485
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:34.770
Let me draw another tree that I claim correspondence to that same matrix,

486
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.860
right?
Here's another tree.
So this other tree,

487
00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.320
instead of having play a one Lou first,

488
00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:45.560
it's going to have player to first player too,

489
00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:50.610
but to have three choices and we'd better call them left middle and right,

490
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.510
and it better be the case.
That player one

491
00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:02.630
is in one big information set and play a one only has two choices which will

492
00:32:03.161 --> 00:32:05.260
call up and down.

493
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:09.520
Right?
Cause that's what this matrix is telling us.

494
00:32:09.521 --> 00:32:13.270
It's telling us player to had three choices and plan what I pay two or three

495
00:32:13.271 --> 00:32:16.540
choices and payer one at two choices.
So that's true in the,
in the,

496
00:32:16.541 --> 00:32:19.650
in the Matrix I've drawn and it's been a little bit careful where the payoffs

497
00:32:19.660 --> 00:32:24.280
are so left up.
That's easy.
That's going to be a one.

498
00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:29.530
A two left down is going to be d one

499
00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:36.090
d two Middle Aarp is going to be B one B two middle down it's going to be e one

500
00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:40.880
e to uh,

501
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:46.150
write up is going to be c one c two and write down is going to be f one F two.

502
00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.500
It had to be a little bit careful what I put the pay offs but I think that's

503
00:32:51.501 --> 00:32:56.120
right.
I just did.
And notice that what I did here,
I started from this tree.

504
00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:00.620
It was an easy operation to construct the matrix so easy that it was kind of

505
00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:05.740
boring and it's not that hard to see things go the other way and construct this

506
00:33:05.871 --> 00:33:08.120
other tree from,
from the Matrix.

507
00:33:08.150 --> 00:33:12.470
This is also a tree in which player to history strategies and play out at one.

508
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.980
This is all player one Az,
two strategies.
All right,

509
00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.870
so what?
What do we learn from this,
right?

510
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:22.190
What does this look at this more carefully.

511
00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:27.790
This tree is a tree in which player one moved first and play a two didn't

512
00:33:30.651 --> 00:33:33.620
observe player one's choice.
All right?

513
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:40.120
This is a tree in which plant to move first and play a one didn't observe two's

514
00:33:42.081 --> 00:33:45.680
choice,
right?
What are we noticing here?

515
00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:51.830
They're really the same game.
There's no difference between these two games,

516
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:55.190
all right?
They're really the same game.

517
00:33:55.191 --> 00:33:59.990
It doesn't matter whether it's player one moving first and play a two who's

518
00:33:59.991 --> 00:34:04.850
unable to observe once choice or whether it's player two's moving first and play

519
00:34:04.851 --> 00:34:07.700
a woman who is unable to observe two's choice.

520
00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.090
My all the matters is that neither play.

521
00:34:10.091 --> 00:34:12.590
I could observe the other person's choice before they got to move.

522
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.690
They both correspond to exactly the same,
the same game.

523
00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:20.540
All right,
so what's the message here?

524
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:22.610
The message is something we've talked about before in the class.

525
00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:26.810
Trying to be a bit more formal about it.
The message is that what matters,

526
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:32.540
what matters
is information.

527
00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:39.640
Well mine is,
is information,
not time,

528
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:45.290
not time.
Clearly time.
You couldn't,
anytime,

529
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:48.350
isn't it an irrelevant thing?
I couldn't know something that hasn't happened yet.

530
00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.680
All right?
It's a time is going to have an effect on inflammation.

531
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:54.670
But ultimately what matters is information of what do we know and when did I

532
00:34:54.671 --> 00:34:56.650
know it?
All right?

533
00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:01.870
So the key idea there we're trying to capture with these information sets just

534
00:35:01.871 --> 00:35:04.480
repeats is warranted the plan though.

535
00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:08.980
And when did they know it right now a famous expression from the Watergate

536
00:35:08.981 --> 00:35:12.690
trials.
Okay,

537
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:15.790
well let's look at a more interesting example and see if we can actually talk

538
00:35:15.791 --> 00:35:16.990
about what's going to happen in these games.

539
00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:17.923
<v 1>Awesome.</v>

540
00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.840
<v 0>Because by the end of the day,</v>

541
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:27.800
I want to have enough machinery so we can actually start analyzing these games.

542
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:29.240
And predicting what's going to happen.

543
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:43.920
All right,
so as we go on we'll get more complicated.

544
00:35:43.921 --> 00:35:46.890
So that's getting a little more complicated.
Now once again,

545
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:51.630
here's a game in which player one is going to have two choices and we'll call

546
00:35:51.631 --> 00:35:55.560
those choices up or down and it's getting some of the [inaudible] and once
again,

547
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.610
play a two is going to move next and now this time just to keep things simple,

548
00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:03.210
we'll have player to just have two choices left or right,

549
00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:08.100
left or right,
but now to make things more interesting,

550
00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:09.810
but let's have play a one move again.

551
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:15.750
If up rights happens,
then play a one gets to move again.

552
00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:20.700
In which case play a one is going to choose up or down and I'll use a little

553
00:36:20.701 --> 00:36:25.140
view and a little d to distinguish it from the worms are further to the left of

554
00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:28.860
the tree.
All right.
She's a very simple tree.

555
00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:32.190
Play a one moves first player to move second.

556
00:36:32.191 --> 00:36:36.960
I forgot to put a two in here and then if up right as occurred,

557
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:39.750
then player one gets to move again.
Let's get some payoffs.

558
00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:45.120
So let's have this be four two zero zero

559
00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:51.780
one four
zero,
zero again

560
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.473
and to full.

561
00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:56.030
<v 1>Okay.</v>

562
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.780
<v 0>All right,</v>

563
00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:01.220
let's just carry on analyzing this game using exactly the methods we've been

564
00:37:01.221 --> 00:37:03.440
talking about in the class today.
So far.

565
00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:08.480
So the first thing I'm going to do is I want to turn this into a matrix or turn

566
00:37:08.481 --> 00:37:10.600
this into a matrix.
And the first thing to do on the,

567
00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:15.630
on that route is to try and figure out how many strategies does play a one have

568
00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.970
and how many strategies that have play a two half.
All right?

569
00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:21.470
And before we even do that,

570
00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:25.070
let's try and figure out how many inflammation steps they have.
All right,

571
00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:30.310
so I claimed the player to just has the one information set is that right place.

572
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.720
He just has the one information site,

573
00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:38.000
but play a one has two information sets this information set at the beginning of

574
00:37:38.001 --> 00:37:38.780
the game,

575
00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:43.340
and then potentially the second information set down further down the tree.

576
00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:44.870
All right.

577
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:49.870
As strategy ms tell you ever miss a strategy must tell the player what to do at

578
00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:55.460
each of their information sets.
So the strategies for playout and one

579
00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:02.980
strategies for player one,
I'll walk,
well,

580
00:38:02.981 --> 00:38:07.690
one strategy is up and then up again.

581
00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:13.920
Another strategy is up and then writes another strategy is down and then up on

582
00:38:18.131 --> 00:38:21.190
the fourth strategy is down.
And then right,

583
00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:24.700
I knew is something which we've seen already in this class before.

584
00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:29.500
There's a little bit of a redundancy here.
These two down strategies,

585
00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:34.190
these two down strategies,
uh,
forced the game into a,

586
00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:39.300
forced the game into part of the tree where this node will not arise less

587
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:42.580
grandly if play a one chooses down,

588
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:44.410
she knows that she won't have to,

589
00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:47.530
she won't have to make a choice of up or down later on.
J

590
00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:55.700
<v 2>thank you.
Sorry.
Thank you.
Thanks Jake.</v>

591
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:58.380
<v 0>All right,
let me start again.
Was actually the wrong rotation.
All right.</v>

592
00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.850
It's a player.
One's choices are up and then up,

593
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:06.590
up and then down,
down and then up and down and then down.

594
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:09.520
<v 2>Thanks,
Jake.
Sorry.
All right.</v>

595
00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.440
<v 0>And why are the four strategies,</v>

596
00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:16.730
it's a bit of a surprise perhaps because if player one chooses down,

597
00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:20.120
then she knows she will never have to make a choice at her.

598
00:39:20.121 --> 00:39:23.420
Second information says nevertheless.
Nevertheless,

599
00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:26.180
we write down every week when we write down a strategy,

600
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:29.780
we have to write down an instruction for every single information sets.

601
00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:33.150
So we include both of those strategies.
Strategies for play.

602
00:39:33.151 --> 00:39:38.151
A two here are a little bit easier scratches for player to adjust left or right.

603
00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:40.430
<v 2>Okay.</v>

604
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:44.060
<v 0>All right.
With that in mind,
let's draw up the matrix.</v>

605
00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:46.400
<v 2>Okay,</v>

606
00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.800
<v 0>so play a one here has</v>

607
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:51.080
<v 2>okay.</v>

608
00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:55.260
<v 0>Uh,
four strategies and they are up,</v>

609
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:59.880
up,
up,
down,
down,

610
00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:03.990
up and down,
down and play.

611
00:40:03.991 --> 00:40:07.410
A two has two strategies and they all left or writes

612
00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:13.440
hi everyone.
A case they're fun with.
Just basically transferring things across.

613
00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:17.250
And then we have to convince where the payoffs across.
So up,
up,

614
00:40:17.251 --> 00:40:22.140
followed by left is going to be for two,
uh,
up,

615
00:40:22.141 --> 00:40:26.640
up,
followed by rights is going to be zero up,

616
00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:31.620
up,
right,
resisting.
He was upright.
UPS operate up.
Is there a zero.

617
00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:33.000
<v 2>Okay.</v>

618
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.300
<v 0>Uh,
up left armpit down,
laughed as the same as up,</v>

619
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.630
left down to it.

620
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:40.770
<v 2>Skin fool too.</v>

621
00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:46.810
<v 0>Up Down Rights is going to be up right down so it's going to be one</v>

622
00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:48.163
<v 2>four</v>

623
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:54.310
<v 0>down.
Up left is the same as saying down left,
so it's going to be zero,
zero.</v>

624
00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:59.090
All right.
Down up rights is going to be too far

625
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:05.240
down.
Down left is,
once again,
I'm going to be a zero,

626
00:41:05.241 --> 00:41:10.190
zero and down.
Down right is once again going to be two fold,

627
00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:12.950
right?
Does everyone see how I got the payoffs?

628
00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:17.030
I just use those strategies to tell me which way I'm going through the tree.

629
00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.620
If I combine them,
it gives me an entire path and gets me to an end node.

630
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:22.120
<v 2>Okay?</v>

631
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.250
<v 0>All right.
And you can see this redundancy we talked about,</v>

632
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:27.830
we pointed out that these things,

633
00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:34.250
I kind of the same thing and you can see in the matrix that the bottom four

634
00:41:34.251 --> 00:41:39.010
squares of the matrix have repetition,
right?
This row is the same as that,
right?

635
00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:44.150
Alright.
Never happy with that.
Okay.
We have a matrix.

636
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:48.970
Let's analyze it by finding the Nash Equilibria.
In this game.

637
00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.460
All right.
Sort of find the,
now she could have written this game.

638
00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.860
We're going to find best responses.
All right,

639
00:41:54.861 --> 00:41:59.861
so does it start by asking what is the best response to left so of player to

640
00:42:00.041 --> 00:42:05.041
choose his left play on one's best response is either up for opt down if player,

641
00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:07.450
uh,

642
00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:12.450
to choose chooses rights than player one's best response is either down or up or

643
00:42:13.041 --> 00:42:16.250
down.
Down.
All right,
we're okay so far.

644
00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:18.140
All right.

645
00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:22.700
If play a one chooses up up then play a two is going to choose left.

646
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:28.460
If play on one chooses up down than player two's best responses to choose
rights.

647
00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:33.170
If play a one chooses down up than play a tos,
best responses to choose rights.

648
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.280
And if play a one chooses down down than plant two's best responses to choose.

649
00:42:37.281 --> 00:42:41.630
Right?
All right,
so this is kind of slow and I just want to be,
be careful.

650
00:42:41.631 --> 00:42:42.650
I'm being slow for a reason.

651
00:42:42.651 --> 00:42:44.810
It's really what we're going to ground you to get harder.

652
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.880
I want to be able to care for.

653
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:47.540
You can see people looking at little sleepy around the room.

654
00:42:47.541 --> 00:42:50.390
I know it's of lunchtime.
If you see your neighbor getting sleepy,

655
00:42:50.391 --> 00:42:52.830
give them a good sharp elbow because I think this is,

656
00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.740
this isn't a good time to fall asleep.

657
00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:57.590
Sometimes I'm worried you're going to miss something and it's not going to get

658
00:42:57.591 --> 00:43:00.050
harder.
They're gonna mess.
Thanks.
All right,

659
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.890
so what are the Nash Equilibrium in this game?
We knew how to do that.

660
00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:08.810
The Nash equilibrium must be up,
up,

661
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.000
followed by left.

662
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:14.900
Try getting them all down,

663
00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:17.333
up,

664
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:22.790
followed by right and down.

665
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.260
Down,
followed by,
right.

666
00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:30.920
All right.
What?
These three Nash equilibrium.

667
00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.760
Okay,
so that wasn't,
so that's a big deal.

668
00:43:34.761 --> 00:43:39.680
I got three clever in this game and if I had simply given you this game in the

669
00:43:39.681 --> 00:43:43.950
first half of the semester,
I hadn't shown you the tree.
You never seen this tree?

670
00:43:43.951 --> 00:43:47.270
Yeah.
Just gave you this game and instead find the Nash Equilibrium.
This game.

671
00:43:47.271 --> 00:43:50.990
That'd be a question on the mid term.
We'd have stopped here.
All right.

672
00:43:50.991 --> 00:43:53.360
We just said,
okay,
I found these Nash Equilibria.

673
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:55.790
Maybe you'd gone on to found mixed ones.
I don't know.

674
00:43:55.940 --> 00:44:00.230
But essentially where we'd be down at this point,
right?
Say again,

675
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:04.250
if we'd started as we would have done before the mid term with me giving you a

676
00:44:04.251 --> 00:44:08.420
payoff matrix and asking you to find the national equilibria and then at this

677
00:44:08.421 --> 00:44:09.230
point we'd be done.

678
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:12.050
We'd have found the three now she could have released the three pure strategy

679
00:44:12.051 --> 00:44:16.940
now sheik,
whatever the problem is,
if we go back to the tree,

680
00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.080
to the dynamic game,

681
00:44:18.081 --> 00:44:22.160
the game that has some action going on in meds and actually look at this game,

682
00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:27.350
it's not clear that all of these Nash Equilibria are really equally plausible.

683
00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:28.940
All right.

684
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.870
Can anyone see what might be bit implausible about some of these Nash

685
00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:35.760
Equilibrium?
What's,
what's implausible about them?

686
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:43.620
Can you take us on this?
Wow,

687
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:47.880
let's look at this.
This game again or this game's a little bit complicated.

688
00:44:47.881 --> 00:44:49.890
It's not clear what one should do here perhaps,

689
00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:54.000
and perhaps it's not clear what player to should do here because after all play

690
00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:58.780
to a,
it doesn't know where he is and he doesn't know where the player one.

691
00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:03.120
If pay one gets to move again is going to choose apoe down box.
What's the bus?

692
00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:05.850
Yeah,
we get a mic on,
on uh,
on Patrick.

693
00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:12.760
Yeah.
So if you look at it backwards,
you can cross out player one second choice.

694
00:45:12.761 --> 00:45:16.370
He's always going to choose down.
So that's one floor at that note.
Good.

695
00:45:16.410 --> 00:45:16.991
Then you know,

696
00:45:16.991 --> 00:45:20.520
player two is always going to choose the right because this payoff is always for

697
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.850
good player wines.
Not going to have any player.

698
00:45:24.851 --> 00:45:26.530
One knows which to choose.

699
00:45:26.531 --> 00:45:31.170
Then he's going to choose down.
Good.
Good.
So there's this,
this,
this,

700
00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:33.880
this works.
What Patrick just said.
That's very good.
So if we just don't,

701
00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:37.170
we just analyze this data and the way we've been taught to analyze trees.

702
00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.080
Essentially using backward induction.
We first all observe the,

703
00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:44.610
that the player one gets to move again here.

704
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:49.020
She'll know where she is and she'll move.
She's choosing between one and zero.

705
00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:52.170
She's going to choose down.
Is that right?
She's going to choose down.

706
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:56.160
But knowing this player too,

707
00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.570
even though player to doesn't know where he is player to actually has a pretty

708
00:46:00.571 --> 00:46:01.590
easy choice to make.

709
00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:06.800
He knows that if he chooses a left he either gets two oh zero but if he chews

710
00:46:09.271 --> 00:46:13.000
his rights he gets four right?

711
00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:14.490
Four is bigger than two.

712
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:18.690
Four is bigger than zero so play it too is actually going to choose.

713
00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:24.530
Right and given that given the player two is going to choose rights play,

714
00:46:24.571 --> 00:46:29.571
a warm is essentially choosing between one if if she chooses up,

715
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.180
which would be followed by writing down and two which was what happened if she

716
00:46:34.181 --> 00:46:36.060
chooses down followed by.
Right.

717
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:40.680
So this game we can essentially analyzed through backward induction.

718
00:46:40.681 --> 00:46:44.640
I don't quite back conduction cause we had to add in this little piece about two

719
00:46:44.641 --> 00:46:47.730
not knowing where she was but it turned out no matter where she was,

720
00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:50.470
she had a dominant strategy.
Has she had a better strategy one,

721
00:46:50.471 --> 00:46:54.570
she figures out that player one is going to shoes down.

722
00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:58.260
Is that right?
If we go back and look at these Nash Equilibria,

723
00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:03.410
the prediction that we just got,
which is what down for playout one,

724
00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:08.170
right?
For player too.
And then down again for player one.
Alright,

725
00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:12.510
that strategy is this one.
All right?

726
00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:17.890
So one of these Nash Equilibria corresponds to our sensible analysis of this

727
00:47:18.481 --> 00:47:22.080
tree,
but the other two do not.

728
00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:26.880
These two national equilibria
inconsistent

729
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:33.130
with backward induction,
but the inconsistent with backward induction,

730
00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:35.600
right?
That perfectly good.
Now she got a,

731
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:38.920
we've given you this matrix at the mid term,
you'd have thought that just fine,

732
00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:44.130
but it turns out both of these Nash Equilibria involve play a one choosing a

733
00:47:44.801 --> 00:47:49.801
strategy up that we know the player one is not going to do if reached.

734
00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:57.060
And one of these Nash Equilibria involves player to choosing a strategy,

735
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:58.480
uh,
left.

736
00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:03.540
Then in fact she's only choosing because play out because she thinks player too

737
00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:05.420
as probably one is going to choose.
Oh,

738
00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:09.540
which in fact we've just argued Pli one is not going to do all.
All right?

739
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:10.950
The people at the back there.

740
00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.690
There's a little bit too much volume bouncing off the wall that so just keep it,

741
00:48:13.691 --> 00:48:18.130
keep it down in the balcony.
Thank you.
All right.
All right,
so these two,

742
00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:21.040
these two met Nash Equilibria that perfectly good.

743
00:48:21.041 --> 00:48:24.730
Now she could have heard of the game,
but they don't make any sense,
right?

744
00:48:24.731 --> 00:48:28.450
They're completely inconsistent with the way we've learned to talk about gangs.

745
00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.200
All right,
now we've seen this before.
We sort on the entry game.

746
00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.470
This is a much more complicated,
much more interesting example,

747
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:39.250
but we saw in the entry game when there was one entrance entering into a market

748
00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:40.241
that didn't,
that game,

749
00:48:40.241 --> 00:48:43.780
there were actually two national equilibria and one of them we argued was

750
00:48:43.781 --> 00:48:47.380
incredible.
Here it's a bit more complicated,
but nevertheless,

751
00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:51.100
these two equilibria seemed like bogus equilibria,

752
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:54.160
whatever will equilibrate we wouldn't really believe it.

753
00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:58.530
And the reason we don't believe in them is that they don't correspond to

754
00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:02.320
backward induction and our common sense intuitions about backward induction.

755
00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:08.110
All right,
so we need some new notion.
The aim of the class,

756
00:49:08.111 --> 00:49:08.800
there's been lot.

757
00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:13.250
We want to be able to model games that have both sequential moves and a

758
00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:18.310
simultaneous moves and we wanted to be able to look at the games and use our

759
00:49:18.311 --> 00:49:20.380
techniques from both parts of the class.

760
00:49:20.381 --> 00:49:23.830
We want to be able to use the idea of Nash equilibrium from the first half of

761
00:49:23.831 --> 00:49:27.430
the class and we wanted to be able to use the idea of backward induction from

762
00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:28.540
the second half of the cost.

763
00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:31.690
But what we're learning here is that Nash Equilibrium,

764
00:49:31.691 --> 00:49:35.510
if we just take the notion of Nash equilibrium it and plunk it down on the

765
00:49:35.511 --> 00:49:36.850
sequential move game,
ms,

766
00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.600
it will produce equilibria that don't make any sense.

767
00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.170
So we need a more refined notion of equilibrium,

768
00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:48.360
a better notion of equilibrium than just nash equilibrium to deal with these

769
00:49:48.361 --> 00:49:53.361
settings where we have both simultaneity and sequential news,

770
00:49:53.381 --> 00:49:56.770
we have both,
uh,
some perfect information and some imperfect information.

771
00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:01.810
All right?
That was one example.
Let me give you a second example.

772
00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:05.180
If that example wasn't yet convinced that,
all right,

773
00:50:05.181 --> 00:50:06.680
let me leave that example up.

774
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:19.783
So far

775
00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:25.970
we've seen the nash equilibrium gets us into trouble in these games and we've

776
00:50:25.971 --> 00:50:30.740
seen it got us into trouble because it basically conflicted with our backward

777
00:50:30.741 --> 00:50:31.800
induction intuitions.

778
00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:35.640
Now I'm going to show you a different game and we're going to see what the game,

779
00:50:35.641 --> 00:50:38.720
the Nash Equilibrium is going to get us into trouble.
All right,

780
00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:40.160
this is going to be a three player game.

781
00:50:40.161 --> 00:50:43.550
We'll get more complicated as we go along.
So another example,

782
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.340
this time with three plans,

783
00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:50.090
there's an example of get harder.

784
00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:54.230
I needed to be more alert to see if you can follow them.
All right,

785
00:50:54.231 --> 00:50:56.180
so this a more complicated tree.

786
00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:01.690
Here's a tree in which play on one moves first and chooses between a or B.

787
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.340
And if play at one chooses a,
the game is over,

788
00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:11.360
she gets one and the other two players get nothing.

789
00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:14.090
If she chooses B,

790
00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:17.540
then players two and three

791
00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:21.140
get to play a little game man here.

792
00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:28.380
Which two moves first and this little sub game and three moves second and the

793
00:51:28.581 --> 00:51:33.470
payoffs in this sub game are as follows.
Again,
using player ones pay off first.

794
00:51:33.471 --> 00:51:38.471
So there's zero one one zero zero two,

795
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.840
<v 1>okay.</v>

796
00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:46.840
<v 0>Zero zero minus one and two one zero.</v>

797
00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:52.240
<v 1>All right.</v>

798
00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:56.200
<v 0>So this is quite a complicated game.
It's got three players for a start.</v>

799
00:51:56.430 --> 00:52:00.230
So it's gonna be a bit hard to draw to draw it up in a matrix.
Uh,

800
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:01.710
but nevertheless,
let me try and do that.

801
00:52:01.711 --> 00:52:06.270
So I claim that we can model this game as follows.

802
00:52:06.570 --> 00:52:07.020
Uh,

803
00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:12.020
it's a game in which play a one is choosing which Matrix score has matrix a

804
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:16.590
<v 1>and matrix B</v>

805
00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:20.820
<v 0>play.
One is choosing the Matrix,</v>

806
00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:25.500
play a two is choosing,
it's called them up and down.

807
00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:27.990
Play a two is choosing,

808
00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:30.883
<v 1>okay,</v>

809
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.650
<v 0>up or down and play.</v>

810
00:52:33.651 --> 00:52:37.220
A three is choosing left or right.

811
00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:49.250
All right.
And they're just in this game,
uh,
play,
uh,

812
00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:53.960
play as two and three actually can observe the choice of arb to start with.

813
00:52:54.830 --> 00:52:58.140
All right,
so let's try and put in the payoffs and the correct places.

814
00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:01.730
It's not always easy to do,
but it's try.
So a is easy.

815
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:03.980
If play one chooses a,

816
00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:07.670
then the payoff from this matrix are somewhat trivial because of player warm.

817
00:53:07.671 --> 00:53:12.460
She says,
Hey,
whatever.
Anyone else does the pay off is one zero zero

818
00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:19.340
<v 1>all right,</v>

819
00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:22.400
<v 0>somewhat,
somewhat uninteresting matrix over that.</v>

820
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:27.060
But if plaid one chooses B,
then life gets more interesting.

821
00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.350
Then uh,
play it.

822
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:33.390
If player to chooses out on player three chooses left,

823
00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:34.710
we ended up here.

824
00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:40.010
So that's zero one one if player one player two chooses to,

825
00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:42.613
and this is three

826
00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:49.890
two and this is a three if play a two chooses AARP on player three shoes,

827
00:53:49.891 --> 00:53:54.891
his rights then worked zero zero two all right,

828
00:53:55.171 --> 00:53:57.660
so this is zero zero two going in here.

829
00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:03.530
If player two shoes is down and play a three chooses left,

830
00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:07.710
then we're at zero zero minus one.

831
00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:13.600
Okay with that and if player to chooses down and play it three bruises down,

832
00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:18.840
then we're down here,
which is two one zero

833
00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:21.683
<v 2>all right.</v>

834
00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:27.090
<v 0>Okay,
so here's a little game player.
One is choosing the Matrix,
play it.</v>

835
00:54:27.091 --> 00:54:32.091
Two is choosing the row in the matrix or be at AAA on the left hand side and

836
00:54:32.931 --> 00:54:36.200
play a three is choosing the column in the Matrix.
Again,

837
00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.150
albeit trivially on the lefthand side,

838
00:54:38.151 --> 00:54:43.100
we don't already care about about this picture very much.
All right.

839
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:48.350
Okay,
so now watch now what?
Well,

840
00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:51.440
once again,
we could look for Nash equilibrium in this game.

841
00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:55.390
It turns out there are lots of Nash equilibrium in this game.
All right,

842
00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.950
let me just show you one Nashik,
whatever him and then we'll talk about it.

843
00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:03.170
All right,
so I claim I claim that there are lots of national put our brand

844
00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:08.440
<v 2>and one of them,
one of them</v>

845
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:11.090
<v 0>is the Nash Equilibrium.
A</v>

846
00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:13.920
<v 2>Oh,
okay.</v>

847
00:55:14.540 --> 00:55:19.250
<v 0>Left a left.
So that's see what that is.</v>

848
00:55:19.251 --> 00:55:20.630
And the tree,
first of all,

849
00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:26.620
so player one shows a player to just up and left,

850
00:55:27.771 --> 00:55:30.890
but it followed a,
so we ended up here.
We ended up at one zero zero

851
00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:33.443
<v 2>all right,</v>

852
00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:37.840
<v 0>Gotcha.
Hey,
op left is this box in the tree?</v>

853
00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:40.400
<v 2>All right,</v>

854
00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:44.320
<v 0>let's just check that.
That actually is a nash equilibrium.
All right?</v>

855
00:55:44.321 --> 00:55:46.720
So we all know how to do this from the first half of the class to check.

856
00:55:46.721 --> 00:55:47.890
And that's a Nash equilibrium.

857
00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:53.040
We better check that no individual player can do better by deviating.

858
00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:55.150
So let's start with playing a one.

859
00:55:55.630 --> 00:56:00.550
If play a one deviates holding player two and three fixed than play a one,

860
00:56:00.551 --> 00:56:05.540
we'll be switching the matrix from matrix a to Matrix B.

861
00:56:06.010 --> 00:56:06.843
Is that correct?

862
00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:12.480
Alright so we'll move from this box in the lefthand matrix to the equivalent box

863
00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:17.290
in the right hand matrix,
right?
And play a ones pay off.

864
00:56:17.291 --> 00:56:21.730
We'll go from one to zero,
one to zero.

865
00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:25.930
So play a one doesn't want to d gate everyone happy with that one.

866
00:56:25.931 --> 00:56:26.770
Doesn't want to deviate here.

867
00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:32.400
How about player to player to deviates holding players one in three fixed then

868
00:56:33.161 --> 00:56:36.790
play a one is going to switch rose and this matrix.

869
00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:41.080
So we'll move from this box to this.
Right from this box to this box.

870
00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:45.160
Play a two was making zero before she's still making zero.

871
00:56:45.310 --> 00:56:49.450
So she just has no incentive to deviate and the same argument applies for player

872
00:56:49.451 --> 00:56:53.470
three cause she will bring to choosing the column holding the row in the matrix

873
00:56:53.471 --> 00:56:57.250
fixed.
So once again she gets zero in either case.
All right,

874
00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.950
you ever unhappy with that?
So that actually is and how she could have rum.

875
00:56:59.951 --> 00:57:02.830
And again,
if this had been the midterm,
I could have set this up.

876
00:57:02.831 --> 00:57:05.000
I could have given you these matrices,
uh,

877
00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:08.030
or the story behind them and you'd have found that you could,

878
00:57:08.190 --> 00:57:10.900
I could have asked you whether this was a nash equilibrium and the answer would

879
00:57:10.901 --> 00:57:15.520
have been yes.
But I claim that once again,

880
00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:18.820
this is just not a believable nash equilibrium.

881
00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:21.490
It isn't actually whatever Emma Foreign International,
the room,

882
00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:25.390
but it's not a plausible prediction for how this game is going to be a place.

883
00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:29.530
Why is it not a plausible prediction for how this game is going to be played?

884
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:34.120
I want to see stare at the tree of it,
right?

885
00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:38.950
So in in the information here and the pre mid term information,
it's fine.

886
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.700
But knowing about the actual structure of this game,

887
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.990
I claim this makes no sense at all.
Why does it make no sense?

888
00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:49.090
Well,

889
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:54.090
notice that if play or one word to switch her action from the prescribed action,

890
00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.910
a call to action be then we'd be here.

891
00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:02.980
All right.

892
00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:07.980
And notice that the tree from here on in looks like a little game.

893
00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:13.460
That right the tree from here on looks like a little game,
right?

894
00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:15.970
So this thing here is put in green.

895
00:58:18.010 --> 00:58:22.910
This thing here is a little game within the game.
It's a sub game.

896
00:58:23.250 --> 00:58:27.790
All right?
And there's some game really only involved two players,

897
00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:32.700
the two players that it involves.
I'll play us too and play a three player.

898
00:58:32.730 --> 00:58:36.520
One's done play ones put us into this game.
But now in this little son game,

899
00:58:36.730 --> 00:58:39.490
it's a little sub game involving just player too and player three.

900
00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:45.220
So we can analyze this little sub game.
If we analyze it,
it'll some game.

901
00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:50.260
What will it give us?
What will we find?
All right,
so let's look at this sub game.

902
00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:57.100
So look at the green,
the green,

903
00:58:57.730 --> 00:59:02.380
some game game that would have happened.
Hand player one,

904
00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:07.510
chosen B.
This is a sock game involving,
just play as two and three.
So one,

905
00:59:07.511 --> 00:59:10.260
let us forget player one.
All right,
we know what I mean.
Play.

906
00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.540
One is part of the game is getting payoffs,
but play a one has made their move.

907
00:59:13.541 --> 00:59:14.560
They're not really involved anymore.

908
00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:18.190
So let's just look at this game as a game involving players two and three.

909
00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:21.380
And let's look at the Matrix for players two and three.

910
00:59:24.610 --> 00:59:27.680
So this is,
this actually corresponds to the matrix above.
It's a,

911
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:31.940
it's a matrix in which player two is choosing up and down.

912
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:37.600
Here it is up and down and simultaneously play at three is choosing left or

913
00:59:39.201 --> 00:59:42.230
right.
Here it is.
Laughter Rights at this inflammation.

914
00:59:42.231 --> 00:59:47.231
Sas and the payoffs are one one

915
00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:50.810
zero two

916
00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:52.253
<v 2>okay.</v>

917
00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:56.000
<v 0>Zero minus one</v>

918
00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:01.860
<v 2>[inaudible].
Alright.</v>

919
01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:09.790
<v 0>All right,
so this is a claim,
a representation of this little green game.</v>

920
01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:12.620
I should put this in green as well.
All right,

921
01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:17.570
this thing corresponds to that thing.
All right,
I'm okay with that.

922
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:19.790
Alright,

923
01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:24.790
so if player one had chosen to chew a chosen B rather than a,

924
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:28.100
then we'd be involved in a little game,

925
01:00:28.101 --> 01:00:32.720
a game within the game or sub game involving just play as two or three and we

926
01:00:32.721 --> 01:00:36.410
can analyze that game.
That's a straight forward gay man.
Here it is.

927
01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:37.970
And what would we do with that game?

928
01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.430
We'd look for the Nash Equilibrium in that game.

929
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.530
So let's look for the Nash Equilibrium in this game.

930
01:00:42.531 --> 01:00:47.060
So what do we notice about this game?
So if player three chooses left,

931
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:51.350
then play out to would rather choose up.

932
01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:55.490
If plan a three chooses a rights,

933
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:57.680
then player two should choose down.

934
01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:03.730
If play a two chooses op than play a three would rather choose rights because

935
01:01:04.191 --> 01:01:07.670
two is bigger than one.
And if play a two or to choose down,

936
01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:11.600
then play a three wood shoes,
right?
Again,
because Xero is bigger than minus one.

937
01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:14.450
<v 2>Okay?</v>

938
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:19.450
<v 0>So in fact in this little sub game and this little sub game actually play a</v>

939
01:01:20.601 --> 01:01:23.630
three has a dominant strategy,
right?

940
01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:28.070
If it turned out that we got involved in this little sub game play,

941
01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:30.590
a three has a dominant strategy,
which is to play writes.

942
01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:35.810
And moreover this some game has just one nash equilibrium.

943
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:37.820
If I'd given you this sub game on its own,

944
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:43.150
it's clear that the Nash Equilibrium of this sub game,

945
01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.600
this game within the game is

946
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:53.020
down rice.
It's down,
right?

947
01:01:54.830 --> 01:01:56.090
So what's that telling us?

948
01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:01.420
It's telling us if play a two and three ever get called upon to play in this

949
01:02:02.991 --> 01:02:07.190
game.
I only happens when a prior one chooses bead.

950
01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:11.150
If play a two and three ever get called upon to play on this game.

951
01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:16.190
We know from when we were young or at least from before the midterm,

952
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:21.490
we know that they're going to play Nash equilibrium in that sub game and the

953
01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:22.930
Nash Equilibrium in the sub game,

954
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:28.010
he's going to have play at three choosing reits and play it to choosing down.

955
01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:33.240
Alright,
but the equilibrium,

956
01:02:33.241 --> 01:02:38.241
we talked about this equilibrium we owe all good before about a UL was doesn't

957
01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:41.880
the equipment told them before.

958
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:46.770
A UL doesn't involve player to choosing down in facts.

959
01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:51.990
She shows up and it doesn't involve player three choosing rights.

960
01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:53.130
In fact,
she

961
01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:58.300
<v 2>should.
I just left.
All right,
so let's set up</v>

962
01:02:58.790 --> 01:02:59.390
<v 0>this.</v>

963
01:02:59.390 --> 01:03:04.390
We found an equilibrium of this game cause he could have run this game was a u l

964
01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.420
but I claimed this is not a plausible equilibrium.

965
01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:13.780
It's not a plausible equilibrium because it predicts that if we actually would

966
01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:18.650
have played the game within the game,
we wouldn't in play equilibrium.

967
01:03:20.780 --> 01:03:21.613
<v 2>Let me say it again.</v>

968
01:03:22.070 --> 01:03:24.980
<v 0>In the whole game and the whole game,</v>

969
01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.980
a op left isn't equilibrium,

970
01:03:28.610 --> 01:03:33.610
but I claim it's a silly equilibrium because he didn't vols the prediction that

971
01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:37.070
if in fact we ever got into the game within the game,

972
01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:41.420
we would no longer play equilibrium.
And that doesn't seem right.

973
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:42.950
If we're going to believe in equilibrium,

974
01:03:42.951 --> 01:03:44.870
we should be consistent and believe in equilibrium.

975
01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:47.603
<v 2>All right,</v>

976
01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:50.340
<v 0>so this brings us to a new idea,</v>

977
01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:53.590
<v 2>right?</v>

978
01:03:53.590 --> 01:03:55.600
<v 0>And the new idea is going to have two parts to it.</v>

979
01:03:55.810 --> 01:03:58.780
The first part is kind of on the border.
Ready?

980
01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:03.700
It's something we try to informally,
it's the notion of a sub game.

981
01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:07.990
It's the motion of a sub game,
right?
What's a sum game?

982
01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:12.340
It's a game within a game.
All right?
I've been using that informally,

983
01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:16.750
but we need to start thinking about more formally what it means.

984
01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:21.161
All right,
so I talked to,

985
01:04:21.161 --> 01:04:25.790
I didn't form an asset that green objects is the game that would be played.

986
01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:31.180
We're player one to choose B and we told her the other sub games in this class

987
01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:38.210
we talked about the sum game that would happen in the entry game if one of
those,

988
01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:39.960
one of those uh,

989
01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:44.540
rival became rival pizza companies moved in,
in uh,

990
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:45.830
the Miami market or something.

991
01:04:45.831 --> 01:04:48.530
There was a game within a game and we took out the Tour de France.

992
01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:52.700
We talked about the being game within a game that is about when you break away.

993
01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:56.900
But I want to be formal about this notion of a game within a game and introduce

994
01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:57.883
some of the main culture.

995
01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:03.520
So the formal definition is this definition of a sound game.

996
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:08.360
He sub game

997
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:14.600
is a part of a game.

998
01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.753
<v 2>Okay.</v>

999
01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.680
<v 0>In full bleed,</v>

1000
01:05:21.970 --> 01:05:25.270
looks like a game

1001
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:29.620
within the tree

1002
01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:33.760
and it has three properties.

1003
01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:40.340
It satisfies the following three properties.

1004
01:05:40.341 --> 01:05:43.700
So since it looks like a game itself,

1005
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:46.850
the sub game must start from a particular point.

1006
01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:51.770
So it starts the sub game,
ms start,

1007
01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:56.630
it starts from a single mode.

1008
01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:03.920
And let's just look at the example and the example we just looked at.

1009
01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:08.180
The sub game started from this mode here.

1010
01:06:12.590 --> 01:06:17.480
<v 1>Second,
second</v>

1011
01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:23.530
<v 0>it comprises can praises,</v>

1012
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:28.390
oh,
successes,

1013
01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.120
successes to that node.

1014
01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:32.653
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1015
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:40.610
<v 0>so now our example,
here's all sub games are green sock game.</v>

1016
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:43.790
Here's the note.
It starts from here.

1017
01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:47.600
All the nodes that are successes of that node.

1018
01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:51.590
These are the children and these are the grandchildren.
All right?

1019
01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.750
You have this grandparent node,

1020
01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:57.050
you have to have all of his children had all of his grandchild.

1021
01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:00.003
<v 1>All right?</v>

1022
01:07:03.310 --> 01:07:07.060
<v 0>So it comprises all the successes of that load.
And finally,</v>

1023
01:07:07.061 --> 01:07:11.800
and this is important,
it does not.

1024
01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.790
It does not break up,

1025
01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:22.250
does not break up any information sets.

1026
01:07:26.530 --> 01:07:29.050
It does not break up any information sets.

1027
01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:33.790
So some game informally it's just a little game within the game,

1028
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:36.010
but slightly more formally.

1029
01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:40.750
I can't put one node that's part of an information site into this sub game and

1030
01:07:40.751 --> 01:07:44.560
it's not going to put all the nodes that are part of that information set into

1031
01:07:44.561 --> 01:07:48.370
the subject.
All right,
let's have a look at some examples.

1032
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:50.650
We've got one example out there.

1033
01:07:51.490 --> 01:07:56.080
The entry game look something like this,
right?
The entry game.

1034
01:07:56.081 --> 01:07:59.290
It's something like this.
So what are the sub games here?

1035
01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:05.260
So no secrets here.
This is a sub game,

1036
01:08:06.310 --> 01:08:09.250
right?
There's actually another sub gang.
Want to see what the other sub game is?

1037
01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:14.670
The whole game is a sub game.
Alright?
The whole game is itself a stop gap.

1038
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:19.130
Somewhat trickily.
All right,
so this is this,
this particular game,

1039
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:21.950
just the [inaudible],
which is a schematic of the entry game.

1040
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:25.100
It has actually two sub games,
but only one proper sub game.

1041
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:27.890
Here's a more complicated example.

1042
01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:36.700
Oh,
he's actually gonna be quite a complicated example just to make life

1043
01:08:36.701 --> 01:08:40.840
interesting.
So one is going to move,
then two is going to move,

1044
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:41.983
<v 2>okay?</v>

1045
01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:45.680
<v 0>And then one is going to move again.</v>

1046
01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:49.990
This is all one big information set to play a one

1047
01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:53.923
<v 2>and</v>

1048
01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:58.710
<v 0>one is going to move like this.
So again,
without pay offs,</v>

1049
01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:02.760
this is a little tree.
And the key point here is this is an inflammation.
So

1050
01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:04.521
all right,

1051
01:09:04.521 --> 01:09:07.730
let's look at stare at this tree a second and figure out what are and and not

1052
01:09:07.731 --> 01:09:12.670
sub games.
So first of all,
what does this,

1053
01:09:12.671 --> 01:09:16.310
this was a sub game and this was a sub game.
What about this thing here?

1054
01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:22.160
Is that a sub game?
It's not as what,
what,
what role does it break?

1055
01:09:24.030 --> 01:09:26.150
It's,
it's breaking up an inflammation set,
right?

1056
01:09:26.151 --> 01:09:30.260
It's breaking up an information set.
So that's no good because of rule three.

1057
01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:34.370
What about this thing?

1058
01:09:36.310 --> 01:09:36.910
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

1059
01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:38.230
<v 0>that doesn't break up and inflammation.</v>

1060
01:09:38.231 --> 01:09:42.390
So that I've got the hold inflammation set in that.
Is that any good?
No,

1061
01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:45.790
that's no good because it doesn't start from a singles and node.
That's no good.

1062
01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:49.930
It violates one.
And uh,
if we do this,

1063
01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.130
we look at this piece,

1064
01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:57.420
that piece there,
that's also new.
Good.
Why is that?
No good?

1065
01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:02.420
Again,
it breaks up an information set.
All right,

1066
01:10:02.421 --> 01:10:06.390
so this is no good again because of rule three.
All right.
So you can,

1067
01:10:06.391 --> 01:10:11.391
you can practice at home drawing trees and trying to identify what are I don't

1068
01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.070
what to not sub gates.

1069
01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:20.980
All right.
So with us with a definition of a stub game now formal,
right?

1070
01:10:20.981 --> 01:10:23.920
It's basically just formalizing something we've talked about before,

1071
01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:28.840
which is the idea of a game within the game.
I want to introduce our new,

1072
01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:32.080
what's going to be our new solution concepts and this is going to be the

1073
01:10:32.081 --> 01:10:32.920
solution concept.

1074
01:10:32.921 --> 01:10:37.390
We're going to use essentially a almost until the final

1075
01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.113
<v 2>definition,</v>

1076
01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:45.240
<v 0>so just remember what our task is.</v>

1077
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:50.270
Our task is to come up with a solution concepts that picks up the idea from the

1078
01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:53.370
first half of the semester,
namely Nash Equilibrium,

1079
01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:58.110
but does so in a way that respects what we've learned in the second half of the

1080
01:10:58.111 --> 01:11:02.610
semester.
Namely that games have sequential elements and people move by backward

1081
01:11:02.611 --> 01:11:03.444
induction.

1082
01:11:03.450 --> 01:11:08.430
So in particular what we want to rule out are those Nash Equilibria that

1083
01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:13.431
instructs players down the tree to play in some games according to strategies

1084
01:11:14.251 --> 01:11:16.620
that are not Nash Equilibria is that again,

1085
01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:18.660
we want to rule out those national whatever,

1086
01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:23.040
then instruct people way down the tree to play according to something which is

1087
01:11:23.041 --> 01:11:23.930
not an athlete.
Whatever.

1088
01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:28.950
We want our new notion to say wherever you find yourself in a tree,

1089
01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:32.940
play Nashik,
whatever.
I'm about to exactly what the definition is going to say.

1090
01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:39.540
So a Nash Equilibrium,
n e s one star,

1091
01:11:40.290 --> 01:11:45.290
two star all the way up to s m star is a sub gay men.

1092
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:54.990
Perfect subgame perfect equilibrium

1093
01:11:57.170 --> 01:12:02.080
slub game,
perfect equilibrium is that's an s p e.

1094
01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.270
It's a subgame perfect equilibrium.

1095
01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:08.813
<v 2>If</v>

1096
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:12.840
<v 0>eight induces</v>

1097
01:12:14.690 --> 01:12:19.690
a nash equilibrium in every sub game,

1098
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:25.793
<v 2>oh of the game.</v>

1099
01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:29.060
<v 0>So getting poverty group equally or remit,</v>

1100
01:12:29.150 --> 01:12:31.610
it has to itself be an ashy color rim of course,

1101
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:37.030
but it also has to instruct players to play a nash equilibrium in every stop

1102
01:12:37.521 --> 01:12:40.820
game.
Let's take that immediately back to our examples.

1103
01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:46.240
In this example and this example we know,

1104
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:49.340
let's bring it down and this example,

1105
01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:53.930
we know that this is a sub game.

1106
01:12:55.190 --> 01:13:00.190
We know that in this sub game there is only one nash equilibrium and that Nash

1107
01:13:01.011 --> 01:13:01.641
equilibrium,

1108
01:13:01.641 --> 01:13:06.641
it involves player to choosing down and player three choosing rights,

1109
01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:11.450
all rights.
So we know,

1110
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:16.630
we know that plant two is going to choose down according to that equilibrium and

1111
01:13:16.881 --> 01:13:20.900
player three is going to choose right according to that equilibrium.

1112
01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:23.930
So we now have a look for an equilibrium of the whole game.

1113
01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:28.670
Let's go back to play a one's choice.
Play on warm.
If they choose a,

1114
01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:31.760
we'll get one.
If they chose B,

1115
01:13:31.850 --> 01:13:36.320
then they know that this nash equilibrium will we played.
So I'll get to,

1116
01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.720
they prefer two to one.

1117
01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:44.080
So the subgame perfect equilibrium here is play a one chooses B,

1118
01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:51.880
play it to chooses down and player three shoes is right.

1119
01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:58.880
This is an equilibrium of the game and it induces.

1120
01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:00.980
Here it is.
It induces

1121
01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:07.670
an equilibrium and this type game.
All right,
so with that example,

1122
01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:08.441
the subgame perfect.

1123
01:14:08.441 --> 01:14:12.310
Your equilibrium is found by first of looking in the sub game,

1124
01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:17.050
find the equilibrium in the sub game and then go back and look at the

1125
01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:20.320
equilibrium of the whole game.
He could've move.
We ended up with,

1126
01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:22.510
it is a nash equilibrium in the whole game,

1127
01:14:22.630 --> 01:14:26.710
but more importantly it induces and Nash equilibrium in the sub game.

1128
01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:29.740
Let's just go back to our other examples.
Then I'll stop.

1129
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:32.680
So our other example was here.

1130
01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:33.693
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1131
01:14:35.860 --> 01:14:40.120
<v 0>He was our other example.
We claim,
hang on everybody.</v>

1132
01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:43.810
We claimed the good equilibrium here.
The one we believed in,

1133
01:14:43.811 --> 01:14:48.460
it was down down rights.
All right,

1134
01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:53.260
where are the sub games and this game?
What are the sub games and this tree?

1135
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:56.423
<v 1>Anybody?</v>

1136
01:14:56.540 --> 01:15:00.590
<v 0>So I claim there's only one real sub game here and that's this piece,</v>

1137
01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:04.580
right?
This is a sub game.
All right?

1138
01:15:04.670 --> 01:15:07.790
Watch the Nash equilibrium of this somewhat trivial sub game.

1139
01:15:09.230 --> 01:15:10.040
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1140
01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.700
<v 0>I'm actually gonna move this somewhat trivial sum game is that player one miss</v>

1141
01:15:13.701 --> 01:15:17.430
choose down.
So for a national equilibrium,

1142
01:15:17.431 --> 01:15:21.860
it to be a subgame perfect equilibrium.
Here are our three Nash Equilibria.
One,

1143
01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:25.810
two,
three.
For this nash equilibrium to be a subgame perfect equal aroma,

1144
01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:27.470
it's got to instruct,

1145
01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:32.060
play a one to choose down in the trivial sub gate.

1146
01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:33.350
And here it is.

1147
01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:37.910
This is our subgame perfect equilibrium in this game.

1148
01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:42.560
Now I know today was a lot of formal stuff,
a lot of new ideas.

1149
01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.690
We come back on Monday,
well first of all,

1150
01:15:44.691 --> 01:15:47.900
give you a game that refreshes these ideas and then we'll go straight to

1151
01:15:47.901 --> 01:15:51.560
applications to trust me,
there will be applications.
It will be useful.

1152
01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:52.693
See you on Monday.

1153
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:56.600
There's a homework to come in and there's another one on the web or going out.
