1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.490
Okay,
let's make a start.
So I hope everyone had a good,
a good break.

2
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.330
We're going to spend this week looking at repeated interaction.

3
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.400
Are we ready?
You saw last time before the break that we,

4
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.530
once we were repeated games,
those games go on for a while.

5
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.410
We can sustain behavior.
That's quite interesting.
So for example,

6
00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:39.700
before the break we saw that we could sustain fighting my players that we're

7
00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:43.200
rational in a,
in a war of attrition.
All right.

8
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.480
And I don't think we learned before the break was when we're analyzing these

9
00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:50.470
potentially very long games,
it helps sometimes to break it,

10
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.800
break the analysis up into what we might call stage games each,

11
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.670
each period of the game and break the payoffs up into the pay offs that are

12
00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:01.780
associated with that stage pay off that are associated with the past,

13
00:01:01.781 --> 00:01:02.521
but they're sunk.

14
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.470
They didn't really matter and pay off or they're going to come in the future

15
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.450
from future equilibrium play.

16
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.720
So there's just some ideas we're going to pick up today.
But for that,

17
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.410
for the most part,
what we do today will be new.
Now,

18
00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:18.580
where as last time we focused on fighting for the whole of today,

19
00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.210
I want to focus on the issue of cooperation about the whole of this week.

20
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.290
I want to issue out a focus on the issue of cooperation.

21
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.230
And the question kind of a behind the everything this week is going to be Canada

22
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.500
repeated interaction among players both induce I'm sustain cooperative behavior

23
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.900
or if you like good behavior,

24
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.090
I know canonical example is going to be prisoner's dilemma way back and the very

25
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:54.091
first class we talked about prisoner's dilemma and we mentioned that playing the

26
00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:57.630
game repeatedly might be able to get us out of the dilemma.

27
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:01.830
It might be able to enable us to sustain cooperation.
All right?

28
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.720
And what's gonna be good about that is not justice team cooperation,

29
00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:08.920
but Justine team corporation without the use of outside payments such as

30
00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:13.840
contracts or the mafia or whatever.
All right.
So why does this matter?

31
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.161
Well,

32
00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:20.161
one reason it matters is that most interactions in society either don't or

33
00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:24.340
perhaps even can't relate,
uh,
rely on contracts right?
The most,

34
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.530
most relationships are not contractual,

35
00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.900
however many relationships are repeaters.
All right,

36
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.110
so he's going to be of more important perhaps in general life don't have lesser

37
00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:38.830
in business,
more important in general life van or thinking about contracts.

38
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.640
So just think about some obvious examples.
Think about your own friendships.

39
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.620
I don't know if you have any friendships,
I assume you do,

40
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.880
but for those of you who do,
your friendships are typically not contractual.

41
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:50.200
You don't have a contract that says,
if you're nice to me,

42
00:02:50.201 --> 00:02:52.270
I'll be nice to you know,
right.

43
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.410
Similarly think about interactions among nations interactions during nations

44
00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.640
typically can not be contractual because the new to enforce those interact,
uh,

45
00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.820
those,
those would be contract so that you can have treaties I suppose.

46
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.510
But most interaction,
my late nations,
that cooperation my nation is,

47
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.550
is this famed by the fact that those,

48
00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.770
that those relationships are going to go on forever.
Right?

49
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.190
And even in business,

50
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.170
even while we have contracts and even in a very litigious society like the u s

51
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.180
which were the most litigious society in the world,

52
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.760
we can't really rely on contracts for everyday business.

53
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.030
And a business relationships.
All right,

54
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.590
so in some sense we need a way to model a way to sustain cooperation and good

55
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.940
and good behavior that forms,
if you like the social fabric of our society.

56
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.930
I was always going to court about everything.
All right,

57
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.560
now why you might repeat it?
Interaction work.
Why do we think,
what do we think?

58
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:49.330
Way Back in day one of the class that repeated interaction might be able to

59
00:03:49.331 --> 00:03:52.960
enable us to behave well even in situations like prisoners,

60
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:56.920
dilemmas or situations involving moral hazard where bad behavior is going to

61
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:59.290
occur in one shot.
Games.
All right,

62
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:04.030
so the lesson we're going to be sort of underlying things today and all week is

63
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:04.864
this one.

64
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.960
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

65
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.980
<v 0>an ongoing and ongoing relationships.</v>

66
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:15.500
It ongoing relationships,

67
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.270
<v 1>the promise,</v>

68
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:22.600
<v 0>all future</v>

69
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.530
<v 1>rewards
and</v>

70
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.193
<v 0>the threat.</v>

71
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.080
Oh,
future punishments,

72
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.250
future punishment.
Me,
let's be careful.

73
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.100
May sometimes

74
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.640
may sometimes provide

75
00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.533
<v 1>incentives</v>

76
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.390
<v 0>for good behavior today</v>

77
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.870
and just leave a gap here.
But in your notes,

78
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:16.660
because we're going to come back to this,
this is a very general idea.

79
00:05:16.661 --> 00:05:19.930
The idea is that future behavior in the relationship,

80
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.590
it can generate the possibility of future rewards,

81
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.240
our and or future punishments and those promises or threats may sometimes

82
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:31.750
provide incentives for people to behave well today and I'm in get like what

83
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:35.500
reason would leave a gap here is I want part of the purpose of this week's

84
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.760
lectures to be trying to get beyond this.
This is kind of a almost a platitude,

85
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:42.240
right?
Thank you.
Most of you knew this already.
All right,

86
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.300
so I want to get me on this.
I want to see when,
when is this going to work?

87
00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:49.240
When does it not going to work?
How is it going to work?
All right,

88
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:51.070
so I don't want to do,
I don't want people to leave the week,

89
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.500
leave this week of classes or leave the course thinking,

90
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.840
oh well this relationship is going to kind of going to a,

91
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.000
we're going to interact more than once,
so everything's fine.
That's not true.

92
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.150
All right?
What do we want to make sure that we understand when things work,

93
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.020
how they work,
and more importantly when they don't work and how they don't work.

94
00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.861
All right,

95
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:10.370
so we're going to try and fill in the gap that we've just left on that board as

96
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:13.310
we go on today.
All right?
Nevertheless,

97
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:16.910
we do have this very strong intuition,
that repeated interaction.

98
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.090
We'll get us as it were out of the prisoner's dilemma.

99
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.370
So why don't we start with the presidents of lamb.

100
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:25.400
I'll put this up now the way we'll come back to it

101
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.990
and let's just remind ourselves what the prisoner's dilemma is,

102
00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:34.010
because you guys are all full of Turkey and cranberry sauce and you've probably

103
00:06:34.011 --> 00:06:37.550
forgotten what game theory is entirely
honest.

104
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.910
Let's name these strategies rather than Alpha and Beta.

105
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.260
Let's call them cooperation and effect,

106
00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.300
and that would be our convention this week.
We'll call them cooperation,
right?

107
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.773
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

108
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.440
<v 0>And the fact is this player a,
and this is play a,
B,</v>

109
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.540
and the payoff is something like this,

110
00:06:56.541 --> 00:07:01.541
two two minus one three three minus one and zero zero.

111
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.430
It doesn't have to be exactly this,
but this will do
all right,

112
00:07:06.431 --> 00:07:09.940
this is the game we're going to play and to try and see if we get cooperation

113
00:07:09.941 --> 00:07:13.120
out of it,
uh,
by,
by having it,
by having repeated interaction.

114
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.240
We're going to play it more than once.
All right,
so let me,
uh,

115
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.830
go and find some,
some players to play here.

116
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.980
This should be a familiar game to everybody here.
All right,

117
00:07:26.981 --> 00:07:29.740
so why don't I pick some people kind of close to the front row.
So what,
so what,

118
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.820
what's,
what's,
what's your name again?
I'm going to use the green one over here.

119
00:07:33.821 --> 00:07:37.300
So say again?
Brooks.
Brooks.
Okay.
So Brooks is what it's going to be a player.

120
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.030
[inaudible] I guess be you want,

121
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:43.390
you play a beat and I've forgotten her name by this.
They just didn't know it.

122
00:07:43.391 --> 00:07:45.940
Patrick.
You're gonna be playing a,
all right.

123
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.150
And the difference between playing this game now and playing this game earlier

124
00:07:49.151 --> 00:07:53.590
on,
the cost is we're going to play not once,
but twice.

125
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.120
We're going to play it twice.

126
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.000
So write down what you're going to do the first time my down,
wait,

127
00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.710
what are you going to do the first time?
And just show it to your neighbor.

128
00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:03.830
Don't show it to each other.
All right?

129
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:07.380
And let's find out what they did the first time.
So it was written down.

130
00:08:07.381 --> 00:08:12.060
Something good and down.
So a Brooks,
when I cooperated,
you cooperated.
Patrick.

131
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.320
I defected.
Patrick defected.
Okay.
Okay,
well that's okay.

132
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.730
Let's play the second time,
right?
Second time to write down.

133
00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:18.870
We're going to do the second time.

134
00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.050
At this time I'm going to defect Mutu all right.
So we had,

135
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.220
we had the play this time,
it just wound up here.
So the player,

136
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.700
when we played at this time,

137
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:40.530
we had a and B and the first time we had defects cooperate or the second time we

138
00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:45.960
had defect effects.
All right,
let's try another power.
What?
Just play.

139
00:08:45.961 --> 00:08:49.270
There's a couple of times and we'll talk about it.
So,
uh,
yeah,
that's fair enough.

140
00:08:49.271 --> 00:08:52.540
How don't we go to your neighbors?
That seems fair enough.
Easy.
So you are Ben.

141
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.070
So shout it out to be the whole yet Ben.
That's a good name.
It's good.
Very good.

142
00:08:56.071 --> 00:09:00.480
Okay.
And you are Edwina,
Edwina,
Edwina and Ben.
Okay.

143
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:04.830
So when we to make Ben Player B and Edwina player a and why don't you write down

144
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:08.100
what you're going to do for the first time again.
We're going to play it twice.

145
00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.000
All right?
All right.
Where are we?
What are we?
Mix it up.

146
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:14.700
We can pay it three times and we'll pay it three times.
First Time.
Okay.

147
00:09:14.701 --> 00:09:15.960
We've about three times.
All right.

148
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:20.010
Both people who were happy with their decisions and,
okay.
So the first time,
uh,

149
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:24.180
and we know,
what did you choose?
Cooperate.
All right,

150
00:09:24.181 --> 00:09:25.980
so we had that down this time.

151
00:09:25.981 --> 00:09:30.981
So we've got and weeder and we know quite a and Ben B and we had cooperate

152
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:37.260
defects.
All right.
Second time please.

153
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.780
Cooperate defect.
Okay.

154
00:09:42.781 --> 00:09:46.260
So we're getting rid of going to and fro now.
Uh,

155
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:49.920
so this was cooperate and defects.

156
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:55.020
And one more time.
One more time.

157
00:09:55.060 --> 00:10:00.020
Write down,
both players run down.
Had We,
oh,

158
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.390
okay.
So we flipped around again.
Okay.
Okay.

159
00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:07.670
So we're seeing some pretty old behavior here.
Uh,

160
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.670
who did what that timer and we know what to do.
Do.
Uh,
so we had,
we had this,

161
00:10:14.671 --> 00:10:18.390
is that right?
We had this.
All right,
so keeping my friends for a minute,

162
00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:23.190
I'll just,
we'll just talk about it in a second.
All right,
so first of all,

163
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.560
let's start with uh,
uh,
with Ben here.
Ben,
you were cooperating and the first go.

164
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:32.040
All right.
So why were you,
why didn't you choose to cooperate the first term?

165
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.290
Shout out to me.
We can hear you.

166
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.740
I felt that if I established a reputation for cooperating,

167
00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:41.930
we could end up in the cooperate.
Cooperate.
All right,
so you thought the by,

168
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:46.110
by playing cooperate early,
you could assumption I'm going to reputation.
Uh,

169
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:49.430
and what about later on when you paid it,
you paid the fact that they're after.

170
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:50.610
What,
what were you thinking there?

171
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.780
I realized that she established a reputation for defecting second.
All right,

172
00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:01.080
so you switched strategies.
Midcourse alright.
Um,
uh,

173
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.230
Edwina you started off by the fact and why didn't you start off by the faxing

174
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.090
shout out to be when he defected.

175
00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.560
So I thought he might affect or cause his friend affected.
Okay.
Okay.

176
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.660
That's a bit tainted by his friend there.
Okay.
All right.

177
00:11:12.661 --> 00:11:15.060
It's shorter space in the class when they can just be sitting next to it and

178
00:11:15.061 --> 00:11:17.310
then thereafter you cooperated.
Why was that?

179
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.910
So in fact your reputation works in some sense by cooperating early,

180
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.820
you convinced and we knew you would cooperate and then he went on cooperating

181
00:11:26.821 --> 00:11:30.870
even after he defected.
So what,
what were you doing in the third round?
Shout out.

182
00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:36.330
Cooperate because I cooperated.
All right.
Did anyone come back?

183
00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:40.520
Let's talk to your neighbors.
So a Brooks Brooks,
why did shout out why,

184
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.330
why you cooperated in the first round?

185
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.170
And because I was hopeful that he would cooperate.

186
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.660
You were hoping he would cooperate.
All right.
All right.

187
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.330
And what did you affect thereafter?
Um,

188
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.480
because I thought he would continue to after he gives it affects anything,

189
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.920
continue to the facts.
And Patrick,
you,

190
00:11:56.921 --> 00:12:00.090
you're the person who just affected throughout here,
uh,

191
00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.350
grabbed the mic and who's next day?
Why didn't you just effect,

192
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:07.120
and this is a short game that make sense,
that effect in the last period.

193
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.940
So the second last periods,
the first period.
So Ah,
all right.

194
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.710
A lot of interesting idea.
So,
so Patrick saying Patrick seeing,
uh,

195
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:18.940
actually if we,
if we look at the last period of this game,

196
00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.100
whatever this last part of the game,

197
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.080
what does the game look like in the last period

198
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:28.390
and the last period?
This actually is the game,
right?
If I,

199
00:12:28.391 --> 00:12:31.730
if I drew out the game with two periods,
it'd be kind of a hard thing to draw it,

200
00:12:31.731 --> 00:12:35.800
but got a,
an annoying diagram to draw.
But in the last period of the game,

201
00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.550
whatever happened in the first period is what?
It's sunk that right?

202
00:12:39.551 --> 00:12:40.990
Everything happened.
The first pair of just sunk.

203
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:45.250
So in the last period of the game,
these are the only relevant payoffs,

204
00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:47.990
is that right?
And in this sense,

205
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:51.400
these are the only role of and payoffs looking forward in the last period of the

206
00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:54.340
game,
we know that there's actually a dominant strategy.

207
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.730
And what is that dominant strategy in the last period of the game to be water in

208
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:03.430
prison as landlord.
What's the dominant strategy shattered out to fact,
okay,

209
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.310
so what we should see in this game,
we didn't actually,

210
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:09.030
we didn't actually cause cause we had some kindness over here from when we never

211
00:13:09.031 --> 00:13:09.731
did it but okay.

212
00:13:09.731 --> 00:13:14.731
But what we should see in general is we know that in the last period of the game

213
00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:22.060
in period two,
we're going to get both people to faxing.

214
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.970
All right?
And the reason we're going to get both people to fixing it,

215
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.940
it's because the last period of the game is just a one shot game,
right?

216
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:32.140
There's nothing,
nothing particularly exciting about it.
There is no tomorrow.

217
00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.490
And so people are going to the facts.

218
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.960
But now let's go back and revisit some of the arguments.

219
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:41.320
That's a Edwina and Brooks and uh,
I've forgotten what your looks,

220
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:44.950
your neighbors called again and bad.
No,
I should with that.
And Ben said earlier,

221
00:13:44.951 --> 00:13:48.910
right?
They,
they,
they gave it quite elaborate reasons for cooperating,

222
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.540
cooperating to establish reputation inc cause the other person might cooperate,

223
00:13:52.541 --> 00:13:54.640
whatever.
All right.
But most of these,

224
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.880
most of these behaviors were designed to either induce or promise cooperation

225
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.050
period two is that right?

226
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:06.820
But what we've just argued is that in period two everyone's going to defect,

227
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:10.930
right?
Period two is just a trivial one.
Stage prisoner's dilemma,

228
00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.110
we actually analyzed it the very first week of the class and provided we believe

229
00:14:14.111 --> 00:14:15.370
these payoffs we're done.

230
00:14:15.371 --> 00:14:19.000
Period two people come to fact since they're going to defect in period two,

231
00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:24.150
nothing I can do in period one is going to affect that behavior and therefore I

232
00:14:24.911 --> 00:14:29.410
should defects also in period one.
I ain't got to Belabor this point.

233
00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:33.940
We can actually draw up what the Matrix looks like in parade while I'm trying to

234
00:14:33.941 --> 00:14:38.510
do that using the style we did last week.
All right.

235
00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:42.490
I put before two weeks ago before the,
before we went away.

236
00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:43.961
Our answer here,

237
00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:48.961
once again is the matrix we had before and I want to analyze the first stage of

238
00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:51.710
the game in the first stage game.

239
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.040
What I'm going to do is I'm going to add in the payoffs I'm going to get from

240
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:58.370
tomorrow.
The parents are gonna get from tomorrow or from tomorrow's equilibrium.

241
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.100
Well this isn't going to do very much from me as we'll see you because I'll get

242
00:15:01.101 --> 00:15:05.630
two plus zero tomorrow cause you know I'm playing defect fact tomorrow.

243
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:11.050
Two plus zero tomorrow minus one plus Zero Nauru three plus zero tomorrow,

244
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:20.650
three plus zero tomorrow minus one plus zero tomorrow and zero plus zero

245
00:15:22.731 --> 00:15:26.360
tomorrow.
Zero plus zero tomorrow.
Right?

246
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:28.850
So just as we did with the war of attrition game two weeks ago,

247
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.310
we can put in the payoff from tomorrow.

248
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.100
We can roll back those equilibrium pay off to today.

249
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.620
It's just in this particular exercise it's rather a boring thing cause I'm just

250
00:15:36.621 --> 00:15:38.450
adding zero of everything.
All right.

251
00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:42.520
When I answer to everything when I then just cancel out the Zeros and backwards

252
00:15:42.521 --> 00:15:46.340
started and of course I should defect,
right?
All right,

253
00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:49.790
so what I'm going to see is because I'm going to defect anyway,
tomorrow.

254
00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.410
Today is just like a one shot game as well and I'm going to do the cats defects

255
00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:59.030
again.
Now here we played the game twice and got to factor facts.

256
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.010
What about if we played the game three times?

257
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.920
It's the same thing right for the in three times,

258
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:07.490
but we did play the game three times between Edwina and Ben there.

259
00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:09.920
We know we're going to defect in the third round.

260
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:12.800
Therefore we may as well to factor in the second to last round.

261
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.160
Therefore we might as well the fact of the first round and if we read it five

262
00:16:16.161 --> 00:16:18.980
times,
we know we're going to all the facts in the fifth round.

263
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.380
Therefore we may as well older faction of the fourth round.

264
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.510
Therefore we have all the facts and the third and so on.

265
00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:27.130
If we put it at 500 times,
we wouldn't have time in a class,

266
00:16:27.131 --> 00:16:28.310
but we've made it 500 times.

267
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.530
We know in that 500th period it's a one shot game and people going to defects

268
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.470
and therefore in the 499th period people are going to affect and therefore in

269
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:40.010
the 498th period people are going to affect and so on.
All right,

270
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:45.100
so the problem here is that we get unraveling what we've seen before in this

271
00:16:45.861 --> 00:16:48.580
class.
We get unraveling from the back.

272
00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:51.950
I have a worry that there might only be one Alan unraveling in America.

273
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:55.700
Is that right?
How many ELLs?
We put an unraveling in America one.

274
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.130
I've just come back from England and my eye,

275
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.230
my spelling is somewhere in the mid Atlantic right now.
I'll leave it as one.

276
00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:04.820
All right.
I'm unraveling
from the back.
Essentially.

277
00:17:04.821 --> 00:17:06.520
This is a backward induction arguments.
Oh,

278
00:17:06.521 --> 00:17:07.910
and he said instead of using backward induction,

279
00:17:07.911 --> 00:17:08.990
we're already using something and perfection.

280
00:17:08.991 --> 00:17:12.800
We're looking at the equilibria and the last games and as we roll back up the

281
00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:17.150
game,
we get unraveling.
So here's bad news.

282
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:22.240
The bad news is we'd hoped that by having repeated interaction in the prisoner's

283
00:17:22.341 --> 00:17:25.370
dilemma,
we would be able to sustain cooperation.

284
00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.070
That's been our hope since day one of the cloth.
In fact,

285
00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:31.280
we stayed at the hung confidently in the first day of the class and we kind of

286
00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:32.750
intuitively believe it,

287
00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:37.730
but what we're discovering is even if you play this game for 500 times and then

288
00:17:37.731 --> 00:17:38.564
stopped,

289
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.920
you wouldn't be able to sustain corporation equilibrium because we're going to

290
00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:45.980
get unraveling of the last stage and so on and so forth.
All right,

291
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:51.030
so it seems like our big hope that repeated interaction would induce corporation

292
00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:54.870
to Sassy is going down the plug hole.
That's bad.

293
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.730
All right,
so let's come back and modify our lesson a little bit.

294
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:06.790
So what went wrong here was in the last period of the game,

295
00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:10.480
there was no incentives generated by the future.
All right?

296
00:18:10.481 --> 00:18:14.410
So there was no promise of future rewards or future punishment and therefore

297
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.220
cooperation broke down and then we had unraveling.
All right,

298
00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:22.990
so the lesson here is what the lesson is,

299
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:24.343
but

300
00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.370
<v 1>for this to work,</v>

301
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:35.410
it helps
to have

302
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.640
the future,
helps to have a future.

303
00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.860
<v 0>Hi,
this whole idea of repeat didn't traction,</v>

304
00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:50.370
which the future was going to create incentives for the present.

305
00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.170
But if the game is coming to an end,

306
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:55.020
there's going to be some point when there isn't a future anymore.

307
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.230
And then we get unraveling.
All right?
Now,

308
00:18:58.231 --> 00:19:02.670
this is not just a formal technical point to be made in the ivory tower of Yale.

309
00:19:02.730 --> 00:19:07.410
This is a true idea.
So for example,
if we think about,
uh,

310
00:19:07.411 --> 00:19:08.340
um,
uh,

311
00:19:08.341 --> 00:19:12.450
CEOs or presidents or managers of sports teams,

312
00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:15.060
there's a term we use for,
there's,
there's,

313
00:19:15.061 --> 00:19:19.260
there's a word we use this in the states for a to describe such such leaders

314
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.320
when they're getting towards the end of their term and everyone knows it.

315
00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:26.340
What's the,
what's the,
what's the expression we use?
Lame Duck.
All right?

316
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.440
So we have this lame duck effects.

317
00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:37.020
The lame duck effect at the end of somebody as term undermines their ability to

318
00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:41.230
cooperate,
their ability to provide incentives for people to cooperate with them,

319
00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.490
uh,
and,
uh,
causes a problem.
So this lame duck effects effects presidents,

320
00:19:45.491 --> 00:19:48.370
but it also affects CEO's of companies.
All right?

321
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:51.250
But it's not just leaders who run into this problem.
All right?

322
00:19:51.251 --> 00:19:55.240
So if you have an employee in your,
if you're employing somebody and you don't,

323
00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.640
you haven't,
you may have a contract with the person you're employing,

324
00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:01.600
but basically you're sustaining cooperation with this person because you

325
00:20:01.601 --> 00:20:03.700
interact with them often.
You know you're always going to track with them.

326
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:06.490
But then this employee approaches retirement,

327
00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.700
everyone knows that in April or something and they going to retire.

328
00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:14.200
Then the future can't provide incentives anymore and you have to switch over

329
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.350
from the implicit incentive of knowing you're going to be interacting in the

330
00:20:17.351 --> 00:20:21.280
future to an explicit incentive of putting incentive clauses in the contract.

331
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:25.330
All right?
So retirement can cause if you're like a lame duck effect.

332
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.313
<v 1>Timeless.</v>

333
00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:31.730
<v 0>All right?</v>

334
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:35.630
How this is even true in personal relationships with your personal relationships

335
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.590
with your friends.

336
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.560
If you think that those friendships are going to go on for a long time,

337
00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.980
be the with your significant other or just with the people you hang out with,

338
00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:47.180
you're likely to get a lot of cooperation.
But if as we perhaps most economic,

339
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:50.710
most of your significant others that are only going to last for a day at most,

340
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.260
you're not going to get great cooperation.
Right?
You're going to get cheesy.

341
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.070
All right?
All right.
No one's rising to that one,
but I guess it's true.
All right,

342
00:20:57.130 --> 00:21:00.970
so what do we call these economics majors?
Relationships.

343
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:02.103
<v 1>Okay.</v>

344
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.220
<v 0>Hi.
These are kind of end effects.
All of these things,</v>

345
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.293
<v 1>oh,</v>

346
00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:23.030
<v 0>are caused by the fact that the relationship is coming to an end and once the</v>

347
00:21:23.031 --> 00:21:24.070
ration is coming to an end,

348
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.220
that all those threats and promises of future behavior,

349
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:32.050
implicit or otherwise are going to basically disappear.
All right?

350
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:37.330
So at this point we might think,
we might think the following,

351
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.990
you might believe the following,
you might conclude fast.

352
00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.080
If a relationship has a known end,

353
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:46.990
everyone knows the relationship's going to end at a certain time,

354
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:48.870
then we're done.
I'm going to,

355
00:21:48.871 --> 00:21:53.320
we basically can't sustain cooperation through repeated interaction.
All right?

356
00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:57.370
And that's kind of what this,
what the example we looked at seems to suggest.

357
00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.840
However,
that's not quite true.
That's not quite true.

358
00:22:02.050 --> 00:22:04.680
So let's look at another example where our relationship,

359
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:06.820
a relationship is going to have a new end,

360
00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.110
but nevertheless we are able to sustain some cooperation and we'll see how,
okay,

361
00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.450
so again,
I'm being careful here.
I said it helps to have a future.

362
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.420
I haven't said it's necessary to have a future.
All right,
so that's,

363
00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:20.530
that's good news for the economics majors again.

364
00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.100
Alright,
so let's do

365
00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:35.860
this example to illustrate that even a finite interaction,

366
00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.420
even an interaction that's going to end and everyone knows it's going to end,

367
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:44.750
might still have some hope for corporations.
Let me look at it.

368
00:22:44.751 --> 00:22:47.200
It's a slightly more complicated game here.

369
00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.860
And this game has three strategies.
We'll call them a,
B,

370
00:22:50.861 --> 00:22:55.180
and c for each player.
And the payoffs are,
is there's four,

371
00:22:55.181 --> 00:23:00.181
four zero five zero zero down here we'll do zero zero,

372
00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:03.941
zero,

373
00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:08.941
zero and three three and the middle row five zero one one zero zero.

374
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:19.450
All right,
and we're going to assume that this game,

375
00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.240
just like we did with the first,
we're the first one we did prisoner's dilemma.

376
00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:26.340
This game is going to be played twice.
All right?
It's gonna be repeated it.

377
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:28.690
We played twice repeated ones.
All right,

378
00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.770
so let's just make sure we understand what's what the point of this game is a in

379
00:23:32.771 --> 00:23:34.480
this game and the one shot game,

380
00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:39.460
I hope it's clear that a is kind of the cooperative thing to do,

381
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:41.020
right?
We'd like to sustain.

382
00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:44.910
We'd like to sustain

383
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.660
play off a because then both players get four and that looks pretty good for

384
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:55.820
everybody.
All right.
However,

385
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:59.210
in the one shot game in the one shot game,

386
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.480
a is not a nash equilibrium.

387
00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:07.490
Why is a not a Nash equilibrium?
It'd be grab.
There's makes.
Again,

388
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:13.580
why is AA not an actual equilibrium?
Told us to work with one thing.
Anybody up?

389
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:17.180
I need to get rid of the memes.
This statement themselves.
This is Casey,
right?

390
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:21.350
So shout out the best response to the other guy playing A's playing be good.

391
00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.830
Good.
So if,
if,
if,
if I think the other person's going to play a,

392
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.630
I'm going to want to defect and play.

393
00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:31.631
Be annotated it again again of ones which I'll get five rather than four.

394
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:33.050
All right,

395
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:38.050
I'll defects to playing B and get five rather than four for gain of one.

396
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.460
Is that right?
Right.

397
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:47.350
So Aa is not a nash equilibrium in the one shot game we've got,

398
00:24:48.801 --> 00:24:51.890
someone's going to call that.
Well that's fine.
And the one shot game.

399
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:54.223
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

400
00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.880
<v 0>So now imagine we play this game twice.
There's US playing once.</v>

401
00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.360
We're going to play this game two times.
All right?

402
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:06.190
So now why isn't it,
I'm sorry,
I'll come back to that before I do that.

403
00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.800
What are the,
what are the pure strategy and actually quite a burden this game?

404
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:11.050
Anybody?

405
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:16.050
So bbs and then actually you whatever the Nash Equilibria and this one shot

406
00:25:16.271 --> 00:25:17.104
game.

407
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.513
<v 1>Ah,</v>

408
00:25:20.390 --> 00:25:24.950
<v 0>BB and CC.
All right,
bub.</v>

409
00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:27.590
That there's some mixed ones as well,
but this will do.
All right.

410
00:25:27.591 --> 00:25:32.220
So BB and cc are the,
uh,
appeal strategy,
Nashik,

411
00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.970
whatever.
All right.
Now consider playing this game twice.
All right.

412
00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:40.790
And last time we adjusted the game played twice while it was prisoner's dilemma

413
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:45.850
and we noticed that we couldn't sustain cooperation because then the last stage

414
00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:48.860
people weren't going to cooperate and have hands on the first stage.

415
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:51.920
People weren't going to cooperate.
But let's look what happens here.

416
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:57.380
If these games played twice,
is there any hope of sustaining corporation?

417
00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:00.710
I Aa in both stages.

418
00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:05.330
Could we have people pay a in the first stage and then pay a again in the second

419
00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:09.440
stage?
All right,
so Patrick shaking his head,
so that's right.

420
00:26:09.441 --> 00:26:12.050
So shake his head up.
He grabbed the other like,
all right,
so,
so why,

421
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.160
why is nothing I can do it?

422
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.520
Why can't we get people to cooperate and play a in both pair of shout out in the

423
00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.550
second period,
you're so ended effect in play beat.
Good.
Good.

424
00:26:19.551 --> 00:26:21.380
So in the second period,
exactly.

425
00:26:21.381 --> 00:26:24.350
The argument that Katie produced just now and the one shot game applies because

426
00:26:24.351 --> 00:26:27.050
the second period game,
it is a one shot game.
All right.

427
00:26:27.051 --> 00:26:31.780
So we've got no hope of sustaining cooperation in both Perez.

428
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:33.740
It's called this cooperation.

429
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:38.203
<v 1>Okay.</v>

430
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:40.160
<v 0>Right.
We call them sustain.</v>

431
00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.493
<v 1>Okay.</v>

432
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.900
<v 2>We call him cause this to stay in a,
in period two</v>

433
00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:51.970
and the second period.
However,

434
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:57.860
<v 0>I claim that we may be able to get people to cooperate in the first period of</v>

435
00:26:57.861 --> 00:26:58.694
the gate.

436
00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.480
<v 2>All right,
how are we going to do that?
So to see that,</v>

437
00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:05.930
let's consider the following strategy,
but

438
00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.400
consider the strategy,
right?

439
00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:14.930
Let's try it.
It's going to be

440
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:22.310
play a
and then

441
00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.940
play.
See a

442
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.800
was played
and play

443
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:40.910
be otherwise.

444
00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:44.223
<v 1>Okay.</v>

445
00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:49.880
<v 0>All right,
so this strategy isn't instruction telling the player how to play,</v>

446
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.930
how before you consider whether this is an equilibrium or not.

447
00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:55.610
It's been inverted commerce here as well.

448
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:58.600
Before we consider whether this didn't an not,

449
00:27:58.730 --> 00:28:02.330
let's just check that this actually is a strategy.
All right,

450
00:28:02.331 --> 00:28:06.700
what does the strategy you have to do?
It has to tell me what I should do it.

451
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:11.360
Could you give me an instruction at each of my information sets in this two

452
00:28:11.361 --> 00:28:13.100
period game,
each of us,

453
00:28:13.101 --> 00:28:16.160
each of the players in the game have two information sets.

454
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:19.700
They have an inflammation is at the beginning of the game and they have another

455
00:28:19.701 --> 00:28:22.880
information set at the beginning of period two is that right?

456
00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.690
So it has to tell you what to do at the first information set and at the second

457
00:28:26.691 --> 00:28:31.310
information sites and it does.
All right.
It says play a at the first one.

458
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.440
All right,
and then the parent,
the beating of period to what not.

459
00:28:35.441 --> 00:28:37.740
Now I said there's any one inflammation is at there,

460
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.880
but actually there's a million possible information sites depending on what

461
00:28:40.881 --> 00:28:41.331
happened in the,

462
00:28:41.331 --> 00:28:44.990
in the first period to each thing that happened in the first period is associate

463
00:28:44.991 --> 00:28:47.150
with the different information so that I always know what happened in the first

464
00:28:47.151 --> 00:28:50.120
parade.
And at each of those nine inflation stats,

465
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.810
it tells me what to do at the beginning of period two in particular,
it says,

466
00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:58.180
if it turns out that Aa was played then place,

467
00:28:58.181 --> 00:29:03.181
see now and otherwise all the other eight possible inflammation sets,

468
00:29:03.531 --> 00:29:08.510
I could find myself in play B.
All right,
so this is the strategy.

469
00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.120
Now,
of course,
the big question is,

470
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:14.720
is this strategy and equilibrium and in particular,

471
00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.310
is it a subgame perfect equilibrium?

472
00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:21.310
<v 1>Is this,</v>

473
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:23.340
<v 0>you stopped getting perfect equilibrium.</v>

474
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:27.300
Now you'd be a bit more precise if both players were playing this strategy.

475
00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.650
Would that be a subgame perfect equilibrium,
right?
Well,
let's have a look.

476
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:35.133
<v 1>Okay,</v>

477
00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:38.500
<v 0>it goes,
I don't see it now.
So let's put both your fourth down.</v>

478
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.413
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

479
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:56.000
<v 0>So to check that,
to check whether this is a subgame perfect equilibrium it,</v>

480
00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.450
we're going to have to check what we're going to have to check.

481
00:29:58.451 --> 00:30:03.230
They didn't do says Nash behavior in each sub game.

482
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:05.300
I think the battery is going on,
man.

483
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:13.060
Should I get rid of that?
Sorry.
Okay,
I'm going to shout.

484
00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:17.130
Can people still hear me?
People that,
can they get the heavy?
Yup.
Okay.

485
00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:23.190
So we're going to have to see if we can sustain Nash behavior.

486
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.713
<v 1>Yeah,
thanks.</v>

487
00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:35.420
<v 0>We're going to see if we can sustain Nash behavior in every sub game.</v>

488
00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:39.200
So let's start with the sub games associated with the second period.

489
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.770
Technically,
is there a nine such sub games?

490
00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:44.180
Depending on what happened in the past,

491
00:30:44.181 --> 00:30:47.510
depending on what happened in the first parade,
there's a subgame following Aa,

492
00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:52.100
there's a sub game following a B,
there's a subgame following,
AC and so on.

493
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.810
Should we?
Okay.
All right.

494
00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:01.730
So for each activity in the first period,
for each,

495
00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:06.020
for each profile in the first period,
there's a sub game.
However,

496
00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.200
it doesn't really matter to distinguish all of this.

497
00:31:08.201 --> 00:31:12.860
Oh games particularly carefully here since,
uh,
the,
the cost from the past.

498
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:16.190
What happened in the past is sunk.
All right.

499
00:31:16.191 --> 00:31:20.240
So we'll just look at them and there's a whole,
all right,
so in period two

500
00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.620
in period too

501
00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:31.150
often a I often AA.
All right,
so in one particular,

502
00:31:31.151 --> 00:31:34.010
the one in particular,
there's nine sub games after Aa.

503
00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.513
<v 1>Okay.</v>

504
00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:41.060
<v 0>This strategy
induces,</v>

505
00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:48.560
and do you see is cc all right.

506
00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.660
If people play a in the fifth,
both people like a,
in the first period,

507
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:54.990
then in the sub game following people are supposed to play a CFC.

508
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.340
Is that a nash equilibrium of the sub game?
What was cc?

509
00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:03.220
It was cc a nash equilibrium.
Yeah,
it's one of our Nash equilibrium.

510
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:05.850
Let's look up for,
we've got it listed here it is.

511
00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:09.900
So we're playing this nash equilibrium so that isn't actually equilibrium.

512
00:32:09.901 --> 00:32:10.734
So we're okay.

513
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:12.263
<v 1>All right.</v>

514
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:17.663
<v 0>Oh,
after</v>

515
00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:23.450
the other choices

516
00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.090
in period one,

517
00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:34.950
this strategy in juices,

518
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.133
<v 1>bebe,</v>

519
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.140
<v 0>that's good news too because Bibi,</v>

520
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:46.970
we already agreed was a nash equilibrium in the,
in the,
uh,
in,

521
00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:50.790
uh,
in,
in the one shot game.
All right.
So in both,
you know,

522
00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:53.150
in all of those nine sub games,

523
00:32:53.151 --> 00:32:58.151
the one off to a and the eight after everything else we're playing Nash

524
00:32:58.221 --> 00:33:01.670
behavior.
So that's good.
What about in the whole game,

525
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.773
the whole game

526
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.800
and the whole game starting home period one,
right.
We have to ask,

527
00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:19.670
do you do better to play the strategy as designated in particular to choose,

528
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:24.570
uh,
to choose a,
Oh,
what do you do better to the facts.
All right.

529
00:33:24.571 --> 00:33:25.404
What does have a look?

530
00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:31.320
So if I choose a then my,
I remember the other person,

531
00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.890
the other person is playing this with this strategy.
So if I choose a,

532
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:40.090
that might pay off in this period comes from a had is full.

533
00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:46.080
That's my shit.
If I choose a,
they were both playing a on this parade,

534
00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:49.950
I only get four.
Alright.
And tomorrow,

535
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:54.220
according to this strategy tomorrow,
right?

536
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:59.400
Tomorrow since we both played a will now put,
both of us will now play.

537
00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:02.160
See,
since we're both playing,

538
00:34:02.161 --> 00:34:06.660
see I'll get an additional payoff of three.
All right,

539
00:34:06.661 --> 00:34:09.550
so tomorrow,
see,

540
00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:14.650
see what a car and I'll get three for a total of seven.

541
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:19.440
All right.
What about if I defect,
what we get to kids?
Cause I,

542
00:34:19.441 --> 00:34:22.200
lots of possible defections but let's just consider the obvious to faction.

543
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:26.070
You can check the other ones at home.
So if I defect,

544
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.720
if I defect

545
00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:33.070
and choose B now,

546
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:38.760
then in this period and this period I will be playing B and my opponent or my

547
00:34:40.931 --> 00:34:43.120
path will be playing a.

548
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:47.170
So in this period I will get five.

549
00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:52.270
Alright.
And tomorrow,
tomorrow,

550
00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:54.760
since Aa did not occur,

551
00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:59.770
both of us will play B.

552
00:34:59.770 --> 00:35:03.970
Both of us will play a beat and get a continuation payoff of one.

553
00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:06.310
So the continuation pay off.
This time

554
00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:11.170
we'll be following from BB

555
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:18.160
and I'll get one what do what I've been doing before in this class and put boxes

556
00:35:18.161 --> 00:35:21.640
around the continuation pal just to indicate that they are in fact continuation

557
00:35:21.641 --> 00:35:23.750
payoffs.
Alright,

558
00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:29.130
so if I play a I get for now and the continuation pay off of three for a total

559
00:35:30.701 --> 00:35:33.760
of seven if I play be now.
Yeah,

560
00:35:33.761 --> 00:35:36.370
I gained something now I get five now,

561
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:40.830
but tomorrow I'll only get one for a total of six.

562
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:45.900
All right.
So in fact seven is bigger than sex,
so I'm okay.

563
00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:47.430
They won't want to do this to faction.

564
00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:50.283
<v 1>All right?</v>

565
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.260
<v 0>I just don't want to write this one other way cause it's gonna be useful for</v>

566
00:35:55.261 --> 00:35:58.800
later.
All right,
so one other way to write this [inaudible].

567
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:01.800
We've convinced ourselves that this is a,
this is an equilibrium,

568
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:05.280
but one other way to write this is an,
it's in a more general way,

569
00:36:05.281 --> 00:36:10.281
but in repeated games is to write explicitly comparing the temptations to cheat

570
00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:15.610
today with the rewards and punishments from tomorrow.
All right?

571
00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.370
What I want to do is in general,

572
00:36:17.371 --> 00:36:22.020
we just rewrite this as checking that the temptation,

573
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:28.950
the temptation to
cheat or to fact

574
00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:33.363
<v 1>today</v>

575
00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:35.850
<v 0>he's smaller than</v>

576
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:42.590
the value.
All the reward

577
00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.560
minus the value of

578
00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:50.443
<v 1>the punishment,</v>

579
00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:55.200
<v 0>but the keywords here are defecting a curse today.</v>

580
00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:57.950
Rewards and punishments I car

581
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.220
<v 1>tomorrow.
All right?</v>

582
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.900
<v 0>If we just rewrite it this way,
we'll see exactly the same thing.</v>

583
00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.400
Just rearranging slightly.

584
00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:11.580
The temptation to defect today is I get five rather than four of your leg again

585
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.193
of one.

586
00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:22.850
And the value of the reward tomorrow was a value of the reward.

587
00:37:23.671 --> 00:37:27.510
The reward was to play CEC tomorrow and get three.

588
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:33.140
The value of the punishment tomorrow was to play BB tomorrow and get one.

589
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.060
Right.
And that difference is too.
All right.
So here,

590
00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:44.120
the fact that the temptation is outweighed by the difference between the value

591
00:37:44.521 --> 00:37:48.840
of the reward and the value of the punishment is what enabled us to sustain

592
00:37:48.841 --> 00:37:52.630
cooperation.
Hi,
I'm just writing that more general way cause this is,

593
00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:56.250
this is the way that we can apply in games from here on.

594
00:37:57.210 --> 00:37:58.980
<v 1>All right.
We're gonna compare</v>

595
00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:03.840
<v 0>temptations to cheat with tomorrow's promises.</v>

596
00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:09.650
Patrick.
Yeah.
Let me,
let me get you a mic.
Okay.

597
00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:15.450
<v 3>I don't understand why it's reasonable to think you would play BB in the second</v>

598
00:38:15.451 --> 00:38:16.280
period though.

599
00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:20.820
Instead of you have in the second period you have a temptation to play cc,

600
00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:22.470
even if the person effected on you.

601
00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.880
<v 0>Good,
good.
That's,
that's a,</v>

602
00:38:23.881 --> 00:38:28.881
that's a very good one in white or Patrick saying is how calm where it's all

603
00:38:29.051 --> 00:38:32.140
very well to say we're sustaining corporation in the first period here.

604
00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:36.850
But the way in which we used to spend cooperation was by going along with,

605
00:38:36.851 --> 00:38:38.860
as it were,
the punishment tomorrow,
right?

606
00:38:38.861 --> 00:38:43.861
It required me tomorrow to go along with the strategy of choosing B if I cheated

607
00:38:45.491 --> 00:38:48.610
in the first period.
Right?
And I want to answer this twice,

608
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:50.950
once disagreeing with him and once agreeing with it.
Okay,

609
00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:55.960
so let me just disagree with them first.
So gnosis tomorrow if the other person,

610
00:38:55.961 --> 00:39:00.670
the other player is going to play B,
then I'm going to want to play B.

611
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:05.830
All right?
So the key,
the key idea here here is as always a nash equilibrium.

612
00:39:05.831 --> 00:39:09.070
If I take the other person's player has given and just look at my own behavior.

613
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.820
If I think the other person is playing the strategy and hence he's going to play

614
00:39:12.821 --> 00:39:16.570
be tomorrow off drive,
she said,
then I want to by being myself.

615
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:19.240
So that check is just our standard check.

616
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:21.620
And actually that's a check that makes sure that it really is us.

617
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:23.140
I've been perfect equilibrium.
We're not,

618
00:39:23.141 --> 00:39:26.310
we're not putting some punishments down the tree that arising out of equilibria.

619
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:26.890
They have to be.

620
00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:29.950
It has to be that I want to do tomorrow what I'm told to do tomorrow.
All right,

621
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:33.160
so that idea seems rights.
Uh,
and I'm gonna go ahead Patrick.
Read it,

622
00:39:33.161 --> 00:39:35.800
cause we're the next thing I know I wanted to go along with as punishment

623
00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:40.480
because if the other person's playing be,
I want to play,
be myself.
All right?

624
00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:41.740
So that's that.

625
00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:45.610
But never think Patrick's onto something and let me come back to it in a minute

626
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.320
and come back to in a minute.
All right?
But what I want to do before I do that,

627
00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:52.630
it's just draw out a general lesson from this game.

628
00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:58.140
And the general lesson is we can sustain cooperation even in a finite,

629
00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:02.050
a repeated game.
But to do so,

630
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:06.280
we need that to be more than one nash equilibrium.
And the stage game,

631
00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:09.820
what we needed to be is several Nash Equilibria,

632
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:14.530
one at least of which we can use as a reward.
And another one,

633
00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.060
which we can use as a punishment.

634
00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.870
I say even if a game is only played a finite number of times,

635
00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:25.050
if there are several equilibria in the sub gay ever severally Korver Equilibria

636
00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:26.500
in the stage game,

637
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:30.450
which bring this down and show again several equilibria in the,

638
00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:34.570
in the stage game,
both BB and cc,

639
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:39.750
we can use one of them as a reward and the other one as a punishment and use

640
00:40:41.441 --> 00:40:46.270
that difference to try and get people to resist temptations today.
All right,

641
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:50.540
so that's the general idea here
and it's just right there.

642
00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:00.430
But Patrick,
don't,
don't,
don't ever get away with not coming back to your point.

643
00:41:00.431 --> 00:41:03.640
I want to come back to it a second.
All right,

644
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:05.770
so the lesson here is

645
00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:15.860
if a stage gate,
the stage game is the game that's going to be repeated.

646
00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.000
If a stage game

647
00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.013
<v 1>highs</v>

648
00:41:20.190 --> 00:41:21.750
<v 0>more than one</v>

649
00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:25.290
<v 1>nash equilibrium in this</v>

650
00:41:28.930 --> 00:41:29.763
van,

651
00:41:30.490 --> 00:41:32.260
<v 0>we may be able</v>

652
00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:39.760
to use,

653
00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:41.680
<v 1>okay.</v>

654
00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.850
<v 0>The prospects,</v>

655
00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:43.993
<v 1>okay.</v>

656
00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:51.430
<v 0>Off playing
different equilibria.</v>

657
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:52.783
<v 1>Okay.</v>

658
00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:59.600
<v 0>Different Equilibria tomorrow</v>

659
00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.250
to provide incentives.

660
00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:07.323
<v 1>Okay.</v>

661
00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:15.550
<v 0>And we can think of these as incentives as rewards and punishments.</v>

662
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:21.623
<v 1>Okay.</v>

663
00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:27.750
<v 0>That's rewards and punishments for cooperation today.</v>

664
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.963
<v 1>Okay.</v>

665
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.521
<v 0>All right.</v>

666
00:42:35.521 --> 00:42:39.000
In the game we just saw there were exactly two PR strategy now sheik whatever,

667
00:42:39.001 --> 00:42:39.834
and the sub game.

668
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:43.890
We used one of them as a reward and the other one as a punishment,

669
00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:47.520
I think we were able to sustain cooperation in a subgame perfect.

670
00:42:47.530 --> 00:42:51.060
Equal equilibrium.
Alright.

671
00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:54.630
Now a question arises here and I think it's behind Patrick's question

672
00:42:56.130 --> 00:43:00.660
and that is how plausible is this?
How plausible is this?
Do we really,

673
00:43:00.690 --> 00:43:04.920
it's okay formally,
we write down that the gay even do the math,
this comes out.

674
00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:10.690
But how plausible is this as,
as,
as a model of what's going on in society.
Right.

675
00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:12.120
And I think the worry,

676
00:43:12.121 --> 00:43:16.350
I'm guessing this is the worry that was behind Patrick's question is,
is this,

677
00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:21.680
suppose I'm playing this game with Patrick and suppose Patrick Cheats on me.

678
00:43:22.411 --> 00:43:23.244
The first parade.

679
00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:27.180
So Patrick chooses B when I wanted them to choose a in the first parade.

680
00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.270
All right.
And now,
and in the second period,

681
00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:35.220
according to the equilibrium instructions were supposed to play BB and get

682
00:43:35.221 --> 00:43:40.221
payoffs of one rather than cc and get payoffs of three says,

683
00:43:40.890 --> 00:43:42.130
make that,
make that visible,
I guess.

684
00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.593
<v 1>All right,</v>

685
00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.480
<v 0>but suppose Patrick comes to me in the meantime.</v>

686
00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.640
So between period one and period two,

687
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:55.520
Patrick shows up at my office hours and he says,
yeah,

688
00:43:55.521 --> 00:43:58.330
I know I cheated on you yesterday.
All right,

689
00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.580
but why should we punish ourselves today?
Why should we,

690
00:44:01.581 --> 00:44:05.640
both of us lose today by playing the BB equilibrium?

691
00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:09.310
Why don't we both switch to the CC equilibrium artful?

692
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:13.250
That's better for both of us.
It's true that Patrick sang to me.

693
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.750
It's true that I cheated you yesterday,
but why know,

694
00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:18.410
let bygones be bygones are why cry over spilled milk on it.

695
00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:21.620
So he'll use some other sort of,
uh,
saying,
uh,

696
00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.070
plucked out of the book of attitudes and,
and,
and say to me,
well,
why,

697
00:44:25.071 --> 00:44:26.590
why go along with the punishment that just,

698
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:30.800
let's just play the good equilibrium now.
Alright.
And if I look at things,
I say,

699
00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:32.520
well,
you know,
it's true.

700
00:44:32.521 --> 00:44:36.420
I got nothing in the first period because Patrick kind of cheated me in the

701
00:44:36.421 --> 00:44:39.870
first parade.
It's Troy got nothing yesterday.
And it's true.

702
00:44:39.871 --> 00:44:43.320
It was Patrick who caused me to get nothing yesterday.
But nevertheless,

703
00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.490
that's a sunk cost.

704
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.880
And I'm comparing getting one now we're getting three now why don't I just go

705
00:44:47.881 --> 00:44:51.510
along,
get three and in fact if I,
I moreover this isn't a,

706
00:44:51.511 --> 00:44:54.790
I'm not in danger of being cheated again because if Patrick believes I'm going

707
00:44:54.791 --> 00:44:56.420
to play a c,
he's going to pay seats.

708
00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:58.203
<v 1>All right,</v>

709
00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.620
<v 0>so that kind of arguments,</v>

710
00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:05.450
that kind of argument involves what involves some kind of communication between

711
00:45:05.451 --> 00:45:08.930
stages,
but it sounds like that's going to be a problem.

712
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:13.280
Why was suppose it's the case that we are all going to get communication between

713
00:45:13.281 --> 00:45:16.460
periods and suppose it's the haste that someone with the gift of the Gab,

714
00:45:16.461 --> 00:45:17.420
I'm on his way to law school.

715
00:45:17.421 --> 00:45:20.690
Like Patrick is going to be able to persuade me to go back to the good

716
00:45:20.691 --> 00:45:24.830
equilibrium for everybody in period two then we know we're going to play the

717
00:45:24.831 --> 00:45:29.420
good equilibrium in period two and now we've lost any incentive to cooperate in

718
00:45:29.421 --> 00:45:30.254
period one.

719
00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:35.630
And the only reason I was willing to cooperate in period one was because the

720
00:45:35.631 --> 00:45:40.280
temptation to defects was outweighed by the difference between the value of the

721
00:45:40.281 --> 00:45:43.520
reward and the value of the punishment.
If we're going to get the reward anyway,

722
00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.050
I'll go ahead and effect today.

723
00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:47.183
<v 1>All right,</v>

724
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.390
<v 0>so the problem here is this notion of renegotiation.</v>

725
00:45:51.690 --> 00:45:56.190
This notion of communicating between periods can undermine this kind of

726
00:45:56.191 --> 00:46:00.540
equilibrium.
There's a problem that arises if we have renegotiated.

727
00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:03.550
<v 1>All right?</v>

728
00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:12.450
<v 0>So there may be a problem.</v>

729
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:15.533
<v 1>Oh</v>

730
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.790
<v 0>re negotiation.</v>

731
00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:24.180
<v 1>All right.</v>

732
00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:28.280
<v 0>It's probably may not be such a big problem for this.
For example,
it may be,</v>

733
00:46:28.281 --> 00:46:31.540
I'll say,
I'll be so angry at Patrick because he screwed me over in parade.

734
00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:35.630
One probably won't go along with the renegotiation and it may also be the case

735
00:46:35.631 --> 00:46:39.740
and we'll see some examples of this on the homework assignments that the many

736
00:46:39.741 --> 00:46:41.540
equilibria in the second,

737
00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:46.250
in the second stage of the game are not such that were that,
that uh,
that uh,

738
00:46:46.251 --> 00:46:49.340
punishment a punishment for Patrick is also a punishment for me.

739
00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:52.760
What really caused the problem here was in trying to punish Patrick,

740
00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:55.200
I had to punish myself.
I haven't,

741
00:46:55.201 --> 00:46:58.640
you could imagine games and we'll see some concrete examples and next and the

742
00:46:58.641 --> 00:47:02.900
next homework assignments in which punishing Patrick is rather fun for me and

743
00:47:02.901 --> 00:47:04.970
punishing me.
Israel,
the Fund for Patrick.
And that's gonna be,

744
00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.320
that's gonna be much harder to renegotiate our way out of.
Right.

745
00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:12.470
There was a question and we get to Mike after the question,
uh,
how he's about,

746
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:13.543
yeah,

747
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:15.833
<v 1>go ahead.</v>

748
00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:20.720
<v 0>Yeah,
just pointed the microphone and shout.
Yup.</v>

749
00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:22.820
If we're ruling out renegotiation,

750
00:47:22.821 --> 00:47:27.530
can't we divide a devise a strategy for prisoner's dilemma as well,

751
00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:32.210
even though it doesn't have a multiple Nash equilibriums yeah,
so the,
the,

752
00:47:32.211 --> 00:47:36.480
the issue in Britain.
Okay,
good.
So the issue there is in prisoner's dilemma,
we,

753
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:40.780
we established in the first week that if we're not allowed to make side
payments,

754
00:47:40.781 --> 00:47:42.580
I'm not allowed to bring it outside contracts,

755
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:46.060
then no amount of communication is going to help us.
All right.
So you're right.

756
00:47:46.061 --> 00:47:50.320
If we can rely on the courts or the mafia to enforce the contract,

757
00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:52.810
that will be fine.
And then communication would have bites.

758
00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.200
But you remember way back in the first week when we tried to talk our way out of

759
00:47:56.350 --> 00:47:58.360
of bad behavior in the prisoner's dilemma,

760
00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:02.240
it didn't help precisely because it's a dominant strategy.
All right?

761
00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:06.700
Whereas here,
here Patrick's conversation,
Patrick is verbal agreements to play.

762
00:48:06.701 --> 00:48:09.900
The other equilibrium is,
is an agreement to play on national,
whatever.

763
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:13.540
That's what's getting us into trouble.
All right.
All right,

764
00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:18.040
so what may help us hear what me avoid renegotiation is simply,

765
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:20.380
I'm not going to go along with that renegotiation.
I just,

766
00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:24.570
I'm too angry about having been cheated on it and it may be other reasons.

767
00:48:24.571 --> 00:48:27.280
It may actually be that I enjoy the punishment.
Nevertheless,

768
00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:30.700
this is a real problem in society.
I think we should retain this problem,

769
00:48:30.701 --> 00:48:34.090
isn't there?
So a good example is in bankruptcy.

770
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:40.003
<v 1>Okay.</v>

771
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:42.350
<v 0>Which is one of those words I can never spell.</v>

772
00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:44.420
It seems to have too many consonants in it.
Is that right?

773
00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:46.580
It's approximately right.
Anyway.
All right.

774
00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:51.700
So bankruptcy law are in the u s for the last 200 years has gone through cycles

775
00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:58.120
and it was one way to view these cycles is their cycles of relaxing the law and

776
00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:04.530
making life easier for borrowers and then tightening up again.
All right.

777
00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:05.660
This is not a reason for not,
I mean,

778
00:49:05.661 --> 00:49:08.870
there's not only a recent phenomenon this occurred throughout the 19th century.

779
00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:13.580
That's what typically happened was there was either explicit renegotiation

780
00:49:13.581 --> 00:49:17.870
between parties or negotiation through act of Congress or sometimes through the

781
00:49:17.871 --> 00:49:22.280
act of,
of,
of,
uh,
of the states in which,
uh,
bankrupt,
uh,

782
00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:23.940
debtors were,
uh,

783
00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:28.280
basically let off or given an easier terms and the Alderman was always the same.

784
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:31.610
These people are not going to pay back now,
right?

785
00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:35.750
It's clear if I'm from the 19th century,
uh,
often,
uh,
if you were bankrupt,

786
00:49:35.751 --> 00:49:38.870
you were in jail.
All right?
Actually worse than that,
sometimes in the,
in,

787
00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:42.500
in the ninth century in England,
not only if you're bankrupt were you in jail,

788
00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:46.400
but your creditors were having to pay the fees to feed you in jail.
All right?

789
00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:47.750
So there you are sitting in jail,

790
00:49:47.751 --> 00:49:50.420
you weren't paying that money back to your creditor and you were actually

791
00:49:50.421 --> 00:49:52.970
costing money to your creditor.
I being in jail,

792
00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.160
this seems like a situation that you want to read it.

793
00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:57.470
Do you want to renegotiate your way out top?
You say,
Hey,

794
00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:00.500
let's let these guys out of jail that there'd be productive again and they'll

795
00:50:00.501 --> 00:50:02.260
pay back part of the loans.
Right?

796
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:06.900
So you had these waves of bankruptcy reform in which a bank in which the,

797
00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:11.720
the,
the uh,
dentist,
jails,
debtors' prisons were closed down.
People were let out,

798
00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.720
people were relieved of debt.
What's the problem with doing that?

799
00:50:14.721 --> 00:50:16.670
And does that seem like a good idea?
Right?
After all,

800
00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.760
you don't want all these people bank crops,
uh,
in debt,

801
00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:21.530
not paying money back to their credit has anyway.

802
00:50:21.531 --> 00:50:24.260
That doesn't seem like a good situation.
Society.
That seems like a good,

803
00:50:24.261 --> 00:50:28.220
was that renegotiation.
That's a win.
Win.
It's better for everybody.

804
00:50:28.700 --> 00:50:32.930
What's the problem with it though?
Yeah.
What's the,
is kind of a mic down here.

805
00:50:32.931 --> 00:50:37.670
What's the problem with us?
Yup.
Yup,
Yup.
And incentivizes bankruptcy,
right?

806
00:50:37.671 --> 00:50:41.980
It creates an incentive for people not to repay in the first place and make it

807
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:45.550
creates an incentive for people to take big risks now.
All right.

808
00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.460
And hence it makes bankruptcy if you like or mix mix,
uh,

809
00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:53.150
non repayment of debt more likely.
So this has been going on for a while,

810
00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.250
but you see it very much today.

811
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:57.670
If you read the financial pages of the papers and the in,
in,

812
00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:58.730
in the last few weeks,

813
00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:03.200
there's a big worry in the u s right now about people failing to repay what kind

814
00:51:03.201 --> 00:51:06.560
of debt we're going to.
That's the big worry about mortgage debt,
right?

815
00:51:06.561 --> 00:51:11.060
So both people who are house owners feeling to payback mortgage debt and equally

816
00:51:11.061 --> 00:51:15.110
worrying financial institutions that have,
that have lent a lot of,
for example,

817
00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:18.530
subprime debt now finding I was in financial trouble and you're going to read a

818
00:51:18.531 --> 00:51:23.531
lot in the papers about not letting people out lately out of those,

819
00:51:24.150 --> 00:51:27.290
out of those situations of being in debt and not letting any black out lately

820
00:51:27.440 --> 00:51:32.240
out of bankruptcy.
Right?
What,
what's the tone you're going to hear is bailout.

821
00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.280
So bailout.

822
00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:41.540
<v 1>Okay.</v>

823
00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.730
<v 0>The argument going to be,
you're going to read this,</v>

824
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:48.140
you don't want the government or the central bank bailing out those financial

825
00:51:48.141 --> 00:51:52.490
institutions who have had apparently taken two large risks on subprime mortgage

826
00:51:52.491 --> 00:51:53.090
debt.

827
00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:57.020
Even though we all agree it's better right now for those financial institutions

828
00:51:57.021 --> 00:51:58.940
not to go under.
And why are we not going to,

829
00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.400
even though it's better for everybody if not to go under,

830
00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:05.360
why we're not going to bail them out because it undermines the incentives for

831
00:52:05.361 --> 00:52:08.330
them not to make bad loans to start with.
And to a lesser extent,

832
00:52:08.331 --> 00:52:09.920
you're going to hear that on the data side as well.

833
00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:13.070
You're to have some people say we shouldn't be bailing out people who took,

834
00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:17.090
who took on the bad loans to borrow it.
It took on bad mortgages to uh,

835
00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:20.570
to finance their houses again for bailout reasons.
All right,

836
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:24.200
so this is an important trade off you'll,
if you go on to law school,

837
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:26.660
you're going to see a lot of out this,
this kind of discussion.

838
00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:31.810
And this is the discussion of trading off ex ante efficiency

839
00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:36.760
and ex post efficiency.

840
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:47.820
Sometimes as Patrick pointed out in the game just now,

841
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:51.690
the ex post efficient thing to do is to go back to the good equilibrium or if

842
00:52:51.691 --> 00:52:55.860
you'd like to bail out these firms who've made bad loans.
However,

843
00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.510
from an ex ante point of view,

844
00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:00.300
it creates bad incentives to people to make those loans in the first place and

845
00:53:00.301 --> 00:53:01.500
the ex ante point of view.

846
00:53:01.590 --> 00:53:04.950
It created the incentive for people to defects in the first part of that game.

847
00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:08.610
All right,
so this theme of ex ante versus ex post deficiency,

848
00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:10.650
it's not what I'm going to go into any more in this class,

849
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:13.560
but it should be there in the back of your minds when you all end up in law

850
00:53:13.561 --> 00:53:17.860
school in a few years' time.
Okay,

851
00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:20.170
so so far what have we done?

852
00:53:20.410 --> 00:53:24.100
We've been looking at repeated interaction and seeing if it's consistent and

853
00:53:24.101 --> 00:53:28.590
cooperation and the first thing we learned was that if they repeated interaction

854
00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:31.770
is a final interaction.
If we know when it's going to end,

855
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.900
we know when the interaction is going to end.

856
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:39.180
Then sustaining corporation's going to be hard because in the last period

857
00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.680
there'll be an incentive to defects.

858
00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:45.360
We saw you get round that to some extent if games have multiple equilibria,

859
00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:48.300
but in the game,
right?
Prisoner's dilemma,
we're really in trouble.

860
00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:50.940
Things will unravel from the back.
All right,

861
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:54.900
so now let's mix things up a little base by looking at a more complicated

862
00:53:54.901 --> 00:53:59.901
variety of repeated interactions rather than just play the game once or twice or

863
00:53:59.941 --> 00:54:02.670
three times.
Let's play the game under the following rules,

864
00:54:02.671 --> 00:54:06.630
but we'll go back to our same players.
How many mikes are still out here?

865
00:54:06.631 --> 00:54:08.400
Then I took them both back.
Is that right?

866
00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:11.190
So I'm thinking I'm taking both the green and the blue mic.

867
00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:13.740
I'm getting them back to our players.
All right,

868
00:54:13.741 --> 00:54:18.450
so this is to the Brooks and this is to Patrick.
All right,

869
00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:21.480
and going to have Brooks and Patrick play prisoner's dilemma again.

870
00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.550
I'm hoping I haven't deleted it.

871
00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:26.333
<v 1>Maybe I did.</v>

872
00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:30.450
<v 0>Oh right.
It doesn't matter what we,
we,
we,
we know the payoffs.</v>

873
00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:32.680
We're going to have them play prisoner's dilemma again.

874
00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:37.120
But this time in between every play of the game,

875
00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:40.690
I'm going to toss a coin.
Actually,

876
00:54:40.691 --> 00:54:45.691
I'll toss the coin twice and if that coin comes up heads both times,

877
00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:51.310
then the game will end.
But otherwise they'll play again.

878
00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:52.600
All right,
everyone.
Everyone's how we're going to do,

879
00:54:52.601 --> 00:54:55.660
we're going to play prisoner's dilemma at the end of every period.

880
00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:57.220
I'll toss a coin twice.

881
00:54:57.580 --> 00:55:00.160
I might get Jesus to said I'm not going to toss a coin twice.

882
00:55:00.190 --> 00:55:03.640
If it comes up heads,
both times the game's over,

883
00:55:03.730 --> 00:55:06.850
but otherwise the game continues.
All right?

884
00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:10.510
So both Brooks and Patrick should get ready to play.
And the payoffs,
this game,

885
00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:11.680
it's just what we had before.

886
00:55:11.681 --> 00:55:14.810
So it's just remind ourselves about the power slide game.
Aha.

887
00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:17.590
So we've got to cooperate the fact cooperate to facts

888
00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:20.770
<v 1>two,
two</v>

889
00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:22.980
<v 0>minus one three</v>

890
00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:29.050
three minus one and zero.
Sarah,
I'm gonna keep score here.

891
00:55:29.051 --> 00:55:31.030
So this is,
uh,
Brooks

892
00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.370
<v 1>and Patrick.</v>

893
00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:38.410
<v 0>All right,
so putting pressure on these guys.
It's a,</v>

894
00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.420
let's write down what you're going to do the first time.

895
00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:48.850
All right,
Brooks,
the fiber.
Better cooperate.
All right.
Weight.
Hey,

896
00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:50.620
waiting some payback from early.
All right.

897
00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:58.630
All right.
Round two.
Are you going to toss a coin?
Oh,
I have to tell you.

898
00:55:58.631 --> 00:56:03.580
I have to write.
Thank you going to have to find the car without,
I look at that.

899
00:56:03.581 --> 00:56:07.030
Thank you,
Allie.
Uh,
twice.
Just twice

900
00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:11.253
<v 1>heads</v>

901
00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:17.640
<v 0>heads again.
So the game is over.
That was the last one.
Let's just for the,</v>

902
00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:21.900
just for the sake of the class,
let's pretend that it came up.
Tails.
Okay.
Okay.

903
00:56:21.901 --> 00:56:24.130
We'll cheat a little bit,
which each little bit.
Okay.

904
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:25.780
So we're playing a second time,
uh,

905
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:29.290
just with a little bit of saying hi to someone else that someone,

906
00:56:29.291 --> 00:56:34.230
someone less honest to toss the coin.
Brooks,

907
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:37.080
what do you,
what do you,
what do you choose?
Oh,
I'm dictating [inaudible] again.

908
00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:39.330
All right.
Patrick,
cooperate.

909
00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.220
Corporated Eddie's.
Patrick's.
He was very trusting.
Yeah.
All right.

910
00:56:44.221 --> 00:56:48.690
It's just the kind of her time.
All right.
Okay,
good.
Thank you.

911
00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:51.540
All right,
so,
uh,
uh,
Brooks,

912
00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:59.520
<v 2>I'm going to defect again.
Yep.
Perfect.
All right.</v>

913
00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:08.720
<v 1>Okay.</v>

914
00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:10.440
<v 0>Okay.
So this time it was somewhat end date.
Okay.
So,</v>

915
00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:13.430
so what happened this time is just talk around to beds.
So they're Brixton.

916
00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:17.220
Patrick,
we're playing.
All right.
Patrick cooperated a bit at the beginning.

917
00:57:17.221 --> 00:57:19.260
Brooks defected throughout Brooks.
Why did you defect?

918
00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:21.090
Shout out so everyone can hear you.
All right.

919
00:57:21.091 --> 00:57:22.770
Why did you defect right from the start of the game?

920
00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:24.260
<v 2>Uh,
because,</v>

921
00:57:25.690 --> 00:57:28.450
<v 0>because last time it didn't work so well.
The gloss,
we're going to walk so while,</v>

922
00:57:28.451 --> 00:57:32.830
okay.
Okay.
That's fair enough.
Okay.
But even after Patrick was corporate,

923
00:57:32.831 --> 00:57:36.820
so the cooperating you went on defecting.
So,
uh,
why,
why then?

924
00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:37.890
<v 2>Um,</v>

925
00:57:37.890 --> 00:57:42.300
because I got out because I wanted to get the higher payoff from,

926
00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:46.650
I thought either he would continue cooperating and I could affect,

927
00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:50.350
um,
and yeah.

928
00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:53.920
<v 0>All right.
All right.
So I thought he'd gone corporate,
which in fact he did.</v>

929
00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:57.430
He did.
Patrick,
why aren't you cooperating early on here?
Shout it,

930
00:57:57.431 --> 00:57:58.460
shout out to people.
Get people here.

931
00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:01.300
<v 3>So it's a two head rules.</v>

932
00:58:01.301 --> 00:58:06.190
Like you have a 75% chance of having another game.
So with those payoffs,

933
00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:08.290
um,
even one period,

934
00:58:08.291 --> 00:58:11.520
the payoff of cooperating twice is the same as the factory once.

935
00:58:11.530 --> 00:58:13.900
So like additional periods,

936
00:58:14.830 --> 00:58:19.360
it's better if you can continue cooperating and a percentage is high enough that

937
00:58:20.290 --> 00:58:22.770
<v 0>you figure there's a good enough chance of,
of,
of,
of getting sick to go.</v>

938
00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:25.840
Even after Brooks defected,
the first period you went on cooperating,

939
00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:26.860
but then the after hit,

940
00:58:26.861 --> 00:58:29.920
after the second period you gave up as a defecting or they go on to the fourth

941
00:58:29.921 --> 00:58:33.720
period,
what would do have done defected.
It does affect it again.
Right.
And,
and,

942
00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:34.730
and fifth period.

943
00:58:35.010 --> 00:58:36.890
<v 3>Well,
if she kept attracting,
I would keep the of,</v>

944
00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:40.700
<v 0>all right,
so what was,
what Patrick's saying is he started off cooperating,</v>

945
00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:45.420
but once he saw that Brooks was defecting,
he was not a switch to the and,

946
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:46.950
but basically as long as she went into effect,

947
00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:49.400
he was in a switch to stick with the faxing.
All right,

948
00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:50.990
let's try a different path.

949
00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:54.470
So why don't we switch it over to your partners there?
So,
so,
uh,

950
00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:59.050
to ban the here and um,
I'm sorry.
Edwina.
Alright.
Right

951
00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:06.693
<v 1>briefing.</v>

952
00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:09.780
<v 0>Well,
we'll put,
we'll put twice.
All right.
All right.</v>

953
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:12.410
But people have told us when he was a stand out,
I want to see these people.

954
00:59:12.411 --> 00:59:15.390
So Thomas second are,
these are players that when people at the backs,

955
00:59:15.391 --> 00:59:18.520
which we know,
we know who playing this,
he said,
we know this is Ben.
All right?

956
00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:23.240
All right,
good.
All right.
Okay.
So,
uh,
Edwina,
uh,

957
00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:26.270
usually you sit down and get to be so you can actually write things down.
Okay.

958
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:27.440
So,
all right,

959
00:59:27.441 --> 00:59:32.030
so Edwina and Ben goes with no strategy.

960
00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:36.210
[inaudible] strategy.
Yep.
Edwina,
what did you choose?
Cooperate and wieners.

961
00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:40.010
Cooperating.
Ban.
Cooperate.
Aha.
Okay,

962
00:59:40.930 --> 00:59:43.750
<v 2>let's toss a coin heads than tails.</v>

963
00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:46.080
<v 0>So we're okay.
We're okay.
So we're still playing.
Okay.</v>

964
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:53.300
<v 2>Edwina,
cooperate.
Ben?
I chose cooperate.
All right,
so the cooperating</v>

965
00:59:56.300 --> 01:00:00.260
tales against,
you're still playing.
Cooperate.

966
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:01.650
Cooperate.

967
01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:05.350
<v 0>All right,
so there's still cooperating some pain in the voice.
This time</v>

968
01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:09.690
<v 2>has a nice house.
Right down.
We're going to do</v>

969
01:00:13.450 --> 01:00:16.390
had we let defect,
Ben Cooperate.

970
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:19.160
<v 0>All right.
All right.
So thanks for going through nicely that</v>

971
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:25.800
we had such a nice class going on there and everything.
All right sir.

972
01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.520
<v 2>It was heads then.
Tails.
All right.
So we're still playing</v>

973
01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:35.040
Edwina defect,
right?
Defect.
Alright.
Alright.

974
01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:40.970
Jay Townsend House.
We're still going

975
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.650
to fact to fact.

976
01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:48.360
<v 0>All right,
let me,
let,
let me,
let me stop it.
They will pretend.</v>

977
01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:50.840
We'll pretend that we're turning them head to head.
So let's,

978
01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:53.490
let's talk about this,
right?
So we had some cooperation going on here.

979
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:56.850
Both people started cooperating.
So a Ben Wa,

980
01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.900
why did you cooperate at the beginning?
Shout out to people to hear,

981
01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.910
why don't you come ride?
Well,
going along with Patrick's reasoning,

982
01:01:03.911 --> 01:01:08.170
I felt that if we could have the cooperate cooperate in the long term with the

983
01:01:08.171 --> 01:01:12.640
75% chance of continuing playing,
that it would be a worthwhile investment.

984
01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:13.391
All right.
All right.

985
01:01:13.391 --> 01:01:17.260
Until I realized that I'd started to cause this cause come back to in a second.

986
01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.470
Let's get you guys to stand out.
We to be able to,
people going to hear you.

987
01:01:20.471 --> 01:01:23.740
I think maybe when you stand up you shout more.
That's not up again.
Yes.
Edwina.

988
01:01:23.741 --> 01:01:25.840
Wait,
why?
Why didn't you,
so you also started cooperating.

989
01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:27.340
Why didn't you start cooperating?

990
01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:28.010
<v 2>Okay.</v>

991
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:29.360
<v 4>Um,
for the same reason.</v>

992
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:32.780
<v 0>Same reasoning.
Okay.
Okay.
So the,
so the key thing here is why,</v>

993
01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.470
why did you start to factor?
You heard the big sigh in the class.
Why,

994
01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:38.240
why did you start the fact check at this stage?

995
01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.590
<v 4>Um,
because we'd had so many,</v>

996
01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:44.040
I mean the coin has cut off task that had to come to heads heads sometime.

997
01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:45.540
So I started thinking that

998
01:01:45.870 --> 01:01:47.480
<v 0>this is reversion to the mean of the coin.</v>

999
01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:55.120
I thought maybe.
I mean I said I don't know.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.
Alright.

1000
01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:59.260
So what do I say about the relation to evacuate if economic majors that are in

1001
01:01:59.261 --> 01:02:01.960
the past anyway.
All right,
so,
uh,

1002
01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.410
so and we ended affected and then Ben,
you switched after that.

1003
01:02:05.411 --> 01:02:06.370
Why did you switch?

1004
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.680
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1005
01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.600
<v 0>Um,
because once Edwina started affecting,</v>

1006
01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:14.830
I felt that we revert back to the defective act equilibrium hall.
Right.

1007
01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:18.910
All right,
so,
so thank.
Thank you.
Good.
Thank you guys.
All right,
so there's,

1008
01:02:18.970 --> 01:02:19.980
remember this strategy here,

1009
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:25.070
people started off cooperating and I claim that at least been banking contract

1010
01:02:25.310 --> 01:02:28.770
in a segment.
I think Ben Strategy here with something like this,

1011
01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:33.590
I'm going to cooperate and I'm going to go on cooperating as long as we're

1012
01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.780
cooperating,
but if at some points,

1013
01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.770
if at some points had wiener defects or the mind of someone I need to facts,

1014
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:42.330
then you know the game,

1015
01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:45.120
this relationship's over and we're going to paint the fact forever.

1016
01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:48.360
Is that right?
That that's kind of a rough description of your strategy.

1017
01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:52.380
All right,
all right,
and then wiener was more or less playing the same thing.

1018
01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.380
In fact,
it was heard,
affected,
but once she defected,

1019
01:02:55.381 --> 01:02:59.100
she realized it was over and he went on to factor.
All right,

1020
01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:03.870
so the strategy has a name has just be clear what the strategy is.

1021
01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:08.330
Their strategy says,
play,
see you,

1022
01:03:08.331 --> 01:03:10.860
she's cooperates,
and then

1023
01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:14.773
<v 1>then</v>

1024
01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:16.800
<v 0>play.</v>

1025
01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:21.800
See if no one has played

1026
01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:30.420
<v 1>d
and play d</v>

1027
01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.620
<v 0>otherwise.
All right,
so start off by cooperating.</v>

1028
01:03:37.070 --> 01:03:40.070
Keep cooperating as long as nobody's cheated,

1029
01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:43.370
but if somebody cheats,
this relationship's over.

1030
01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:45.740
We're just going to affect forever.
All right,

1031
01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:49.790
now these strategies are famous strategy.
It has a name.

1032
01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.230
You want to know what the name is?

1033
01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:53.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1034
01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:57.310
<v 0>This is called the grim trigger strategy.
The grim trigger strategy.</v>

1035
01:04:06.980 --> 01:04:07.813
<v 1>Okay?</v>

1036
01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:12.040
<v 0>The grim trade strategy.
So this strategy,
again,
it says we're going to cooperate,</v>

1037
01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:13.660
we're going to cooperate.

1038
01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:18.610
But if that corporation breaks down ever,
even if it's me,

1039
01:04:18.611 --> 01:04:21.700
you breaks it down,
then I'm just going to defect forever.

1040
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.280
<v 1>Alright.
Alright.</v>

1041
01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:28.280
<v 0>Now we're going to come back next time as you can see if this is an equilibrium,</v>

1042
01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:30.920
but before,
but,
but there's a few things to do.
First.
First,

1043
01:04:30.921 --> 01:04:34.210
let's just check that it actually is a strategy,
right?

1044
01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:35.690
What does it mean to be a strategy?
Again,

1045
01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:40.930
it has to tell us what to do at every information said I could find myself fast

1046
01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:46.450
and this gay you man,
he's potentially infinite,
right?

1047
01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:49.780
So potentially there's an infinite number of increment of inflammation.
So it's,

1048
01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:50.633
I could reach.

1049
01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:56.050
So you might think that writing down a strategy that gives me an instruction at

1050
01:04:56.480 --> 01:04:58.280
every single information sets,

1051
01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:01.970
it's going to be incredibly complicated once we go to games that are potentially

1052
01:05:01.971 --> 01:05:05.180
infinite,
right?
Cause that need to be an infinite number of instructions.

1053
01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:09.790
But it turns out actually it's possible to write down some strategies rather

1054
01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:13.550
simply at least if they,
if they are simple strategies and this example is one,

1055
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:17.980
this tells me what to do at the first information site it says,
please see it.

1056
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:22.960
Then tells me for every information said I find myself at in which only

1057
01:05:22.961 --> 01:05:26.440
cooperation has ever occurred in the history of the game.

1058
01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:28.180
I'm going to go incorporating,

1059
01:05:28.410 --> 01:05:33.410
please see and it says for all other histories for all other inflammation sets I

1060
01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:38.140
might find myself at play d.
All right,
so it really is a strategy.

1061
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:43.810
All right.
No,
this is very different behavior.

1062
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:46.300
Both of his,
we played with the same players.

1063
01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:51.540
This kind of behavior is very different in both games actually is very different

1064
01:05:52.510 --> 01:05:55.630
than the gate and then the then the behavior we saw in the game that ended,

1065
01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:57.310
they get them with two periods or three periods.

1066
01:05:57.580 --> 01:06:01.220
What is it essentially that made this difference?

1067
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:04.690
What's different about this way of playing prisoner's dilemma where we toss,

1068
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:09.070
we had Jake toss the coin versus the way we played before and we just played for

1069
01:06:09.071 --> 01:06:12.400
five periods and then stopped.
What's different about it?

1070
01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:17.890
Somebody has talked to our players.
Okay,
so is the Mikes let Patrick,

1071
01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.950
do you have your mic still Patrick?
Why?
Why is this difference?

1072
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:25.570
We don't know when the game is going to end or if it's going to and so there is

1073
01:06:25.571 --> 01:06:28.930
no last period.
Good,
good.
So our analysis of the,

1074
01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:31.750
of the game before the analysis or the prisoner's dilemma,

1075
01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:34.710
when we knew it was going to end after two periods,
five periods,

1076
01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.620
whatever it was was we all knew it was going to end right.

1077
01:06:38.621 --> 01:06:41.860
There was a clearly defined last period where people are going to retire.

1078
01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:44.110
We knew the month in which they're going to retire.

1079
01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.090
When presidents are going to step down,

1080
01:06:46.270 --> 01:06:49.240
we know they're going to step down that parade.
When CEOs are going to go,

1081
01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:51.890
we know they're going to are,
we don't always know.
I think I got this.

1082
01:06:51.900 --> 01:06:53.350
Pretend we did it right.
Alright.

1083
01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:58.300
So what's different about this game is every time we play the game,

1084
01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.030
that is a probability.
In this case,

1085
01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:04.450
a three quarters problems see that the game's going to continue to the next

1086
01:07:04.451 --> 01:07:05.290
permit,
right?

1087
01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:10.060
Every time we play the game with prevalency 0.75 there's going to be a future.

1088
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.033
All right?

1089
01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:17.040
There's no obvious last period from which we can unravel the game and the way we

1090
01:07:17.651 --> 01:07:21.430
did before.
I just remind ourselves the way in which cooperation,

1091
01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:25.620
our analysis of cooperation broke down in the filing and repeated prisoners'

1092
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:28.300
dilemma was that when we looked at the last period,

1093
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:32.830
we know people are going to defect and once that thread is loose we can unravel

1094
01:07:32.831 --> 01:07:35.530
it all the way back to the beginning.
But here,

1095
01:07:35.650 --> 01:07:38.260
since there is no last period,

1096
01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:42.670
that unraveling argument never gets hold.
All right?

1097
01:07:43.330 --> 01:07:46.990
Now instead we're able to see strategies develops lake.

1098
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:50.980
The grim trigger strategy and news is that the grim trigger strategy has a

1099
01:07:50.981 --> 01:07:55.870
pretty good chance of of of actually sustaining corporation.
So in particular,

1100
01:07:56.050 --> 01:08:00.040
as long as people play this strategy,
they are cooperating.

1101
01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:03.970
All right along the people that play a stretch,
they are cooperating.
Well,

1102
01:08:04.110 --> 01:08:06.790
it turns out that had wiener eventually gave up that strategy.

1103
01:08:06.791 --> 01:08:11.170
But how'd you got on playing it?
They're gone cooperating forever.
All right,

1104
01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.570
but of course there's a question here and the question is,

1105
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:18.020
is this in fact an equilibrium?
Right?

1106
01:08:18.021 --> 01:08:21.050
We know that people play this way.
We get cooperation,
but the question,

1107
01:08:21.051 --> 01:08:24.680
that's what the,
the thousand dollar question is,
is this an equilibrium?

1108
01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:29.480
So what do we have to do to check whether this isn't equal?
Everyone,
not,

1109
01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:34.600
we have to mimic

1110
01:08:38.050 --> 01:08:39.400
the argument we had before.

1111
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:44.910
We have to compare the temptation to defect today and compare that with the

1112
01:08:48.251 --> 01:08:53.251
value of the reward to cooperating and the value of the punishment from

1113
01:08:53.681 --> 01:08:56.230
defecting tomorrow.
All right,

1114
01:08:56.231 --> 01:09:00.340
so this basic idea is going to reemerge.
Having said that,
let me now delete it.

1115
01:09:00.341 --> 01:09:04.330
So I have some rob,
we're going to have to come to,

1116
01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.710
to show this as an equilibrium,

1117
01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:10.920
we need to show that the temptation to did affects the temptation to cheese in

1118
01:09:11.531 --> 01:09:15.010
the short term is outweighed by the,

1119
01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:19.600
the difference between the value of the reward.
And the value of the punishment.

1120
01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.940
All right,
so let's set that up.

1121
01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:28.973
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1122
01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.050
<v 0>let's put the temptation here first.</v>

1123
01:09:31.470 --> 01:09:36.090
So the temptation and prisoner's dilemma to the temptation to cheat today is

1124
01:09:36.091 --> 01:09:40.230
what?
I'll get three rather than two.

1125
01:09:40.650 --> 01:09:44.910
Is that right?
So if I had to facts when Edwina affected,

1126
01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:50.780
he said we knew the fact thing and this period she got a pay off of three rather

1127
01:09:52.261 --> 01:09:56.730
than the payoff of two she would have got from cooperating.
All right?

1128
01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.180
So there's a temptation here is just three minus two.

1129
01:10:02.050 --> 01:10:04.500
And let's be clear.
This is a temptation

1130
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.033
<v 1>today.</v>

1131
01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:10.580
<v 0>We want to compare this with</v>

1132
01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:17.750
the value of the reward

1133
01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:22.490
<v 1>minus the value of</v>

1134
01:10:24.590 --> 01:10:25.550
the punishments.

1135
01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:30.720
<v 0>But the key part observation is that these occur</v>

1136
01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:34.600
<v 1>tomorrow.
Here's a cat tomorrow.</v>

1137
01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.830
<v 0>All right?
So since they occurred,</v>

1138
01:10:37.831 --> 01:10:42.630
tomorrow we have to weight them a little bit lower.
All right?

1139
01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.640
So in general,
in general,

1140
01:10:44.641 --> 01:10:47.220
the way which we're going to weight them tomorrow is we're going to discount

1141
01:10:47.221 --> 01:10:49.410
them just like we did in our bargaining game.

1142
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:54.420
We're going to wait tomorrow's payments by Delta.

1143
01:10:59.190 --> 01:11:00.023
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1144
01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.920
<v 0>Where Dell says less than one.
All right.
Now.
Why am,</v>

1145
01:11:04.490 --> 01:11:09.050
why is Delta less one?
Why?
Why are we waiting tomorrow less than payments today?

1146
01:11:09.051 --> 01:11:12.830
Why?
Why a payments tomorrow worth less than payments today?

1147
01:11:15.930 --> 01:11:19.080
Because tomorrow might not happen.
All right?
There are other reasons why.

1148
01:11:19.081 --> 01:11:19.441
By the way,

1149
01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:22.260
it might be just wearing patient to get the money today and we can just wonder

1150
01:11:22.261 --> 01:11:23.130
the pay off in a hurry.

1151
01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:27.000
Or it might be that she wanted to take the payment today and put it in the bank

1152
01:11:27.001 --> 01:11:27.840
and earn interest.

1153
01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:30.750
And are there other reasons why money today you might be more valuable than

1154
01:11:30.751 --> 01:11:32.300
money tomorrow.
But in gay,

1155
01:11:32.301 --> 01:11:36.960
you miss the most important reason is tomorrow may not happen right tomorrow.

1156
01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:40.410
By tomorrow you might be dead or if not dead,
at least Jake's thrown out,

1157
01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:44.460
thrown two heads in the coins.
Alright,
so delta has on one

1158
01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:51.420
because the game may end

1159
01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:57.840
cause the gay man now watch the value of the reward.

1160
01:11:58.140 --> 01:12:01.200
The value of the reward is going to be the value.

1161
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:04.230
<v 1>Oh,
see</v>

1162
01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:09.450
<v 0>forever.
But I want to be calf up forever.
It's see forever.</v>

1163
01:12:09.451 --> 01:12:12.240
But of course it isn't really forever cause the game my end.
All right,

1164
01:12:12.241 --> 01:12:16.080
so why by forever,
I mean until the game ends and maybe a bit more careful.

1165
01:12:16.081 --> 01:12:20.310
Actually the CC,
isn't it?
The value of CC cooperate,

1166
01:12:20.311 --> 01:12:21.600
cooperate forever.

1167
01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:26.340
And here we're going to have the value of

1168
01:12:27.190 --> 01:12:31.600
<v 1>Dee Dee
forever.</v>

1169
01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:36.760
<v 0>I once again,
since it's the forever here means until the game ends.</v>

1170
01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:41.190
All right,
so this is the calculation we're going to have to do.

1171
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:46.560
We're going to have to compare the temptation.
That was easy.

1172
01:12:46.561 --> 01:12:51.561
That was just one with the discounted value difference between the value of

1173
01:12:51.691 --> 01:12:55.860
cooperation and the value of defecting.
Alright,

1174
01:12:56.160 --> 01:13:00.090
let's do the easy bits now and then we'll leave you in suspense until Wednesday.

1175
01:13:00.091 --> 01:13:03.720
Let's do all the easy base.
All right,
so watch this delta.

1176
01:13:03.721 --> 01:13:05.370
In this case and this particular gay men,

1177
01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:08.640
what was the probability that the game was going to continue

1178
01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:13.170
with the public of the game was [inaudible] wasn't one of the properties of the

1179
01:13:13.171 --> 01:13:14.004
game was going to end.

1180
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:21.500
Poverty ending was 0.25 so delta here was 0.75 that's easy.

1181
01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:26.520
All right.
Yeah,
a second bit.
That's relatively easy

1182
01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:32.930
is what's the value of playing dd until the game ends.

1183
01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.140
Once people have cheated,
you're going to pay d forever.
Hey,

1184
01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:42.380
we are Edwina's chasing here.
You're going to get Dee Dee in this period,

1185
01:13:42.381 --> 01:13:44.900
dd or this part and so on and so forth.
Until the game ends.

1186
01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:50.000
In each of those periods,
you're going to earn zero.
So this is just a Xero,

1187
01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:54.550
which leaves us with a messy beds.

1188
01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:01.030
Watch the value of cooperating forever.

1189
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:07.180
Let's try and do it one.
We got one minute,
let's do it.

1190
01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.760
So in every period of which we both cooperate,

1191
01:14:09.910 --> 01:14:12.430
what do we earn during the next period?
We're going to it next.

1192
01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:17.740
We're at the beginning of the game,
right?
We cooperated in the first parade.

1193
01:14:17.741 --> 01:14:19.420
On the second period,
we cooperate again.

1194
01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:24.460
What payoff do we get from cooperating again?
We get to right,
we get to,

1195
01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:30.430
and then Jake tosses this coin and with probability Delta,
we continue.

1196
01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:34.030
All right,
and we're going to cooperate again.

1197
01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:39.310
So we've probably Delsa we cooperate again and get what?
Pay off the next period

1198
01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:45.760
two again.
And then Jake tosses the coin again.
All right,

1199
01:14:45.761 --> 01:14:49.300
so now he's just the coin twice.
So it was probably Delta squared.

1200
01:14:49.301 --> 01:14:51.010
We're still playing and we get to,

1201
01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:56.560
and then Jake [inaudible] the client again and see if it comes up other than

1202
01:14:56.561 --> 01:15:00.960
hate head again.
And that's the,
the Delta cubed we get to and so on.

1203
01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:05.140
All right,
so your exercise between now and Wednesday,

1204
01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:09.190
it's figuring out what the value of cooperation forever is.

1205
01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.430
Figure out this equation and find what value fund,

1206
01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:17.000
whether in fact you're more than equilibrium for people to go,
oh,

1207
01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:17.950
pick it up on Wednesday.
