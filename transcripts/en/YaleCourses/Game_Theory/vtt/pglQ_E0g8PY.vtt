1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.560
So last time we left things in the middle of a model,

2
00:00:04.561 --> 00:00:06.180
which was the candidate vote in model.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.390
And what was I going to go with the whole model again,

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.790
but just to iterate a little bit,
uh,
what was different,

5
00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:15.150
what was different about that model from what we saw before?

6
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:19.680
And the main thing that was different was that the candidates can not choose

7
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:23.100
their positions if you're like every voter is a potential candidate,

8
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:25.680
but you know the positions of the voters.

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.000
And let me just bring out two lessons that we left hanging last time.

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.250
I would just put them on the board to make sure they're in your notes.

11
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.200
So the first lesson is,

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.500
one thing we saw already last time is there can be lots of different national

13
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:39.901
whatever.

14
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:43.410
In this model there are multiple possible nationally good Deborah and his model.

15
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.120
And more to the point,

16
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.980
not all of those equilibria have the candidates crowded at the center.

17
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.060
All right?

18
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.440
We saw early on and the classic downs or median voter model that that model

19
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:58.710
predicted crowding the center.
This one doesn't.

20
00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:59.970
And we'll come back to that in a second.

21
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.800
And a second thing we saw last time was that entry can,

22
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.930
if you enter on the left,

23
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.940
one affects of entering on the left can be to make the candidate on the rights

24
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.950
more likely to win.
And conversely,

25
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:17.850
if you enter on the rights you're right wing voter candidates and you enter that

26
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:19.740
can make it more likely that the left wins,
we can,

27
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:22.050
it can lead to the winner being more,

28
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.960
being further away from your ideal position.

29
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.160
And just to revisit this a little bit,
let me go back and,

30
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:32.070
and just illustrate what those two points again.
So I'll take a row further back.

31
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:35.580
This time
I'm getting nice full row.

32
00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:39.180
We can see the whole of this way.
I think a road further back.

33
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.590
So this time we have no confusion about what left wing and right wing is all

34
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:46.380
right.
At least almost no confusion.
So,
so let me choose this row.
Okay,
this,
this,

35
00:01:46.381 --> 00:01:49.170
this railroad.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
The people in the Balkan,

36
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:51.240
they going to have to imagine that it's a penalty being in the balcony.

37
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.410
All right,
so this row.
All right.
And here's my left wing.

38
00:01:55.411 --> 00:01:58.140
Of this row for everyone who's in front of it is almost everybody.

39
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.850
And here's my right wing.
Okay.
All right.

40
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.340
And let's try to illustrate some equilibrium we saw last time.
So in particular,

41
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.840
if I can get the guy in the Blue Yale shirts to stand up a second and the guy

42
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.650
with his computer to set up a second.
Sorry.
All right.

43
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.890
And let's assume all the seats are Phil Phil's for now.
So,
uh,
so know,

44
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.350
just to help me out a little bit since I'm doing this on the fly,

45
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.140
this I'm going to claim is an equilibrium.

46
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.440
Notice that there are two candidates standing and those is that they are not

47
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:28.860
particularly close to the center.

48
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.450
We have our sort of sort of a middle of the Democratic Party left candidates.
So,

49
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:36.210
uh,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm tempted to give it an a get to give you a name,

50
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.580
but perhaps there was not.
And his,
uh,

51
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.910
middle of the middle of the Republican party candidates.
All right.
And this is,

52
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.730
this is the election.
They're going to split the votes equally if I'd,

53
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.260
if I'd actually chosen correctly.
All right.
Just just observe some things here.

54
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.000
First for this to be an equilibrium,

55
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.600
it better be the case that they're symmetric on left and right.
Right.

56
00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:58.080
If they're not symmetric,
then uh,
it isn't even any good.

57
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.300
It isn't an equilibrium because one of those candidates is going to lose for

58
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:03.940
sure.
And the way we set up,
the way we set up the model,

59
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.940
that means that one of them will drop out.
They'll deviate to drop out.

60
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.930
Is that correct?
All right.
This also illustrate this.

61
00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.940
We've already illustrated that they're not particularly close to the center.

62
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.350
Let's illustrate what I meant by somebody on the left causing the right ring to

63
00:03:17.351 --> 00:03:18.310
win.
So if this was the,

64
00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.220
if this was the election and who we are getting closer and closer to the

65
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:24.310
election and suddenly one of our left wing guys,

66
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.730
so a dentist percentage or something,
you know,
decides to end test.

67
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.610
So that's what it's supposed to.
This is Dennis percentage.
I mean he enters,

68
00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.300
alright,
if Dennis Dennis Kucinich are left wing guy enters,

69
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.870
there might be some sort of moral victory and entering,

70
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.540
but the results of this will be that our right wing candidate wins.

71
00:03:40.541 --> 00:03:44.430
They want to see is that if these three guys are standing,
Dennis,
I,

72
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.790
she's going to steal some votes from our center left candidate and cause our

73
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:52.050
center right candidate to win.
Now,
that may or may or may not be,
uh,

74
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.380
Mr [inaudible] intention,
but we should be aware of it.
All right?
All right.

75
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.570
So this is these,
this is a real effects.

76
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.370
Go back to the 2000 election and think about what happens when Nita entered and

77
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.130
do the math as it were.
All right?
Which people didn't do at the time,
harmony.

78
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.880
All right?
And if you,
if you were listening to the newspapers,

79
00:04:09.881 --> 00:04:12.820
we could read the New York Times this morning or this to the radio this morning.

80
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.360
You'll find exactly the same debate is going on now in the Republican Party.

81
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.340
Some men actually tell it around.
It's the right wing.
This time I switch.

82
00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:22.390
We just switching around.
Uh,
so,
uh,
the right way,

83
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.530
some people on the right of the Republican Party are saying that if it turns out

84
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.010
that Giuliani who currently is leading in the polls wins the Republican

85
00:04:30.011 --> 00:04:32.620
nomination,
they will run a third party candidate.

86
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.260
And of course the debate is exactly in these terms if they run a,
a right wing,

87
00:04:36.261 --> 00:04:40.580
third party candidate.
So that would be our guy over here.
All right.
Uh,

88
00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.150
this might be,
uh,
you know,
it might,

89
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.340
it might have pay off in terms of other things,
but in terms of the election,

90
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.940
it's going to result in a Hillary winning.
All right.
All right.

91
00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.680
All right.
Thank you.
Okay,
so we've seen these two effects.

92
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:56.560
They're very real effects when not necessarily getting people crowding the

93
00:04:56.561 --> 00:05:01.150
center and we have to worry about when we enter causing the other wing to win.

94
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.940
All right.
This is,
this isn't a,

95
00:05:02.941 --> 00:05:05.080
I'm not making a left wing right wing politics arguments here.

96
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.380
This is true for both wings symmetrically.
All right.
So,
uh,

97
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.360
let's try and bring one more idea in here,
which is where we ended up last time,

98
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.480
which is just how far away from the center can we be?

99
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.830
So these guys sit down in a second and let's stand up.
Mr [inaudible] again,

100
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.690
and I know it isn't a real name,
but have a mind.

101
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.630
Mr [inaudible] out here on the left and uh,

102
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.190
Mr Crazy right wing guy whose name I've,
uh,

103
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.040
who's the most crazy right wing guy of these candidates.

104
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:31.860
I'm not gonna I'll get in trouble wherever I name.

105
00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:34.810
So whoever the most crazy right wing candidate is,
you can think of.
All right.

106
00:05:34.811 --> 00:05:37.630
And then we have the full spectrum represented with the,

107
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.510
just the extremes standing right here.

108
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:43.510
We have this symmetric metric around the center,
right?

109
00:05:43.511 --> 00:05:46.540
But I claim this is not an equilibrium.
So if people on the balcony,

110
00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.480
I've got the extreme right and extreme left standing here.

111
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.740
Why is this not an equilibrium?
Yeah,
I just actually I should,
it's my fault.

112
00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:58.700
I should put in the way.
Can I have the mic and I,
sorry,
my fault.
Thanks.

113
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.460
This one.
So Katie,
why is that not an equilibrium?

114
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.430
Because the person in the center could stand up and when exactly.

115
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:07.340
Cause the person in the syndicates up when actually it doesn't only have to be

116
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:10.940
the person exactly in the center,
uh,
a wide variety,

117
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.940
a wide array of center candidates could deviate.
And when at this point,

118
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.500
all right,
so this was the,
this was the,
uh,

119
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.820
two candidate standing and you mentioned a third candidate standing who for

120
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:24.230
example,
is this gentleman.
All right?
If he was to stand,
uh,
uh,

121
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.500
well how you need to be looked at close and center,
let's say,
let's say this guy,

122
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:30.980
the guy in gray,
all,
alright.
Fairly clearly.
He's going to end up,

123
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.360
he's going to end up winning.
All right?
All right,
so this is the third lesson.

124
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:39.680
If the candidates are too far apart,
we're going to see some center entry,

125
00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.560
which is going to win.
Thank you.
Thank you guys.
All right.
All right.
So,

126
00:06:42.561 --> 00:06:47.561
even though there isn't this full downs in effects of pushing candidates towards

127
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:50.480
the center,
even though we don't have the median voter theorem here,

128
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.240
we still have part of the intuition surviving.

129
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.350
The part of the intuition that survives is if the candidates are too far apart,

130
00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.420
then the center will enter and win.

131
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.950
So there is something pulling people to the center stone.
Thank you.

132
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.080
Ah,
AH,
not much.
I can't,
sorry,
someone to ask you how you move the podium.

133
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:12.790
I can do so a little bit.
Not much.
And retry that matter.

134
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.553
All right,

135
00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:19.630
so a reasonable question here is just how far apart in equilibrium can the

136
00:07:20.421 --> 00:07:20.991
candidates be?

137
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:23.870
We've established that we can have two candidates and they need and both be at

138
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:27.540
the center.
We've established that they can't be at the extremes.
Alright,

139
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:32.000
how far apart can they be?
How far apart can they be?
Well,
this is really just a,

140
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:33.950
it's,
it's kind of a nerdy question to get it precisely,

141
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:37.340
but let's get it precise nevertheless.
All right,
so let's have a look.

142
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.520
<v 1>Excuse the other board.</v>

143
00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.980
<v 0>So here's the full extent of our political spectrum from zero to one.</v>

144
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.010
And let me just try and illustrate how far apart these can be.

145
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.710
I'm going to do is I'm going to divide this into sixth one sixth,

146
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:07.090
two,
six and a half,
four,
six,

147
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.970
five,
six.
All right,

148
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.030
so I claim and I'll show afterwards.

149
00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:18.060
I'll claim that provided the two candidates aren't outside of a sick and five,

150
00:08:19.721 --> 00:08:22.690
six that that will be an equilibrium.
All right?

151
00:08:22.691 --> 00:08:26.890
So in particular if the candidates and just inside I'll put them just there in a

152
00:08:26.891 --> 00:08:30.460
sec and just inside fires it.

153
00:08:30.461 --> 00:08:33.700
So just more than a sticks and just less than five,
six,
right?

154
00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:35.410
So here's one of these candidates in standing

155
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:37.870
<v 1>and he was the other one.</v>

156
00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.690
<v 0>Moby.
Okay.
Now why?
Why is that?
Why is that the right answer?</v>

157
00:08:44.691 --> 00:08:47.660
And you want 101 w word try.
I guess.

158
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.350
Here's the question I sent you over the weekend and I'm sure you were doing

159
00:08:50.351 --> 00:08:54.160
other things over the weekend,
but nevertheless,
why is this the answer?

160
00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:57.680
Well,
let's see.
Let's see.
What's,
what are they vulnerable?

161
00:08:58.150 --> 00:09:02.210
They're vulnerable to deviation by somebody entering at the center.

162
00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.180
And if somebody enters at the center,
what's what,

163
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.790
what would make somebody entered the center if they're going to enter the
center,

164
00:09:07.791 --> 00:09:12.260
if they can win,
basically.
All right,
so if they entered the center,
in this case,

165
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.470
let's see how many votes everyone gets to be to talk to Sanjay here.

166
00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:19.430
Here's our new canvas.
Who's thinking about entering the center?

167
00:09:19.431 --> 00:09:22.740
So he's sort of thinking about it,
right?
Right.
So what's,

168
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.620
what's his or her calculation going to be?
Well,
let's,
let's,

169
00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:30.080
let's look what would have happened.
So all of these voters,

170
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:36.200
I'm going to vote for this cat for the are left wing candidate.

171
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:40.530
So these are going to vote for the left wing candidate.
All of these voters,

172
00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.870
oh,
going to vote for the right wing candidate,
right?

173
00:09:45.871 --> 00:09:49.170
They're all closest to the right wing candidate and the middle third,

174
00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:53.130
that's a third of the voters,
another third and the middle third.
These ones here,

175
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.090
these ones here are going to vote for the center candidate,
is that right?

176
00:09:57.091 --> 00:09:59.540
So I basically divided into six.

177
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.100
I don't want to put everybody at the middle of a third.
All right,

178
00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:06.110
so here the left wing candidate is,
is it the middle of the left third?

179
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.640
The right wing candidate is the middle of the right third.

180
00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.170
How the center candidate is at the middle of the center.
Third,
I'll surprise.

181
00:10:11.171 --> 00:10:14.610
Surprising.
Wait,
all right.
If he,
if they sent a candidate enters,

182
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:18.000
if they were exactly at a sick and five,
six,

183
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.160
they would split the vote and the center candidate would win with problems.

184
00:10:21.161 --> 00:10:23.750
The one third is that right?
Alright,

185
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:28.200
but warm without worrying about that exact case.
Suppose that,
that,
that this,

186
00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.370
as I as I claimed that the left wing candidate is just slightly to the right of

187
00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:36.300
a steak and the right one candidate is just slightly to the left of five,
six.

188
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.430
Now this left wing candidate gets a few extra votes here and the right wing

189
00:10:41.431 --> 00:10:43.950
candidate gets a few extra votes.
Yeah,

190
00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.120
but harder.
And you can see now that the left,

191
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.750
the center candidate isn't going to win.
Is that right?

192
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:54.330
Cause the left wing candidates getting slightly more than a third of the votes.

193
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.150
The right wing candidates going to get slightly more than a third of the votes.

194
00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.630
So the right,
so the center candidate is going to get squeezed out.
All right,

195
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.630
so just a little bit of thinking about it.
We can tell that that the,
in this,

196
00:11:03.631 --> 00:11:06.360
in this very simple model,
the furthest apart,

197
00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.680
the left and right wing candidates can be,
is at a stick and five,
six,

198
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.950
they can't go to the extremes but then not pulled all the way to the center.

199
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:16.260
All right,
so that's just,

200
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.130
that's just a little bit nerdy math to confirm it or no,

201
00:11:19.131 --> 00:11:22.980
do you thinking about it,
but coming back to our lessons,

202
00:11:22.981 --> 00:11:26.610
but I guess what we care about come out to our lessons.

203
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:31.790
The third lesson here is if the candidates,

204
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:34.650
if,
if the two candidates

205
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.353
<v 1>kindness</v>

206
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.950
<v 0>are too extreme,</v>

207
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.580
where Chuck's room in this model made beyond less than a second and more than

208
00:11:43.581 --> 00:11:45.740
five or six,
but a too extreme.

209
00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:48.213
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

210
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.690
<v 0>Someone in the center,</v>

211
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.003
<v 1>we'll enzyme.</v>

212
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:59.860
<v 0>I think,
again,
if you look back in both American history and,
uh,</v>

213
00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:00.910
all the country's history,

214
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.630
you'll see that when candidates up perceived to be too far apart,

215
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.800
there's been tremendous temptation for center parties with third parties to

216
00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:13.030
establish themselves in the center.
So again,
uh,
with some bias towards England,

217
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:17.380
uh,
this is what happens,
uh,
in English history during the Thatcher period,

218
00:12:17.381 --> 00:12:20.290
for example,
the Thatcher government was perceived to be quite far on the right.

219
00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.340
The Labor Party at the time was cause we've quite far on the left and we sort of

220
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:27.940
center party set up in between them.
Right.
Okay.

221
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.800
So these seem to be the three main politics lessons of this model.
Right?

222
00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:33.750
You don't want everyone happy with that.

223
00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.070
I'm rushing it slightly because we've said that very last time.

224
00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.560
They weren't happy with how it works.
Okay.

225
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:42.760
There's also a game through lesson that I want to just keep in mind here
without,

226
00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:43.594
well

227
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:44.743
<v 1>you said</v>

228
00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.330
<v 0>there's a game theory lesson here</v>

229
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:55.000
and the game theory lesson is that our method of finding equilibrium in this

230
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:59.080
model,
which was what it was guessing check is actually pretty effective.

231
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:06.220
You might think that gas in shacks and so it doesn't sound like advanced

232
00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:09.760
mathematics wouldn't be at such a great way of going about solving games and

233
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:13.090
thinking about them and thinking about real world,
but actually guessing.

234
00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:16.990
Check did pretty well here.
We were able to make sensible guesses pretty quickly.

235
00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:20.650
We were pretty quickly able to figure out what was going on and the key here,

236
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.500
the key here is what now without writing in a surly,

237
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.170
the key here is be systematic.
When you're guessing,

238
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.960
make sure you've looked everywhere and second,

239
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.210
be systematically careful when you're checking.

240
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:34.350
The big error is to ignore it,

241
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.420
is to ignore certain types of deviation and this particular model,

242
00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:41.200
people very quickly realized that one possible deviation is for someone else to

243
00:13:41.201 --> 00:13:44.650
enter,
but perhaps they're a little bit less good at spotting that.

244
00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:48.530
Another possible title deviation is for somebody to drop out,
right?

245
00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.390
You want to look at all possible types of deviation,
but bread,
you're careful.

246
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.980
This is a very effective method.

247
00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:02.510
All right.
So that's all I want to say about this politics model.

248
00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:07.000
And I want to move on to a model that perhaps has more to do with sociology's.

249
00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:10.250
We did a little tour of the social sciences here and showing how game theory can

250
00:14:10.251 --> 00:14:15.230
apply to each intern.
All right,
so to do that,
I'm going to,
I'll put this up

251
00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.080
<v 1>so you can still read it and work on this program.</v>

252
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.680
<v 0>So we're going to play another game this morning and it's going to completely</v>

253
00:14:26.681 --> 00:14:28.900
different from the Games we've played so far,

254
00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:30.190
but it's still going to have lessons.

255
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:35.750
It's going to be a normal location model.

256
00:14:35.751 --> 00:14:37.460
So that's the connection to what we've done before.

257
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.660
But the idea of this game is as follows.

258
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:45.380
We're going to imagine that there are two towns,

259
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.260
two possible locations,

260
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:52.400
and we'll call them east town and West town.

261
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:57.590
And we're going to assume that there are two types of people in the world.

262
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:02.030
So there's two types of people

263
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:10.340
and these types of people are tall and short.

264
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:14.990
All right?
And uh,
by deliberately,
this is arbitrary,
right?

265
00:15:14.991 --> 00:15:18.290
Eastern Western kind of meaningless,
uh,
almost meaningless.

266
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.470
The Mantel Shelf at the towns,

267
00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.550
I guess it says something about where they are and tall and short is we're

268
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:23.211
pretty meaningless.

269
00:15:23.211 --> 00:15:26.410
The main pusher for the people that it as it said something about how tall,
loud.

270
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.250
All right.
The idea here is the people are going to choose where they live.

271
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.400
Let's assume that there's a,
you know lots of people.

272
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:39.401
There's 100,000 of each type of person and let's assume that each town holds

273
00:15:41.811 --> 00:15:42.710
100,000 people.

274
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:49.290
He's a fairly big towns.
All right?

275
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.090
So the players in this game are going to be the people,

276
00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:58.620
the 200,000 people,
200,000 talk tall people and 200,000 short people.

277
00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.860
But in a minute I'm going to tell you whether you're tall or short.
All right?

278
00:16:01.861 --> 00:16:05.850
So actually you're going to be the players in this game and the strategies are

279
00:16:05.851 --> 00:16:10.800
going to be a choice of whether you choose east or west.
All right?

280
00:16:10.801 --> 00:16:12.060
So these are the players

281
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:19.680
and these are going to end up being the strategies each of is going to choose,

282
00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.950
do I want to live in the east town or do I want to live in West town?

283
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.780
So as usual,
what's missing is the payoffs.
All right?

284
00:16:27.781 --> 00:16:29.880
And to model the payoffs,
let me first of all,

285
00:16:29.881 --> 00:16:33.420
draw a picture and then come back and explain it.
Okay?

286
00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.750
So the picture is going to look like this.
Here's the payoff picture,

287
00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:42.510
and it's a little complicated.
It's just,
just bear with me for a second.

288
00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.700
So on the horizontal access,
uh,

289
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:50.840
I'm going to put the number of people of your type in the town you end up in.

290
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:53.131
All right?

291
00:16:53.131 --> 00:16:57.960
So the horizontal axis is the number of your tape

292
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.370
in your town.

293
00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.510
So the most of could possibly be is 100,000,
right?

294
00:17:09.511 --> 00:17:14.511
Because everybody has the same type as you and the town and the lowest it could

295
00:17:14.761 --> 00:17:18.320
possibly be,
possibly be zero,
because that would,

296
00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:23.040
that would say that everyone in the town,
except for you,
is of the other type.

297
00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:24.533
Is that right?

298
00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:29.630
And I'm going to draw this a payoff function.
This is just me.

299
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.930
Your pay off.
This is going to be the Tennessee or pay off

300
00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:40.580
of you.
All right?
Let's just do this is type X.
Okay.
It doesn't make me mad.

301
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.600
I don't know if this [inaudible] as soon as he's the tall type pay off,

302
00:17:43.601 --> 00:17:47.130
but to me it's gonna be some metric for the other type as well.
All right,

303
00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.880
so the payoff is gonna look like this bit careful.

304
00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.730
Let me draw it and that.
Explain it.

305
00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:00.683
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

306
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.310
<v 0>All right.
That goes like this and then like this.</v>

307
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.410
All right,
so the idea here,
the idea is more important than the picture.

308
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:17.800
The idea is if you are a minority of one in your town to everyone else is of the

309
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:22.460
other type,
you get a payoff of zero.

310
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:24.960
<v 1>All right?</v>

311
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:26.870
<v 0>If you are in the majority,</v>

312
00:18:26.871 --> 00:18:30.860
and in fact everyone in your town is offer the same type,

313
00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.200
then you're going to pay off of a half.

314
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.610
And if it's the case that everyone in your town,
sorry if,
if,

315
00:18:40.611 --> 00:18:43.700
if,
if it's the case that your town is exactly mixed.

316
00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:47.110
So half of your town is uh,
uh,

317
00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:50.480
are tall and half of your town or short.

318
00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.310
Then you get a payoff of one.

319
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.890
And I put a half fare that really the wrong thing to put here,

320
00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:58.910
there should be a half of a hundred thousand.
So I guess it's 50,
it's 50,000,

321
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:00.900
right?

322
00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.180
So just the case that 50,000 people in the town or your tape and 50,000 or the

323
00:19:05.181 --> 00:19:09.290
other side,
then you get the highest possible pay off,
which is one.

324
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:14.270
So this is what we're going to assume that each and every one of you has this

325
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.920
payoff.
That makes sense.
That makes sense.
All right,

326
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:22.100
so these are people,
it's a,
can I get the idea across in words?

327
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:26.120
These are people who would like to live in mixed towns,

328
00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:30.350
but if they go into live in a town that's not mixed,

329
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:35.300
they'd rather live in a town in which that the majority.
That makes sense.

330
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.320
All right.
I'd like to live and mixed towns,

331
00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.830
but it's a town is not making a choice between two towns.

332
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.790
The towns are not evenly mixed,
then they prefer to be in the majority.

333
00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.970
So they to put the town in which that the majority.
All right,

334
00:19:48.971 --> 00:19:50.170
everyone understand this,
right?

335
00:19:50.171 --> 00:19:52.390
It's important since we're about to play this game,
it's important.

336
00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:56.710
You're all kind of on board here.
Alright?
So to play this game,

337
00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:02.230
I need to put on a few more rules.
All right?
So the first rule is going to be

338
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:03.773
<v 1>okay,</v>

339
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.850
<v 0>but the choice is simultaneous.</v>

340
00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:11.990
And that's a little unrealistic because in practice,
of course,

341
00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.390
people choose that towns sequentially when they,

342
00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.190
whenever they happened to be moving.
But for the moment,

343
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:18.920
let's leave it as the hap.
And second,

344
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:23.390
I need to just say what happens if too many people choose the same town.

345
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.900
So,
uh,
if there's no room,

346
00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.890
if there's no room in a town,
for example,
if,
if,
uh,
uh,

347
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:37.870
if too many people chose east of town,
then we allocate the surplus randomly.
We,

348
00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:42.150
we,
we,
we,
we at the places,
uh,
randomly.
All right?

349
00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.550
So then we,
uh,
then

350
00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.130
randomize,
uh,
to ration.
People understand that.
So,

351
00:20:51.131 --> 00:20:54.940
for example,
there's a hundred,
there's 100,000 places in east town.

352
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.660
So if 150,000 people chose East town,

353
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.330
you're going to have a two thirds chance of getting into east town and the rest

354
00:21:01.331 --> 00:21:05.410
of it's gonna be allocated to Western.
All right,
that makes sense.
Actually,

355
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.250
I just need something to make things add up.
Okay.

356
00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:11.470
Okay.
So to do this,

357
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:16.530
I first of all need to decide who in the clause is tall and who in the class is

358
00:21:16.781 --> 00:21:20.860
short.
I'm going to grab that mic again.
All right,

359
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.510
so let me just count backwards.
I guess we'll ignore this row.
So one,
two,

360
00:21:25.511 --> 00:21:29.770
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,

361
00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:35.000
possibly eight,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight.
Well maybe this.
Okay,
so,

362
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.550
so up to here,
this row and forwards,
you are short people.

363
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.550
You understand that everyone,
everyone forward of where I am now,

364
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:46.000
Rahul included is short.
Okay.

365
00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.710
And the rest of you guys and the guys in the balcony to come see me anymore.

366
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.890
The guy isn't the balcony.
You are tall.
All right.
Short,

367
00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:59.680
tall.
Okay.
Okay.
So how many rows of these you have?
One,
two,

368
00:21:59.681 --> 00:22:04.420
three,
four,
five,
seven,
seven rows here,
right?
The right,
uh,
one,

369
00:22:04.421 --> 00:22:08.560
two,
three,
four,
five,
six.
We have seven rows of short people.

370
00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.960
Okay.
All right.
And the rest of you are a tall mean.

371
00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.940
I'm going to hope I split that evenly.
Okay.

372
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.100
And I'm going to cheat a little bit in the minutes.

373
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.680
You're going to have to choose which town you're going to live in.

374
00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.400
And we'll do it by showing it by show of hands.
All right?
But before we do that,

375
00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.580
I'm going to cheat a little bit by giving each of you an initial position.

376
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:31.150
This is irrelevant,
but I just wanted to just want to sort of set things up.

377
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:35.770
So what we'll do is we'll put,
we'll put,

378
00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:40.840
uh,
this row to this row.
One,
two,
three,
four.

379
00:22:40.841 --> 00:22:44.950
These rows,
your initial position isn't east town.
It doesn't matter.
You can move.

380
00:22:44.951 --> 00:22:48.580
But your initial positions in east town,
so east,
east,
east,
east,

381
00:22:48.581 --> 00:22:52.990
ever understand that yeast.
And these are heroes.
This row,
this row,

382
00:22:52.991 --> 00:22:56.290
and this row,
you're in West town.
All right.

383
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.690
And these next four.
Oh,
so you guys,
you guys,
you guys,

384
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.950
and you guys do it again.
This row,
this row,
this row,
and this row,

385
00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.600
you're an east town and I notice I have this one and you're,

386
00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:10.840
you're an east town as well.
Okay.

387
00:23:10.841 --> 00:23:14.740
The up to his east town and the rest of you is in West town.
Okay.

388
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:17.980
Everyone understand where they are.
Now let's do a test with the,

389
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:22.540
with the camera watching.
So if you are currently in east town,

390
00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:27.460
raise your hands and if you're currently in west town,
raise your hands.

391
00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.280
All right,
so I've,
I've set you up with a stripey pacman.

392
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:35.440
See over the stripey patent and notice that I've set things up so that slightly

393
00:23:35.441 --> 00:23:39.730
more of the short people were in east town,

394
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:45.260
right?
And slightly more of the,
uh,
of the,
uh,

395
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:50.110
tall people.
I did that right?
I did that right.
We're in West town.
All right.
If,

396
00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.980
if,
if I did that correctly,
I'm not sure I did actually.

397
00:23:51.981 --> 00:23:52.970
But if I did that correctly,

398
00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:57.770
slightly more of my short people started life in east town and slightly more of

399
00:23:57.771 --> 00:24:02.750
my tall people started life in West town.
Okay,

400
00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:07.400
so now think about it.
A seconds.
Remember,
these are your payoffs,
right?

401
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:10.280
That's a suspension of disbelief.
These your payoffs.

402
00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:15.820
And in the minutes I want all the people who are choosing a east town to raise

403
00:24:17.661 --> 00:24:20.960
their hands.
And then I'm going to do to count of three and don't cheat.

404
00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:23.090
Don't look around you and see what's going on.
All right?

405
00:24:23.091 --> 00:24:26.520
So really you all close your eyes.
All right,
everyone close.

406
00:24:26.521 --> 00:24:29.500
Their eyes are on the room.
Close their eyes,
right?
I could do anything.

407
00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.170
I'd be swimming naked.
All right.
All right,
so I will get your,
I suppose,

408
00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:36.200
and the count of three everyone is choosing east town should raise their hands.

409
00:24:36.201 --> 00:24:39.470
One,
two,
three.

410
00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:44.240
All right,
so this is my east town where people can open their eyes.

411
00:24:44.241 --> 00:24:46.550
Now look at the east town,
East town distribution.

412
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.330
So I've got this big block of East town here,
a little bit going on the wings,

413
00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.290
little bit of spillage here.
I said,
let's just make it,
let's just check it.
So,

414
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:56.600
so those of you who didn't raise your hands just now in West town.
So West town,

415
00:24:56.601 --> 00:25:00.350
people raise their hands.
All right.
I got a little bit of spillage here,

416
00:25:00.351 --> 00:25:03.170
but basically I've got west town over here,
right?
That's all right.

417
00:25:03.171 --> 00:25:06.050
Everyone understood what just happened?
Everyone saw it happens.
All right,

418
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.270
let's do it again.
That's not that.
That's,
that's where you are now.

419
00:25:08.271 --> 00:25:11.900
Let's see what happens next time.
So once again,
close your eyes.
All right,

420
00:25:11.901 --> 00:25:16.030
close your eyes.
Don't communicate.
All right.
Everybody's who's a,

421
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.370
who's going to choose east town?
Raise their hands now.

422
00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:25.550
All right,
so I've got pretty much all of these rows now,
or an east town.

423
00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:27.410
I got a little bit of spillage here,

424
00:25:27.411 --> 00:25:30.400
but basically I've got east town in the front.
I can onto the balcony.

425
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.590
What I've got in the balcony up there?
No hands up on the balcony.
That's typical.

426
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:37.820
All right.
So,
okay.
Okay.
All right.
They live in the balcony,
right.
So,
all right,

427
00:25:37.821 --> 00:25:40.880
so I bet I've more or less,
but eastern here.
Where's my West town?

428
00:25:40.881 --> 00:25:43.820
And raise your hands if in west town now and West town.

429
00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:46.250
A little bit of spillage here,
but basically about West town in the bank.

430
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.800
All right,
let's do it one more time.
One more time.

431
00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.430
I everyone understand where things were just now.
All right.
I May,

432
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.220
I'm leaving the hands up long enough.
Long enough.
Yeah.
Okay.

433
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:59.960
So let's try it again.
So East town we'll count of three.
One,
two,

434
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:03.520
three.
All right.
So here's my east town.
I'm more,

435
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:07.370
I'm pretty much any among the east town dwellers right now.
West town.

436
00:26:07.371 --> 00:26:09.110
Raise your hands.
One,
two,
three.

437
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:11.330
And I'm pretty much in the West town dwellers right now.

438
00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.370
And this is not a tall stripey.
All right.

439
00:26:13.371 --> 00:26:16.280
We start off with the stripey pattern and we ended up,

440
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:20.340
we ended up how we ended up with pretty much the whole front of the room

441
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:24.590
choosing East town and the whole back of the room,

442
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.340
maybe including the balcony.
Me Choosing West town,
the bulky,

443
00:26:28.341 --> 00:26:32.630
we're just flying over.
All right.
All right,
so everyone saw what happens.

444
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:36.710
All right.
Now can anyone what say what,
what's,
what's happened there?

445
00:26:36.711 --> 00:26:39.440
Why did we end up like that?
How do we end up like that?

446
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.740
We started off with a stripey pattern,
right?

447
00:26:42.741 --> 00:26:46.470
It was a little bit off from being kind of perfect because all of you by these

448
00:26:46.471 --> 00:26:51.300
preferences would prefer to be in a town that was exactly 50 50 wasn't quite 50

449
00:26:51.301 --> 00:26:53.910
50 but it wasn't far off actually.
All right,

450
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:57.420
and we pretty quickly ended up with all these short people.

451
00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:02.420
You guys are short all living in East town and all of Utah people living in West

452
00:27:02.461 --> 00:27:07.110
town.
It all of you pretty much ended up with a,
with a payoff of a half.

453
00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.450
Some of you didn't know were a few DVN.

454
00:27:08.451 --> 00:27:13.230
Two of my Devens who my guys who am I tall guys who ended up in east town.
Yeah,

455
00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.190
so these guys,
it's fine,
but they end up with a pair of close to zero.
Right,

456
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.740
right,
right.
And,
and,
and who am I short deviants who ended up in West town?

457
00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:22.880
It was a few,
not many of them.
It all works in a few of them,

458
00:27:22.881 --> 00:27:24.780
but then they end up with a pair of zero as well.
Right.

459
00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:28.200
But pretty much everyone else was ending up with a pay off close to a half,

460
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:32.940
close to a half,
and splitting down the middle of the room.
All right,
now,

461
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:37.080
now why?
What do we call that?
What do you call that process?

462
00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:43.650
What's the outcome here?
Yeah,
so this is to say it again.

463
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.080
So this is segregation,
right?

464
00:27:46.081 --> 00:27:50.790
We ended up getting the class to segregates on tall and short,

465
00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:56.360
right?
What is it?
The people,
it wasn't the people wanted desegregates right.

466
00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.160
Where I gave you,
I gave you a preference is,
and I told you,

467
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.660
and you have to have these preferences,

468
00:28:00.661 --> 00:28:04.020
which might actually will preferences that favored being in a mixed town.

469
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.480
But we very quickly settled down to a segregated,
uh,

470
00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:11.340
distribution of a class.
All right.
Why,

471
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:14.410
what led to that as just talk it through a bit.
Well,

472
00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.940
who has an opinion of what it was that kind of got us there?
Yes.
So Patrick,

473
00:28:17.941 --> 00:28:20.220
shout out for the part of it.
This doesn't,
this doesn't speak to the club.

474
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:22.360
<v 2>I mean I think what happened is basically,</v>

475
00:28:22.361 --> 00:28:25.880
because it was the first choice is simultaneous everyone,
the site lead,

476
00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:30.910
bad situation,
all change to what was perceived to be a better situation.

477
00:28:30.911 --> 00:28:34.540
So he sort of shot past that equilibrium where we were 50,
50.

478
00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:35.341
<v 0>Right,
right.</v>

479
00:28:35.341 --> 00:28:40.341
So I cheated a little bit by starting you off away from the 50 50 points and you

480
00:28:40.921 --> 00:28:44.620
kind of went further very,
very quickly.
Now I want to say that I think with,

481
00:28:44.621 --> 00:28:47.010
with a longer,
with a longer time period to play with,

482
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:51.780
I could have started you off,
uh,
just random,
right?
Let's choose whatever.

483
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:53.130
And if we played enough times,

484
00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:55.890
my guess is we'd have ended up saving gated anyway.

485
00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.160
It might not have been segregated with east here in west there.

486
00:28:59.161 --> 00:29:00.300
It might've been the other way round,

487
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:04.050
but I'm pretty sure we'd have ended up segregated anyway.
All right.

488
00:29:04.051 --> 00:29:06.060
I can't prove that because we wouldn't have enough time to do it.

489
00:29:06.061 --> 00:29:10.590
I cheated by pushing us that way.
All right.
So what happened was,
is this,

490
00:29:10.591 --> 00:29:15.450
right people who started off in the minority but not badly in the minority,

491
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.290
uh,
in,
uh,
who,
who are,
who are short guys in West town,

492
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:24.210
they moved to east town.
Right?
That was largely the rows here,
right?

493
00:29:24.211 --> 00:29:28.080
You guys moved to West town and guys who ended up who I started off in the

494
00:29:28.081 --> 00:29:31.320
minority,
I don't know.
I'm not even sure.
It was actually a minority,
uh,

495
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:35.220
who were tall guys and east town.
You guys drifted over at West town.

496
00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.750
Is that right?
Is that right?
Okay,
well talk about this more in a second,

497
00:29:39.751 --> 00:29:42.700
but let's just get some ideas down on,
on the board.
Well,

498
00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:46.780
I dunno actually that while I'm,
while I'm down here,
it's a little bit more work.

499
00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:51.460
All right,
so before we leave this,
I'm not,
I mean we leave talking about it.

500
00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:54.310
Let's figure out what are the equilibria hair.

501
00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.930
So what's an equilibrium of this game?
It's a pretty simple game.

502
00:29:58.931 --> 00:30:03.180
It has lots of people,
two choices per person.
We're going to be doing guessing,

503
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.120
check here,
right?

504
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:07.030
So what people think the equilibrates and we get someone who hasn't spoken the

505
00:30:07.031 --> 00:30:10.990
APP.
I surely can't have to cold call then it's an easy one.

506
00:30:10.991 --> 00:30:14.170
What's an equilibrium here?
Somebody wasn't equally.

507
00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:15.690
How about the gentleman here on it?

508
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.060
You would have ever guessed what an equilibrium is.
Everyone being segregated,

509
00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.430
everyone being segregated.
Let's be a bit more precise.

510
00:30:21.431 --> 00:30:24.490
So I claim there's two ways they can be segregated.
So,
so,
so,

511
00:30:24.491 --> 00:30:26.020
so spun out the two ways.

512
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.370
<v 3>If all of the top people are in West town and all the shore people are in east</v>

513
00:30:30.371 --> 00:30:33.830
town or if all the tall people are in the West town,

514
00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.360
<v 0>good,
good.
And your name is.</v>

515
00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:41.310
So Greg is saying there's two ways to be segregated and each of them seems like

516
00:30:41.311 --> 00:30:45.060
an equilibrium,
right?
Let's just spell it out to all the tall people.

517
00:30:45.061 --> 00:30:49.020
Being in the East is one equilibrium and all the poor people being on the west

518
00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:53.580
is the other equilibrium.
Both of those I claim or Greg claims,

519
00:30:53.581 --> 00:30:57.600
but more carefully,
great claims.
Both of those are Nash Equilibria.

520
00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:02.520
How do we check that they're nationally,
whatever they are,
you're right.

521
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.800
But how do we check that,
that the,
that they are in fact equilibrium.

522
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:10.880
We go about checking that they're equilibrate the guessing part is easy
checking,

523
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:14.250
whereas a bit of thought.
So what,
how do we check?
Uh,
yeah,
yeah,

524
00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:20.520
you check for profitable deviations.
So what's a,
what's a deviation here?
If,
if,

525
00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:20.910
if,

526
00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:25.910
if all the tall or short people are an east town and all the tall people in West

527
00:31:26.621 --> 00:31:29.300
town,
what's a deviation?
A deviation.

528
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:32.440
It's ignore the capacity constrained from an it,
uh,
a,

529
00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:36.540
a deviation is for what are the short guys to move to West town?

530
00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.080
That,
right?
So as the equilibrium,

531
00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.960
that short guy was getting a payoff of what,

532
00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.740
what was this pay off his or her pay off and equilibrium.
One half.

533
00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:50.250
If he or she deviates and moves to Westtown.
Again,

534
00:31:50.251 --> 00:31:52.650
ignoring the capacity constraints,
let's assume that they can,

535
00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:57.840
if that short person moves to West town,
watch their payoff going to be zero.

536
00:31:57.841 --> 00:32:00.330
So that's not a profitable deviation.
And conversely,

537
00:32:00.331 --> 00:32:02.400
if we do the same from the other side,
for the tall people,

538
00:32:02.401 --> 00:32:04.870
we'd find the same thing.
So we've just checked for that.

539
00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:09.120
Isn't equilibrium because nobody can deviate profitably.
All right,

540
00:32:09.121 --> 00:32:13.260
so we found to equilibrate here and if people have pointed out they are

541
00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:18.120
segregated.
Now I claim that there's another equilibrium here,

542
00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:21.400
which the other equilibrium here,
what's the other recruitment and I,

543
00:32:21.401 --> 00:32:23.950
I should get the Mike right the way on the other side.
So let me let,

544
00:32:23.951 --> 00:32:27.750
let me try and lean in here.
Lean my way.
Yeah,
can he can eat.
Thanks.
Thanks.

545
00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:38.060
Good.
Good.
So if the,
if the,
if the crowded split exactly.

546
00:32:38.061 --> 00:32:41.750
50 50 that would also be an equilibrium.
Right?

547
00:32:41.751 --> 00:32:45.680
But the key word there is what the keyword cause to the 50 50 is the key word.

548
00:32:45.810 --> 00:32:49.280
What's the other key word there?
Exacts.
All right.

549
00:32:49.281 --> 00:32:51.830
It really has to be exact for this to work.

550
00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:55.400
I know since I'm hand waving a bit because he Collibra always exact statements,

551
00:32:55.670 --> 00:33:00.200
but can people see what's going on here?
So people split exactly 50 50 wide,

552
00:33:00.201 --> 00:33:02.360
split the class down the middle.

553
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:05.690
I started off by saying it this way in to talk people and short people and I

554
00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.900
might split the town down the middle and eastern West,

555
00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:12.340
then everyone would've been happy and they'd have stayed put.
That's uh,

556
00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:16.160
this gentleman's playing and I think it's,
that's correct.
All right.
But what's,

557
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.410
what's,
um,
suspicious if you like,
what's,

558
00:33:18.411 --> 00:33:20.720
what's worrying about that equilibrium that isn't equilibrium?

559
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.500
What's worrying about that equilibrium,
that mixed equilibrium,

560
00:33:24.501 --> 00:33:27.980
that integrated equilibrium.
All right.
Can get role.
How can we get the guy here?

561
00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:30.290
<v 1>Okay.</v>

562
00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:32.920
<v 0>It's so weak nash equilibrium because while there's no,</v>

563
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.290
there's no real incentive for you to deviate.

564
00:33:36.291 --> 00:33:38.990
There's no incentive for you to not deviate either.
Good.
So,

565
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.450
so one thing that distinguishes,
thank you,
that's very good.

566
00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:45.710
So one thing that distinguishes that equilibrium from the equilibria that we

567
00:33:45.711 --> 00:33:48.670
were just looking at is it,
in some sense it's week,

568
00:33:48.671 --> 00:33:50.840
whereas the other ones are straight.
What do we mean by that?

569
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:55.130
If we deviate away from this thing?
Exactly.
Mixed equilibrium.

570
00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:58.130
Roughly speaking.
I'm [inaudible] a little bit of hand waving here,

571
00:33:58.131 --> 00:34:02.630
but roughly speaking,
we're exactly in different.
All right.
All right.
It's true.

572
00:34:02.631 --> 00:34:06.020
It's true.
It's not strictly true because I guess by ourselves moving,

573
00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.180
we're changing the balance a little bit,
but,
but nevertheless,

574
00:34:08.181 --> 00:34:11.240
we know that if I pay smooth out the top,
it will be exactly right.
Right?

575
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.880
So at the,
at that ad,
that's a mixed equilibrium,

576
00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.440
so I don't want to call it a mixed income.

577
00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.440
Had that integrated eat whatever that an equilibrium.

578
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:22.040
I'm exactly in different about where I live,
both towns and look the same to me.

579
00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:23.840
Right?
They call it east and west,

580
00:34:23.841 --> 00:34:27.350
but they have the same mixture of tall and short people in that.
All right.

581
00:34:27.351 --> 00:34:31.250
Where is it?
The segregated equilibria at the segregation equilibria?

582
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:36.080
I strictly prefer to go to the town in which I'm the majority.

583
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:41.060
I'm doing s having a strictly higher pay off half versus zero by being in the

584
00:34:41.061 --> 00:34:45.500
town in which I'm in the majority.
All right,
so there's this,

585
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:49.610
there's this notion of strictness.
There's also a notion of stability here.

586
00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.490
All right,
so I got,
I don't wanna be too formal here.

587
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:56.450
I want to give you in formal idea about why we might worry about stability.

588
00:34:56.690 --> 00:35:00.470
So what do we mean by stability here?
Why?
Why do I think that that,
that,

589
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.790
that integrated equilibrium in which we divide the town's equally might not be

590
00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:08.420
stable.
When we mean by that mean for the physicists in the room,

591
00:35:08.421 --> 00:35:11.060
it should be an easy idea.
But for everyone,
I think it's a fairly intuitive idea.

592
00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:13.370
Why has that not likely to be stable?

593
00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:16.753
<v 1>Anybody,</v>

594
00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:19.510
<v 0>what's her name,
Chris.</v>

595
00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.880
If even one person deviates and all of a sudden everyone will prefer to deviate

596
00:35:23.881 --> 00:35:26.220
to that completely segregated position.
Right?
Good.

597
00:35:26.221 --> 00:35:29.010
So at that integrated equilibria,

598
00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.760
if we move away from it a little bit,
right?
If it turns out that,

599
00:35:32.761 --> 00:35:37.761
let's say one town has 5% more short people and the other town has 5% more tall

600
00:35:40.441 --> 00:35:44.720
people,
right?
Then in some sense we're in trouble already.
All right?

601
00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:47.850
We have when we haven't gone very far from this nice equilibrium,

602
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.260
but already we're in trouble because now all of the uh,

603
00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:55.890
short people are going to prefer east town and all of the tall people I kind of

604
00:35:55.891 --> 00:36:00.630
refer West town and in a few in a few moves we're very quickly going to be back

605
00:36:00.631 --> 00:36:02.380
at segregation again.
Right.

606
00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:05.190
It's not stable in the sense that we were a little bit off.

607
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:08.190
We're going to go a long way off and again,
I'm not being formal here,

608
00:36:08.191 --> 00:36:12.600
but the informal idea I think is important.
All right.
Conversely,

609
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:17.580
those segregated equilibria because they were strictly collaborators,

610
00:36:17.581 --> 00:36:19.080
they didn't want to have over that we're pointing out,

611
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:20.610
they're really pretty stable.

612
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:26.060
If we start close to 100% short people in east and close to 100% a tall people

613
00:36:28.651 --> 00:36:30.760
in west and then we move it in a bit of weight.

614
00:36:30.761 --> 00:36:34.320
So I shake you up a bit and I forced you not to be know I reallocated a few

615
00:36:34.321 --> 00:36:38.070
people and then that you play,
I claim you'll go back to that equilibrium.

616
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:42.990
Is that right?
Is that right?
So the equilibrium that is integrated here,

617
00:36:42.991 --> 00:36:44.430
it is an equilibrium.

618
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:48.870
It's only a week equilibrium and it's not very stable in some sense.

619
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:53.430
Whereas the segregated equilibria there clearly strict equilibria and they asked

620
00:36:53.431 --> 00:36:57.160
people,
all right,
let's put some of this down on the board now,

621
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.700
partly because it feels weird for me being out there,
even if it doesn't for you.

622
00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:07.650
All right.
All right,
so we've got this several equilibrate here.

623
00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.810
We've got at least three and we'll come back and talk about whether there are

624
00:37:25.811 --> 00:37:29.320
others in a minute.
We've got at least three equilibria.

625
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:34.480
Two of them are segregated.
Nash Equilibria in this game.

626
00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:39.790
We have to
segregated.

627
00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:45.220
Nah,
she when it wrap.
All right.
And they,

628
00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:50.310
these corresponds to tool in east and short in west and vice versa.

629
00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:02.100
And we,
and,
and we had a separate,
a separate one,
which was an integrated one.

630
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:04.343
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

631
00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:10.860
<v 0>Which was roughly half of each in each town.</v>

632
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:16.000
All right,
so there's at least three equilibrate hair,

633
00:38:16.001 --> 00:38:20.670
although the two separate ones are kind of the same.
And we argued that this,

634
00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.570
these segregated equilibria

635
00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.020
is segregated equilibria.

636
00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.440
We're in some sense stable.

637
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:36.200
And they were strict equilibria in the sense that you preferred not to deviate.

638
00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:41.080
All right?
Whereas these intimate of Equilibria,

639
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:46.330
these were actually perhaps not stable and again,
I'm not being for here,

640
00:38:46.331 --> 00:38:47.320
so has to be careful.

641
00:38:47.321 --> 00:38:52.150
I'll put it in inverted commerce and again,

642
00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:55.540
I'm a little bit informal.
I kind of weak equilibrium.

643
00:38:57.010 --> 00:38:57.960
<v 1>All right.</v>

644
00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:02.740
<v 0>No,
I want to bring up one other concept here,</v>

645
00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:06.250
which is the idea of a tipping point.
All right,

646
00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.890
so this is a game that was introduced by a guy called shelling.

647
00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:12.370
Shelling went on to win the Nobel prize largely for this,

648
00:39:12.371 --> 00:39:16.050
I think certainly in law in large part for this one idea,
right?

649
00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:19.030
This is a game that has a tipping point.

650
00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.240
There are really two stable equilibria,

651
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:25.390
the segregation at one way or the segregation the other way.

652
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:29.710
And in between there's a tipping point beyond which if you,
if you've been on,

653
00:39:29.711 --> 00:39:32.950
which if you go beyond which you go to the other equilibrium,

654
00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:34.390
I said that very badly.

655
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:38.530
But if people get the idea that there there are too strict equilibria and if

656
00:39:38.531 --> 00:39:42.250
we'd got beyond the point of a half half mics going the other way,

657
00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:45.410
we can was off to the other equilibrium,
right?

658
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:49.330
And we already saw a game that had a tipping point when we pay the investment

659
00:39:49.331 --> 00:39:53.170
game,
whether a two week,
there were two equilibria,
all invest and no one invest.

660
00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.720
There was a natural tipping point in that game.

661
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:59.680
And the tipping point was having exactly 90% of you at best or at the point at

662
00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:02.530
which you actually would want to flip over and go to the other equilibrium.

663
00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:05.140
So this is a game that has a tipping point.

664
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:13.000
We can push people away from the equilibrium and they'll go and coming back and

665
00:40:13.001 --> 00:40:14.770
they'll go and coming back and go and come and coming back.
And then,

666
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:17.440
but if we just push on a little bit beyond the half,
whoops,

667
00:40:17.441 --> 00:40:21.050
look off to the other equilibrium.
Very dramatic change.
All right?

668
00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:25.960
Is that seems like a lot an important idea in uh,
for example,
uh,

669
00:40:25.961 --> 00:40:26.794
sociology.

670
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:31.450
So I've got these segregated equilibrate and they've got these integrative equal

671
00:40:31.451 --> 00:40:34.630
a rat and this just make the other obvious remark,
uh,

672
00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:38.650
which of these e w which of these equilibria is it is preferred by the

673
00:40:38.651 --> 00:40:39.484
population.

674
00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:44.370
Would they rather be in the integrative equilibrium given that these are their

675
00:40:44.371 --> 00:40:46.470
pay offs or the segregated equilibrium,

676
00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.990
but rather be an integrated one?
Right?
All right,

677
00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.360
so here's a world in which they'd like to be.
In the end,

678
00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.750
everybody would like to be in the intro to equilibrium.

679
00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:59.240
This is not a prisoner's dilemma.
All right?

680
00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:01.580
This is not a case that we've seen before,

681
00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:05.870
but it turns out that you're likely to end up in these inefficient,

682
00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:09.860
less preferred by everybody.
Segregated equal number.

683
00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:11.483
<v 1>All right?</v>

684
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:14.510
<v 0>However,
if we're subtle about this,</v>

685
00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:17.600
you might notice there's actually a 30.

686
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:20.720
Whenever I'm in this game for a little bit nerdy,

687
00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.200
there's actually another equilibrium in this game.
So,
uh,
ally,

688
00:41:24.201 --> 00:41:28.070
I need to give you your mic back.
I'm sorry.
That was the guy that uh,
in in gray,

689
00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:31.580
<v 1>mmm.</v>

690
00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.530
<v 0>They've ever chooses one town,
the other,</v>

691
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:38.510
regardless of whether they're tall or short
distributed.
Good.
Good.

692
00:41:38.511 --> 00:41:41.960
So your name is nick.
Nick.
So Nick's pointing out,

693
00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:45.560
this is actually hidden in here.
Let me put it on.

694
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:47.780
It doesn't sound like anything very realistic,

695
00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.750
but let's just focus on just a second because I think that's an important lesson

696
00:41:50.751 --> 00:41:52.480
here.
There's going to turn out to be important lessons.

697
00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:56.150
The other recorder room is support.
Actually this is two of them.

698
00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:01.340
It's everybody.
Everyone in the room shows east town.

699
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:05.930
What would happen while we'd have to find a way of assigning everybody.

700
00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:06.711
All right.

701
00:42:06.711 --> 00:42:11.000
So what we do is we essentially randomize over the room and half the room will

702
00:42:11.001 --> 00:42:14.280
be an east town and half the room will be in west.
All right?

703
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:18.650
So there's this kind of silly equally reminiscence in which everyone does the

704
00:42:18.651 --> 00:42:23.630
same thing and the way in which people actually get allocated is not by their

705
00:42:23.631 --> 00:42:26.930
choice,
but by this detail of the group.

706
00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.700
This detail of the original game,

707
00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:34.160
which was if there was overcrowding,
we were going to randomize people.

708
00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:36.423
<v 1>All right,</v>

709
00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:40.680
<v 0>so the is actually a 30 whatever,
which is,</v>

710
00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:45.510
oh there's two of these of course.
So all choose the same town

711
00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:51.230
<v 1>and get</v>

712
00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:56.230
<v 0>randomize and to check out his new equilibrium.
It no,</v>

713
00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.970
just that if everyone else is choosing,

714
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:59.560
if everyone else is playing this strategy,

715
00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:01.780
I've all choosing east town and allowing,

716
00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:05.110
allowing the randomization device to place you,

717
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:07.230
then you're completely happy to do that.
Compete,

718
00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:11.410
<v 1>do the same thing.
All right,
so it is in fact an equal number.</v>

719
00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:17.240
<v 0>So this is a slightly odd equilibrium here and there's immediate like game</v>

720
00:43:17.241 --> 00:43:18.080
theory lesson here.

721
00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.620
This equilibrium sounds like something we might see in society.

722
00:43:21.621 --> 00:43:24.620
This one certainly worth talking about.
It seems a natural part of the game.

723
00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.910
This equilibrium seems to have nothing to do with anything that's really in the

724
00:43:28.911 --> 00:43:32.780
world.
It's just a rising from a particular detail.

725
00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:36.570
I threw into the model at the end to make things that up.
Is that right?
When I,

726
00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:39.080
when I was setting up this model and describing reality,

727
00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:41.570
I threw this in at the end.
Just say,
well,

728
00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:44.840
we better do something just to make things add up otherwise otherwise towns are

729
00:43:44.841 --> 00:43:47.120
going to be overcrowded.
Alright,
well it wasn't,

730
00:43:47.121 --> 00:43:49.700
that's really out there in the real world.
It was just to make it a game.

731
00:43:49.701 --> 00:43:54.290
So have to define things carefully and this seemingly innocent detail of my

732
00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:58.630
modeling technique threw up another equilibrium,
right?

733
00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:00.410
So there's a sort of warning lesson here.

734
00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:03.610
<v 1>The lesson is</v>

735
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:05.850
<v 0>seemingly irrelevant details.</v>

736
00:44:05.851 --> 00:44:10.851
I'm a game seemingly irrelevant details.

737
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.330
Things that aren't really attempts to capture reality,

738
00:44:14.331 --> 00:44:18.260
they're just trying to get things through in a hurry
can end up mattering,

739
00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:22.100
can matter,
it can lead your game to give you a prediction.

740
00:44:22.101 --> 00:44:25.160
You really don't believe it.
Is that right?

741
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:27.350
And that's a very general lesson for those of you.

742
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:32.230
I'm going to go out and model things more widely.
There's a second lesson

743
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:33.170
here.
However,

744
00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:38.500
the second lesson here is if in fact there's this randomization process was

745
00:44:38.501 --> 00:44:39.040
available,

746
00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:44.020
if in fact it was possible for everyone in the town to choose east town and then

747
00:44:44.021 --> 00:44:47.830
have the local governments randomize you,
right?

748
00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:51.620
Then if we use the law of large numbers,
if there's $100,000,

749
00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:54.250
it's 200,000 people in all,
and they're all being randomized,

750
00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:58.540
we're going to end up very,
very close in the limits exactly.
At the,
uh,

751
00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:02.320
at integration.
Right?
And everyone's going to be better off.

752
00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:05.110
Is that right?
All right.

753
00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:09.910
So the other kind of strange thing here is by randomizing,

754
00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:15.040
well,
I don't want to say randomizing.
I want to say

755
00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:21.290
<v 1>having
[inaudible]</v>

756
00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.580
<v 0>randomize for you</v>

757
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:30.740
ended up being better than choosing.

758
00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.460
<v 1>I ended up better</v>

759
00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:40.840
<v 0>then what you might want to call it an active choice.</v>

760
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.391
All right.

761
00:45:44.391 --> 00:45:49.340
Here's an example of a place where by advocating the right to choose what my

762
00:45:49.341 --> 00:45:53.900
town and simply,
uh,
by,
by all choosing east having society randomize for me,

763
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:58.630
we ended up better off,
slightly surprising result.

764
00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:03.530
All right,
let's try and push this a little harder.

765
00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.600
<v 1>Get rid of that.
Nope.</v>

766
00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:26.703
Okay.

767
00:46:28.770 --> 00:46:30.270
<v 0>Let's try and draw some lessons.</v>

768
00:46:30.271 --> 00:46:34.320
We draw out some game through lessons already from this about irrelevant details

769
00:46:34.321 --> 00:46:38.220
and about stability and so on.
Let's try and drive some other lessons here.

770
00:46:39.090 --> 00:46:42.510
So one lesson might be a lesson in sociology.

771
00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:48.030
I'm not a sociologist so I I uh,
wanted me to be careful,

772
00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:51.420
I'll put it in inverted commas here.
Uh,
the social order,

773
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:56.430
the lesson is what in this game segregation is what resulted at least in the

774
00:46:57.091 --> 00:47:02.091
stable equilibrium and you might be tempted if your an empirical sociologist to

775
00:47:03.331 --> 00:47:07.380
go around the world and say,
look,
I see segregation everywhere.

776
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.760
I've gone from country to country,

777
00:47:08.761 --> 00:47:13.050
from society to society and wherever I go I see segregation.

778
00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.870
You might be tempted to conclude,

779
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:20.790
but that's because people prefer segregation and that might be right.
Right.

780
00:47:20.791 --> 00:47:21.421
Nothing of this model.

781
00:47:21.421 --> 00:47:24.960
This proves that it might be the facts that it might in fact be the case that

782
00:47:24.961 --> 00:47:28.710
the reason you see a segregation in virtually every society is because

783
00:47:28.711 --> 00:47:31.450
segregation preferred.
I'm not ruling that out here.

784
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:34.830
I'm just raising another [inaudible] what's the other hospitals?

785
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:37.720
The other possibility is it could be.
The preference is,

786
00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:42.700
I like this roughly speaking,
people don't actually prefer segregation,

787
00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:45.820
but when all people act in their own interest,

788
00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:49.000
you end up with segregation anyway.
All right,

789
00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.760
so the fact that we seeing segregation,

790
00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:54.540
seeing segregation in this morning,

791
00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:55.393
<v 1>cool</v>

792
00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:00.620
<v 0>in segregation does not imply,</v>

793
00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:05.960
does not imply that there's a preference for segregation.
It doesn't rule it out.

794
00:48:05.961 --> 00:48:06.794
Of course.

795
00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.380
What do you call them?
Conclude.

796
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:16.250
Just because you see segregation everywhere then necessarily people want

797
00:48:16.251 --> 00:48:20.090
segregation and let me just take that outside of the context of segregation more

798
00:48:20.091 --> 00:48:20.870
generally.

799
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:25.870
If you see a social phenomenon in society after society after society,

800
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:30.020
whether they were anthropologists going across the societies or a historian

801
00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.630
going through societies in historical time and you see the same phenomenon that

802
00:48:33.631 --> 00:48:34.680
each of these societies,

803
00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:39.820
which results from the choices of thousands of different people you call

804
00:48:40.041 --> 00:48:43.070
conclude from the fact that you see it in all of these societies,

805
00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:44.780
the those people prefer it.

806
00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:50.760
All you know is that each of their individual choices add up to this social

807
00:48:50.811 --> 00:48:53.210
outcome that may or may not be something they prefer.

808
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:55.550
In this case is not all right.

809
00:48:55.551 --> 00:48:58.280
That was what he's shutting his big idea all.

810
00:48:58.730 --> 00:49:01.040
So I don't want to write that all out,
but it's,
it's kind of a,
it's a,

811
00:49:01.041 --> 00:49:05.240
it's a huge idea.
I could've got him the Nobel prize.
Right?
All right,
great.

812
00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:10.250
So you don't want to conclude from observation straight back to preference in

813
00:49:10.251 --> 00:49:13.130
the strategic settings.
All right,

814
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:19.030
now this matters a little bit obviously in our own society because we live in a

815
00:49:19.401 --> 00:49:23.900
robber segregated society.
Okay?
So,
uh,

816
00:49:23.901 --> 00:49:24.760
I mean we didn't be,

817
00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:28.880
be quite so coy as to talk about tall people and short people all the time.

818
00:49:28.881 --> 00:49:32.240
What we're really talking about mostly I guess in our society is ethnic

819
00:49:32.241 --> 00:49:36.860
segregation.
And we see this very dramatically in,
in,
in Connecticut for example.

820
00:49:36.861 --> 00:49:41.240
So where we live in new haven,
at least if you go,
uh,
you know,

821
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.220
a few feet outside of the university,

822
00:49:43.221 --> 00:49:45.200
you actually look where people living in new haven.
Uh,

823
00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:49.980
we see that new haven is a fairly integrators town.
There's not hundreds,

824
00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:53.870
hundreds grid of town,
but it has a fairly wide,
uh,

825
00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:57.350
array of ff,
uh,
ethnicities.
All right?

826
00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:01.260
But if you go upstairs and Connecticut,
did you go north ignoring half?

827
00:50:01.261 --> 00:50:03.170
And if you go into the rural areas or Connecticut's,

828
00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.740
you find something dramatically different.
Now,

829
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:07.090
how many of you have traveled around in,
in,

830
00:50:07.091 --> 00:50:09.920
in rural Connecticut about some of you have.

831
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:12.800
So if quite shocking for me as a foreigner,
I came here,

832
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:16.400
so new haven and the towns along the coast are fairly integrated.

833
00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.860
But if you drive into rural Connecticut use,
he's been quite different.

834
00:50:18.861 --> 00:50:21.650
So this weekend for example,
I was up at the Dharma Fair.

835
00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:24.050
How would you know what the Durham Ferris,
some of your nose,

836
00:50:24.051 --> 00:50:25.880
the Darren Fair actually is very good.
It's a place where you can,

837
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:29.570
it's a biggest agricultural in Connecticut and you can take your kids there.

838
00:50:29.571 --> 00:50:33.020
I have a four year old and a two year old and they discover it this fair that in

839
00:50:33.021 --> 00:50:37.140
fact it is the case.
That cow saying moo and sheep say bar.
Who Knew?
Right?
That's,

840
00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:40.480
that's a good thing.
So I don't want to knock the Darren Fair.

841
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:41.780
I think it's a good,
a good thing.

842
00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:45.680
But if you're wondering around the DRM affair and you're a social scientist as

843
00:50:45.681 --> 00:50:50.240
as I am,
I gas,
you can't help but be struck by,
um,

844
00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.840
how would I put this without getting in trouble?
Um,

845
00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:58.220
you would find more ethnic diversity at a Klan rally,
right?
This is,

846
00:50:58.221 --> 00:51:02.030
this is not,
I mean,
this,
that's not gonna get me out of trouble.

847
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:04.280
There's gotta be some way of saying that it doesn't get me in trouble,

848
00:51:04.580 --> 00:51:08.330
but you know what I mean.
Right,
right.
It is strikingly,

849
00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:11.740
strikingly white at the darling.
All right?

850
00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:16.370
We're only what it's about,
I think it's 18 miles from new haven.

851
00:51:16.371 --> 00:51:20.240
It's a 20 minute drive from new haven.
All right?
It's a,
it's a public event,

852
00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:24.080
20 minutes,
20 miles from new haven.
All right,
so this is a phenomenon.

853
00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:28.130
One might be tempted to say,
ah,
this is because people choose,

854
00:51:28.131 --> 00:51:31.580
people want clean.
People are choosing to go to the Darwin for her,

855
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:34.190
that choosing to some extent where they live in,
in Connecticut.

856
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:38.030
And you won't think the fact that we see this incredibly dramatic segregation

857
00:51:38.031 --> 00:51:41.750
between,
uh,
activities in new haven and activities 20 miles away.

858
00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:45.470
It's evident that people might actually prefer segregation and it just repeats.

859
00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.170
I'm not,
I can't prove that it isn't right,

860
00:51:48.171 --> 00:51:51.170
but we have to be at least aware of the possibility that he's got nothing to do

861
00:51:51.171 --> 00:51:52.580
for it.
With a profit to segregation.

862
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:56.270
It could be the preference is look like the preference is above all right?

863
00:51:56.271 --> 00:52:00.050
It could be that simply thousands of activities by thousands of individuals who

864
00:52:00.051 --> 00:52:02.320
at least would prefer to be in the majority than,
than the,

865
00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:04.430
they'd rather be in the majority,
not the minority,

866
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:08.300
but they'd like to be integrated leads to incredible segregation in the

867
00:52:08.301 --> 00:52:12.680
aggregates.
All right,
so let's go out policy now.

868
00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:16.220
So as I go down here,
I'm going more and more in trouble,
I'm sure.

869
00:52:16.221 --> 00:52:18.920
Horrible as a foreigner,
right.

870
00:52:18.921 --> 00:52:21.290
This is a big policy question in the u s right.

871
00:52:21.291 --> 00:52:24.440
How many of you are unaware of the fact this is a big policy question in the u s

872
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:28.040
right,
right.
So at least since the 1960s,

873
00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:32.990
this issue about segregation versus integration has been a hot button issue,

874
00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:38.000
particularly in what,
in what circ?
Uh,
particularly in,
in,
in,
in what part of,
uh,

875
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:41.610
uh,
of social life?
Uh,
yeah,

876
00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:46.970
segregating schooling.
Okay.
So,
I'm sorry.

877
00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:50.600
So Jessica is pointing out correctly that since the 1960s,

878
00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:54.050
this has been an incredibly hot issue in the U S and we're talking about the

879
00:52:54.051 --> 00:52:56.720
busing debate.
How many of you have not heard of busing?

880
00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.920
How many of you have heard of Boston?
That's him.
Yeah.
All right.
So,

881
00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:05.510
so it's slightly a,
a policy debate of 1960,
so people tend to forget it.

882
00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:08.000
But in the 1960s and early seventies,

883
00:53:08.330 --> 00:53:12.860
people were so worried about segregation in schools that they,
uh,
that,
uh,

884
00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:15.740
children were bused from one neighborhood to another neighborhood to go to

885
00:53:15.741 --> 00:53:16.670
school.
All right.

886
00:53:16.671 --> 00:53:19.670
And this was an incredibly controversial issue in the U S and I'm not,

887
00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:21.230
I don't want to take a position on it here.

888
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:25.410
I just want to point out that you could arrive at that policy by thinking about

889
00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:29.910
this kind of model.
In fact,
this is not just a,
an issue of history.

890
00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:34.680
If you read the newspapers last week,
uh,
including,
uh,
the,
the,
uh,

891
00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:37.950
the Yale daily,
you'll see that it's an issue today in Connecticut.
There's a,

892
00:53:37.951 --> 00:53:40.980
there's a worry in Connecticut today,
typically around Hartford,

893
00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.580
that the schools are still illegal,
illegally segregated,
right?
There's this,

894
00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.330
that they're not,
not in compliance with the law.
All right,

895
00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:49.070
so this continues to be an issue.
Uh,

896
00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:53.670
let me take it to a slightly less contentious areas since that's obviously so

897
00:53:53.671 --> 00:53:58.671
contentious and talk about and try and relate it back to the model a bit.

898
00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.020
So in the model,

899
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:06.350
what we saw was if everyone shows to go to east town of everyone chose to go to

900
00:54:06.481 --> 00:54:09.240
west town,
uh,
there was a policy,

901
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:12.060
there was a little bit like busing going on,
right?

902
00:54:12.061 --> 00:54:13.590
If everyone chose to go to east town,

903
00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:18.330
what we ended up with was randomized placement across the towns.
Is that right?

904
00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:22.570
Right.
And that's a little bit like the Boston policy.
It says everybody should,

905
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:25.350
we take away people,
we,
we,
we,
uh,

906
00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:30.680
take away people's active choice of their school and in place we just randomize

907
00:54:30.721 --> 00:54:33.510
everybody.
Alright.
So leaving aside,

908
00:54:33.511 --> 00:54:35.970
what happened in Connecticut's let's think about a school,

909
00:54:36.030 --> 00:54:38.670
not a very good school,
but a school that's a little bit north of here.

910
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:43.700
So there's this school called Harvard.
All right?
And uh,
so that's,
Harvard is,
uh,

911
00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.930
uh,
outside,
outside Boston.
All right.

912
00:54:45.931 --> 00:54:48.360
And at least when I was there as a graduate student,

913
00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:50.550
this was a hot issue in Harvard.

914
00:54:50.551 --> 00:54:55.050
So whereas Yale has colleges,
Harvard has a houses,

915
00:54:55.051 --> 00:54:59.990
but at the same thing,
right?
And,
uh,
uh,
these,
uh,
twins hissing me.

916
00:54:59.991 --> 00:55:00.960
They are,
they are the same thing.

917
00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.870
It's just the same name for maybe they're not the same.

918
00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:04.860
Maybe there's some subtle difference,

919
00:55:04.861 --> 00:55:06.930
but they're roughly speaking the same thing.
Right.

920
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:11.240
And I'm still getting it right.
And uh,
all right,

921
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:12.300
so these houses,

922
00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:17.300
these houses at Harvard at least until about 1990,

923
00:55:17.851 --> 00:55:20.730
I think roughly,
and I spent to me when I was there as a graduate student,

924
00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:25.740
the way in which you ended up at a particular house was that was you chose which

925
00:55:25.741 --> 00:55:30.630
house to be in.
All right?
And Harvard administrators started worrying.

926
00:55:30.631 --> 00:55:33.360
So these houses started looking,

927
00:55:33.810 --> 00:55:38.580
sort of taking on certain characteristics.
So,
for example,
there was a house,

928
00:55:38.581 --> 00:55:42.180
I guess there still is called Eliot House.
And if you went to a,

929
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:43.790
as I used to occasionally as a graduate student,

930
00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:47.190
go and eat at dinner at any house,
you'd meet all these people.

931
00:55:47.370 --> 00:55:51.330
And it was kind of an odd experience because more than half of them had names

932
00:55:51.331 --> 00:55:53.970
that just happened to be the same as the swim pool than just been built at

933
00:55:53.971 --> 00:55:57.660
Harvard.
It was like,
right,
right,
right.
Um,
and then if you went to,
um,

934
00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.200
to Adam's house where I was actually at a,
you sir,
uh,

935
00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:05.280
it was a very different mix of people and an extraordinary large portion of
them,

936
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:10.170
uh,
were a daughters of recently deposed Latin American dictators,
right.

937
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.620
Not exactly what you expect to meet at random.

938
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:17.330
And then just give you a third example.
There was a cow's called,
um,

939
00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:19.410
I think it's wrong now.
Kirkland houses that right.

940
00:56:19.540 --> 00:56:23.400
Kirkland House and Cuban house was known to be the Jock House,
the,

941
00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.900
the athlete house.
And of course this being Harvard,

942
00:56:25.901 --> 00:56:30.790
that meant that everyone that was comedian.
All right.
All right.

943
00:56:31.070 --> 00:56:35.510
So,
so this was this worry you did the Harvard administrators.
All right.
So they,

944
00:56:35.511 --> 00:56:39.130
they,
they were worried about it.
Are they presumably they were worried that uh,

945
00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.060
uh,
you know,

946
00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:44.260
little Ms Pinochet wasn't going to have a chance to meet Mr Master Gretzky or

947
00:56:44.261 --> 00:56:48.040
something.
Right,
right.
Whatever it was.
All right.
So they did tell me about it.

948
00:56:48.041 --> 00:56:49.540
Talk to what do they do?
What did,

949
00:56:49.541 --> 00:56:52.990
what did the hub administrators do to change this,
to change this,
this,
uh,

950
00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:57.620
outcome and one though.
Hi.
Yeah,
shocker that it's right,
but

951
00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:02.930
when you're going to go into,
right,
right.

952
00:57:02.931 --> 00:57:06.070
So what happened was they impose randomization.

953
00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:10.550
They did exactly the policy that we described a up here.
All right.

954
00:57:10.551 --> 00:57:13.880
This was essentially that policy and those is actually the policy that they

955
00:57:13.881 --> 00:57:18.110
adopted the policy in which a house allocation was run.
It was randomly,

956
00:57:18.180 --> 00:57:21.350
it was random,
which basically going through the policy,
Gail had all along.

957
00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:24.080
All right,
so as happened in other cases in education,

958
00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:28.610
Harvard arrived at the Yale solution eventually.
Alright.
Right.
All right.

959
00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:29.900
So randomization,

960
00:57:31.070 --> 00:57:33.880
randomization or more dramatic thing.

961
00:57:33.881 --> 00:57:38.840
It's like busing our policies arrived at really,

962
00:57:38.841 --> 00:57:40.850
because if we know of the existence of these models,

963
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:43.160
I'm not saying these are right or wrong,
it's not my position to say it.

964
00:57:43.161 --> 00:57:43.880
The right and wrong.

965
00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:46.160
I'm saying if you were going to all of you for these policies,

966
00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:50.510
this might be a way in which you might argue for these bosses.
All right,

967
00:57:51.290 --> 00:57:53.720
now I want to bring out the third lesson here.

968
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:58.640
And the third lesson here is once we,
we've drawn it,
well,

969
00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:59.990
I already said I wouldn't repeat it.

970
00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:04.630
Does a game theory lesson here about irrelevant details.
All right,
uh,

971
00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:05.840
relevant details mastering.

972
00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:09.200
But I want to bring in one more game theory lesson here.

973
00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:15.580
So here we've been discussing randomization in this settings of the following

974
00:58:16.731 --> 00:58:19.440
form,
uh,
in,
in the gay man,

975
00:58:19.490 --> 00:58:24.000
the local governments randomize where you lived in the busing experiments.
Uh,

976
00:58:24.001 --> 00:58:26.690
it was randomly chosen.
Who went to which school?

977
00:58:26.691 --> 00:58:30.570
I guess it was done by social security number.
I don't know.
All right.
Uh,
and uh,

978
00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:33.080
in Harvard it was an yell too.

979
00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:37.310
There's some randomization about which college stroke house you're living,
right?

980
00:58:37.311 --> 00:58:41.270
That's one way to achieve randomisation.
You can have it done centrally.

981
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:43.610
The central administration,
this local government,

982
00:58:43.611 --> 00:58:45.860
the central government can randomly assign people.

983
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:50.180
But in principle there's another way to achieve randomization,

984
00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:52.480
which the other way you could actually randomization,

985
00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:57.470
it's another way you could just see randomisation both in this experiment and

986
00:58:57.471 --> 00:59:00.920
elsewhere.
Uh,
rovers hammer way at the back there.
We kind of get them.

987
00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:09.840
Each player in the game could randomly choose rice,
right?

988
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:14.760
So rather than having centralized randomization in principle,

989
00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:19.200
you could get to the same outcome by having individual randomization.

990
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:22.400
All right,
so there's another possibility here,

991
00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:25.250
which is individual randomisation.

992
00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.000
In principle,

993
00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:36.320
you could have everybody in the room decide that they're going to do is throw a

994
00:59:36.321 --> 00:59:39.800
coin,
a fair coin,
each of them separately.

995
00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:44.210
And if it comes up heads,
they'll go to east town.
And if it comes up,
tails,

996
00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:48.230
they'll go to west town.
And if all of them do that and they all stick with it,

997
00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:49.071
right?
Again,

998
00:59:49.071 --> 00:59:53.060
by the law of large numbers will get pretty close to integrated towns.

999
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:56.630
But it won't have been some central authority doing the randomization.

1000
00:59:56.900 --> 01:00:00.790
It'll be each of you individually during the randomization.
Is that right?

1001
01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.980
All right,
so that's a little bit different.

1002
01:00:04.310 --> 01:00:08.900
And notice that if everyone else is doing this,
if everyone else is randomizing,

1003
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:12.110
the towns will in fact be,
uh,
at least,
uh,

1004
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:17.360
asymptotic we towns will be equally mixed and you'll be happy to randomize.
Why?

1005
01:00:17.361 --> 01:00:19.700
Because you'll be indifferent whether you end up in east town of West town,

1006
01:00:19.701 --> 01:00:21.980
so you might as well toss a coin anyway,
right?

1007
01:00:22.220 --> 01:00:26.990
So this is actually another nash equilibrium.
Let me get it loose here,

1008
01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:29.420
but we'll be much more precise in a moment.
All right,

1009
01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:33.110
there's another nash equilibrium yet another Nash equilibrium in this model and

1010
01:00:33.111 --> 01:00:34.910
it isn't it as silly in some sense.

1011
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.000
It's how everyone go to la going and go into the east town and then having the

1012
01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:39.020
government randomize.

1013
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:43.400
It's each person on their own tossing a coin and deciding where they go.

1014
01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:44.691
All right.

1015
01:00:44.691 --> 01:00:47.900
It sounds a little bit less like central planning and more like choice.

1016
01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:52.790
All right.
Now.
However,

1017
01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:56.990
as soon as we introduced the idea of individual randomization,

1018
01:00:57.230 --> 01:01:01.070
we've gone a little bit beyond where we've got two in the class.
Why?

1019
01:01:01.550 --> 01:01:03.590
Because so far in the class,

1020
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:08.650
we've talked about strategies as the choices that are available to you and the

1021
01:01:09.411 --> 01:01:12.410
choices available to you.
Where go to the east town,

1022
01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:16.870
go to the West town or in the numbers game we played it was shoes a number or in

1023
01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:18.170
the alphabet,
the game we played,

1024
01:01:18.171 --> 01:01:20.750
it was choose Alpha or Beta or deciding whether to invest or not.

1025
01:01:20.751 --> 01:01:24.230
It was invest or don't invest and so on and so forth.
Right.
All right.

1026
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:29.380
What we're seeing now is a new type of strategy and the new type of strategy is

1027
01:01:30.501 --> 01:01:34.940
to randomize over your existing strategies.
All right,

1028
01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:38.240
so we're introducing here in new notion that's going to occupy us for the rest

1029
01:01:38.241 --> 01:01:41.780
of the week,
and the new notion is a randomized,

1030
01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:44.670
<v 1>okay.</v>

1031
01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:48.360
<v 0>Or as we to call them mixed strategies.</v>

1032
01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:53.233
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1033
01:01:53.550 --> 01:01:57.870
<v 0>All right,
so what is,
I'd be more formal next time,
but what is a mixed strategy?</v>

1034
01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:02.760
It is a randomization over your pure strategists.

1035
01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:04.453
All right?
You're pure.

1036
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:07.710
The strategies we've be dealt with in the course up to now.
From now on,

1037
01:02:07.711 --> 01:02:11.070
we're going to refer to those as pure strategies that your choices.

1038
01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:16.440
How am I going to expand your actual available choices to include all

1039
01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:19.850
randomizations over those?
Right?

1040
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:23.760
This may seem a little weird too,
to make it seem a little bit less weird.

1041
01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:26.130
Let's move immediately to an example

1042
01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.950
done with this so I can use it.

1043
01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:41.340
So the example I wanted talk about is a game that I think is a bit,

1044
01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.960
is familiar to a number of you,

1045
01:02:46.790 --> 01:02:51.700
but I'll put up the payoffs and see
the parents look like this.

1046
01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:53.800
Each person has,
there's two players.

1047
01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:57.880
Each of them has three strategies and the payoff matrix looks as follows,

1048
01:02:57.910 --> 01:03:01.930
zero zero is down the lead diagonal.
I'm going around.

1049
01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:06.960
It's going to be one minus one minus one one minus one one one minus one,

1050
01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:14.070
one minus one minus one one.

1051
01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:18.760
Now without me putting any more letters up there,
what is this game?

1052
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:23.970
Right?
So somebody to try it out.
And this is rock,
paper,
scissors,
right?
Rock,

1053
01:03:23.971 --> 01:03:26.880
paper,
scissors.
So I think I get this right.
This better be rock.

1054
01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.870
And this is to be scissors.
Actually this better be paper.

1055
01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:33.973
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1056
01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:37.390
<v 0>All right.
This is rock paper says,
how many of you have not heard of rock,
paper,</v>

1057
01:03:37.391 --> 01:03:39.910
scissors?
Good.
Uh,
uh,

1058
01:03:39.911 --> 01:03:43.060
the other day I was flicking channels and ESPN had a rock paper,

1059
01:03:43.061 --> 01:03:47.640
scissors contest.
I want to know who watches that.
Alright,

1060
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:51.550
so this is a cut a fun game and it occurs all over the place.

1061
01:03:51.551 --> 01:03:55.450
It occurs even in episodes of the Simpsons.
So there's a,

1062
01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:59.470
I guess now by now famous episode of the Simpsons in which,
um,
the kids who are,

1063
01:03:59.471 --> 01:04:01.150
I guess Barton,
Lisa,
is that right?

1064
01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:03.280
Somebody help me out here at bottom with Easter.
Is that what they call?

1065
01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:07.560
It's a Bot and Lisa are playing rock,
paper,
scissors for some purpose,
uh,
to,

1066
01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:12.250
you know,
to allocate some priors and bars is seen to think,

1067
01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:15.550
did you can do an calcium's is seem to think rock,
paper,
scissors.

1068
01:04:15.610 --> 01:04:18.340
I love playing rock,
paper,
scissors,
rock rocks.

1069
01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:22.310
What could possibly be rock at least or his team to think?
Ah,

1070
01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.600
I love playing rock,
paper,
scissors.
Bart.
Always chooses rock.

1071
01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:29.920
All right,
that's pretty a hint of where we're going here.

1072
01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:32.800
That's a hint of where we're going.
This is a very simple game.
Rock,
paper,

1073
01:04:32.801 --> 01:04:35.800
scissors,
rock,
paper,
scissors.
But it's pretty obvious.

1074
01:04:35.801 --> 01:04:40.801
I hope that pure strategies in this game are probably not enough to to model

1075
01:04:41.741 --> 01:04:44.050
this guy.
Is that right?
So in particular,

1076
01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:49.110
I claim and if necessarily we'll prove that there is no nash equilibrium in pure

1077
01:04:50.291 --> 01:04:52.870
snatches in the strategies we've been looking,
looking at up to now,

1078
01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:56.930
there's no nash equilibrium in which people choose your strategies here.

1079
01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:01.510
All right,
so there's no nash equilibrium,
not from now on.

1080
01:05:01.511 --> 01:05:06.130
I'm going to use the term your strategies to mean the strategies we've been

1081
01:05:06.131 --> 01:05:09.370
looking at so far.
So by pure strategies here,

1082
01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.230
the set of PR strategies

1083
01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:19.370
is equal to the set rock,
your path and sisters.

1084
01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.720
All right?
What we've called strategy is up to now in the class.

1085
01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.160
Now can they want,

1086
01:05:24.161 --> 01:05:26.740
kind of want to see why there's not going to be a nash equilibrium in pure

1087
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:29.590
strategies.
There's this talk it through.

1088
01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.840
So if one person plays rock,

1089
01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:36.920
the best response against rock is,
I just try that again.

1090
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:40.990
You all know best response to rock his paper.
All right?

1091
01:05:40.991 --> 01:05:43.810
But if you paid paper,
the best response to paper is,

1092
01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:48.040
and the best ones to scissors is okay,
so everyone doesn't play this game.
Okay?

1093
01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:50.770
So clearly there's no,
there's not going to be a pure strategy,
Nashik,
whatever,

1094
01:05:50.771 --> 01:05:51.370
and wait because,

1095
01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:54.420
because any to attempt to look for best responses that the best ones,
which are,

1096
01:05:54.430 --> 01:05:56.050
that can lead to a cycle,
right?

1097
01:05:56.051 --> 01:06:00.520
Everyone see that there's no hope of finding to pure strategies that are best

1098
01:06:00.521 --> 01:06:02.980
response to each other because of that cycle,
right?

1099
01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:08.040
It's also a claim pretty easy to figure out what must be the national,

1100
01:06:08.141 --> 01:06:10.810
whatever.
I'm in this game,
we're going to prove it in a second,
more or less.

1101
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:12.790
But nevertheless,
I think we actually know it.

1102
01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:17.640
So what is in fact the Nash Equilibrium Strategy in this game?
Uh,
it was,

1103
01:06:17.650 --> 01:06:18.341
it's good to get some,

1104
01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:20.480
we can put in cold call somebody what role do when I was chemical?

1105
01:06:20.490 --> 01:06:24.370
Somebody random.
Yeah,
just cold call somebody.
I'm sure they all know it.

1106
01:06:24.371 --> 01:06:27.400
To just cold call somebody to watch the,
yeah.
So the gentleman in the yellow,

1107
01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:29.740
what?
Watch the watch the Nash Equilibrium in this game

1108
01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:34.030
time allowing you mixed strategies.
Now it's,

1109
01:06:34.031 --> 01:06:37.860
I'm allowing you to randomize by allow you to randomize over your PR strategies.

1110
01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.010
I'm allowing you to play mixed strategies.
What it,

1111
01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:42.160
what's the mix strategy we think people are going to apply here.

1112
01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:44.950
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1113
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:48.190
<v 0>No idea.
No idea.
You should be on that yet.
I want to play against you.</v>

1114
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:51.820
Is that it's up.
It's up.
Someone else pick Picada.
Yeah.

1115
01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:56.290
What do we think is likely to be the mixed trashy people are going to play on

1116
01:06:56.291 --> 01:07:01.180
this game and equilibrium?
No idea.
No idea.
All right.
Who hasn't it?

1117
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:02.890
We've gone from cells,
a champion,
rock,
paper,
scissors.

1118
01:07:02.891 --> 01:07:07.210
Blair playing each choice with one third bro.
Ability.
Thank you.
Thank you.

1119
01:07:07.211 --> 01:07:08.620
I think I thought that would be okay.
So I'm,

1120
01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:11.320
I'm amazed people live in play this with their siblings whenever they did and

1121
01:07:11.321 --> 01:07:13.960
there's lost a lot.
I don't know.
I don't know,
but all right,

1122
01:07:13.961 --> 01:07:16.390
so I claim I claim him as a guest.

1123
01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:20.950
I claim that the mash equilibrium is each player,

1124
01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:24.850
both planners,
each player chooses,

1125
01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:29.110
I'm going to call it a third,
a third,

1126
01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:33.640
a third.
And I said each player is playing the mix strategy.
A third,
a third,

1127
01:07:33.641 --> 01:07:36.580
a third,
which I'm sure I didn't catch your name.
Your name is,
uh,

1128
01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:40.810
which is Moses recommended strategy.
All right?
All right,
so each player,

1129
01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.780
he's going to play a third,
a third,
a third.
All right?

1130
01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:47.470
So I'm actually amazed that people didn't realize that.
Um,
and again,

1131
01:07:47.471 --> 01:07:50.270
I'm sort of puzzled as what happened in your childhood,
but never mind.

1132
01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:54.840
Let's figure out what in fact is the payoff to each of the pure,

1133
01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:56.710
pure strategies against this or whatever.

1134
01:07:56.711 --> 01:08:00.210
What I'm going to do is I'm going to show you that this will in fact be a nash

1135
01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:02.990
equilibrium by showing you payoffs.
Alright?

1136
01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:08.170
So watch the expected payoff.
So start off,

1137
01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:10.270
watch the expected payoff

1138
01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:16.760
of rock against a third,
a third,
a third,

1139
01:08:16.761 --> 01:08:20.900
and the other person is randomizing equally over rock,
paper,
scissors.

1140
01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:25.420
And I'm going to choose rock.
What would be my payoff?
My expected pay off?
Well,

1141
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:28.400
I claim that with pro Valencia.
Third,

1142
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:30.920
I'll meet another rock and get zero.

1143
01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:33.160
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1144
01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:37.540
<v 0>come with Promos your third oh me to scissors and get minus one.</v>

1145
01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:42.510
Hi,
I'm with problems.

1146
01:08:42.510 --> 01:08:47.020
A third how we'll meet paper and I said that wrong.

1147
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:50.800
Let me try it again.
Probably a third.
Amit Rock and getting zero property,

1148
01:08:50.801 --> 01:08:55.400
a third Amit scissors and get positive one and it probably a third Amit paper

1149
01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:57.560
and get minus one does that right this time.

1150
01:08:58.290 --> 01:09:03.050
That's plus one minus one.
So my expected pay off is what?

1151
01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:04.520
It's a third of zero.

1152
01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:09.760
A third of plus one and a third of minus one for a total of zero.

1153
01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:15.680
Right.
And it's not hard to check that.
The same is true if I chose scissors,

1154
01:09:16.570 --> 01:09:20.240
I chose scissors and the other person is randomizing a third,
a third,
a third.

1155
01:09:20.600 --> 01:09:22.360
Then with promises here,

1156
01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:26.960
third I will get minus one with problems here.
Third,

1157
01:09:27.050 --> 01:09:30.590
I'll meet.
Analysis isn't get zero and we've probably a third.

1158
01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:34.340
I'll meet paper and get one and wants to get it nets out at Xero.

1159
01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:41.110
And finally if I played paper and once again I'm,

1160
01:09:41.111 --> 01:09:44.930
I'm going to meet somebody who is in fact randomizing a third,
a third,

1161
01:09:44.931 --> 01:09:49.550
a third over papers and scissors.
Then with probably a third,

1162
01:09:49.730 --> 01:09:53.450
I'll meet a rock and get one with probably a third.

1163
01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:55.640
I'll meet scissors and get minus one.

1164
01:09:56.630 --> 01:10:01.340
And with policy a third I'll meet paper and get zero.
Is that correct?

1165
01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.030
I want to happen with that.
How so?
It will net out at zero.

1166
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:10.460
So each of the pure strategies here,
rock,
paper,
scissors.

1167
01:10:10.461 --> 01:10:12.380
I did actually,
I did rock,
scissors and paper.

1168
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:16.520
You should have them when they play against a third,
a third,
a third.

1169
01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:20.580
The yield and expected payoff of zero.
All right.

1170
01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:25.580
What about playing the mix itself?
What's the expected payoff?

1171
01:10:29.610 --> 01:10:34.080
Oh,
of playing myself playing a third.
A third,

1172
01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:38.630
a third.
If I play against somebody who's playing a third,

1173
01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:43.600
a third.
All right.

1174
01:10:43.890 --> 01:10:48.200
What a third of the time I'm going to be playing rock.
Is that right?

1175
01:10:48.201 --> 01:10:52.070
A third of the time I'm going to be playing rock.
Alright.

1176
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:54.330
So a third of the time I'm gonna be playing rock.

1177
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:58.260
And then I'll get the expected payoff from playing rock against the third,

1178
01:10:58.261 --> 01:11:01.500
a third,
a third.
What was the expected payoff from playing rock against a third,

1179
01:11:01.501 --> 01:11:04.590
a third,
a third?
Zero.
All right,

1180
01:11:04.591 --> 01:11:08.700
so a third of the time I'm going to play rock and I'm going to get this zero.

1181
01:11:08.701 --> 01:11:12.180
And I was wishing I had color,
but let me just do it without colors.

1182
01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:13.810
Messily alright.

1183
01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:19.440
And a third of the time I'm going to be planning a scissors and then I'm going

1184
01:11:19.441 --> 01:11:22.920
to get the expected payoff from scissors against a third,
a third,
a third.

1185
01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.530
And what was the expected payoff of scissors against a third,
a third,

1186
01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:28.230
a third zero again.
All right,

1187
01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:32.130
so third of the time I'll place scissors.
I'll get this.
Zero.

1188
01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:38.280
All right.
And a third of the time I'll be playing paper,

1189
01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:43.050
in which case I'll get the payoff.
The expected payoff of paper against a third,

1190
01:11:43.051 --> 01:11:45.240
a third,
a third,
which once again it was zero.

1191
01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:51.660
So my total expected payoff is a third of zero plus a third of zero plus a third

1192
01:11:51.661 --> 01:11:52.494
of zero,

1193
01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:57.360
which for the math phobics in the room comes out as zero.
Okay?

1194
01:11:57.390 --> 01:12:01.410
Third of zero parts.
The third of Xero wasn't 30 zero,
zero.
All right?

1195
01:12:01.411 --> 01:12:02.790
So notice what we've shown here.

1196
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:07.770
We've shown that if I play what I claim is the equilibrium of strategy.

1197
01:12:07.771 --> 01:12:11.190
A third,
a third,
a third against a third,
a third,
a third,
I get zero.

1198
01:12:11.610 --> 01:12:16.470
And if I played any other strategy,
I'd still get zero.

1199
01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.770
Is that right?
So therefore planning a third,
a third,

1200
01:12:19.771 --> 01:12:23.280
a third is indeed the best response or be it weekly.

1201
01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:28.140
It is indeed a best response.
And this is in fact a Nash Equilibrium,
right?

1202
01:12:28.141 --> 01:12:30.600
So what we've shown here is

1203
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:37.860
we'll start with this.
What we've shown is in rock,

1204
01:12:39.210 --> 01:12:40.440
<v 1>paper,
scissors,</v>

1205
01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:47.340
rock,
paper,
scissors,

1206
01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:53.040
playing a third,
a third,

1207
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:55.890
a third against

1208
01:12:57.420 --> 01:13:02.280
the other guy playing a third,
a third,
a third

1209
01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:06.560
<v 0>is a best response.
All right?</v>

1210
01:13:06.561 --> 01:13:08.130
Especially on the pack in the thing will be a vegetable.

1211
01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:09.950
But in particular it's a best response.

1212
01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:14.240
<v 1>So
if both people play this,</v>

1213
01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:19.670
one person pays a third,
a third,
a third,
and the other person plays a third,

1214
01:13:19.671 --> 01:13:20.690
a third,
a third.

1215
01:13:22.930 --> 01:13:25.060
<v 0>This is a nash equilibrium.</v>

1216
01:13:25.450 --> 01:13:29.230
So we'll belaboring a point that we all knew already playing a third,
a third,

1217
01:13:29.231 --> 01:13:31.690
a third.
Again,
if everyone pays a third,
a third,
a third,

1218
01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:34.300
that is a nash equilibrium.
It,
it's a little harder to show,

1219
01:13:34.301 --> 01:13:38.770
but it's true that that's the only equilibrium in the game.
And before you go,

1220
01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.540
if any of you know that people are running ESPN,

1221
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:45.280
this is why watching this game on TV is unlikely to be exciting.
All right,

1222
01:13:45.370 --> 01:13:48.640
we'll come back and look at other mixed strategies and more interesting games on

1223
01:13:48.641 --> 01:13:49.120
Wednesday.
