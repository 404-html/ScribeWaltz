1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.800
So last time we covered a whole bunch of new ideas and that was really quite a

2
00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:10.530
lot of ideas for one class here.
Some of the ideas we covered,

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.150
we talked about information says and these were ways to allow us to mortal

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.350
imperfect information.
So what's imperfect information?

5
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.420
It's a way of being able to capture both simultaneously and moves and sequential

6
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.890
and sequential moves in the same game so it's not like it's a way that still

7
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.460
allow us to to meld the lessons from before the midterm and after the midterm.

8
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.950
Then we talked about what strategies meant in this context and the basic idea is

9
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.310
strategies,
our instruction,
a strategy for each player.

10
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.060
It gives them an instruction at each of that information sets.

11
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.620
Then we talked about what some games were and leaving aside the technicalities,

12
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.680
sub games are just games within games and finally we introduced the idea of sub

13
00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:56.220
game perfection,

14
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.400
which is our new solution concepts that refines the idea of Nash equilibrium and

15
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:05.130
what subrogating perfection is going to do is it's going to instruct the players

16
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.530
to play a nash equilibrium and every sub gate.

17
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.210
When I was saying it is a sub game.

18
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:12.600
Equilibrium is a national equilibrium and the in the whole game,

19
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.070
but in each sum game it induces Nash play as well.

20
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.570
All right.
Now we're going to see today examples.
If we have time,

21
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.860
I'll go through three different examples and I'll tell you at the end of each

22
00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:30.120
example what it is.
I'm hoping to be the takeaway from that example.
All right,

23
00:01:30.121 --> 00:01:33.870
so last time was a lot of formal staff.
Two days can be a lot of examples.

24
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.120
Okay,
that's our agenda.

25
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.020
Here's the game.

26
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.310
Here's our first example and I called this example that I called this game.

27
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.120
Don't screw up for reasons.
We'll see in a minute.
All right,

28
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:53.121
so this is a game in which player one has to choose between up and down.

29
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.160
If player one chooses up,

30
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.110
then play a two gets to move and chooses between left and right,

31
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.560
and if player to chooses left,

32
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.450
then player one gets to move again and play a one chooses between up or down.

33
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.950
All right?
If we're looking at that game,
so what do we play this game?

34
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:17.880
Since we haven't played a game for a while.
I'll play a couple of games today.
Um,

35
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.780
so what I'm going to do is let's divide the class into,

36
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.630
so I just draw a line down the middle of the class.
Okay?
Everybody to my left.

37
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.140
Your rights.
Everybody over this side of the class is a player one.
Okay?

38
00:02:31.141 --> 00:02:35.100
You're all player ones.
All right.
And everyone on this side of the class.

39
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.110
Your player to including you guys hiding from the camera.
All right,
your parties.

40
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.380
All right.
Okay,
so this,
it's figuring out what we're going to do.

41
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.120
Not everyone has time to look at the game.
All right?
So play a ones.

42
00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.710
You get to move first.
Uh,
those of you who are going to choose down,

43
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.710
raise your hand now.
Raise your hand within,
they're right.

44
00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.070
Can You keep it up?
Keep it up to the can see you.
Okay.

45
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.710
And those of you who are going to choose up,
raise your hands.

46
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:04.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

47
00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.890
<v 0>All right,
let's more up those of you who chose up,
why don't you all stand up?</v>

48
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.280
Why should I do?
I don't do one of the exercise here.
So all those,
it shows up.

49
00:03:11.281 --> 00:03:14.750
Stand up.
All right,

50
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.280
so you can see that choosing town ends the game.

51
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.150
So this many people are still playing the game,
right?
It's people to people.

52
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.940
Everyone who's still sitting down,
I want to say we sat down here,
has exited.

53
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.880
All right,
play it too is you get to move now.
All right,
so play twos.

54
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.830
Those of you who choose rights,
including the people on this aisle,

55
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.100
there's people who choose rights.
Raise your hand now

56
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.030
one right over there.
Those of you who choose left,
raise your hands.

57
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.550
All right,
why don't you guys all stand up

58
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.420
just to get your weekend Monday morning,
right?
Everyone's,

59
00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:51.240
everyone's sleepy otherwise.
All right,
let's go back to play it twos.

60
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.860
Let's go back to play it too.
All right,
so those of you who are still alive,

61
00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:57.470
so we play a one.
Those of you who are still in the game,

62
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.990
so those of you who shows up at the first time,

63
00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.740
they could just up the first time.
How many of you now choose down?

64
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.240
Raise your hand if you choose down and raise your hand if you choose op.

65
00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.090
All right.
That's it.
Again,
get a stalling point of this.

66
00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.270
It's getting the tools to sit down again so I can speak for people going to need

67
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:16.920
them to sit down.
All right.
Those of you play a ones who are,

68
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.510
who are still in the game,
who are choosing are.
Raise your hand now.

69
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.050
I think it's everybody.
It's everybody.
It's that.
All right.
It's okay.

70
00:04:24.051 --> 00:04:25.820
You can all sit down.
Okay.
Okay,

71
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.640
so let's just talk about this game for awhile and then we'll analyze it.

72
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.020
Now this is not a difficult game from the point of view of stuff we've done

73
00:04:33.021 --> 00:04:33.854
since the mid term.

74
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.030
It's pretty clear what we should do in this game by backward induction.

75
00:04:38.031 --> 00:04:39.740
So why don't we start that?
Okay,

76
00:04:39.741 --> 00:04:43.100
so by backward induction we find that if player one,

77
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.610
if player one gets to move a second time,

78
00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.850
then that choosing between four and three and they're going to choose for all

79
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.060
right and play it to play a two.
If they get to move,

80
00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.330
knowing that player one is going to choose up tomorrow,

81
00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.420
they're going to be choosing between three if they choose left or two or three

82
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:07.280
choose right?
So they're going to stay on the game and she's left,

83
00:05:07.281 --> 00:05:10.990
which is what most of you did.
All right,

84
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.050
and finally play a one at the beginning of the game,

85
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.930
knows that player two is going to choose left,

86
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.710
where upon she's going to choose op.
So if she chooses up,

87
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.250
she's going to end up getting four and if she chooses down,

88
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.210
she's going to get to,
so she's going to choose op.

89
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.730
So it's clear what backward induction doesn't this game and that's what most

90
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:35.410
people did in the game.
Is that right?
Is that right?
However,

91
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.870
not everybody did it.
Some of the player,

92
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.230
once some of the player one is actually right when you raise your hand.

93
00:05:41.231 --> 00:05:44.590
Those are the people who chose,
who chose down,
the ones who chose down.

94
00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.340
But more than that,
because in north stand up live,

95
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.710
you didn't stand up just now raise your hand.
People are hiding now.
It's okay.

96
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.270
Those people who chose down,

97
00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.950
they may have had a reason for choosing down and their reason for choosing down

98
00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.180
might've been that they thought that even though they know they can do backward

99
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.580
induction,

100
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.850
so even though they know that my backward induction up gets them the better

101
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:05.600
answer,

102
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.600
they might be worried that if they choose up play a two we'll screw up and

103
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:15.450
choose rights and notice the player to choose his rights than play.

104
00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:16.700
I won and it gets one.

105
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.910
Whereas down yielded to so in some sense down was the quote safe thing to do for

106
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:23.780
player one given that they weren't,

107
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:26.840
might be worried that play a two might screw up.
Right.

108
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.810
Does that roughly just not,
if this is the case for those people who chose down,

109
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:30.920
is that kind of what you were thinking?

110
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.100
Some people are shaking their heads but some people are nodding.

111
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:38.390
That's a good sign.
All right.
All right.
Now why might play a two in facts,

112
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.120
screw up and choose rights because player to might themselves think that player

113
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.450
one might screw up at this stage of clout if by or one with a screw up at the

114
00:06:47.451 --> 00:06:49.250
last stage and choose down.

115
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.180
Then player two by choosing left would only get one.

116
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.890
And for him the safe option,
therefore his rights which yields two.

117
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.030
Alright,
so to get their backward induction answer here,

118
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:03.770
which most of them we did most of us did to get the backward induction here.

119
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:04.580
Answer here,

120
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.580
realize plant on player one trusting player two to play backward induction.

121
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.640
And that requires player one to have trust in player too.

122
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:17.330
Trusting player one not to screw up in the last stage to say it again.

123
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.640
Play a one needs player too,
not to screw up.

124
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.160
And that means player one needs to trust the player.

125
00:07:22.161 --> 00:07:25.970
Two will trust her not to screw up.
All right everyone to do the game.

126
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.520
Okay.
Okay.

127
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:32.780
So let's try and analyze this game using what we learned last time and see what

128
00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:37.250
we find.
So the first thing to do is let's,
let's look at strategies in this game.

129
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.320
So player two has just,

130
00:07:39.321 --> 00:07:43.760
Wa has just as two strategies left and rights because I play a two and he has

131
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:45.500
one information sites and there's just,

132
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.860
this game is actually a game of perfect information games.
Again,

133
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:52.940
with perfect information there's gonna be very easy play a one has two

134
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:53.960
information sets,

135
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:59.020
this information set and that inflammation said at each of them play a one has

136
00:07:59.571 --> 00:08:04.010
two choices.
So she must have four strategies at all.
All right,

137
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:09.370
so there's this game when we put it in its matrix form is going to be a four by

138
00:08:09.981 --> 00:08:13.040
two game.
Here it is.

139
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.080
And the strategies for playing a one are up,
up,
up,
down,
down,

140
00:08:18.081 --> 00:08:20.000
up and down,
down.

141
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:25.450
And the strategists for player too are just left and rights.

142
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.070
And now we can put the payoffs in.
So up,

143
00:08:29.071 --> 00:08:32.350
up left gets us for three up,

144
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.160
up right gets us,
uh,
up,
up right,
gets us one,

145
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:41.390
two,
a up,
down left,
uh,

146
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:45.010
gets us three one,
uh,

147
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:49.400
up up rights get to us one too.
Again,
we end up exiting the game here.

148
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.020
Down up is easy because it's just exiting the game at the first stage,

149
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:59.040
so at one of these are going to be just two one.
Okay,

150
00:08:59.041 --> 00:09:00.500
we're happy with that.
All right,

151
00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.500
so what I've done is Trump's late to the game into its matrix form.

152
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:09.410
Let's look for Nash Equilibria in this game.
All right,
just look fanatic,

153
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.900
whatever.
Let me,
let me do it at the board since it's quite easy at this stage,

154
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:14.100
so look for Nash Equilibrium.

155
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.430
Let's just worry about pure strategy equilibria for now.
All right,

156
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:21.960
so if player too was choosing left,

157
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.160
then play a one's best response is the ops strategy Hanif player two is choosing

158
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:32.820
right than play.
A one's best response is either down or up or down,
down.

159
00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:34.260
That's exactly the conversation we just had.

160
00:09:34.261 --> 00:09:37.470
If player too was going to quote screw up and she's right,

161
00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.510
then player one wants to get out of the game of medially.
All right?
Conversely,

162
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.950
if player one is choosing up up,

163
00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.740
then player two is happy and he's going to choose left.
It's gonna Trust.

164
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.640
It's trusting player one.
If player one was no chews up,
down,
however,

165
00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:58.970
then play a two if that's play a one screwing up at the second stage.

166
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:03.000
So in that case,
player to wants to get out of the game and shoes,
right?

167
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.540
If playing a one is choosing down up,

168
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.120
then player two is actually,

169
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.360
that doesn't matter that they're indifferent and if player two is choosing down

170
00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:14.310
down,
then once again,

171
00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.540
play or two isn't different just so they'll get to move at all.
All right,

172
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:22.380
so from this we see that there are three Nash Equilibria.

173
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:27.000
Let me call them one,
two and three.
All right,

174
00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:32.001
so one nash equilibrium is op op left,

175
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.410
another nash equilibrium is down.

176
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:42.570
Up
Right here.

177
00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.250
I have a 30 could I remedy is down,
down right

178
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:52.320
down,
down,
right.
All right,
so the three pure strategy,

179
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:56.040
Nash equilibrium in this gate and let's just see what they do.

180
00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.780
So the first one up up left is up,

181
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.320
left up.
So that gets us to here.
All right,

182
00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:08.600
so this one is the same equilibrium as corresponds to backward induction.

183
00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.820
Is that right?
This one is the backward induction equilibrium.

184
00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.390
And the other two are different.
Down,
upright and down.

185
00:11:17.391 --> 00:11:20.840
Down rights both end up down here.

186
00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:23.563
<v 1>Okay.</v>

187
00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.550
<v 0>Exiting the game.
[inaudible] right.</v>

188
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:30.120
So both of these other equilibria fell backward.
Induction.

189
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.080
So let's put not conduction with a line through it right there.

190
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:38.060
They're feeling backward.
Induction.
All right,

191
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.550
so you may ask why are they equilibrate who?

192
00:11:40.551 --> 00:11:42.720
We've seen examples like this before.
For example,

193
00:11:42.721 --> 00:11:46.860
in the entry game we also see examples last time.
So in this,
in this,

194
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.880
in this game,
the reason these are equilibria,

195
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:52.530
even though they fail backward,

196
00:11:52.531 --> 00:11:57.370
induction is exactly coincide with that conversation we just had about worrying

197
00:11:57.371 --> 00:11:59.770
about the other person's growing up.
All right,

198
00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:04.771
so in particular in particular if plow one thinks that player two is choosing

199
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.670
reits there just to say thanks to player two is going to screw up,

200
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.170
then player one doesn't want to travel up the tree because she knows she'll be

201
00:12:14.171 --> 00:12:18.370
carried down here and instead she just chooses the safe option and gets to,

202
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:22.720
right.
So from play a woman's point of view,
if player two was going to choose,

203
00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.030
writes them,
getting out of getting out of the game,

204
00:12:25.031 --> 00:12:27.580
doing the safe thing is the best response for player one.

205
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.840
And for a player to his point of view,
if play one's exiting the game,

206
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.020
it really doesn't matter what player two says he's going to do,
right,

207
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:37.600
because she doesn't get to move anyway.
All right,

208
00:12:37.601 --> 00:12:41.410
so that's why these are both equilibria.
Okay?

209
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.750
So what we want to do next,
we wanted to do next,

210
00:12:43.751 --> 00:12:46.690
we've translated this into a tree.
We've written down the strategies.

211
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:50.560
We want to actually see which of these national equilibria.

212
00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:55.210
Ah subgame perfect.
Which of these national equilibria I subgame perfect.

213
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.020
All right,

214
00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.740
let me give us a bit of a roommate because I want to keep this insight.

215
00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.740
So let's get rid of those

216
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.530
and raise this one.

217
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.400
<v 1>All right,</v>

218
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.210
<v 0>so next question is,
which of these three Nash Equilibria?
Ah,</v>

219
00:13:14.211 --> 00:13:16.860
subgame perfect.
I had to do that.

220
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:21.060
We need to start identifying the sub games and Paul's having just posted that

221
00:13:21.061 --> 00:13:23.580
bought up that I have to always sit down again.
Okay.

222
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.310
So what are the sub games here?
Well the simplest stub game,

223
00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.560
the simplest sub game is this simple sub game at the end

224
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.850
and which player one moves.
All right.

225
00:13:36.851 --> 00:13:38.560
That's a very obvious sub game,
isn't that right?

226
00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:39.460
That's a little game with a game.

227
00:13:39.461 --> 00:13:43.180
It's a rather trivial game cause it's a one player game but it is a game.

228
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.450
So let's examine that one first.
That's the last sub game.

229
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.610
All right,
so the last sub game here is that somewhat trivial sub game.

230
00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:59.980
It looks like this player one is the only mover and they're choosing either up

231
00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:04.070
or down and the payoffs off four,

232
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.470
three and three one.

233
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.860
And frankly we don't really care at this point what player two's payoffs are

234
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.220
cause play a one is the only person who is playing in this time came.
All right.

235
00:14:13.221 --> 00:14:17.600
But nevertheless,
let's put them there.
And if we write this up as a matrix,

236
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:21.820
here it is as a matrix.

237
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:26.410
It's player one is the only mover that choosing between up and down.

238
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:28.510
And the payoffs are four,

239
00:14:28.511 --> 00:14:32.440
three and three one and of course play a two doesn't get to move.

240
00:14:32.441 --> 00:14:36.820
So player to player to a is irrelevant here and clearly,

241
00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:40.930
clearly the only Nash equilibrium in this game with in Nash Equilibrium in this

242
00:14:40.931 --> 00:14:44.980
game is for player one to choose op right by a two.

243
00:14:44.981 --> 00:14:46.600
It doesn't really matter what they choose is,
I think,

244
00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.030
I think they can do about it anyway.
But for player,

245
00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:52.040
for player one to choose up is the Nash Equilibrium.

246
00:14:52.041 --> 00:14:57.041
So the Nash equilibrium in this trigger or some game is one just chooses up.

247
00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.173
Is that right?

248
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.340
So let's look at the play induced by our three candidates,

249
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.970
Nash Equilibria in this sub game.
All right,

250
00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:12.800
so each of our candidate Nash Equilibria,
here they are this one,

251
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:18.280
this one and this one in an instruction of how player one should play on this

252
00:15:19.401 --> 00:15:21.350
sub game.
And let me just pause a second.

253
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.800
The reason that these three equilibria have an instruction for how player one

254
00:15:27.741 --> 00:15:31.130
should play in the sub game,
it's because of my definition of a strategy.

255
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:36.550
Each strategy tells the player how they should move at every information said,

256
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.810
every information ahead of that player.

257
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.960
So even if the strategy is such that that is such that that information set will

258
00:15:43.961 --> 00:15:44.794
be reached,

259
00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.570
the strategy is still has to tell you what you would do when you got there.

260
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.740
And now for the first time maps,
we're going to see why that redundancy helps us.

261
00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:55.220
All right,
so let's look at the instructions.
Each of them gives an instruction.

262
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.450
The first one,

263
00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:02.950
the first one tells us to play up in the sub game.

264
00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:05.840
First one says up

265
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.310
<v 1>the second one,</v>

266
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.080
the second one says op again.

267
00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.860
<v 0>And notice this was redundant,
right?
If once you've chosen down,</v>

268
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.170
you know you're not going to get to make a choice at the third.
The third note,

269
00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.830
we all second node,
but nevertheless there's an instruction and it says up,
right?

270
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.960
And the third one,

271
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:31.450
<v 1>okay,</v>

272
00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:35.380
<v 0>the third one says down,
all right,
says down.</v>

273
00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.510
So this is the instructions,

274
00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:42.690
all of these three equilibria in this little sub game,
right?
This,

275
00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:47.230
this is the play prescribed by these three equilibria in this sub game.

276
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:47.981
All right?

277
00:16:47.981 --> 00:16:52.981
Two of them say Aarp and the those ones are going to induce the Nash Equilibrium

278
00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.250
in this dog game,
but the third one does not.

279
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.370
The third one says down and that's the loud,

280
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:04.330
that's not allowed in a sunbeam perfectly equilibrium because in a s I started

281
00:17:04.331 --> 00:17:06.600
getting equilibrium equilibrium.

282
00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:10.540
It has to a prescribed play in every sub game.

283
00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:15.810
That's Nash and here the third equilibrium is telling player one to choose down,

284
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.410
which is not a nash equilibrium.
The Sunday.
All right,
so three.

285
00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:25.470
So what are we doing here?
It just made me make it clear.
We're finding

286
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:33.040
it's not getting perfect equilibria and what we've done is number three is

287
00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:36.380
<v 1>okay,</v>

288
00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.610
<v 0>eliminated</v>

289
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.510
<v 1>because</v>

290
00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.160
<v 0>it induces,</v>

291
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:45.103
<v 1>okay,</v>

292
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:49.950
<v 0>play in this sub game.</v>

293
00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.613
<v 1>Okay.</v>

294
00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.810
<v 0>That is not nash equilibrium,</v>

295
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.450
not a Nash equilibrium of the sub game.
All right,

296
00:18:03.451 --> 00:18:04.610
we're already putting stuff together.
Now,

297
00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.400
this really used to be able to draw this conclusion.

298
00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:12.380
We really used the fact that it's a strategy three contained and redundant

299
00:18:12.381 --> 00:18:17.090
instruction and instruction down at this node that was never reached,

300
00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.210
but that helped us get rid of it.
All right,
so that one's gone.

301
00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:24.860
That one's got three is gone.
All right,
let's proceed.

302
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.670
Uh,
I'm going to run out of the board space here.
If people got this one.

303
00:18:28.671 --> 00:18:33.430
Now we've got this down.
All right,
I'll bring it back in a second.
Uh,

304
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:37.000
almost,
let me give it a second.
Let me give him a second.
All right.

305
00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:42.300
What I want to do now is look at the next sub game.
All right?

306
00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.620
Maybe what I can do if I just remove this comment,
like,

307
00:18:44.621 --> 00:18:46.880
and work on the right hand board that that'll aid us to look at it.

308
00:18:47.050 --> 00:18:50.120
So all that comments said was three is eliminated.

309
00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.940
And let me work now on the right hand,
half of this boy,

310
00:18:52.941 --> 00:18:55.670
they don't allow it to be out there a bit longer.
Okay?

311
00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.410
So let's now look at the next sub game.
And again,

312
00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.750
we're going to work from the back.
So the next,
some game,

313
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:07.010
next time gained back is the sub game that starts from this node.

314
00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.970
All right?
That's again,
that starts from that note.
All right?

315
00:19:10.971 --> 00:19:14.300
So let's identify that in a different color.

316
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.750
Uh,
I use blues,
let me use pink.

317
00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:26.640
So now we're going to look at this sub game,
this big pink because I'm game.

318
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.270
All right.
And again,
in this pink sub game,

319
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.910
this game look like it looks like this.

320
00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:42.700
It starts with player to choosing between left and rights and then player one

321
00:19:42.701 --> 00:19:47.020
has to choose up or down.
And the payoffs are one,

322
00:19:47.021 --> 00:19:50.380
two,
four,
three,

323
00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.610
three,
one.
All right,
once again,

324
00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:57.520
let's look at the matrix form of this sub game.

325
00:19:57.521 --> 00:20:00.760
And this is a bit less triggered on the last one because now there are really

326
00:20:00.761 --> 00:20:01.900
two players playing.

327
00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.920
So here's the matrix that goes along with this

328
00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.630
play.
Uh,
uh,

329
00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:14.170
one is choosing between up or down and play.

330
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:19.180
Two is choosing between left or right.

331
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.380
And this is slightly,

332
00:20:20.381 --> 00:20:24.730
slightly cheating because the facts play one is probably one of course knows

333
00:20:24.731 --> 00:20:26.790
what player two is going to have done by the time she moves.

334
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.050
Nevermind it'll do for now.
All right,

335
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:34.110
and is it put the payoffs in this upper left is for three and a down left is

336
00:20:36.941 --> 00:20:39.180
three one and uh,

337
00:20:39.550 --> 00:20:44.320
right is one too.
And this must also be one too.

338
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.960
All right,
ever.
What happened with that,
who are just putting,

339
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.220
putting the payoffs in and let's just look again,
just a pure strategy,

340
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.800
Nash Equilibria here.
Okay.
There are actually mixed ones.

341
00:20:53.801 --> 00:20:55.990
Let's just worry about pure ones for now.
All right,

342
00:20:55.991 --> 00:20:57.880
so the pure Nash Equilibria here,

343
00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:05.080
and this is all sub game,
I'll walk when it's to see if two shows left,

344
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:10.020
then one wants to choose up.
Um,
uh,

345
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:14.230
if to Jesus,
Jesus left and one it choose up if two shoes is right,

346
00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.880
it doesn't really matter what one chooses because she isn't going to get to move

347
00:21:18.881 --> 00:21:22.300
anyway.
All right.
Conversely,

348
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.680
if one chooses up then to wants to choose left,

349
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:30.760
that's the example of one not scoring up.
So two wants to stay on the game,

350
00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:36.150
but if one was to choose down,
then player two we'd like to get out of the gate.

351
00:21:36.151 --> 00:21:39.460
So if,
if,
if,
if play a two things,
one is going to screw up,

352
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.700
she wants to exit the game.
All right?

353
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:44.290
Very quickly we can see there are two equilibrate here.

354
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:49.950
One of them is up left and the other one is down,

355
00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.350
right?
All right.

356
00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.770
They correspond to and it playing that down this way,

357
00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.230
perhaps down right and left playing up this way.
Right?

358
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:05.800
And once again,
let's look at our three equilibria in the parent game.

359
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:08.320
Here's our three equilibrate and the parent game

360
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:15.230
three and let's see what play they induce in this little sub games.

361
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:18.250
We'll do exactly what we did before.
So one,

362
00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.070
two and three.

363
00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.480
These are all three equilibria from above and equilibrium.

364
00:22:25.481 --> 00:22:26.950
Number one up,

365
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:31.810
up left in this game prescribes left.

366
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:36.460
Is that right?
And equilibrium number two,

367
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.960
down,
up,
right down,

368
00:22:40.961 --> 00:22:45.961
up right here prescribes up rights had equilibrium.

369
00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:54.790
Number three down.
Down right here prescribes

370
00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:57.533
downright.

371
00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:01.363
<v 1>Okay.</v>

372
00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:06.340
<v 0>So which of these are scribing Nash Equilibria in the sub game?
Well,</v>

373
00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.600
pull laughed as an equilibrium.
It's that one up left as an equal I rent.

374
00:23:09.601 --> 00:23:13.080
So this is okay and down was an equilibrium.

375
00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:15.560
So three is okay in this sub game.

376
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:22.110
Alright Bob up rights operates is not upright,

377
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:27.630
is not a magic whatever.
All right,
so in this,
in this some game,

378
00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:31.380
straight up,
Nash equilibrium.
Number two,
the down,

379
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:35.520
up right equilibrium is prescribing play.

380
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:39.180
That is not a Nash equilibrium in the sub game,
so it's eliminated.

381
00:23:39.181 --> 00:23:41.430
It can't be a subgame perfect equilibrium,

382
00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:45.030
so here too is

383
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.660
<v 2>eliminated since it induces deuces.</v>

384
00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.080
<v 0>Norman Nash Equilibrium play</v>

385
00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:05.680
<v 2>in this sub game.
All right.</v>

386
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.570
<v 0>I know we're done.
When we,
we know about the whole games,
what we did here,</v>

387
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.510
we started with the whole game.
We found all of that.

388
00:24:12.511 --> 00:24:14.060
We found that the three Nash Equilibria,

389
00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.010
we found that only one of them agree with backward induction.

390
00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.050
We then looked at the sub games.

391
00:24:19.051 --> 00:24:22.710
We first of all looked at that blue sub game and we found that one of the

392
00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:25.890
equilibria equilibrium number three was eliminated.

393
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:29.790
The grim number three is not prescribing Nash behavior in this sub games.

394
00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:30.800
<v 2>Okay.</v>

395
00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:35.020
<v 0>Right.
Then we looked at the slightly more complicated sub game,</v>

396
00:24:35.021 --> 00:24:37.470
the pink sub game and we found that he couldn't run.

397
00:24:37.471 --> 00:24:42.070
Number two prescribes the paver up,
right,
which is not nash.

398
00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.630
And this sub game right at this stage we've eliminated two of the three

399
00:24:46.631 --> 00:24:50.440
equilibria and we're just left with one and the one we're left with the one

400
00:24:50.441 --> 00:24:51.274
we're left with,

401
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:57.100
the only saw game,

402
00:24:57.101 --> 00:25:00.870
perfect equilibrium there own equilibrium that wasn't eliminated by the fact it

403
00:25:00.871 --> 00:25:03.370
would prescribe bad behavior and sub games.

404
00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:08.180
The only spe is number one which is up,

405
00:25:08.370 --> 00:25:12.490
up and left.
And what do we notice?

406
00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:15.010
We notice that that the equilibrium,

407
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:18.040
that's the play that backward induction would've selected.

408
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:21.420
<v 2>All right,
so notice,</v>

409
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:27.240
notice this is

410
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.410
<v 0>the backward induction prediction.</v>

411
00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:35.880
<v 2>Okay.</v>

412
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.030
<v 0>All right,
so what are the lessons here?</v>

413
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:43.190
The lessons here are that on new idea,
idea of subgame.

414
00:25:43.191 --> 00:25:46.640
Perfect equilibrium is pretty easy to go about finding.

415
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:50.870
You just look at some games and check that the play and each some game it has to

416
00:25:50.871 --> 00:25:53.790
be Nash play.
All right,
I have to be started at the bank.

417
00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:58.490
You construct it by rolling backwards much like we did back in induction,
right?

418
00:25:58.491 --> 00:26:00.590
It started the last sub game and work backwards.

419
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:04.160
And the second thing is not surprisingly given,
given that remark,

420
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:08.600
not surprisingly were backward induction applies.
For example,

421
00:26:08.601 --> 00:26:09.440
in this game,

422
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:14.830
the subgame perfect equilibrium will find the equilibrium that is consistent

423
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.560
with backward induction and remember that's,
that was our aim last week.

424
00:26:18.561 --> 00:26:22.880
We wanted a way of refining Nash equilibrium to throw it away.

425
00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:26.630
Those Nash Equilibria,
that word inconsistent with backward induction,
so Sabine,

426
00:26:26.631 --> 00:26:30.620
perfect equilibrium has done that.
It tells us now if backward induction applies,

427
00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:34.970
the national collaboration focused on are the subgame perfect equilibrium

428
00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.100
and indies.
Most people in the class played that he could ever him just now.

429
00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.713
<v 2>All right.</v>

430
00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:43.980
<v 0>Okay,
so that's really,
well I want</v>

431
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.250
<v 1>to say about this example but me just make a remark in passing,</v>

432
00:26:47.251 --> 00:26:49.170
I made this market in the middle.
Let me take it again.

433
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:52.020
When we write down strategies,

434
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.640
those strategies tell us what seem to be redundant moves,

435
00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:01.470
but being forced to write down those redundant moves is useful because it allows

436
00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:06.120
us to model what other people think you would have done at those major nodes.

437
00:27:06.121 --> 00:27:10.930
And sometimes I have to think what you think I would have done at this later

438
00:27:10.970 --> 00:27:13.980
mode nude before I decide not to go down that branch of the tree.

439
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.700
So I'll be able to write down everything in a strategy allows us to have to have

440
00:27:17.701 --> 00:27:20.670
everything in front of us and makes that analysis simple.

441
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:23.240
And that's exactly what we did here.
All right.

442
00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:27.420
This was a fairly mundane example because in particular we didn't use any kind

443
00:27:27.421 --> 00:27:31.830
of inflammation set.
So next let's look at an example that does use them.

444
00:27:31.831 --> 00:27:36.090
Inflammation,
Sas.
All right,
so new example,

445
00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:37.243
clean this off.

446
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:53.040
<v 0>Well,
once again,
I want to play this example.
What I'd really like to do,</v>

447
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:59.710
got a couple of this game,
the matchmaker game

448
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:07.850
matchmaker game.

449
00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:12.730
What are they actually like to find out is do we still have all couple?

450
00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:15.960
We tried to send on a date.
I have plus couple.
We tried to send on a date,
uh,

451
00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:19.220
at about week three.
Are you guys still here or there's the guy your,

452
00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.460
what's your name again?
David.
And what was the,
uh,

453
00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.480
she hiding or is Cesar.
Thank you.
Thank you.

454
00:28:26.481 --> 00:28:30.860
And your name was Nina.
Nina and David.
Good.
Good.

455
00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:34.880
Can we get some mixed and Nina and David,
actually,
uh,
let,
let me,
let me do it

456
00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:42.140
and I'll go on talking when I'm doing this,
so that be,
that's okay.
Um,
uh,

457
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:46.680
where's David?
Thank you.
And uh,
let me grab him.

458
00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:49.940
[inaudible] that'd be great.
Thank you.
All right,

459
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.780
so for weeks we've been trying to get this couple have to go on a date.
It's our,

460
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:57.560
it's our attempt to get economics majors so it become real people.

461
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:03.060
It's a hard thing to do.
And they kind of the happiest couple of,

462
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.960
we were supposed to do something to the movies and they're not going to

463
00:29:05.961 --> 00:29:08.420
different movies.
And then we send them off from a romantic,

464
00:29:08.421 --> 00:29:11.060
we came to New England and they end up doing different things.

465
00:29:11.061 --> 00:29:12.890
And one went to the theater and other one apple picking,

466
00:29:12.891 --> 00:29:14.120
I forget which way around it was.

467
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.960
And at this point I figure I'm a pretty bad matchmaker.

468
00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.880
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to introduce a third player into the game

469
00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:26.420
as the matchmaker.
So first of all,
I'll write down what the game is.
All right.

470
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:29.300
So the game at this point,
them to look like this,

471
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.410
play a one is the matchmaker.
We can come and play em if you like.

472
00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:38.570
And he has a choice.
He or she has a choice.
Uh,
he,

473
00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:38.870
uh,

474
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:43.870
she could not send the couple out on the date.

475
00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:45.290
<v 1>Oh,</v>

476
00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.060
<v 0>she could send the capital out from the date.</v>

477
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.440
<v 1>Okay.</v>

478
00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.830
<v 0>But being a better matchmaker than me.
If she sends them out on the date,</v>

479
00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.500
she's gonna stake some money.
You know,
she'll pay for the date,

480
00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:01.340
she'll pay for the date.
All right.
And in the days,

481
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:06.560
once again,
they're trying to meet and once again,

482
00:30:06.561 --> 00:30:09.800
unfortunately they haven't figured out where to meet.
All right,

483
00:30:09.801 --> 00:30:12.130
well put the payoffs in in a second or two that the strategies are

484
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:15.310
all right.
So what,

485
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:19.870
so what I'm going to assume here is I'm going to let Jake Rta,

486
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.190
br matchmaker.

487
00:30:21.191 --> 00:30:24.510
And the reason I'm choosing Jake is I think he's the nearest thing I can,

488
00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:27.250
I have in mind in this class to being a Jewish mother.
I mean,

489
00:30:27.251 --> 00:30:31.120
he's neither Jewish.
He's,
I think he's not Jewish and it's not my mother,
but

490
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:37.000
he,
he isn't ca who's responsible for bringing me some drink every day in case I

491
00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:39.070
pass out and the lecture.
So that's,
that's the nearest thing I can think of.

492
00:30:39.071 --> 00:30:43.420
So Jake's going to be a Jewish mother and Jake's going to either send these guys

493
00:30:43.421 --> 00:30:46.000
on a date or not.
And Jake smarter than me at this,

494
00:30:46.001 --> 00:30:47.260
he's actually good at matchmaking.

495
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.750
And what are you going to do is he's going to send them somewhere where they

496
00:30:49.751 --> 00:30:50.330
really,

497
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:53.260
he knows Yale students better than I do and he's just some really some somewhere

498
00:30:53.261 --> 00:30:54.094
where they're going to meet.

499
00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:58.450
So he's gonna send them to go to the same lecture class next year and then

500
00:30:58.451 --> 00:31:01.510
there'll be sitting in the aisles in this huge lecture class and they're bound

501
00:31:01.511 --> 00:31:03.730
to meet all of you have sat next to other people some point.

502
00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:05.590
So you know that that seems like a good idea.

503
00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:09.550
So the classes he thinks of sending them to,
he says go to a large lecture class.

504
00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.610
So they're either going to go to,
uh,

505
00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:16.480
the Gaddis class or which is called Cold War or to the Spence class,

506
00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:19.540
which is called China.
Everyone know what about this passage.
Right,
right.

507
00:31:19.570 --> 00:31:24.340
And these seem like reasonable cost is to go to for it to,
to meet,
to meet your,

508
00:31:24.341 --> 00:31:24.940
you know,
Tommy didn't had,

509
00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:28.330
have a date to meet somebody and when the Cold War and going to fun class,

510
00:31:28.331 --> 00:31:30.550
I mean,
you hope it isn't a prediction of the future relationship,

511
00:31:30.551 --> 00:31:33.090
but you can cold war.
It seems the right and,
uh,

512
00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:37.270
China's by all accounts is a fantastic class.
It involves,
you know,

513
00:31:37.271 --> 00:31:38.770
something involving 20 million people.

514
00:31:38.771 --> 00:31:42.460
Most of them were in the classic [inaudible],
so,
uh,
it's pretty big class,

515
00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.430
so let's,
let's do that.
So we'll call this gap.
Unfortunately,

516
00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.500
Jake makes the same mistake I do.

517
00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:49.360
He's not going to tell them which classes to go to,

518
00:31:49.361 --> 00:31:53.110
so they have to decide whether to take Gaddis or Spence.

519
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:57.490
And once again,
they're coordinating,
we'll call them players two and three.

520
00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:03.700
So here they all trying to coordinate and the payoffs are as follows.

521
00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:07.900
So let's put in Jake's payoffs first of all.
So if they manage to coordinate,

522
00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:11.800
well,
first of all,
if Jake doesn't send them,
everybody gets nothing.
All right.

523
00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.230
And if Jake does send them and they coordinate,

524
00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:18.460
Jake makes one because he feels really happy about this.
Uh,
after all,

525
00:32:18.461 --> 00:32:22.810
I mean not to be some motivation for people matchmaking.
Uh,
and,
uh,
if a,

526
00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:26.680
they called Nate down here,
Jake gets one as well,
but if they fail to coordinate,

527
00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:30.190
uh,
Jake fields rotten about it,
particularly because,
you know,

528
00:32:30.191 --> 00:32:33.850
he paid for them to go to this class,
whatever the cost of a class at Yale is,

529
00:32:33.851 --> 00:32:37.060
which is probably quite a lot actually.
I don't know.
All right.
All right.
So,
okay.

530
00:32:37.061 --> 00:32:39.190
We'll call it [inaudible].
All right.

531
00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:43.400
And otherwise the payoffs are exactly the same as the payoff we used when we

532
00:32:43.401 --> 00:32:45.140
looked at this game earlier on in the course.

533
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:50.000
So the payoffs are going to be too warm here and zero,

534
00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:54.250
zero if they failed to coordinates and zero zero here if they fail to
coordinate.

535
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:59.360
And one,
two,
one,
two here.
All right.
So what are the implication of this?

536
00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:04.250
Is that player to who will assume is is David,
is that right?
David?

537
00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.960
So David would like to meet Nina,
but uh,

538
00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:09.290
one of the things being equal,

539
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:12.830
he'd like to meet her at the Cold War and then it would like to meet David.

540
00:33:12.831 --> 00:33:17.120
But all other things being equal,
she would like to meet in China.
I mean,

541
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:21.350
not literally in China,
but in the classroom.
All right.
All right.

542
00:33:21.351 --> 00:33:23.000
So this is our game.
All right?

543
00:33:23.001 --> 00:33:25.190
And we're going to analyze this game of before we analyze it,

544
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:29.960
let's try and play it.
So,
so,
um,
uh,
what we need to do is,

545
00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.860
first of all,
let's not make sure things worked smoothly.

546
00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:37.280
Let's have David write down which class he's going to choose.

547
00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:40.130
And Nina write down which class she's going to choose.

548
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:41.610
I've lost sight of mean it is.

549
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:44.250
Somebody needs to point out that actually is right,
right down at Portsmouth.

550
00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:48.400
Choose.
Okay.
Something we'd written down.
Okay.
And Jake got,

551
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:49.670
you've got your mic class.
All right.
Jake,

552
00:33:49.671 --> 00:33:52.730
are you gonna are you gonna are you going to send this hapless capital or not?

553
00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:57.350
So,
so I have Dave in my section actually,

554
00:33:57.351 --> 00:33:59.210
and I hear how much he's been talking about Nina.

555
00:33:59.211 --> 00:34:02.570
So I'm going to roll the dice and send them.
All right.
Sound?
Okay,
good,
good.

556
00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.180
All right,
so we have them going off to this class.
All right.
And,
uh,

557
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:09.110
let us see what they wrote down.
So a day,
what did you write down?

558
00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:13.370
I'm going to give it and go to China.
You got to go to China and Nina,

559
00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:16.370
I just ask you to wait until they managed to me too.

560
00:34:16.371 --> 00:34:18.950
There's this successful dates.
Let's give him a round of applause.
All right.

561
00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:25.600
I hear it a great class too.
And in fact,

562
00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:27.850
I don't think it's gonna happen forever cause I think he must be approaching

563
00:34:27.851 --> 00:34:31.210
retirement.
Thompson's a pretty good choice.
So good.
Okay.
That worked very well.

564
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.190
Let's have a look now at this given its allies,
this gay man,

565
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:36.250
and see what we can do with this game.
All right.

566
00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.920
So how are we going to analyze this game?
So no surprise,

567
00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:43.470
we're going to use the idea of a subgame perfect equilibrium.
I'll collect them.

568
00:34:43.471 --> 00:34:45.320
I explains it that way.
All right?
So,
uh,

569
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:49.480
we're gonna use the idea of a subgame perfect equilibrium.
So how do we,

570
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:52.750
how do we figure out how to work out when a sunbeam have any good everyone is,

571
00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.680
we're going to use the same basic idea that we use it when we,

572
00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:59.730
what we've been using all along and backward induction and they come,

573
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.800
it's the same idea in the game we just looked at just now what we're going to do

574
00:35:02.801 --> 00:35:06.400
is rather than start from the last decision node,

575
00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.120
you can't do that anymore and work backwards.
Sort of doing that.

576
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:15.150
We're going to start from the last sub game and work backwards and then this

577
00:35:15.761 --> 00:35:20.200
example,
it's pretty obvious what the last sub game is,
right?
The last sub game,

578
00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:24.430
the game within the game there isn't it only really won the game within the
game.

579
00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:30.730
Is this object here?
Is that right?
This is the game within the game.
No,

580
00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.300
I could at this stage I could just lay out.
I was like,

581
00:35:33.301 --> 00:35:37.290
could write down the whole matrix for the whole game and have uh,

582
00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:41.370
Jake choose the matrix and Dave and Nina shoes,

583
00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.430
the row and the column.
But that's going to take,
you know,

584
00:35:43.431 --> 00:35:44.231
it's going to get us a stray.

585
00:35:44.231 --> 00:35:46.320
So it's not that we mean we couldn't do that and it's not worry about that.

586
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.590
It's just let's just start doing things backwards.
So we do things backwards.

587
00:35:49.591 --> 00:35:54.420
We'll start at the last sub game and that last time game is an old friend of

588
00:35:54.421 --> 00:35:59.280
ours.
It looks exactly like this.
This is right then.
All right,
so here's,

589
00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:04.080
it involves players two and three.
All right.

590
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:09.200
And two is choosing between Gaddis and Spence and three was choosing between

591
00:36:09.211 --> 00:36:14.211
Gadison and Spence and their pay offs where let we leave a space here.

592
00:36:14.821 --> 00:36:19.821
So it was two one one two zero zero zero zero is a,

593
00:36:20.431 --> 00:36:23.460
here are the payoffs of the relevant players in the game.
But while we're here,

594
00:36:23.461 --> 00:36:27.960
when we put in Jake's payoffs as well.
So Jake's payoffs were one here,

595
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:32.760
one here,
minus one here and minus one.
All right,

596
00:36:32.761 --> 00:36:36.700
so there are any relevant players here play as two and three but I've put player

597
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:40.750
ones pay in as well because why not?
Why not just keep track of it.
Okay.

598
00:36:40.751 --> 00:36:45.410
And we're happy that that's,
that's exactly describes this little game.
All right.

599
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:48.600
Now all intents and purposes,
we can forget the first payoff,
but there it is.

600
00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.690
All right.
And this is a game we've seen many times so far.

601
00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:55.620
It's the battle of the sexes or the battle of Dave and Nina.
And,
uh,

602
00:36:55.690 --> 00:37:00.610
in this game we already know what the equilibrium Ra.
So,
uh,
the,
uh,

603
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.430
equilibrium here,
I mean it's underlying,
uh,
best responses.
Uh,
so if,

604
00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:09.840
uh,
if Nina is choosing Gaddis,
then Dave chooses gas.

605
00:37:09.841 --> 00:37:14.530
If neither is choosing Spence than Dave would like to choose Spence.
And,
uh,

606
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:17.100
conversely,
all right,

607
00:37:17.101 --> 00:37:19.500
so I just underlined the best responses for the players who are actually

608
00:37:19.501 --> 00:37:20.520
involved in the game.

609
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.040
I haven't bothered underlining and thing for Jay because he isn't a player in

610
00:37:23.041 --> 00:37:25.350
this game.
That makes sense.
All right,

611
00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:28.380
so the pure Nash equilibrium in this game,

612
00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:33.820
a pure Nash equilibrium in this game are essentially Gaddis Gaddis or Spence.

613
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:39.150
Spence.
Alright.

614
00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:44.520
I have a pretty easy,
all right.
And from Jake's point of view,

615
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.950
each of these pure strategy,

616
00:37:46.951 --> 00:37:51.660
Nash Equilibria yield a pay off of here for him.
Of what,
how,

617
00:37:51.661 --> 00:37:52.800
what does he get if they,

618
00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:57.810
if they go to Gaddis Gaddis he's happy that they magically gets one and if they

619
00:37:57.811 --> 00:38:00.120
choose Spence Spence,
he's happy that they met and he gets one.

620
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:01.170
Jake doesn't really matter.

621
00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:04.500
[inaudible] himself doesn't really mind whether Dave and Nina,
uh,

622
00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:07.500
learn about China or learn about the Cold War.
He just wants them to meet.

623
00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:12.090
All right,
so both of these,
uh,
yield one for Jake,

624
00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:17.660
both yields he valued it was cool value of one for plan one for player one.

625
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:27.300
Who's Jake?
All right.
So from Jake's point of view,

626
00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:30.810
from Jake's point of view,
going back a stage and we're going to do now,

627
00:38:30.811 --> 00:38:32.160
it doesn't mean it just made it with backward induction.

628
00:38:32.161 --> 00:38:33.900
We're going to roll the game back.

629
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.990
So we started by analyzing this sub game and then we're going to roll back a

630
00:38:37.991 --> 00:38:42.850
stage just as we did with backward induction.
So when we rolled back,
Jake,

631
00:38:42.851 --> 00:38:44.020
he's moving here.

632
00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:48.940
If Jake chooses not to send them not to send them,

633
00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:52.150
then we get zero,
zero,
zero.

634
00:38:52.151 --> 00:38:55.000
But the key part of this is the first year that's Jake's payoff.

635
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:59.500
And if Jake's sends them,
if Jake sends them,

636
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:04.360
they weren't Jake gets is the value

637
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:10.840
to Jake.
Oh well okay.
I'll put it Jake,
but play player while,
okay.
Value for Jake.

638
00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:16.360
All of the Nash Equilibria in this subject.

639
00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:19.003
<v 2>Okay.</v>

640
00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:20.760
<v 0>Right.
Well the big thing to write but that's what,</v>

641
00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:24.480
that's what Jake gets on the others do to that.
Let's get that as well.

642
00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:28.560
And in this case,
in this case,
rather than waiting that long piece,

643
00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:33.690
this is just equal to one that right.
All right.
So if Jake sends them,

644
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:38.280
he knows that they're going to play a nash equilibrium in this some game or he

645
00:39:38.281 --> 00:39:41.520
believes they're going to play a nash equilibrium in this sub game and either of

646
00:39:41.521 --> 00:39:43.270
those two national whatever on the sum game.

647
00:39:43.271 --> 00:39:45.200
I think I got second either of the two Nash Equilibrium,

648
00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:49.260
the sum game yield a pay off to Jake of one.
All right,

649
00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:53.400
so actually uh,
the,
the,
the,
the one of them is one,
one of them.

650
00:39:53.401 --> 00:39:57.450
You'll pay payoffs of one,
one,
two and the other yields payoffs of one to one.

651
00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:00.990
But since Jake is the only mover here,
lets us focus on Jake.
All right,

652
00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:05.040
so from Jake's point of view,
he's really choosing between zero and one.

653
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:09.510
So he's going to choose sent.
All right,
so the national search,

654
00:40:09.511 --> 00:40:12.900
so the subgame perfect equilibrium,
the subgame perfect,
whatever.

655
00:40:12.901 --> 00:40:17.520
I'm therefore they're actually two of them here.
One is

656
00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:22.720
<v 2>Cindy Spence,
Spanish.</v>

657
00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:26.820
<v 0>That's what actually happened.
But there's another one which is</v>

658
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:32.780
<v 2>send Gaddis Gaddis.</v>

659
00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.220
<v 0>Right?
That would also have been a pure strategy.
Uh,
it's like getting perfect.</v>

660
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:40.150
He could ever write.
In either case,
what we did is a rock,

661
00:40:40.151 --> 00:40:41.020
just to remind ourselves,

662
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:45.190
we first of all sold the equal rim down the sum game,

663
00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.540
the equilibrium in this blue sub game.

664
00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:51.700
We figured out how much that equilibrium was worth for everybody,

665
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.860
but in particular for Jake,
but in for everybody.

666
00:40:54.130 --> 00:40:58.840
And then we rolled that payoff back and looked at Jake's choice,
right?

667
00:40:58.841 --> 00:40:59.830
In this particular case,

668
00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.360
that gave us to whenever send Spence Spence and send Gaddis Gaddis.

669
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:05.980
However,

670
00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.700
some of you must be suspecting at this point that there's actually another

671
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.940
subgame perfect equilibrium here,
right?
How do we know that?

672
00:41:12.941 --> 00:41:14.010
What does the thing about this game,

673
00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.650
I mean we've been trying to send this couple on a date or all semester.

674
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:20.010
They haven't gone on a date or some acetone embarrassing now,

675
00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:21.190
but they haven't gone a day all semester.

676
00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:25.250
So there must be some possibility that they would fail to coordinate and it'd be

677
00:41:25.251 --> 00:41:29.110
a pretty weird notion of equilibrium that concluded that they always managed to

678
00:41:29.111 --> 00:41:32.020
coordinate and hence Jake always wants to send them.
Is that right?

679
00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:35.420
So let's also look at the other equilibrate here.

680
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.720
Now the reason there's another equilibrium in this sub game.

681
00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:53.640
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

682
00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.170
<v 0>The reason,
the reason is that another equilibrium equilibrium in the whole game,</v>

683
00:41:58.171 --> 00:42:00.150
there isn't,
there's another sub game.
Have any on in the hallway,

684
00:42:00.151 --> 00:42:03.030
you mean is that there's another nash equilibrium in the sub game.

685
00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:08.130
What's the other Nash Equilibrium in the sub game?
They could mix,
right?

686
00:42:08.131 --> 00:42:12.870
They could mix.
Right,
right.
It turns out that in the sub game,

687
00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:20.490
in the sub game,
here it is.

688
00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.080
There's also a third mixed equilibrium.

689
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

690
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.360
<v 0>That is a mixed,</v>

691
00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:36.910
<v 1>Nah,
she could I rent</v>

692
00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:40.340
<v 0>all right.
And we can,
we know how to work that out.
We could,</v>

693
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:43.360
we could write down a p in a queue and we can look at those indifference

694
00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.300
conditions and solve it out.
But this is a sub game.
This is a game.
This,

695
00:42:47.301 --> 00:42:50.150
this top game corresponds to a game we've seen many times in his past so far.

696
00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.940
And I think we probably remember what that equilibrium is that right?

697
00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.410
I do anyway.
So if it's,
if you remember it as well,

698
00:42:55.411 --> 00:42:57.560
I write down and we'll see if you'd all look alarmed.

699
00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:02.740
So I claim the equilibrium at the other equilibrium has Dave playing with

700
00:43:03.921 --> 00:43:05.000
problems.
He two thirds,

701
00:43:05.001 --> 00:43:10.001
one third and has Nina playing with property one third,

702
00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:14.830
two thirds.
Alright,

703
00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.510
so this is another equilibrium in the sub game.

704
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:20.900
People remember that this was an equilibrium.
A battle of the sexes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

705
00:43:20.901 --> 00:43:24.970
People nodding at me.
Yeah.
Okay.
So,
so it isn't until an intuitive we,
we can,

706
00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:26.150
we all know how we'd work it out.

707
00:43:26.151 --> 00:43:29.060
We can go back and put it on the p in the queue,
but it isn't quite an intuitive.

708
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:32.440
It has a day of going more often to the lecture course.

709
00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.480
He would prefer all of the things being cool and it has me,

710
00:43:35.481 --> 00:43:37.790
they're going more often to the lecture course that she would refer.

711
00:43:37.791 --> 00:43:41.460
All the things be equal and they do just such a way as to make each of them in

712
00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:43.610
difference.
All right.

713
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:48.440
Now this some game induces a different value for Jake,

714
00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:49.251
right?
It's,

715
00:43:49.251 --> 00:43:54.251
I suppose Jake thinks I trust Dave and Nina to play a nash equilibrium in there.

716
00:43:55.721 --> 00:43:56.554
Some game,

717
00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.240
but I don't know which one it is and I think maybe they're going to play this

718
00:43:59.241 --> 00:44:01.010
one.
All right.
So suppose it,

719
00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:05.210
suppose Jake thinks that this is the equilibrium that Dave and neither going to

720
00:44:05.211 --> 00:44:09.350
going to play.
So now should Jake send them or not?

721
00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.400
Well let's work it out.
Let's work it out.
So now,

722
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:15.970
now if he sends them,

723
00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:18.180
<v 1>yeah,</v>

724
00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:23.180
<v 0>if Jake since Dave and Nina and weren't honestly if plow one sentence players</v>

725
00:44:27.781 --> 00:44:28.710
two and three.

726
00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:30.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

727
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.650
<v 0>Alright then</v>

728
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.690
<v 1>with what prevalency will they meet?
Okay.</v>

729
00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.900
<v 0>In what problems do you,
will they meet?</v>

730
00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:43.700
Well this is just a little math exercise that's kind of look at the game again.

731
00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:49.220
So Dave is playing two thirds.

732
00:44:49.910 --> 00:44:54.860
One third is that right?
And Nina is playing

733
00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:01.080
two thirds.
One third.

734
00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:03.690
All right.
It's not right.

735
00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:09.380
So the probability of that meeting is probably of this box.

736
00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:14.580
They could meet it Gaddis plus the property of this box.

737
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:16.920
They can meet at Spence.
Is that right?

738
00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:21.270
So the problem is that this box is one third times two thirds.

739
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.770
So this box has problems.

740
00:45:22.771 --> 00:45:27.771
The two ninths and the problem with this box is two third times one third.

741
00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:29.880
So this problems he had,

742
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:34.910
this box has probably two ninth so the problems that their meeting is two nine

743
00:45:35.451 --> 00:45:40.380
two plus two ninths that makes four nights,
right,
Evan.
Okay with that.
Alright.

744
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:41.303
So

745
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:46.710
if Jake sends Dave and Nina and they play this mix strategy agreed equal over

746
00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:51.730
him and then they meet with probable c two ninths plus two nights,

747
00:45:54.691 --> 00:45:59.691
two nights at gas to ninth expense for a total of four nights.

748
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:03.930
Right.
Which means they fail to meet.

749
00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:06.993
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

750
00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:09.310
<v 0>And hence fail to meet</v>

751
00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:14.180
with probability.

752
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:18.110
One of my meeting with 44 nine what must be the property that they are fading to

753
00:46:18.111 --> 00:46:20.540
me is five.
Nine thank you.

754
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.940
So they failed who it was probably five nights.
Alright,

755
00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:30.600
so Jake's expected payoff if he sends them.

756
00:46:30.601 --> 00:46:35.130
The value for Jake of this equilibrium is worse.
So the value,

757
00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:41.960
the value to Jake of this nash equilibrium if he sends them is four ninths times

758
00:46:50.281 --> 00:46:55.281
one plus five ninth times minus one for a total of minus ninth

759
00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:05.160
and we're okay with that.
Alright,
so if Jake sends them,

760
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:09.030
they fail to meet five months at the time and he gets minus one each of those

761
00:47:09.031 --> 00:47:12.060
times basic seed in meeting for ninth of the time,

762
00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:14.010
he gets plus one each of those times.

763
00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.750
So his expected payoff is expected value from sending Dave and Nina on the date

764
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:22.890
is minus and ninth.
All right.
So from Jake's point of view,

765
00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:25.350
what this game looks like,
if he thinks this is the,

766
00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:28.650
if he thinks that this is the nash equilibrium being played,

767
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:33.070
if he doesn't send you get zero.
And if you does,

768
00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:37.570
he get to the value of this nash equilibrium,

769
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:43.230
which in this case is minus one ninth so he's not going to send.

770
00:47:45.690 --> 00:47:48.640
All right.
And the SBA here is

771
00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:51.910
not sand

772
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:58.500
mix mix.
All right.
Where this where this is the Vegas.

773
00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:03.680
Alright,
so there's a 30 equilibrium here in which our match me,

774
00:48:03.681 --> 00:48:07.230
Kat says this hapless couple is just to hapless.

775
00:48:07.231 --> 00:48:08.950
They're going to play the mixed strategy equilibrium,

776
00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:12.340
in which case it isn't worth my while sending them on my date.

777
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:15.240
You guys were lucky because Jake shows the other week whenever it was,

778
00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.930
I figured you're playing the old agreement.
You could have him,

779
00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:19.480
which it turned out that you were all right,

780
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:23.910
so in this game there were three subgame perfect equilibria,

781
00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:27.430
one for each of the magic,
whatever in the sub game was.

782
00:48:27.431 --> 00:48:31.750
It turned out there was one in which Jake sent them and they coordinated on the

783
00:48:31.751 --> 00:48:33.850
pure strategy equilibrium in the game.

784
00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:38.800
S s there was one in which Jake sent them and they coordinated on the pure

785
00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:43.801
strategy needs to be clear from the sub game GG on this one in which Jake didn't

786
00:48:43.811 --> 00:48:47.110
send them,
but have you in fact send them?

787
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:51.970
They would have both mixed and hence for a lot of the time,
fail to coordinate.

788
00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:56.320
All right,
watch the big lesson here I,

789
00:48:56.370 --> 00:49:00.010
the big lesson of the first game we saw this morning was that subgame perfect

790
00:49:00.011 --> 00:49:03.970
equilibrium implies backward induction,
right?

791
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:05.410
The big lesson of this game,

792
00:49:05.411 --> 00:49:08.020
other than the fact that we're getting close to they're getting Dave and mean it

793
00:49:08.021 --> 00:49:08.854
on that date.

794
00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:13.860
The big lesson of this game is to show that the find subgame perfect equilibria.

795
00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:19.290
All you have to do is keep your head and sold out the Nash Equilibria in each of

796
00:49:20.141 --> 00:49:21.130
the sub games.

797
00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:26.140
Roll the payoffs back up and then look for behavior up the tree.
All right.

798
00:49:26.141 --> 00:49:26.770
Once again,

799
00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:30.830
you look for the national equilibrate and each of these sub games roll the pay

800
00:49:30.831 --> 00:49:34.930
off backup and then see how behavior is to what the optional moves are higher up

801
00:49:34.931 --> 00:49:39.190
the tree.
All right,
so we have time to do one more example.

802
00:49:40.100 --> 00:49:43.540
Alright.
And the third example I want to do is more of an application.

803
00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:51.750
All right?
So,
so far we've seen fairly simple examples.

804
00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:53.850
Now I want to do an application

805
00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:10.010
and the application I want to do is kind of a classic business school case if

806
00:50:10.011 --> 00:50:14.300
you like,
or mini case,
uh,
involving strategic investment.

807
00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:27.950
Um,
the game is this,
all of the setting is this,
there were phones,

808
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.780
we'll call them a and B,

809
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:33.860
and these two firms initially before we start considering the fork,

810
00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:35.340
before you start initially,
uh,

811
00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:37.970
considering what we're actually going to talk about initially,

812
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:42.080
they are playing corn.
Oh,
competition.
So two firms

813
00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.860
and that playing corno competition.

814
00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:52.390
How are we going to mention that they're producing fertilizer,
right?

815
00:50:52.391 --> 00:50:55.060
Imagine that that producing is that,
why is that?
All right?

816
00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.400
And let's be specific here.

817
00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:02.460
Let's assume that the prices in this market are given by the following demand

818
00:51:02.980 --> 00:51:06.490
curve.
Two minus one,

819
00:51:06.491 --> 00:51:11.491
third times Qa plus QB.

820
00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:17.590
Alright,
so this is the demand curve that they face.
All right?

821
00:51:17.591 --> 00:51:22.591
And we'll assume that costs marginal costs C is equal to a dollar a ton.

822
00:51:27.940 --> 00:51:29.230
<v 1>All right,</v>

823
00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:33.350
<v 0>so this is,
this is the,
this is the price in dollars per Tom Price.</v>

824
00:51:33.351 --> 00:51:37.660
Baton in dollars and the costs are a dollar per ton,
right?

825
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:38.631
I'm in a minute.

826
00:51:38.631 --> 00:51:41.660
What we're gonna do is we're going to consider a change in this game,

827
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:43.100
but before we do that,

828
00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:47.150
let's just remind ourselves what the corner equilibrium of this game would look

829
00:51:47.151 --> 00:51:51.030
like.
All right,
let's do a bit of a review.
It's a while since we've seen Cornell.

830
00:51:51.031 --> 00:51:53.960
It was,
that's remind ourselves,
so I claim,

831
00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:58.550
I claim that the quantity,
the core,
no quantity chosen,

832
00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:03.930
Q star has the formula a minus c over three beam.

833
00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:09.970
Is that right?
If you go back in your notes,
you'll find it.
So we,
we,

834
00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:12.710
and I'm not going to resolve it here.
We've done it many times.

835
00:52:12.711 --> 00:52:14.840
So a minus C minus three B.

836
00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:17.930
Trust me is what came out of our calculation before the midterm.

837
00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:21.260
And what I want to do is I just want to make sure we can translate that into

838
00:52:21.261 --> 00:52:23.390
numbers here.
It's all very well having a letters.

839
00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:27.620
But let's translate into numbers.
So in particular this a,

840
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:32.090
this a is this to that,
right?

841
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:37.390
This si is this one and this be is this third,

842
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:46.670
is that right?
So let's just put that down.

843
00:52:46.940 --> 00:52:48.500
So what this is in this case,

844
00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:53.680
this is two minus one over three times a third,

845
00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:59.570
right?
Two minus 100 times three minutes.
The third.

846
00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:03.700
So this says that the quantity is what this is.
This is,

847
00:53:03.701 --> 00:53:06.830
this is million tons.
So the quantity here,

848
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:11.660
the corner quantity is a million tons each,
right?
So one each.

849
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.510
So each and this equilibrium it,

850
00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:18.500
each of these two firms is producing a million tons of fertilizer.

851
00:53:19.170 --> 00:53:22.010
All right,
and what else do we know?

852
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:26.040
We know therefore what prices must be and it to do that before we even get

853
00:53:26.041 --> 00:53:26.850
started.

854
00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:31.850
So prices must be two minus a third times the quantity.

855
00:53:33.421 --> 00:53:37.290
That's the first phone producers plus the quantity that the second from

856
00:53:37.291 --> 00:53:40.740
producers.
So that's two minus two thirds.

857
00:53:41.310 --> 00:53:44.670
So that should be four thirds.
If I got that right,
or one and a third.

858
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:51.080
So prices here are $1 and 33 cents per time,

859
00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:55.920
alright?
And finally,
profits.

860
00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:02.840
So profit for each from here and this equilibrium before we even start the game.

861
00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.600
The more interesting part of the game,
profit is what?

862
00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:11.830
So they're going to get $1 and one third for every time they produce.

863
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:16.550
It's going to cost them $1 to produce each time.

864
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:21.650
And they're producing 1 million of these things.
All right?

865
00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:23.660
So their profits are

866
00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:31.100
to be a dollar sign here as well.
Their profits are,
or one third.

867
00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:35.740
If there's a millions and producing one third that there's that there's,

868
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:40.390
or that their profits are one third of $1 million.
All right?
All right?

869
00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.250
So this is their prepared profit,
right?
In each period they're doing this,

870
00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:47.770
each year they're doing this and this is that profits in each period.
I,

871
00:54:48.010 --> 00:54:51.140
this is the simple model we've done many times before.
This is core know,

872
00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:56.200
and now we're going to make it more interesting.
Well,
everything.

873
00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:59.660
If the Algebra here,
it was a bit quick,
don't worry about it,
check it at home.

874
00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:02.930
It's very,
it's just basic,
basic Algebra.
All right.

875
00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:07.760
So now suppose that you are the manager of from a

876
00:55:09.350 --> 00:55:11.450
classic understated classic business school case.

877
00:55:11.451 --> 00:55:14.110
I'm looking at my business school students in there.
In the balcony,
right?

878
00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:19.120
You're the manager of May and you have to choose whether to uh,

879
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:24.110
accepts a,
an offer to rent a new machine.

880
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:28.430
I went to this new machine has two features,

881
00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:32.783
<v 1>okay?</v>

882
00:55:33.370 --> 00:55:35.400
<v 0>Right?
The first,
well,
three features.</v>

883
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:40.430
The first feature is it only works Faye to this machine is being offered to you.

884
00:55:43.171 --> 00:55:47.580
It wouldn't fit in to from bees technology.
So this is only being offered for a,

885
00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:53.570
the second feature of this machine is it costs point $7 million in rental.

886
00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:02.220
So each year you rent this machine,
you'd have to pay point $7 million,

887
00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:05.880
all right?
But that's not so bad news.

888
00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:09.280
The good news is it will lower

889
00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:16.800
costs to 50 cents a ton.

890
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:19.230
<v 1>Okay?</v>

891
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:22.120
<v 0>All right,
so plot classic business school situation.
You're the manager of,</v>

892
00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:25.450
you're involved in competition with another firm B,

893
00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:29.470
and suddenly an opportunity comes along to rent some new technology.

894
00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:33.220
It's going to cost you 0.7 a year to rent this machine.

895
00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:37.820
But it will lower your costs by 50 cents a ton.
All right?

896
00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:42.310
This is a classic thing that you might be asked in your interview for Morgan

897
00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:44.230
Stanley next week.
How many of you were interviewing with investment banks?

898
00:56:44.231 --> 00:56:47.470
There's no one's going to admit it in a couple of years when you're in bed,

899
00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:50.030
when you're interviewing with them,
with these guys.
All right,

900
00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:52.120
so what's the obvious question?
The obvious question is,

901
00:56:52.330 --> 00:56:57.330
should you go ahead and rent this new technology or not?

902
00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:58.840
Should you rent this

903
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:59.783
<v 1>or not</v>

904
00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:04.110
to rent or not as a rent

905
00:57:07.350 --> 00:57:11.320
to rent an alternate?
Less dramatic than it.

906
00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:14.490
It's a coolant question to the English class,
but important nevertheless.

907
00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:19.950
All right,
is board is stuck.
Unfortunately,
I don't have to rate that a bit more.

908
00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:25.800
There we go.
All right?
So what I want to do

909
00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:29.410
<v 0>is I want to analyze this three times,</v>

910
00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:33.940
and each time I analyze it,
I want us to see what I'm doing,

911
00:57:34.450 --> 00:57:37.420
what mistakes I'm making.
Because I want you guys,

912
00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:41.380
when you interview with Morgan Stanley about this kind of thing to impress them

913
00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:44.290
so that they tell us we will come to Yale and preferably give lots of money to

914
00:57:44.291 --> 00:57:48.130
Gail.
All right?
So we're gonna look at this way three different times.

915
00:57:48.550 --> 00:57:50.200
And the first thing we're going to do,

916
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:53.890
the first one we're gonna look at this is look at it as if we were accountants.

917
00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:00.250
We're going to look at the accountants answer to this question.

918
00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:03.130
And some of you may decide you don't want to integrate with Morgan Stanley or

919
00:58:03.131 --> 00:58:05.840
Mckinsey.
You might want to interview her for some,
uh,

920
00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:10.300
some accounting firm when you leave Yale,
God forbid,
but you might.

921
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.990
All right,

922
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:14.110
so let's have a look at how the accountants would answer this question.

923
00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:18.400
All right?
So I think the accountants would do this.
They would say,

924
00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:25.330
but before we do this,
that's of a poll.
How many people think you should rent?

925
00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.590
You've got to time to think about it now.

926
00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:28.870
So how many people think you should rent the new machine?

927
00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:30.490
<v 1>Okay.</v>

928
00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:32.400
<v 0>I don't even think you should not run the new machine.</v>

929
00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:33.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

930
00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.770
<v 0>Oh No,
I'm not gonna lie to extensions.
Yeah,
let's try it again.
All right.</v>

931
00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:37.770
Without no extensions,
right?
You've got to defend it.

932
00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:40.900
You come out of Spain and the interview.
All right,
so you're on the spot.

933
00:58:40.901 --> 00:58:42.580
You're in the board room.
All right.

934
00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:44.650
How many think you should rent the new machine?

935
00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:45.990
<v 1>Okay,</v>

936
00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:47.520
<v 0>raise your hands.
Waved them in the air.</v>

937
00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:51.980
How many things are not rent the new machine?
All right,

938
00:58:51.981 --> 00:58:55.280
so we're split kind of in the middle.
I'm looking at my MBA students,

939
00:58:55.281 --> 00:58:59.630
see which they voted?
Which you guys both rent,
rent,
or not vote rent.
Okay.

940
00:58:59.850 --> 00:59:04.060
NBA think rents will see if that's right.
All right,
so it's move forward.

941
00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:06.170
All right,
so accounting accountants aren't set,

942
00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:08.660
so I think what the counter is going to say is this.

943
00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:14.390
They're going to say Purdue right now,
you're producing a million tons a year.

944
00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:21.070
All right.
The new machine saves you a yes,
but that's said to put per annum.

945
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:24.770
Let's try,
let's try and be fancy here and million tons per annum.

946
00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:30.500
The new machine saves you 50 cents.

947
00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:32.663
<v 1>Hi Tom.</v>

948
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:38.910
<v 0>So if you rent this new machine,
you're producing a million tons a year,</v>

949
00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:43.530
it's going to save you 50 cents a ton,
so it's going to save you

950
00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:50.870
1 million a year in variable costs.

951
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:53.303
<v 1>Okay.</v>

952
00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:56.390
<v 0>Right,
and those people do in one 15 or one 50 no one.
I mean,</v>

953
00:59:56.391 --> 00:59:57.590
my variable cost is the cost.

954
00:59:57.591 --> 01:00:01.190
You're going to save it in actual production of your fertilizer.

955
01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.400
So it saves you half a million a year.

956
01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:09.500
Right?
Unfortunately,
it costs you

957
01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:15.840
<v 1>cost of machine,
which is a fixed cost.</v>

958
01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:20.760
There's a fixed cost of

959
01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.940
<v 0>point 7 million a year.</v>

960
01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:29.310
I 0.7 is bigger than 0.5 so you should not rent.

961
01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:34.993
<v 1>Okay.</v>

962
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:36.240
<v 0>All right,</v>

963
01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:41.240
so 0.5 is less than 0.7 so don't rent the machine.

964
01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.270
All right.
How many of you said no,
this is kind of,
that was that,

965
01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:46.360
that's kind of the back of the envelope calculation you were doing,

966
01:00:46.361 --> 01:00:47.194
is that right?

967
01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:50.520
I'm just going to back of an envelope calculation that accountants do.

968
01:00:52.110 --> 01:00:53.490
So what's going on here?
And I,

969
01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.700
business school student up in the balcony says you should rent.

970
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:57.930
He took accounting.

971
01:00:57.931 --> 01:01:00.060
I know he did that cause you have to accounting at business school.

972
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:04.560
So what's wrong did,
did,
did,
did he fail accounting or if this answer wrong,

973
01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.880
the answers wrong.
All right?

974
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:09.900
There's two things you need to know about accountants.

975
01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:15.680
One is that they're usually boring and the other is that they're often wrong,

976
01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:20.460
right there more often boring than wrong,
but that they're almost always boring,

977
01:01:20.461 --> 01:01:23.610
but all right,
so this is this.
The answer is kind of boring,
right?

978
01:01:23.611 --> 01:01:27.570
And it happens also to be wrong.
Why is it wrong?

979
01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:32.580
It's wrong because we made an assumption here.
That's not a good assumption.

980
01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:37.350
We made the assumption that you're going to go on producing

981
01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:43.910
the same amount per year or after you've invested in the new machine that lowers

982
01:01:44.321 --> 01:01:47.520
marginal costs as you are producing beforehand.

983
01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:52.980
All right?
All right.
We made the assumption that it would lower your,

984
01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:57.750
we know it lowers your cost and we assumed implicitly you'd go on producing a

985
01:01:57.750 --> 01:02:00.140
million tons a year,
but that's not rights.

986
01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.550
So let's try and have a more sophisticated answer.

987
01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:06.100
And if you want to be more sophisticated and less boring than accounts saying

988
01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.140
what class would you want to take?
An economics?
Probably.
Right?
All right,

989
01:02:10.141 --> 01:02:14.160
so let's look at an economic saucer.
It took an economics one 15 I'm sorry,

990
01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:18.930
how many of you have taken economics?

991
01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:22.740
15 how many you didn't want to at one 15 at the moment?

992
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.930
Quite a few.
Okay,
so let's have a look at an economic salsa.

993
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:30.540
Let's see why that previous answer was wrong.

994
01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:36.750
So here is Qa and here is

995
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:43.770
cost of a dollar.
You're new.
Costs will be 50 cents.

996
01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:48.990
All right,
I'm putting prices and costs on this access.
Alright?

997
01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:53.250
And here is your residual demand curve.

998
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.880
This is the demand curve you face after the other guy has finished producing.

999
01:02:56.881 --> 01:03:01.290
So this is your residual demand curve.

1000
01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:05.100
It's the demand curve on that part of the market you're supplying.
Well,

1001
01:03:05.101 --> 01:03:07.980
not being supplied by the other side of the market and to figure out your

1002
01:03:07.981 --> 01:03:10.440
optimal quantity on your residual demand curve,

1003
01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:12.390
what you should do it like you're,

1004
01:03:12.391 --> 01:03:16.200
you're a monopolist on this residual demand curve.
So you should set what?

1005
01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:18.790
<v 1>Yes.
And again,
Chad.</v>

1006
01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.030
<v 0>Yeah,
if the answer isn't backward induction,</v>

1007
01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:25.220
it's probably marginal revenue equals marginal costs,
right?
So let's try the hat.

1008
01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:28.570
So,
uh,
here's the marginal revenue curve,

1009
01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:33.040
right?
Roughly speaking,
it should be twice as steep.

1010
01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:38.310
This is residual marginal revenue.

1011
01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:42.160
All right?
And here's what you used to produce,
right?
So we know what this is.

1012
01:03:42.970 --> 01:03:47.350
This was a million tons when this was marginal revenue hitting marginal costs.

1013
01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:52.510
Now your costs have gone down.
So gnosis that your quantity,

1014
01:03:52.511 --> 01:03:55.060
your new quantity has gone up,

1015
01:03:56.950 --> 01:04:00.910
your new contract has gone up because you've slid down the marginal revenue

1016
01:04:00.911 --> 01:04:05.560
curve as the marginal cost curve dropped that clear to everybody.

1017
01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:07.293
All right,

1018
01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:11.050
so this is the kind of picture that you probably saw a lot of in one 15.

1019
01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:14.410
Is that right?
Or in one 50 for that matter?
Is that correct?

1020
01:04:14.740 --> 01:04:18.310
So notice in this picture we can actually see the accountants aren't,

1021
01:04:18.311 --> 01:04:21.670
are the boring old.
Say the boring answer is this rectangle,

1022
01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:28.670
<v 1>right?
This rectangle,
this is the accounting answer.</v>

1023
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.520
<v 0>This rectangle is 0.5 times one.</v>

1024
01:04:37.820 --> 01:04:38.990
So it comes out as a half.

1025
01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:41.830
And there's that to think that we're the accountants answer.

1026
01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:44.510
And what did they miss?
What are they?
Accountants mess.

1027
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:48.070
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1028
01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:50.290
<v 0>they missed the triangle,
right?
They missed the triangle.</v>

1029
01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:53.770
They missed this triangle.
So I,
I told you they were boring.

1030
01:04:53.771 --> 01:04:57.760
They're a little bit square,
so they tend to miss triangles.
All right?

1031
01:04:57.850 --> 01:05:02.590
So here's the triangle that they missed.
All right?
Did we miss this triangle?

1032
01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:06.423
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1033
01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:10.590
<v 0>All right.
And how big is this triangle?
What we could do it at home.</v>

1034
01:05:10.591 --> 01:05:13.800
It's half base times height.
All right?
So we could figure this out.

1035
01:05:13.801 --> 01:05:17.440
We know the slope of this line.
We know the slope of this line is a third.

1036
01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:20.290
We or the slope of this line is two thirds.

1037
01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:25.570
We know that the height of this triangle is a half.
Uh,
we know,
uh,
we,
we,
uh,

1038
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.520
we,
we could figure out what the width is as well.

1039
01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:32.410
Therefore we can do half base times height.
Turns out that this has area.

1040
01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1041
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:38.400
<v 0>Uh,
I did this at home,
so let me just write it down.
Uh,</v>

1042
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:43.290
it has area three-sixteenths.
Alright,
so again,
everyone,

1043
01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:45.760
everyone could figure out the area of a triangle at home.
Is that right?

1044
01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:49.180
You all know that from your probably in junior high school geometry.

1045
01:05:49.181 --> 01:05:51.080
So as soon as I did it correctly at home,

1046
01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:56.300
this is three 16 which is approximately 0.19 right?
It's,

1047
01:05:56.330 --> 01:06:01.300
we missed this 0.19.
You missed this 0.19.
All right,

1048
01:06:01.301 --> 01:06:05.280
so how are we doing now?
So we know from the accounting arm,
sir,

1049
01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:08.920
we had a hall in savings.

1050
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:12.240
We know from the economics aren't sir,

1051
01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:15.730
that we should add another 0.19 to this.

1052
01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:20.790
That's the triangle for a total of 8.69

1053
01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:22.570
<v 1>yeah.</v>

1054
01:06:22.570 --> 01:06:27.160
<v 0>But unfortunately this is still less than 0.7,</v>

1055
01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:31.480
which is the cost of the machine,
the prime cost of the machine.

1056
01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:34.450
So it looks like we should still not rent.

1057
01:06:39.260 --> 01:06:42.890
So even after taking economics one 15 which is a good thing to do and is much

1058
01:06:42.891 --> 01:06:44.180
less boring than accounting,

1059
01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:46.850
and we'll get you the accounting officer or anywhere.
If you do things carefully,

1060
01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:49.250
we still end up concluding you shouldn't rent.

1061
01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:53.510
But all guy from the business school said you should wrench,
right?

1062
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:57.680
So did he feel economics is what I was accounting or is this answer wrong?

1063
01:06:58.810 --> 01:07:02.240
There's also still wrong.
This owns just still wrong.

1064
01:07:04.810 --> 01:07:09.460
<v 1>Oh,
okay.
All right,</v>

1065
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.073
here we go.

1066
01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:14.980
<v 0>We've got board is broken.
All right,
this answer's still wrong.</v>

1067
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:23.210
Didn't really want to delete that.
That's a shame.
Well done now.

1068
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:29.150
All right,
you've all gotten his number somewhere.
I have that in my notes.

1069
01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.960
There's almost,
this is still wrong.
We need to get the writer on the side.

1070
01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:42.640
All right?
So what we need is a third down side,

1071
01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:45.000
which is the game theory.
I'm sir,

1072
01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:51.820
which is also known as the right answer.

1073
01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.130
<v 1>All
right,</v>

1074
01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:02.610
<v 0>what are we missing?
What's wrong with the economics?
Answer somebody.</v>

1075
01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:07.170
What's wrong?
Everyone knew was wrong.
Why is it wrong?
It looked pretty good.

1076
01:08:07.171 --> 01:08:10.320
What's wrong with it?
What's wrong with it?
And says it's bounced down here,

1077
01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.050
but something in the front row will help me.
Why is this,

1078
01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:16.880
what did I do wrong from the also changes it's quantity.

1079
01:08:17.250 --> 01:08:20.540
We assumed in the accounting onset,

1080
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:25.130
we assumed that from a captain's quantity fix that we kept up on to fix and that

1081
01:08:25.131 --> 01:08:29.720
was wrong.
But in addition from B is going to change it's quantity,

1082
01:08:29.721 --> 01:08:32.470
isn't it from B is going to change it's quantity.
Let's have it.

1083
01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:37.070
Let's remind ourselves why we're still playing corner competition.

1084
01:08:38.840 --> 01:08:43.610
Here's our corn.
Oh,
diagram with Qa and QB.

1085
01:08:44.270 --> 01:08:47.180
So prior to making this investment,

1086
01:08:47.690 --> 01:08:51.050
the model is symmetric.
Here it is,

1087
01:08:51.290 --> 01:08:56.290
and this is the old best response of a,

1088
01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:02.000
and this is the best response of I'm be

1089
01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.020
all right.
And what we've learned,

1090
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:09.170
what we learned just now in the economic song,
sir,

1091
01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:14.050
is what we learned that from a,
as its costs go down,

1092
01:09:14.051 --> 01:09:18.830
it will produce more for each possible content that from a beat,
you produced it.

1093
01:09:18.831 --> 01:09:23.831
So regardless of what generated this residual demand curve,

1094
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:27.800
as the costs go down for,
for me,

1095
01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:32.390
it increases it's quantity.
All right?
So we'll know that.
We know that.

1096
01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:33.950
So what's that telling us?

1097
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:39.010
It's telling us that the new best response of Fermi is shifted

1098
01:09:43.110 --> 01:09:43.943
to the rice.

1099
01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:51.750
This is the new best response from a,
it shifts to the right now,

1100
01:09:51.751 --> 01:09:56.650
but it's just more for any given quantity that from be producers.
Alright,

1101
01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:01.200
so Qa has gone up.
That was our economics onsite.

1102
01:10:04.230 --> 01:10:06.740
<v 1>All
right?</v>

1103
01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:09.980
<v 0>But that leads from B to do what?</v>

1104
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:13.460
To produce last.

1105
01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:17.660
That leads to be producing less.
And it was just,

1106
01:10:17.661 --> 01:10:22.661
we slid down from bes best response line from the old equilibrium to the new

1107
01:10:25.281 --> 01:10:30.281
equilibrium and at the new equilibrium from bees production has gone down.

1108
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:33.980
By the way.
What kind of game?
What kind of game is it?

1109
01:10:33.981 --> 01:10:38.780
Where as from a increases its strategy from be decreases it strategy and

1110
01:10:38.781 --> 01:10:41.240
response.
Strategic substitutes.
Right?

1111
01:10:41.241 --> 01:10:45.890
So because this is a game of strategic Starbucks,
it's use strategic substitutes.

1112
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:47.833
<v 1>Okay,</v>

1113
01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.380
<v 0>good interview word,
right.
Good word,
dimension.
An interview.</v>

1114
01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:54.360
Because this is a game of strategic substitutes.

1115
01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:58.410
We know that from B reduces its quantity as from B,

1116
01:10:58.411 --> 01:11:02.440
it reduces its quantity.
Is that good for a or bad for a,

1117
01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:05.970
it's good for right,
right.
This is good for a,

1118
01:11:09.810 --> 01:11:13.570
this is good.
Full from,
hey,

1119
01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:16.380
it's softened its competition.
I it softens competition.

1120
01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:18.503
<v 1>Right,</v>

1121
01:11:18.610 --> 01:11:23.020
<v 0>and as a consequence it leads to the increase in profit.
Again,
we could,</v>

1122
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:24.640
we don't have time today,

1123
01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:29.700
but we could do is we could go back and we could recalculate the new core.

1124
01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:32.980
No equilibrium.
Right?
We could calculate this.

1125
01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:37.800
We could,
there's a homework exercise.
Try it.

1126
01:11:38.330 --> 01:11:42.840
How your lights,
the new

1127
01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:48.510
Nash Equilibrium and notice this is a nash equilibrium in a sub game.

1128
01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:51.270
All right.
Why is this a sub game?

1129
01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:56.390
Because from a made its decision whether to buy this new machine or not and then

1130
01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:02.520
they played corner.
Those are the core.
No game.
The game up here.
What is this?

1131
01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:06.940
This is the sub game.
All right.

1132
01:12:06.941 --> 01:12:09.970
This is the diagram of the sub game.
If you're like right,

1133
01:12:09.980 --> 01:12:12.380
what is the best response?
The best response isn't the side gate.

1134
01:12:18.310 --> 01:12:22.180
So what [inaudible] tells us to do here is first of all,

1135
01:12:22.210 --> 01:12:26.080
we'll count the new equilibrium in the sub game workout.

1136
01:12:26.170 --> 01:12:29.560
How much that new Collibra is worth for from a,

1137
01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:34.330
and then roll it back to the investment decision.
Right?

1138
01:12:34.331 --> 01:12:38.650
It turns out it turns out when we do that,
we get an extra

1139
01:12:40.510 --> 01:12:43.030
0.3 $1 million.

1140
01:12:44.730 --> 01:12:45.563
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1141
01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:50.430
<v 0>All right,
so we can do it at home.
We get an extra 0.3 $1 million,</v>

1142
01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:54.810
so it turns out that our MBA student was right.
Good.
All right.

1143
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:59.870
It turns out that you add this 0.31 to the 0.69 we had already,

1144
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:04.470
we get one,
which of course is much bigger

1145
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:11.090
than 0.7 and indeed you should rent the machine.

1146
01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:13.840
<v 1>All right.</v>

1147
01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.490
<v 0>Now I want you to have to take away lessons from this game.</v>

1148
01:13:19.450 --> 01:13:23.890
The first takeaway lesson is this.
When you're analyzing a game like this,

1149
01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.440
be it in the real world or in a job interview,

1150
01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:31.080
the first thing you want to do is what you want to look at the sub game.

1151
01:13:31.081 --> 01:13:36.081
You want to look what would happen if you did invest and so loud the knew Nash

1152
01:13:36.971 --> 01:13:39.100
equilibrium in that sub game.

1153
01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:45.110
Then you want to roll back the value of that sub,

1154
01:13:45.111 --> 01:13:47.740
game it back into the initial decision,

1155
01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:50.400
which is the strategic investment decision whether to buy this,

1156
01:13:50.690 --> 01:13:53.610
whether to rent this machine or not.
All right?
So schematically,

1157
01:13:53.611 --> 01:13:55.630
massively the game looks like this,

1158
01:13:57.410 --> 01:13:59.720
rent or not rent.

1159
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:05.290
And in either case,
you play core,
no,

1160
01:14:08.670 --> 01:14:13.660
there's a sub game in each case.
In this case,
you play symmetric core.
No.

1161
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.300
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1162
01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:19.850
<v 0>When you both have the same costs,
and here you play asymmetric corn,
okay,</v>

1163
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:24.110
well you have different costs.

1164
01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:27.830
And the way we analyze this game is we've sold out the symmetric corner.

1165
01:14:27.831 --> 01:14:29.240
We actually did that up front.

1166
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:33.370
We now sold out the new equilibrium and this asymmetric Cornell game,

1167
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:36.830
this one here,
right?
This is the old one.

1168
01:14:38.170 --> 01:14:42.740
This is the new one.
Solve it out.
Work out how much profit you're going to get,

1169
01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.090
and roll that back.

1170
01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.140
Remembering that it costs 2.7 million to make this step.

1171
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:50.420
So that's the first takeaway lesson.

1172
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:52.970
But the second takeaway lesson is more general.

1173
01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:55.970
So let me just pause and get everyone to wake up again.
So I make it.

1174
01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:58.940
The second amendment takeaway lesson is this.

1175
01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:04.790
What tips the bands here from the economics answer and the accounting answer.

1176
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.550
What are the strategic affects?

1177
01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:13.180
It was the strategic effects.
This was a strategic effects,

1178
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:14.343
<v 1>okay?</v>

1179
01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:25.240
<v 0>It was the effect of the other firm or other players changing their behavior and</v>

1180
01:15:26.421 --> 01:15:31.421
the most common mistake to make when you're thinking about strategic decisions

1181
01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:34.640
is what?
It's to forget that they're strategic.

1182
01:15:34.970 --> 01:15:39.200
It's to forget that the other players are going to change their behavior.

1183
01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:40.610
In this example,

1184
01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:45.760
the other firm cuts back its production so much as to make that investment

1185
01:15:45.951 --> 01:15:50.240
profitable,
but let me give you two other examples.
Example.
Number one,

1186
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:55.510
you're designing a tax policy for the u s the dumb way to analyze this is to

1187
01:15:57.021 --> 01:16:00.230
say,
look at what people are doing now.

1188
01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:05.000
Push through the new tax numbers and act like an accountant and crunch out how

1189
01:16:05.001 --> 01:16:08.480
much money the government's going to make,
right?
Why is that wrong?

1190
01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:12.170
Because you're forgetting that as you change the tax code,

1191
01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:16.940
people's behavior changes,
incentives change,
and people's behavior change.

1192
01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:19.460
It leads to a mistake in designing the tax code.

1193
01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:23.990
You need to take into account strategic effects,
how behavior changes.

1194
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:29.180
Example number two,
closer to home,
you're designing a new curriculum for Yale.

1195
01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:34.100
So you change the rules of the curriculum and when analyzing it,
you say,

1196
01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:35.721
I wouldn't say this,

1197
01:16:35.721 --> 01:16:39.020
but some people on our committee might say this under these new rules,

1198
01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:42.020
if we look at what people used to do,
they will know,

1199
01:16:42.021 --> 01:16:44.900
do more of this and less of that,
and they'll learn this and learn that.

1200
01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:46.063
What are you missing?

1201
01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:51.520
You're missing that students are players and students change their behavior as

1202
01:16:51.951 --> 01:16:55.040
you change the curriculum rules.
All right,
so the,

1203
01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:59.030
the biggest lesson of today's pastor is don't be like an accountant,

1204
01:16:59.330 --> 01:17:00.830
partly because it's boring and you won't get,

1205
01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:04.640
you won't go on your dates and partly because you'll miss out on these important

1206
01:17:04.641 --> 01:17:08.030
strategic effects.
We'll come back and look at it more on Wednesday.
