WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.220
So last time we introduced a new idea and the new idea was that of best response

2
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.990
and that was what was the idea.

3
00:00:08.991 --> 00:00:13.460
The idea was that I think to think of a strategy that is the best you can do

4
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.700
given your belief about what the other people are doing,

5
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:18.620
what your opponents are doing,
what other players are doing.

6
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.990
And you could think of this as,

7
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.310
you can think of this belief as the belief that rationalizes that choice.

8
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.690
So if you have a boss,

9
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.860
you might want it a he or she is going to ask you why you chose the action.

10
00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:34.670
You did a,
if you took,
if you look at best response to some belief,
you can say,

11
00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:38.060
I took this action because I believed other people are going to do this.

12
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.280
And since that was the best you could do under that belief,

13
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.680
that will hopefully keep your job.
All right.

14
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:48.500
And I promised that today we would look at the most important game in the world

15
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.510
and as announced last time,
the most important game is the penalty kick game.

16
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.500
So this is a game that occurs in soccer.

17
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.850
And just to give it an idea of how important it is for those people who are

18
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.570
unfortunate enough not to be soccer fans here.
Uh,

19
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.990
the last World Cup was decided on penalty kicks.

20
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.880
In England's case,
uh,

21
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:17.370
England goes out of every single world cup and every single European competition

22
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:22.220
because it loses on penalty kicks usually to Germany.
It has to be said,
um,

23
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.900
and uh,
more minerally.
Uh,
this weekend,
uh,
it was all of your thinking,

24
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:28.250
the most important event in the world,

25
00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:30.860
but was whatever was happening in Congress to do with Iraq.

26
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.180
Actually the most important event in the world was taking place in England where

27
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.160
my favorite team,
Portsmouth,
we're playing Chi,
the head ta,
his favorite team,

28
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.850
Liverpool.
Uh,
and uh,

29
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.220
about a third of the way through that game there was a penalty and I'll let you

30
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:49.100
know what happened later.
So keep in the back of your mind.
That's

31
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.930
the real world example that matters here is Portsmouth versus Liverpool this

32
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.360
weekend.
Uh,
Chi.
The head ta is Scandinavian,

33
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.590
so I've got no idea why he supported Liverpool anyway,

34
00:02:03.591 --> 00:02:06.730
but I think maybe he spelled it like this and something had to smash.

35
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.080
<v 1>All right,</v>

36
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.520
<v 0>so what we're going to do is we're going to look at some numbers,</v>

37
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.930
but approximately,
uh,

38
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.220
approximately the problems is just scoring when you kick the penalty kick in

39
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:21.840
different directions.
But just make sure everyone,

40
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.030
do I need to explain what's going on here.
I mean,

41
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.590
does it everyone familiar with the situation?

42
00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:28.110
There's one guy who's going to run up and kick the ball,

43
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.260
the goalkeepers sending and the goal and the aim is to kick it into the goal.

44
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.380
Is that that,
that's fair enough.
You've all seen this,
right?

45
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.300
If you haven't seen this,
go see it and he's come on.
This is all right.

46
00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:44.190
So things you should do in life.
And I read Shakespeare and cs soccer game.
Okay,

47
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:49.170
so the rough numbers for this are as follows?
No,
actually they turned on the car.

48
00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:51.990
So I'll give you some more accurate numbers,
but this will do for now.

49
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.170
There are three ways.
The goal,
the attacker could kick the ball,

50
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.360
he could kick the ball to the left,
the middle or the right.

51
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:03.570
And I shouldn't just say here,
here,
of course.
I mean,
all right,

52
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.840
this is [inaudible],
but if I get that wrong going on,
please forgive me for it.

53
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.460
And the goalie,
the goalie can dive to the left or the right in principle,

54
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:13.480
that gold,
he could stand in the middle.

55
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:16.090
We'll come back and talk about that later.
All right,

56
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:18.040
so this is the guy who was shooting

57
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.880
a shooter and this is the goalie.

58
00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.580
And these are roughly,
uh,
well let me let,
let me put that up,

59
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.700
the payoffs for this game and I explain them.
So you'll notice,

60
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.680
but I'm just going to take,

61
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.990
put in numbers here and then the negative of the number.

62
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.483
<v 1>Okay.</v>

63
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.560
<v 0>And the numbers are roughly like this for mine is forced numbers four minus</v>

64
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:45.101
four,

65
00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:50.101
nine minus nine six nine six six one six nine minus nine and four minus four.

66
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.290
And the idea here is that the number four represents 40% chance of scoring.

67
00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.060
If you shoot the bull to the left of the goal and the goalkeeper dives to the

68
00:04:01.061 --> 00:04:05.350
left.
All right?
So the payoff here is something like,
uh,
you,

69
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:07.540
one of left,

70
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.100
if the goalkeeper dives to the left is equal to four,
by which I mean

71
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.910
there's a 40% chance of scoring.

72
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.720
All right?
So the,

73
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.990
the number for the shit that the payoff for the shooter is his property of

74
00:04:23.991 --> 00:04:26.060
scoring and the payoff for the goalkeepers.

75
00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:30.460
Just the negative of that just to keep like,
keep things simple.
Okay?
Now,

76
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.940
as I said before,
for now,

77
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
we'll ignore the possibility that the goalkeeper could stay budget.

78
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.310
Alright,
so how should we start analyzing this important game?

79
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.630
Why don't we start with the idea as we learnt already several weeks ago now,

80
00:04:44.631 --> 00:04:48.080
or more than a week ago,
which is the idea of dominant strategies.

81
00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.410
Does either player here have a dominated strategy that's either plan to have a

82
00:04:53.571 --> 00:04:54.500
domination strategy?

83
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.190
<v 1>Okay,</v>

84
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.590
<v 0>no,
it's kind of clear that they don't,
uh,</v>

85
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.880
let's just look at the shooter for example.
So you might think that maybe,

86
00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.860
uh,
um,
maybe middle dominates left,
but notice,

87
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.390
uh,
that uh,
uh,
uh,
the,

88
00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.400
the middle middle has a higher pay off against left for shooting for the left

89
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.640
than she did the left.
It has a lower pay off if the,
uh,

90
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.360
if the goalie dives to the white matter,
not surprisingly in this game,

91
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.600
it turns out that if the goalie dives to the left,

92
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.050
you're best off shooting to the right second best officers into the middle and

93
00:05:28.051 --> 00:05:31.020
worst off shooting to the left.
And if the,
if that's a good to go today,

94
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.250
it's the left go the right your best,
best off shootings at the left.
Second.

95
00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:38.250
Best off,
shouldn't the metal and worst off a shooting with the right.

96
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.030
And that's kind of common sense.
Okay.
Okay.
So if we,

97
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:46.240
if we had stopped the class after the first week,
we're,

98
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:50.260
all we learned to do was to lit,
was to delete dominated strategies.

99
00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.560
We'd be stuck.
We'd have nothing to say about this game.
And as I said before,

100
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:56.320
this is the most important game.
So that would be,
that would be bad.

101
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.680
That'd be bad news for game theory,

102
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.270
but luckily we can do a little bit better than hat.
Before I do that,

103
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:05.710
let's just take a poll of the class.
How many of you,
if you were,

104
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.540
if you were playing for,
I guess it's going to be America,

105
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.330
which is a sad thing to start with.
Never mind.

106
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.590
You guys are playing for America and you're,

107
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.600
you know you're taking this penalty kick and it's the,

108
00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:18.620
it's the last kick in the World Cup.
How many of you,
show of hands,

109
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.900
how many of you would shoot to the left

110
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.050
and how many of you would just shoot to the metal?

111
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.333
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

112
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.930
<v 0>And how many of you would shoot to the rights?
We've got kind of an even split.</v>

113
00:06:31.931 --> 00:06:34.870
They're pretty much an even split.
All right.
And what,
assuming again,

114
00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:37.840
we're going to assume these are the correct numbers and we're going to see if

115
00:06:37.841 --> 00:06:41.830
that even split is really a good idea or not.
Alright,

116
00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.200
so how should we go about thinking about this?

117
00:06:44.201 --> 00:06:46.780
What I suggest we do is we do what we did last time

118
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.260
and we started to draw

119
00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.850
a picture to figure out what my expected payoff is.

120
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:57.860
Depending on want,

121
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.630
I believe the goal is going to do so this is the same kind of picture we drew

122
00:07:01.631 --> 00:07:06.250
last time.
So on the horizontal axis,

123
00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:07.300
this is my belief

124
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.200
am I believe is essentially the probability that the goalie dives to the right.

125
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.550
I know I did last time.

126
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.790
Let me put in two axes to make the picture and we'll easier to draw.

127
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.490
So this is zero and this is one and you probably have lions in your notes,

128
00:07:25.491 --> 00:07:29.180
but I don't.
So let me just to help myself a bit.
So this is two,
four,

129
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.990
<v 2>six,
eight 10.</v>

130
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.090
So this is going to be two,
four,
six,
eight,

131
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.860
10 and over here.
Two,
four,

132
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.740
six,
eight,
ten two,

133
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:52.960
four,
six,
eight,
10.
This would be the basis of my picture.

134
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:54.111
<v 0>All right.</v>

135
00:07:54.111 --> 00:07:59.000
So does it start with the possibility of shooting to the left?

136
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:03.560
All right,
let's do this.
Uh,
in,
uh,
red.
All right,

137
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:08.561
so I shoot to the left and the goalie dives to the left.

138
00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:14.300
My payoff is what?
All right,
it's,
it's,

139
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.480
it's for all right.
If I,

140
00:08:16.481 --> 00:08:19.180
if I issue to left and there's this and there's no problems here,

141
00:08:19.181 --> 00:08:21.920
the goalie dive in to the right,
which means that they dive to the left then,

142
00:08:21.921 --> 00:08:25.720
then,
then my payoff is for meeting.
I score 40% of the time.

143
00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.850
All right?
If I shoot to the left and the goalie dives to the right,

144
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:35.830
then I score 90% of the time.
So my payoff is 0.9 by the way,

145
00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:38.140
why is it 90% of the time and not 100% of the time?

146
00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.020
I could miss,
I could miss.
Okay.
I could miss that happens rather often.

147
00:08:45.021 --> 00:08:48.050
It turns out,
well,
10% of the time.
All right,
so,

148
00:08:48.051 --> 00:08:50.270
and we know this is going to be a straight line in between.

149
00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.750
<v 2>So let's put this line then.
All right,
so watch,</v>

150
00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.850
it's the expected

151
00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:02.060
<v 0>payoff to play or one of shooting to the left as it depends on the,</v>

152
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.140
see the fast,
the goalkeeper dives to the right.

153
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:12.820
All right.
And conversely we can put in,
well,

154
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.240
let's do this.
Assume in order,
so middle.

155
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.290
So if I shoot to the middle and the goalkeeper dives to the left,

156
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:24.300
then my payoff is points six is it six or I score 0.6 at the time?

157
00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.540
And if I shoot a shoot in the middle and the golden goes to the right,

158
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.930
it's still,
I still see a score 60% of the time.

159
00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.340
So I once again,
it's a spray straight line in between.

160
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.640
So this line represents the expected payoff of shooting to the middle as a

161
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:44.490
function of the problem.
See?
But the goalkeeper dives to the right.

162
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.823
<v 1>All right.</v>

163
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:52.100
<v 0>And finally do it in green.
Let's look at the pay offs.
Expected payoffs.</v>

164
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.360
If I shoot to the right,

165
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.630
so if I shoot to the rights and the goal today is to the left,

166
00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.400
then I score with probability 0.9 or a payoff is nine.

167
00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:05.480
Conversely,
if I shoot to the right and uh,
he or she dives to the right,

168
00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:10.670
then I score 40% of the time.
So here's my pay off 0.4 and

169
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.770
here's my green line.
Representing my expected payoff

170
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:24.050
as the shooter from shooting to the right as a function of the problems that the

171
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:27.120
goalie dives to the right.
All right.

172
00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:28.630
Did everyone understand how I can start to this picture?

173
00:10:28.631 --> 00:10:31.020
It's actually easier picture than the one we constructed last time.

174
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.263
<v 1>All right,</v>

175
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.090
<v 0>so what does anyone notice from this picture?</v>

176
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.940
What's the first thing that jumps out at you from this?

177
00:10:39.941 --> 00:10:44.200
But assuming these numbers are true,
what jumps out at you at this picture?

178
00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.060
I think we get some,
some mics up here.
So,
uh,
uh,
can we get this guy?

179
00:10:49.061 --> 00:10:50.740
But it was stand up first.
The guy in red,

180
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:57.300
what's your name?
It looked at the hold.
The Mike.
Just a shout.
Oh,
Steven.
And um,

181
00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:01.600
there's no point at which the six shooting it,
the middle is,

182
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:04.870
gives a higher expected payoff and exactly.
Exactly.

183
00:11:04.871 --> 00:11:09.670
So the thing that I hope jumps out to get this picture is this.
No,
no.

184
00:11:09.671 --> 00:11:12.490
Great guesses.
We're figuring out this is a half.
So if the,

185
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.660
if the problems are that the goal is going to jump to the right is less than the

186
00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.590
half,
then the best you can do is represented by this Green Line,

187
00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.400
which is shoot to the right.
All right,

188
00:11:24.401 --> 00:11:26.920
so the gold is going to shoot to the right and with the property less than a

189
00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.140
half,
she's gonna dive for the right to protest to the half.

190
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.900
You should shoot to the right.
And conversely,

191
00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.690
if you think the gold is going to shoot to the right with property more than a

192
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.640
half than the best you can do as represented by the pink line and that shoot

193
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:38.750
into the laughter.

194
00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.440
If you think the goal is going to die for the right withholding more than a
half,

195
00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.700
the best you can do,
your best response is to shoot to the institute,
to the left,

196
00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and there is no belief there's nobody you could possibly hold given these

197
00:11:51.011 --> 00:11:56.011
numbers in this game that could ever rationalize shooting the ball to the metal.

198
00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.970
<v 2>Is that right?
Is that right?
All right,
so no 10 all the way.</v>

199
00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:04.550
Middle is not

200
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:09.560
a best response to any

201
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:16.220
belief.
I can hold about the goalkeeper,
but anybody.
All right,

202
00:12:16.221 --> 00:12:17.750
so there's a lesson here.

203
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.830
<v 0>I just put you on.
I'm going to do it.
Just a Mick lesson.
Resonant Games.
Again,</v>

204
00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.770
imagine that you are in the World Cup.
You're playing for England.
All right?

205
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:30.210
You have to justify your actions,
not only of your teammates,
uh,

206
00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.850
bots to your and your manager and your boss,

207
00:12:32.851 --> 00:12:37.080
but to about 60 million rather angry fans.
All right.

208
00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.370
And what's the lesson here?

209
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:39.813
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

210
00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.430
<v 0>Oh,
hoping it was going to be obvious.
What's the lesson here?</v>

211
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:46.083
<v 1>Okay,</v>

212
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:53.050
<v 2>the last one is,
all right,
lastly,</v>

213
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:58.650
do not shoot to the middle.

214
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.510
All right?

215
00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.780
<v 0>Do you not shoot to the metal?
Let me qualify that lessen slightly</v>

216
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.860
<v 2>unless you're German.
Alright,</v>

217
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:18.850
Jim is going to do whatever they like.
Alright.
Alright.

218
00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:23.920
<v 0>No,
it turns out that about a third of the game,
uh,
between my team,</v>

219
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.260
Portsmouth and case Tim Liverpool this weekend,
uh,

220
00:13:27.261 --> 00:13:29.160
there was a panel teapots without a panel fee.

221
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.010
And the guy who's gonna take the penalty came up to get the penalty and he

222
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:37.360
kicked it to the middle and it was saved.
All right,
so just confirming this,

223
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:40.570
these actions,
uh,
not only does that spoil my weekend,

224
00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.600
but it also spoiled my opportunity to make fun of Kyle Week.

225
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.220
So it was really a big deal.
All right,

226
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.540
so this weekend a penalty was missed exactly by somebody's ignoring this rule.

227
00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:54.130
All right?
There's a more general lesson here and the more general lesson is,

228
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.053
of course,

229
00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:00.070
do not choose a strategy that is never a best response to anything you could

230
00:14:00.071 --> 00:14:03.880
believe,
right?
The more general lesson,
do not choose a strategy.

231
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:11.680
<v 2>Do not choose a strategy.</v>

232
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:19.660
Vat is never
a best response

233
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.310
to any
belief.

234
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:25.550
<v 0>I notice here to submit,</v>

235
00:14:25.551 --> 00:14:27.440
just to underline something just came up at the end last time.

236
00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.720
That doesn't mean beliefs of the form.

237
00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.720
The goal is going to die of laughter or the goal is going to dive right?

238
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.680
It means all provost is in between.
All right?
So we're allowing you to,

239
00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:37.281
for example,

240
00:14:37.281 --> 00:14:41.000
to hold the belief that it's equally likely that the goalie dives left or diets,

241
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:41.843
right?

242
00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:42.720
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

243
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.570
<v 0>All right?
But if there's no belief that could possibly justify it,</v>

244
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.350
don't do it and underline what arises in this game.

245
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:54.470
Notice that in this game we're able to eliminate one of the strategies.

246
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.930
In this case,
the strategy of shooting into the middle,

247
00:14:57.170 --> 00:15:00.500
even though nothing was dominated.
All right,

248
00:15:00.501 --> 00:15:03.950
so when would of domination and deleted dominated strategies?

249
00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.120
We've got no way here.

250
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.240
Here at least we've got somewhere we got rid of the idea of students in the

251
00:15:08.241 --> 00:15:08.630
middle.

252
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.450
Now if you could just persuade the English and Portsmouth soccer players at this

253
00:15:11.451 --> 00:15:15.940
lesson,
I'd be very happy.
All right,
before we leave and I,

254
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:17.510
I've been making a point in this class,

255
00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.670
I've coming back to reality from time to time.

256
00:15:19.671 --> 00:15:23.540
So this is a very simple model of the soccer game in reality.

257
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.660
And let's just try it.
Any of you on the a Yale soccer team?

258
00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.513
<v 1>No.</v>

259
00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.460
<v 0>How did you play soccer for your college?
Well,
let's see if I took of course.</v>

260
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.230
And have you ever played like how many of you have ever played soccer?
Oh,
okay,

261
00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.020
good.
Okay.
I was going,
I was getting worried there for a second.
All right.

262
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.020
So one thing we said last time was when we,
when we,

263
00:15:42.021 --> 00:15:44.270
when we put up a modal and try and draw lessons from it,

264
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:49.370
we should just take a step back and say,
what's missing here?
What's missing here?

265
00:15:49.371 --> 00:15:50.640
So let's try and get some kind of deal.

266
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.350
I'll come off the stage and make it easier for Jude.
What's,
what's missing here?

267
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.710
What's missing in this model of this piece of soccer,
this game within a game.

268
00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:00.080
What's missing here?
Why is,

269
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.930
why is this not necessarily a hundred percent accurate models?

270
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:06.260
I'll need some mics up here.
Mark,
can you,

271
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:09.830
you have to really shock cause you're miles from the mic that you might be

272
00:16:09.831 --> 00:16:12.830
better at kicking to the left or to the right depending on whether you're right

273
00:16:12.831 --> 00:16:14.900
handed or left handed.
Good.
Good.

274
00:16:14.901 --> 00:16:19.760
So one thing that's clearly missing here is I'm ignoring that.
In fact,

275
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.960
right footed players find it easier to shoot to that left,

276
00:16:23.961 --> 00:16:25.010
which is actually the goal is right.

277
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.270
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

278
00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:31.200
<v 0>All right.
So right for the players find it easier to shoot,
to,
uh,
to,
uh,
to,</v>

279
00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:35.580
to the left is spacing.
We should have crossed the goal.
Right?
Is that true?

280
00:16:35.581 --> 00:16:38.310
Everyone confirm that's true.
Yeah.
I want to,
his driver tried to do this.

281
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.130
It's a little easier to hit the ball hard to the,

282
00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.220
to the opposite side from the fiber Jeff,
which is your foot.
And that's,

283
00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.260
that's the same principle in baseball.

284
00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:49.800
It's a little bit easier to pull the ball hard than it is to hit the ball to the

285
00:16:49.801 --> 00:16:52.730
opposite field.
All right.
Uh,
yes.
Uh,

286
00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:55.210
<v 1>okay.</v>

287
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.660
<v 0>Players don't make their decision before and didn't just stick with it</v>

288
00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:02.650
necessarily.
All right,
so play as I'm making a decision as that running up.

289
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.450
I think that's okay here,
right?
We can,

290
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.900
we can think of this as the decision happening at the instant to which you

291
00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:08.860
kicked.
All right?

292
00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:12.320
So your rights that you could have made a decision back in the locker room or

293
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:15.670
you could have made the decision that halftime,
but the ultimate ultimately what?

294
00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:17.670
Wow.
I'll definitely,
what matters.

295
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:25.190
We're getting that off there,
so,
okay.
It's hope that goes away.

296
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:32.780
We're sure it's off my mic
just in case.
I'll move my mic a bit lower.

297
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:35.030
Alright.
So I'm going to,

298
00:17:35.031 --> 00:17:37.940
I'm going to shout louder cause my mic is now a now lower.

299
00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.030
It doesn't really matter exactly when the decision is made.
Right.

300
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.750
At the end of the day,
the goalie doesn't know the decision of the,

301
00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:47.030
of the shooter and the,
she doesn't know the decision of the goalie.

302
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.740
So it's as if that that decision made instantaneously as the,

303
00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:51.870
as the shooter was running up.

304
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.870
<v 2>All right,
what else?
What else?</v>

305
00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:59.470
<v 0>Yeah.
Can we get this taken?
You can I get this guy here that stand up,
stand up</v>

306
00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:03.550
shutout.
The goalie might stay in the middle.

307
00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.950
The goatee might stand in the middle.
That's a good point.
And of course I've,

308
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:09.490
I've extracted from that here.
Uh,
and in fact we'll come back.

309
00:18:09.491 --> 00:18:11.950
I think I'll try and put that onto our problem set.
But I think you're right.

310
00:18:11.951 --> 00:18:15.820
It is a,
it is a,
it is an issue.
Here is an issue here.
Uh,
anything else?

311
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.740
What did we put up?
Some real numbers and we'll see you have it.
Uh,

312
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.310
how much the corresponds to what we've got here.

313
00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.673
<v 2>Okay.</v>

314
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:31.470
<v 0>So I gave you some numbers I made up actually a long time ago.
But since,</v>

315
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.240
since I've been using this game in class,

316
00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:38.220
somebody went out and checked and it turns out that ignoring middle for a
second,

317
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.650
ignoring metal.
So these are real numbers

318
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.520
and these numbers come from a paper in the ar by Kia Pori and some coauthors.

319
00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:54.120
And for the,
uh,
everyone at Yale,
I'll make that paper available to,
uh,

320
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.100
through j daughter through the,
through the air library.

321
00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.480
So you can go look at it if you like.

322
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.380
And what they worked out was the following,

323
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:07.040
the following table,
uh,
and uh,
again,
uh,

324
00:19:07.050 --> 00:19:08.430
it will be a little bit careful here.

325
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:12.450
So I'm going to put the left and right and inverted commerce here because

326
00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:17.930
actually what they did was they corrected for people's natural direction and not

327
00:19:18.121 --> 00:19:20.920
natural direction.
So the idea here is,
uh,

328
00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:24.750
shooting to the left if your rate footage is the natural direction.

329
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:28.140
So left here means the natural direction.
Of course,
if your left foot,

330
00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:30.600
it goes the other way,
but they've corrected for that.
All right.

331
00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:35.040
And it turns out that the problems is of scoring here are as follows,

332
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:41.480
63.6 94.4 89.3 and 43.7 all right.

333
00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.540
To things are not,
and I haven't given you the numbers for the metal,

334
00:19:51.541 --> 00:19:55.500
but so you can see that whoever it was who said you're slightly better off,

335
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.940
you score with slightly higher prevalence is when you kicked your natural side

336
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.781
is exactly right.

337
00:20:00.781 --> 00:20:03.360
I think are things belong dominated and we could still have done exactly the

338
00:20:03.361 --> 00:20:06.480
same analysis and actually,
see I'm not,
I'm not very far off,
uh,

339
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.420
in the numbers I made up.
All right?
But things are not perfectly symmetric.

340
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.520
All right?
I forget who it was who said that,
but that's,
uh,
that,
that,
that,

341
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.370
that doesn't have to be true.
All right.
Uh,

342
00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.740
certainly the garlic staying pushes an issue or as I,

343
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.370
we'll deal with that on the problem set.
But there's another issue here.

344
00:20:20.371 --> 00:20:24.270
Let me just raise one more issue.
One more issue is you haven't,

345
00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.780
you have another decision when you run up to hit this hit the penalty other than

346
00:20:27.781 --> 00:20:30.240
just left and right.
So when he's played the game,

347
00:20:30.241 --> 00:20:34.380
what's the other decision you really faced?
The w taking to get the woman here?

348
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.360
Other decision you face

349
00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.400
up to the top corner and the lower you could kick up and down.
That's true.

350
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.880
That's true actually.
That's true.
But I,
I mentally out if that's right,

351
00:20:44.881 --> 00:20:49.720
but that makes me a house.
What else is the,
um,

352
00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:54.710
uh,
the striped,
try this guy here.
Spin.
Well,

353
00:20:54.730 --> 00:20:57.970
that's getting subtle.
That's getting stuff done.
So much more basic thing.

354
00:20:57.971 --> 00:21:02.320
What's a more basic thing?
What's a more basic thing here?
Uh,

355
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.800
they're gonna get there right in front of you.
Yep.
Speed.
Speed.
Right?

356
00:21:05.801 --> 00:21:08.710
So another decision you face is do you just try and hit,

357
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:13.300
kick this ball as hard as you can or do you try and place it all right?

358
00:21:13.301 --> 00:21:17.050
That's probably,
uh,
that's probably as important to decision as placing it as,
as,

359
00:21:17.051 --> 00:21:21.010
as deciding which,
which direction to head.
And it turns out to matter.
So,

360
00:21:21.011 --> 00:21:23.920
for example,
if you're the kind of person which is,

361
00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:25.870
I have to say all I ever was all kinds of,

362
00:21:25.871 --> 00:21:29.140
if I'm the kind of person who can kick the ball fairly hard but not very

363
00:21:29.141 --> 00:21:33.540
accurately,
right,
then it actually might change these numbers.
All right?

364
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.010
If you can hit the ball very hard but not very accurately,

365
00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:38.350
then if you try and shoot to the left or right,

366
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.410
you're slightly more likely to mess.
On the other hand,

367
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.540
as you shoot in the middle until hitting the ball hard,

368
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.690
you're slightly more likely to score.
Now,

369
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:48.370
if these all seems like arcane and irrelevant detail,

370
00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.110
let's just see why this matters in the picture

371
00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:58.020
and then we'll leave soccer at least for the day.
All right,
so if I,

372
00:21:58.021 --> 00:22:01.320
if you're the kind of person who can kick the ball hard but not accurately,

373
00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:06.620
then it's going to lower the prices of scoring as you kick towards the the

374
00:22:08.071 --> 00:22:13.071
rights because you might miss and it's going to lower the probability of scoring

375
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:18.390
as you hit towards the left because you're like to the mess and it might

376
00:22:18.391 --> 00:22:22.620
actually raise the privacy of your scoring as you hit towards the middle because

377
00:22:22.621 --> 00:22:25.430
you get the ball so hard,
it's really pretty hard for the goalkeeper to stop it.

378
00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.680
All right,
and here's the air,
it goes in the middle.

379
00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:32.040
If you look carefully there didn't really make it clear enough.

380
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.180
You can see suddenly suddenly our strategy that looks crazy shooting for the

381
00:22:36.181 --> 00:22:40.470
middle of a sudden they started to seem okay.
All right.

382
00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.400
It turns out there's dotted lines.
There's an error in the middle,

383
00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:48.300
just the area between here and here and this little area here.

384
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:53.550
You actually might be just fine shoot into the metal.
All right.
So in reality,

385
00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.413
in reality,

386
00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.660
we need to take into account a little bit more and in particular we need to take

387
00:22:57.661 --> 00:23:01.560
into account their bonuses of players to hit the ball at currently and or hard.

388
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.100
And if those people,
if you're interested in that,
and I wrote us this one,

389
00:23:05.101 --> 00:23:07.350
I probably lost the interest of most Americans in the room,

390
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.600
but for the non Americans or the Roman people who are interested in the real

391
00:23:09.601 --> 00:23:12.270
world,
um,
that,
uh,
I,
I as I said before,

392
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.020
I'll put that article online and that goes through all the gory detail of this.

393
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.130
All right.
I'm not sure,
just say the dates are,
I just gave you is real data,

394
00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.190
but it's actually a mixed ability data.

395
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:27.390
This data comes half from the Italian league,
which is pretty good.

396
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.390
And half from the French league,
which socks?
So yeah,

397
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.700
so who knows how much we should trust it.
All right.
Okay.

398
00:23:35.701 --> 00:23:39.600
So that was our example of the day and our first brush with Ralph's d for the

399
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.433
day,

400
00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.010
let's clean board and do some

401
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.850
<v 2>work.
Do some,
a bit more formal stuff.
Yeah.
So here we have,
uh,
an example,</v>

402
00:23:49.851 --> 00:23:53.660
but I want to go back to the generality and a bit of formulas.
Oh,
by the way,

403
00:23:53.661 --> 00:23:57.050
I should tell you that the game ended nil nil or zero?
Zero.
Yeah.
Not yet.

404
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:05.260
It's a moral victory for me,
I think.
All right,

405
00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:10.480
<v 0>so I want to be formal about these things I've been mentioning informally and in</v>

406
00:24:10.481 --> 00:24:15.481
particular I want to be formal about the definition of a of best response.

407
00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.580
And I'm gonna put down two different definitions of best response,

408
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.600
one of which corresponds to best response to somebody else playing a particular

409
00:24:22.601 --> 00:24:25.850
strategy like left and right.
And the other,
which is going to correspond to the,

410
00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:29.650
to the more general idea of a best response to a belief.
All right.

411
00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:30.401
And I'll do it.

412
00:24:30.401 --> 00:24:33.430
It will allow us to use on a rotation and just be a little bit more nerdy.

413
00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.570
So player eyes strategy.

414
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:41.683
<v 2>Okay.</v>

415
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:47.110
<v 0>Plant ISCM strategy s I hat get a hat.</v>

416
00:24:47.511 --> 00:24:51.140
It just a single it out is a best response.

417
00:24:51.141 --> 00:24:54.940
Always abbreviated br two.

418
00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:01.190
That's strategy s minus sy.

419
00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.070
Oh,
the other players.

420
00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:11.150
<v 2>Okay.
All the players.
If,</v>

421
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.490
<v 0>and here's our real excuse to use Australia annotation.</v>

422
00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:20.790
If the payoff from player I from choosing s ihat against s minus sy is weekly

423
00:25:24.551 --> 00:25:26.080
bigger van,

424
00:25:26.081 --> 00:25:31.081
her payoff from choosing some other strategy s prime against s minus PSI.

425
00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:38.060
And this better hold for all es I prime available to play high.

426
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:44.050
All right,
so in previous,
uh,
definitions,

427
00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.710
we've seen the qualifier for all beyond the other player strategy here.

428
00:25:47.711 --> 00:25:50.500
The qualifier for all is on my strategy.
All right,

429
00:25:50.501 --> 00:25:53.530
so a strategy hat has the best response to this strategy.

430
00:25:53.531 --> 00:25:55.960
S I s minus I of the other players.

431
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:59.750
If my payoff from choosing essay hat against desk minor,

432
00:25:59.751 --> 00:26:04.500
sy is weekly bigger than that from choosing s I prime,
uh,

433
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:05.260
against that I,

434
00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:09.580
I at Osi and this better hold for all possible other strategies I could choose.

435
00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:12.100
And there's another way of writing that that's kind of useful

436
00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:13.960
<v 2>or equivalentlys</v>

437
00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.780
I hat souls the falling,

438
00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.040
it maximizes my payoff.

439
00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:28.070
Okay.
Just mine.

440
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.640
<v 0>I'm hoping everyone is used to seeing the term Max [inaudible] salt of the</v>

441
00:26:34.641 --> 00:26:35.750
maximization problem.

442
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:40.480
How do I maximize my payoff given that other people are choosing?
S minus.

443
00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.610
All right?
And again,
for the math,
the Roman don't panic.

444
00:26:44.611 --> 00:26:48.390
This is just writing down in words what we've already seen a couple of times

445
00:26:48.391 --> 00:26:49.020
already today.

446
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:53.550
Well today and last time it's generalized this definition a little bit since we

447
00:26:53.551 --> 00:26:55.920
wanted to allow for more general beliefs.

448
00:26:56.070 --> 00:27:01.070
So rewriting plat eyes strategy.

449
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:07.820
Same thing as I hat is a best response,

450
00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:13.500
but now let's be careful.
The best response to the belief

451
00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:19.210
<v 2>PE about</v>

452
00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:23.860
<v 0>the other players</v>

453
00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.003
choices.

454
00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:33.541
Hey,

455
00:27:33.541 --> 00:27:36.930
finish look remarkably similar except now I'm going to have expectation if the

456
00:27:36.931 --> 00:27:38.100
expected payoff,

457
00:27:38.101 --> 00:27:43.101
the player I from choosing Sei has given that she holds this belief p is bigger

458
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.630
than her expected payoff

459
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:56.230
from choosing any other strategy
given.

460
00:27:56.231 --> 00:27:58.900
She holds this belief p and this better hold

461
00:27:59.690 --> 00:28:04.330
<v 2>for all as I prime that she could choose.</v>

462
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:05.530
<v 0>All right?</v>

463
00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:09.060
It's a very similar idea and the only thing is I'm slightly abusing notation

464
00:28:09.061 --> 00:28:13.140
here by saying that my payoff depends on my strategy and a belief.

465
00:28:13.141 --> 00:28:16.620
But what I really mean is make expected path as the expectation given this

466
00:28:16.621 --> 00:28:21.060
belief.
All right?
And once again,
we can write it the other way.

467
00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.870
Or S I hat

468
00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:27.660
solves

469
00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:34.970
Max and I choose SSI to maximize my expected pay off this time

470
00:28:37.150 --> 00:28:40.560
<v 2>from choosing sai against.
Nice.
My last line.</v>

471
00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.620
<v 0>And what do I mean by expected pay off?
Just in our example,</v>

472
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.790
I just make clear with that expectation means.
So for example,

473
00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:59.690
the expected payoff to player one and the game above from choosing

474
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:09.230
left given she holds the belief p is equal to the probability that the

475
00:29:11.431 --> 00:29:16.431
goalkeeper as to the left times play ones payoff from choosing left against

476
00:29:18.391 --> 00:29:23.340
left,
plus the probability that the goalkeeper dives to the right

477
00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:30.120
times play a one to expected payoff from choosing left against.
Right.

478
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:34.410
Okay.
So expectation which recipe just means exactly what you expect it to me.

479
00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.830
All right,
so this is a little bit of math over the formality.

480
00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.940
Is everyone okay with that?
I haven't,
I haven't a thing here.

481
00:29:41.941 --> 00:29:43.870
I was on his right down slightly.

482
00:29:43.871 --> 00:29:48.400
Boringly a nerdily exactly what we already saw in a couple of occasions.

483
00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.093
<v 1>Okay.</v>

484
00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:03.350
<v 0>Ah,
thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Bye.</v>

485
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:05.783
<v 1>Thank you.</v>

486
00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:09.983
<v 0>All right,</v>

487
00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:14.760
so that right now he's going to seem a little bit like sudden blast of of

488
00:30:14.761 --> 00:30:16.110
notation.
So let's,

489
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.930
let's just remind us that what we really care about is the idea.

490
00:30:18.931 --> 00:30:23.370
It's not an invitation and let's spend the next half hour applying these ideas

491
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.270
to an application.
This application is not as in as important as soccer,

492
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:31.170
but it's a bit more economic seat so I can justify it under the economics title

493
00:30:31.171 --> 00:30:32.004
of the class.

494
00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:37.933
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

495
00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.090
<v 0>All right.
It's a clearing off my soccer game.</v>

496
00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:48.923
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

497
00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.630
<v 0>So imagine we're going to look at it as a game involving a partnership</v>

498
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.870
partnership game.

499
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.970
And I believe this game is covered in some detail in the Watson textbook or

500
00:31:07.971 --> 00:31:12.380
something very close to it is if you,
if you're having trouble,
the idea is this,

501
00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:17.560
there are two individuals who are going to supply an input to a joint project.

502
00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.990
So that could be a firm,
it could be a law firm for example,

503
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:24.680
and they're going to share equally in the profits.
All right?

504
00:31:24.681 --> 00:31:28.160
So one example would be a firm that they both earn.
They both betrayed,

505
00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.053
they both own.

506
00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:34.280
And another example would be two of you working as a study group on my homework

507
00:31:34.281 --> 00:31:36.890
assignment.
All right?
All right,

508
00:31:36.891 --> 00:31:39.080
so you're going to share equally in the profits of this,

509
00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:41.540
of this firm or this joint projects,

510
00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:45.170
but you're going to supply efforts individually.
All right?

511
00:31:45.171 --> 00:31:46.430
So it's just be a bit more formal.

512
00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.510
So the players are going to be the two agents,

513
00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:55.370
two agents,
and they own this from,

514
00:31:55.371 --> 00:31:58.150
let's call it maybe over this from joint glee

515
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:05.110
and they split the profits so they share 50% of the profits.

516
00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:13.010
All.
Alright?
It's a profit sharing partnership

517
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:15.860
and each agent,

518
00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.990
each agent is going to choose

519
00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.470
her effort level,

520
00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:30.950
every level to put into this firm

521
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:39.590
to put into this room.
So it could be the other siding as a lawyer,

522
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:40.520
how many hours

523
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.570
<v 1>you're going to spend on the job.</v>

524
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.100
So for most of you is decisions will be question of whether you spend 20 hours a

525
00:32:46.101 --> 00:32:49.570
day at the firm or 21 hours a day at the firm,
something like that.

526
00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:50.850
But most of you on your homework assignments,

527
00:32:50.851 --> 00:32:53.960
I hoping it's a little less than that.
And not much less than that.
All right,

528
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:57.050
so the strategy choices,
we're not going to do it an hours.

529
00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:02.230
Let's just normalize and regard these choices has living in zero to four.

530
00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:05.283
All right?

531
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:10.220
<v 0>And you can choose any number of hours between zero and four.</v>

532
00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:16.330
All right,
and just to mention as we go past it and novelty here,

533
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:20.500
every game we've seen in the class so far has had a discreet number of

534
00:33:20.501 --> 00:33:25.000
strategies.
Even the game when you chose numbers,
you chose numbers.
One,
two,
three,

535
00:33:25.001 --> 00:33:29.920
four,
five,
up to 100 the 100 sandwiches.
Here,
there's a continuum of strategies.

536
00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:33.450
You could choose any real number in the intervals are four.

537
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:37.060
It's you have a continuum of possible choices.
That's not going to bother us,

538
00:33:37.061 --> 00:33:40.480
but let's just point out it's there.
So there's a continuum of strategist.

539
00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.710
In principle,
you could bill your clients for every,

540
00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.320
for fractions of a second or fractions of a minute.
All right?

541
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:58.170
I'm that's wonder what the firm's profit is given by.
So this,

542
00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:01.470
this partnership as law firm,
it's profit

543
00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.330
is given by the following expression

544
00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:13.400
four times the effort of player one plus the Abbot of player two plus a

545
00:34:16.801 --> 00:34:21.060
parameter called call B times the product of their efforts.

546
00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:26.560
All right?
This is that profits and I won't tell you what B is for now,

547
00:34:26.890 --> 00:34:28.940
but that's just,
I mean I won't tell you exactly what it is about.

548
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:30.190
I'll explain it what,

549
00:34:30.191 --> 00:34:35.050
assume that B lived between zero and a quarter.
Now it's known.

550
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:39.820
That's what about a variant later.
Alright,
so what's the idea here?

551
00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:43.420
The idea is playing one directly contributes,
uh,

552
00:34:43.450 --> 00:34:46.570
profits to the firm by working as does play a too,

553
00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.990
but they also contribute through this interaction term.

554
00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:51.950
How do we think of that interaction term?

555
00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:58.310
How do we think of that term be s one s two when you're working,

556
00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:02.030
when you're working on your homework assignments,
if you're,
if you're,

557
00:35:02.031 --> 00:35:07.031
if you're proactive and you hand in was just s one plus s two then you might

558
00:35:07.161 --> 00:35:10.010
think,
well,
you might think there's no point working in a study group at all,

559
00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:14.930
right?
If,
if the,
if the products is just uh,
the psalm or a multiple of us,

560
00:35:14.931 --> 00:35:18.950
some of the inputs,
there wouldn't be much work point working in a team at all.

561
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.940
It's the fact you're getting this extra benefit from working with someone else

562
00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:26.480
that makes it worthwhile working as a team to start with.
Is that right?

563
00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:30.560
So we could think of this term has to do with complimentarity

564
00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:34.110
complementarity

565
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:40.610
or synergy right word these days,
but still synergy and say,

566
00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.570
we're going to assume that when you work together there is something to do.

567
00:35:43.571 --> 00:35:45.330
Some of you are good at some parts of the homework,

568
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:48.360
some of them are good at other parts of the homework and still in this law firm,

569
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:52.680
one of these guys is an expert on intellectual property and the other one on

570
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:57.480
fraud isn't it?
All right.
So I've got the uh,

571
00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:02.580
agents,
I've got the strategy set,
I know something about the profit of the firm.

572
00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.240
I need to tell you about their payoffs.
All right to the payoffs.

573
00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:13.530
The payoff for player one is going to depend of course on her choice and on the

574
00:36:16.711 --> 00:36:18.390
choice of her partner.

575
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:23.670
And he's going to equal a half cause they're splitting the profits.

576
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:28.970
So a half of the profits are half of four times s one plus s two plus B,

577
00:36:31.291 --> 00:36:35.890
s one s two,
right?
He uh,

578
00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:39.060
she gets half of those profits,
but it also costs,

579
00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.980
it costs s one squad.

580
00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:49.350
So s one squared is her effort costs.
It's an input costs.

581
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:54.070
<v 2>This is the effort cost.</v>

582
00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.820
<v 0>All right?
And similarly,
play two.
Everything symmetric here.</v>

583
00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:02.210
Play a tos payoff is the same thing.

584
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:07.000
So this term is the same except we're going to subtract off the player two's

585
00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:10.720
athletes squared,
s s t squared.
All right.

586
00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:15.230
And you get the profits of the firm minus the district policy of having missed

587
00:37:15.231 --> 00:37:20.220
all last week.
There's a guy in the fifth row that he's missed too much sleep.

588
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:23.590
So somebody just nudge it.
That's it.
That's it.
Good.
Now what?

589
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.910
We will put him on camera.
Just nudge an attic it,
there you go.

590
00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:29.750
Next time we'll use the camera for that.

591
00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:31.820
<v 2>Okay.
All right.</v>

592
00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.313
<v 0>All right.</v>

593
00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:45.690
So we know we have everything we want to analyze this from and to analyze how

594
00:37:45.691 --> 00:37:49.050
things are going to work either when you're working on a homework assignments or

595
00:37:49.051 --> 00:37:52.650
in the law partnership.
And again,
just to make this relevant to you.

596
00:37:52.651 --> 00:37:54.420
I mean this is very stylized of course,

597
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:59.660
but a huge number of businesses out there are partnerships and do have this kind

598
00:37:59.761 --> 00:38:01.680
of profit sharing rule and do have some images.

599
00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.690
So this is a relevant issue in a lot of businesses.
All right,

600
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.270
now we're going to analyze this no secret here.

601
00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:13.500
We're going to analyze this using the idea of best response,
right?

602
00:38:13.501 --> 00:38:16.080
And it's no surprise to any of use and that's where we started the day.

603
00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:17.133
All right,

604
00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:22.160
so in particular I want to figure out what is play are ones best response to

605
00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:27.380
each possible choice of player to one,

606
00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:30.300
figure out what was probably one of the best response for east possible choice

607
00:38:30.301 --> 00:38:34.200
as to of player to how should I go about doing that?

608
00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:36.253
<v 2>How</v>

609
00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:37.183
<v 0>should I do that?</v>

610
00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:42.950
So here what we did before was we drew these graphs with propolis is at least

611
00:38:43.071 --> 00:38:46.130
with beliefs of player one.
And the problem here is a,

612
00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.190
previously we had only simple graph to draw because there were just two

613
00:38:49.191 --> 00:38:50.520
strategies for player to patch.

614
00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:53.830
It was a gold league or die for the left and the right problem is here that play

615
00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:57.560
player two has a continuum of strategies and trying to draw all possible

616
00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.000
policies over an infinite number of objects on the board is,

617
00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.550
is more than my drawing can do it too hard.

618
00:39:04.050 --> 00:39:05.210
I'm going to meet some other technique.

619
00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.600
How are we going to find out player one's best response?

620
00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.820
<v 2>Somebody
wave your hands on the APP</v>

621
00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:17.770
<v 0>way,
way,
way,
way back in the corner.
Can I,
uh,
can we,
yeah,
that's an account.</v>

622
00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:20.940
Let's get the mic.
Yeah.
Wait,
wait.
Stand up and wait for the mic to come see you.

623
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.060
How are we going to do it?

624
00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.610
How are we going to figure out what pie one's best responses?
Shout loudly.

625
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.170
You can on fund player ones.

626
00:39:32.171 --> 00:39:37.171
Payoffs as a function of player tos of what player to effort is good.

627
00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:42.520
Okay.
Okay.
So we've doubled that study.
The first step.
We've got that right,

628
00:39:42.521 --> 00:39:45.450
actually we've got that coheres.
Here's player ones.

629
00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:50.050
Pay Off as a function of what player to choose is an what payer one chooses.

630
00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:51.760
So we have that already.

631
00:39:51.761 --> 00:39:56.050
We have player ones pay off as a function of the two efforts and I want to find

632
00:39:56.051 --> 00:40:01.051
out what his player one's best efforts given a particular choice of s two.

633
00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:06.150
<v 2>Uh,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

634
00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:11.210
<v 0>Take the derivative with response to uh,
sorry.
Driven with s one.
Take one,</v>

635
00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:16.130
take a derivative and uh,
equals zero.
Oh,
okay.
Okay,
good.

636
00:40:16.131 --> 00:40:18.230
Good.
So we're going to use calculus,
right?

637
00:40:18.231 --> 00:40:20.890
We're going use calc because of one variable.
All right.
What does,

638
00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.540
what does changing one variable last one.
How many of you,
uh,

639
00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:28.340
we won't let the camera say,
how many of you have not?
No,

640
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.480
I don't getting show hands at all.

641
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:33.400
If you have not seen the cult person I'm about to use on the board or,

642
00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:38.390
or more likely,
if you've forgotten it since high school,
don't panic.
All right.

643
00:40:38.420 --> 00:40:40.100
There is a chapter in the back of the book,

644
00:40:40.101 --> 00:40:42.860
I think it's chapter 25 that goes over this.

645
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:46.670
It refreshes your memory of such calculus.
And if you haven't,

646
00:40:46.671 --> 00:40:49.400
if you've never seen it before,
if you know,
if you haven't taken,
for example,

647
00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.490
they call it of math one 12,
come and see us.

648
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.580
We'll probably try and line up a quick calculus lesson,

649
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:59.840
a special section for those people,
right?
So if,
if what I'm going to do now is,

650
00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:04.970
um,
scary,
come and see us and we'll deal with it.
All right,

651
00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:07.940
so,
all right,
what I'm going to do,
we want to,

652
00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.670
we want to take a derivative of this thing.
All right?

653
00:41:10.671 --> 00:41:14.030
We're going to do is we're going to what we're asking the question,

654
00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:19.340
what is the maximum choosing s one

655
00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:25.760
of this profit.
Can I multiply the half by the four to save myself some time?

656
00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
So I got the profit is to s one plus s two plus B s s two

657
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:40.280
minus x one squad,
right?
We're asking the question,

658
00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:46.090
what take your thinking as to has given what s one maximizes his expression.

659
00:41:47.050 --> 00:41:50.210
All right.
And as the gentleman at the back said,

660
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.540
I'm going to differentiate and I'm going to set the thing equal to zero.

661
00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:56.510
So I'm almost bound to get this wrong on the board or can you all watch me like

662
00:41:56.511 --> 00:41:59.880
a hawk?
A second.
All right.
So if a differentiate this objects,

663
00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:06.710
I differentiate,
I'm going to find a first order conditions in a second.

664
00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:11.300
All right?
So differentiate.
I'm going to have to still,

665
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:16.170
and then this s one is going to become a one.
All right?

666
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:21.190
And this s one here is going to come a plus B asked to and weren't happy with

667
00:42:24.021 --> 00:42:27.800
that.
And this s one squared,

668
00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:31.970
he's going to come a minus two s one.

669
00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:33.381
All right.

670
00:42:33.381 --> 00:42:35.990
That was differentiating and weren't happy with the way a differentiated.

671
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:40.280
Is this coming back from high school?
The coaches are spending now.
Yeah.

672
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.530
And to make this a first order condition,
I'm going to say at the best response,

673
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:49.490
but a hat over the one at the best response.
This is equal to zero.

674
00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:54.110
All right.
Yeah.
Uh,
taking to get the guy again.

675
00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:00.170
Oh,
sorry.
Nevermind.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
It's quite though,

676
00:43:00.171 --> 00:43:01.250
yet you'll write to turn it cause I'm very,

677
00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.770
I mean doing it on the board and bring light to make mistakes,
but okay,

678
00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:05.450
so I differentiated this objects.
This is,

679
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.510
this is my first rotation and I said equal to zero in a second.

680
00:43:08.511 --> 00:43:09.590
I'm going to work with that,

681
00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:12.770
but I want to make sure I'm going to find a maximum and not a minimum.

682
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:15.260
So how do I make sure I'm finding a maximum,
not a minimum.

683
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:20.870
I look at the second derivative,
right?
Look at the second derivative,

684
00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.910
which is the second order conditioning.

685
00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:26.270
So I'm gonna differentiate this object again with respect to s one but in the

686
00:43:26.271 --> 00:43:29.690
hat isn't verus seconds and none of this has an s one and it's that all goes

687
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:34.010
away and I'm going to get minus two right when it's too,

688
00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:37.460
which came from here minus two.
And that is in fact negative,

689
00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:39.830
which is what I wanted to know,
right?
To find a maximum.

690
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:44.900
I want the second derivative to be negative.
All right,
so here it is.

691
00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:46.880
I've got my first daughter condition.

692
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:52.510
It tells me that the best response to s two best response to s two is the s one

693
00:43:56.331 --> 00:44:00.740
has that solves this equation.
But souls this first order condition.

694
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:05.960
All right,
and we can just rewrite that.
If I divide through by two and rearrange,

695
00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:10.670
it's going to tell me that s one hats or if you like,

696
00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:13.070
that's what,

697
00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:18.070
that's one hat is equal to one plus B s two one plus ps two.

698
00:44:22.371 --> 00:44:27.250
So this thing is equal to play or one's best response given us too.

699
00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:30.950
All right,
now I could,

700
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:35.730
I could go through again and do exactly the same thing for player too,

701
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:38.630
but I'm not going to do that because it's everything symmetric.
Okay?

702
00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.740
Everyone happy with that?
So I could at the same,

703
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:45.330
I could do the same kind of analysis but we know I'll get the same answer.

704
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:50.720
So similarly I would find that s two hats equals one plus B s one

705
00:44:55.850 --> 00:45:00.850
and this is the best response of player too as it depends on player one's choice

706
00:45:01.161 --> 00:45:04.040
of effort.
S one okay,

707
00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:08.270
now I found out what player one's best responses to placet to play a two.

708
00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:10.000
And what play are twos but the best ones,

709
00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:13.570
the supplier one for each possible choice of player two up here and Vicki

710
00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.190
critical will to play player one down there.
All right.

711
00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:19.880
Now let's see if I can get a bit further and to get a bit further.

712
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:20.960
Let's draw a picture.

713
00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:32.771
All right.

714
00:45:32.771 --> 00:45:37.771
What I'm going to do is I want to draw the two functions we just found and see

715
00:45:38.291 --> 00:45:39.124
what they look like.

716
00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:43.513
<v 1>Okay?</v>

717
00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:47.870
<v 0>All right.
This is all in your notes already.
I can get rid of it.
Well,</v>

718
00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:50.480
I can do with it some more chocolate.
Okay.

719
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:56.303
<v 1>Excuse me.</v>

720
00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:01.400
<v 0>All right,
so we're going to do is let's try a picture that has</v>

721
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:08.540
s one on the horizontal access and s two on the vertical access.

722
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:14.490
All right,
and there were,
there are different choices here.
One,
two,

723
00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:16.320
three and four

724
00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:23.870
for player one.
Here's a 45 degree line.
I'm careful.
I should get this right.

725
00:46:23.871 --> 00:46:24.704
One,

726
00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.800
<v 1>two,
three</v>

727
00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:32.550
<v 0>for all the possible choices,</v>

728
00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:39.220
possible choices for player one.
Okay.
Now before I draw it,

729
00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:43.760
I better decide what B is going to be.
Okay,
so I'm going to draw for the case.

730
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:50.550
I'm going to draw the best response of player one and I want to draw the best of

731
00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.660
entrepreneur to in a minute for the case.

732
00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:55.253
<v 1>Okay?</v>

733
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:59.600
<v 0>B equals a quarter,
okay?</v>

734
00:46:59.601 --> 00:47:01.940
So we said B was somewhere between zero and a quarter.

735
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:05.270
That's draw the case for B equals a quarter.
All right?

736
00:47:05.271 --> 00:47:09.950
Until the expression I want to draw first of all is the best response of player

737
00:47:09.951 --> 00:47:14.951
one as a function of s two and we agreed that that was given by one plus a

738
00:47:15.531 --> 00:47:20.320
quarter.
Now one plus a quarter s t.

739
00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:23.870
All right,

740
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:28.500
so for each possible choice of s two I'm going to draw player ones.

741
00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.060
Best response,
I'm going to do it in,
right?

742
00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:35.050
So if player to choose is zero,

743
00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:40.180
if player to choose is zero,
what does player one's best response?

744
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.990
Let me shout out one.
Okay,
so one pass,

745
00:47:44.991 --> 00:47:47.860
a quarter of zero is one.

746
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:51.040
So pay a to choose a zero player.

747
00:47:51.041 --> 00:47:55.480
One's best response is to choose one.
Alright?

748
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:59.860
What if player,
why I play a two chooses for play.

749
00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:04.720
A two chooses for what will be player one's best response.

750
00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:10.060
All right,
so it'll be,
it'll be one plus a quarter times four.

751
00:48:10.061 --> 00:48:12.370
Quarter four is one to one plus one is two.

752
00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:17.610
So a player to as best response in that case will be to sort of pay one chooses

753
00:48:18.071 --> 00:48:18.904
for

754
00:48:21.370 --> 00:48:26.370
Blair to should choose I sorry Claire to choose is for play a one should choose

755
00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:31.180
to.
Right.
And this is a straight line in between.

756
00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:37.860
So the line I've just drawn is the best response for play and one as it depends

757
00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:42.340
on player to his choice.
Haven't happy with how I drew that.

758
00:48:42.341 --> 00:48:45.460
I mean I I I'm assuming you had to take it on faith and a straight lane in

759
00:48:45.461 --> 00:48:47.950
between.
We did.
It's all right.

760
00:48:48.070 --> 00:48:53.070
And the way we read this graph is you give me an s two I read across to the pink

761
00:48:53.291 --> 00:48:57.250
line and dropped down and that tells me the best response,
the player one.

762
00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:01.810
Okay.
And we can do the same for player too.

763
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:06.870
We can draw player two's best response as it depends on the choices of player

764
00:49:07.031 --> 00:49:09.310
one.
But rather than go through any math,

765
00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.320
I already know what that line's going to look like.

766
00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:15.970
What does that line look like?
So many raise your hands.
Somebody,
all the player,

767
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:20.230
what we'll pay a tos best response look like as a function of player one stress

768
00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:26.170
and the same picture.
Uh,
so we haven't had before all of these guys before.

769
00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:29.530
Someone else,
someone else.
Uh,
yeah,
there's a guy in the,
in the uh,
can,

770
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.650
can we get into him?
Oh yeah,
yeah.
Immunity,
diplomat status.
That's pretty right.

771
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.900
Shout out loud to the making heat reflection across 45 degrees.
Right,

772
00:49:37.901 --> 00:49:42.340
exactly.
So,
so if I drew,
if I,
if I drew the equivalent line for player too,

773
00:49:42.341 --> 00:49:45.390
which is play a tos best response for each choice to play a one,

774
00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:49.330
we're simply flipping the identities of the players,
which means we will,
we will,

775
00:49:49.331 --> 00:49:52.360
we reflecting everything in that 45 degree line.

776
00:49:52.361 --> 00:49:57.250
So it'll go from one here to,
to here.

777
00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:03.100
It'll look like this.
So this is the best response for player too,

778
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:06.670
for every possible choice of player one.
And just to make sure we understand it.

779
00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:11.080
What this Blue Line tells me is you give me an s one and effortless effort level

780
00:50:11.081 --> 00:50:14.470
of player one.
I read up to the Blue Line and go across,

781
00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:19.210
and that tells me player to best response,
okay,

782
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:20.650
now we're making some progress.

783
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:24.820
What do we notice when we stayed at one of the lessons of today's class?

784
00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:27.950
The second lesson,
the first lesson was don't shoot towards middle of the goal.

785
00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.700
And the second more general lesson was what it was.
Don't have a plan,

786
00:50:31.701 --> 00:50:36.230
a strategy that is not a best response to everything.
I mean,
I'm,

787
00:50:36.231 --> 00:50:39.950
I'm cheating a little bit here because I'm ignoring,
uh,
beliefs,
but trust me,

788
00:50:39.951 --> 00:50:42.530
that's okay in this game.
All right,

789
00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:47.300
so are the strategies here that are never a best response to anything?

790
00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:51.380
We'll stretch his head today,
but all the way,

791
00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:54.320
what stretches of player ones I ever best response

792
00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:00.870
<v 1>anybody?
Why does have a look?
All right.</v>

793
00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:05.150
<v 0>If player to choose is zero,
then play a one's best response is one,</v>

794
00:51:05.151 --> 00:51:08.450
and that's as low as he ever goes.
It's as low as he ever goes.

795
00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:12.620
So these strategies down here,
these strategies down here,

796
00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:17.780
less than one,
I'll never a best response for player one.

797
00:51:18.780 --> 00:51:19.640
<v 1>All right.</v>

798
00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:23.960
<v 0>And if player to choose these four,
right?
There's,
there's that.</v>

799
00:51:23.961 --> 00:51:27.060
Then the synergy leads player,
uh,
one took to raise his best,

800
00:51:27.061 --> 00:51:31.020
respond to all the way up to two.
But these strategies up here,

801
00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:37.340
you strategies up here above two are never a best response for player one.

802
00:51:38.490 --> 00:51:39.323
Is that right?

803
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:44.390
So the strategy is below one and above two are never a best response for

804
00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:45.234
planning.

805
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:50.490
And similarly for player to the lowest player one could ever do is choose zero,

806
00:51:50.491 --> 00:51:54.540
which has player too.
We want to choose one.
So the strategy is below one.

807
00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:58.620
I'll never a best response for player too,
and the strategies above two,

808
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:05.370
whenever a best response for player too.
All right,
so let's actually,

809
00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:08.880
you might want to be a little bit gentler in your own notebook,
but on my board,

810
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:13.260
let's get rid of all these strategies that are never a best response.
All right,

811
00:52:13.261 --> 00:52:16.740
so all of these,
all these strategies for player one,

812
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:21.150
I'd gone and had all of these strategies for player one.

813
00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:25.000
I'd gone,
you might want to not scribble quite so much on your own notebook,

814
00:52:25.001 --> 00:52:28.490
but still.
All right.
And all these strategies for play,

815
00:52:28.491 --> 00:52:33.420
a two are gone and all these strategies for play or two are gone.

816
00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:36.030
And what's left,

817
00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:43.360
a lot of scribble is left.
What's left.
So I claim if you look carefully,

818
00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:45.160
there's a little box in here,

819
00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:52.660
foot box in here
that saw alive.

820
00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:56.210
I've deleted all the strategies that were best,

821
00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:59.010
but I never best responsible player one and all the strategies that I've never

822
00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:02.800
restaurants player too.
And what I've got left is that little box,

823
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:04.750
but I can't see that little box.

824
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:07.900
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to redraw that little box.

825
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:13.333
Let's redraw it.

826
00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:18.020
So it goes from one to two.

827
00:53:18.021 --> 00:53:21.080
This time I'm going to blow up that box.

828
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:24.920
So this now is one one and up here is

829
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:33.260
two.
And let's put in numbers of quarters.
So this will be,
uh,

830
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:37.590
this will be,
um,
a be baby,
five courses,

831
00:53:38.550 --> 00:53:41.680
six quarters and seven quarters.

832
00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:48.110
Over here it'll be five courses and six courses and seven courses.

833
00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:56.910
And let's just draw how those pink and Blue Line look in that box.

834
00:53:56.911 --> 00:54:00.690
This is just a picture of that little box.
So it's going to turn out,

835
00:54:00.691 --> 00:54:03.150
it goes from the pink line,

836
00:54:03.151 --> 00:54:06.810
goes from here to here

837
00:54:09.300 --> 00:54:14.300
and the Blue Line goes from here to here.

838
00:54:15.361 --> 00:54:19.280
We can work out at home check Kathleen.
But this isn't that correct?
All right.

839
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:23.400
All right,
well I've done is I've redrawn the picture.

840
00:54:23.401 --> 00:54:27.350
We just had a and blown it up.
And um,

841
00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:32.280
how many you've seen that picture before?
Anyone has seen that picture before?

842
00:54:33.090 --> 00:54:36.280
That's the pitch of we just had,
right?
Except I've changed the numbers of bed.

843
00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:37.440
All right?

844
00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:42.440
Once I deleted once I deleted all the strategies that were never a best response

845
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:47.460
and just focused on that little box of strategies that survived.

846
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:49.860
The picture looks exactly the same as it did before.

847
00:54:49.861 --> 00:54:53.250
All big blown up on the numbers changed.
All right,

848
00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:57.900
so what have we done so far?
We said players should never play a strategy.

849
00:54:57.901 --> 00:55:01.380
That's never a best response to anything.
So we throw those away.

850
00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:05.760
All right,
now what's left?
Well,
what's,
what,
what do we do now?

851
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:10.790
So some of the strategies that we didn't throw away,

852
00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:13.790
work best responses to things,

853
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:18.620
but the things they were best responses to have now been thrown away.

854
00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:21.200
Is that right?
This is,

855
00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:23.320
this should be something familiar from when we would leading dominated

856
00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:27.440
strategies.
The strategies I'm about to throw away now than not,

857
00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.980
it isn't that they're not best responses.
They are best responses to something.

858
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.810
But the things they were best responses to we know are not going to be played

859
00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:39.350
because they themselves were not best for them to stay anything.
All right.

860
00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.200
So what strategies do I have in mind?
What flashes I'm about to throw away?

861
00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:47.020
Well,
for example,
for player one,

862
00:55:47.230 --> 00:55:52.230
we know now that player two is never going to choose any strategy below one.

863
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.961
All right?

864
00:55:52.961 --> 00:55:56.800
And so the lowest bio to whatever chooses one and it turns out that the lowest

865
00:55:56.801 --> 00:56:00.880
player two would ever do in response to anything as anything one and above.

866
00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:05.500
It never leaves player one to choose a strategy less than five quarters.

867
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:10.720
And the highest player to ever chooses is to,
uh,
so,

868
00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:15.280
and the highest response,
uh,
to that play out one ever makes any strategy,

869
00:56:15.281 --> 00:56:19.120
two or less is a sticks quarters.

870
00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:23.800
So all these things bigger than six quarters can go,
let's be careful here.

871
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:25.780
These strategies I'm about to delete.

872
00:56:26.020 --> 00:56:29.440
It isn't that they never best response is they were best responses to things,

873
00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:33.910
but the things they were best responses to are things that are never going to be

874
00:56:33.911 --> 00:56:37.440
played.
So they were relevant.
Alright?

875
00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:41.530
So we're throwing away all of the strategy is less than five quarters of a

876
00:56:41.531 --> 00:56:41.801
player,

877
00:56:41.801 --> 00:56:45.940
one and bigger than six quarters replay or how much is one and a half by one.

878
00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:47.410
And somebody for play at too.

879
00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:54.140
And if I did this,
and again,
don't struggle too much in your notes,

880
00:56:54.141 --> 00:56:56.900
but if we just make,
uh,
make clear what's going on here,

881
00:56:59.910 --> 00:57:03.540
I'm actually delete these strategies because since I never going to be played,

882
00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:08.100
I end up with a little box again.

883
00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:10.333
<v 2>All right?</v>

884
00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:15.150
<v 0>All right,
so everyone,
see what I did,
I started with the game.</v>

885
00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.970
I found out what player one's best response was.

886
00:57:17.971 --> 00:57:20.310
For every possible choice of player too.
And I find out what pair of twos,

887
00:57:20.311 --> 00:57:22.770
but best response every possible trusteeship player.
One,

888
00:57:22.980 --> 00:57:25.950
I throw away all strategies,

889
00:57:27.090 --> 00:57:30.720
but we're never a best response.
Then I looked at the strategies that were left.

890
00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:34.260
I said those transfers that were best response to things that have now been

891
00:57:34.261 --> 00:57:37.860
thrown away but not restaurant.
Otherwise I can throw those away too.

892
00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:39.240
I want to throw those away.

893
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:42.600
I was left once again with the football because I can do it again and again and

894
00:57:42.601 --> 00:57:42.990
again.

895
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:46.050
I could do it again and again if I go on doing this exercise again and again and

896
00:57:46.051 --> 00:57:49.200
again,
what do I,
what were the,
what am I going to end up with

897
00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:55.450
Saturday night?
What I'm gonna end up with
the intersection,
right?
If I get,

898
00:57:55.451 --> 00:58:00.440
if I keep on constructing these boxes within boxes,
so that next box would be,

899
00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:03.770
would be a little box in here and then draw it.
But it's something like,

900
00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:07.040
like this,
keep on doing boxes within boxes.

901
00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:09.860
I'm going to converge in on that intersection.

902
00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:12.490
So if we know people are not going to play our best risk,

903
00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:13.760
as long as you never best response.

904
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:15.420
And we know if people are not going to play something,

905
00:58:15.421 --> 00:58:17.600
we just never have restaurants that we were just never a rest response and we

906
00:58:17.601 --> 00:58:19.850
know people are not going to pay us,
which is,
which is not the best one,

907
00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:22.670
that which is not,
et Cetera,
et Cetera,
et cetera.
All right,

908
00:58:22.850 --> 00:58:27.320
we're going to converge in,
in this game to just one strategy for each player,

909
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:31.040
which is where they intersect,
which is where they intersect.

910
00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:37.630
So again,
what we're going to converge in on too is the s one star,

911
00:58:37.631 --> 00:58:42.631
it's called us in this case is equal to one plus B s two star.

912
00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:49.480
And that s two star is equal to one plus B s one star.

913
00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.340
All right?
And we actually,

914
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:54.490
we can do a little better than that since we can let me know.

915
00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:59.030
The game is symmetric.
We know that s one star is actually equal to s to stop.

916
00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.273
<v 2>Alright?</v>

917
00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:06.600
<v 0>So taking advantage of the fact that we know our s one equalness to cause we're</v>

918
00:59:06.601 --> 00:59:07.950
laying on the 45 degree line.

919
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:12.270
I can simplify things by making us one star equal to s to stop.

920
00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:16.370
All right,
so now I've got actually that looks like three acquaintances.

921
00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:19.800
We're just two equations.
Does that one of the other players,
the other all right.

922
00:59:19.801 --> 00:59:23.780
And I can solve them and if I solved them out I'm going to get something like,

923
00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.640
ah,
let me just,
uh,
be careful.

924
00:59:25.641 --> 00:59:30.641
I'm going to get something like a one minus B s one star is equal to one or s

925
00:59:34.291 --> 00:59:39.291
one star equals s two star is equal to one over one minus B.

926
00:59:39.891 --> 00:59:43.010
And again,
anytime I'm doing Algebra on the board so much and check me at home.

927
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:47.600
Uh,
so just have a quick look at that.
Is that right?
I think that's right.

928
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:49.960
All right.
My,
my Algebra,
which is often wrong,

929
00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:55.360
suggest that the solution is s one star equals as two star equals one over one

930
00:59:56.001 --> 01:00:00.320
minus B.
Alright.
[inaudible] this is isn't nothing interesting going on.

931
01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:03.590
I'm just trying to solve that for the equation.
At this point,

932
01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:10.340
okay,
so what do we learn here?
We learned that in this game,

933
01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:14.930
deleting strategies that are never best response and then deleting strategies

934
01:00:14.931 --> 01:00:15.764
that are never best,

935
01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:20.810
anything that's the best response and so on and so forth yielded a single

936
01:00:20.811 --> 01:00:22.910
strategy for each player.

937
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:27.980
Just one strategy for each player and that strategy was given by this equation.

938
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:29.451
So if we try,

939
01:00:29.451 --> 01:00:33.680
if we were a management consultants working for Mckinsey or something and we

940
01:00:33.681 --> 01:00:38.681
were brought in to advise you on your homework assignments or this lower

941
01:00:38.871 --> 01:00:41.750
partnership on their work practices,

942
01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.290
we would come down with a prediction that this is how much work you're going to

943
01:00:45.291 --> 01:00:46.124
get.

944
01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.473
<v 1>Right?</v>

945
01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:54.970
<v 0>Question.
Is this amount of work,
a good amount of work or a bad amount of work?</v>

946
01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.150
<v 1>Okay?</v>

947
01:00:57.150 --> 01:01:00.040
<v 0>It is a good audio here.
All you're working with Mckinsey,
you've been hired by,</v>

948
01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:04.160
uh,
you know,
Joe Smith and,
and blogs to,
to,

949
01:01:04.450 --> 01:01:08.330
to figure out that strategy is working in a problem,
uh,
in a,
in a,
uh,

950
01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:10.510
a team on working on my homework assignments.

951
01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:12.730
You figured out how much work they're going to contribute.

952
01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:16.750
Is this a good amount of work as this?
Are they controlling too much,
too little?

953
01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:17.921
Of course,

954
01:01:17.921 --> 01:01:22.840
the answer today is depending on compared to what Brian compared to water.

955
01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:26.290
So let me rephrase all these people,

956
01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:30.520
all these pair of partners in the firm or two students working on their homework

957
01:01:30.521 --> 01:01:35.320
assignment,
are they working more or less than an efficient level

958
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:42.450
to a poll after poll who thinks more?

959
01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:47.160
I think more turn that,
turn the camera and for the world instead of a look.

960
01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:50.520
I think it's more who thinks they're working just right.

961
01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:56.690
Who thinks less,
not of stains?
A lot of stuff of here.

962
01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.300
I think they're working to little here.

963
01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:03.270
I think they're working to little here compared to what's efficient.
Uh,
we'll,

964
01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:03.501
we'll,

965
01:02:03.501 --> 01:02:06.710
I'll get you to solve it out on a homework assignment so you can actually prove

966
01:02:06.711 --> 01:02:09.770
the hat.
You can prove that.
In fact,
if you,
if it was,

967
01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:13.430
if you're writing a contract or if there's a social planner,
uh,
you'd work more.

968
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.590
But let's try and get to grips.
Why?

969
01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:21.160
Why is it that when we see these law partners or medical partners or whatever it

970
01:02:22.051 --> 01:02:24.540
happens to be,
students working together on a homework assignment,

971
01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:29.960
why is it we tend to get inefficiently little efforts when we start figuring out

972
01:02:30.631 --> 01:02:34.520
the strategy and working through the game?
I'm,
I'm,
I'm conceding the artist.

973
01:02:34.521 --> 01:02:36.330
I'm telling you it's,
they're going to work to referral.

974
01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.340
Why do they end up not working harder

975
01:02:39.620 --> 01:02:42.820
<v 2>enough?
Take us.</v>

976
01:02:44.490 --> 01:02:47.210
Um,
we can get a mic in here.
Yeah.

977
01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.650
<v 0>Yes.
Because if they work any harder than that,</v>

978
01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:55.280
then the other person's just going to slack off instead.
All right.

979
01:02:55.281 --> 01:02:57.800
So there's something about,
that doesn't mean on the other hand,

980
01:02:57.830 --> 01:02:59.230
this isn't really a,
I mean,

981
01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:02.570
the intuition you'll giving me is kind of a prisoner's dilemma intuition,
right?

982
01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:05.720
Saying,
Oh,
I'm going to let the other guy work and I'll,
I'll shook.

983
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:07.910
But there's something at the end that there's something in that.

984
01:03:07.911 --> 01:03:10.760
But those little bit more going on here,
what's,
what's,
what more is going on.

985
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:15.260
And I think that's good for us to have.
And they're instantly all of that.
Yeah.

986
01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:19.870
If there are two people working together very,

987
01:03:19.871 --> 01:03:23.090
there's about half as much work for each person to do.

988
01:03:24.250 --> 01:03:25.100
That's true.

989
01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:29.210
But that would suggest it doesn't matter if they slack off what's going on here.

990
01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.380
So go back to economics one 15 or 150 if you took what either of those courses,

991
01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.520
what's the problem here?

992
01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:37.310
What's what's underlying the probiotic that's got to get sky guy in pink down

993
01:03:37.311 --> 01:03:38.144
here,

994
01:03:39.110 --> 01:03:44.080
they only capture 50% of their marginal benefit.
Good.
Good.

995
01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:47.200
So when your name is,
so Patrick is giving anyway,

996
01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:49.220
I think it's the correct tone a here.

997
01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.880
The problem here isn't really about the amount of work.

998
01:03:52.881 --> 01:03:57.020
It isn't it even by the way about the synergy or you might think it's because of

999
01:03:57.021 --> 01:03:59.660
this synergy that they don't take into account correctly.

1000
01:04:00.110 --> 01:04:00.980
That isn't the problem here.

1001
01:04:00.981 --> 01:04:03.480
It sounds like even without listening to this problem would be that the problem

1002
01:04:03.481 --> 01:04:07.550
is what Patrick said.
The problem is that at the margin I,

1003
01:04:07.551 --> 01:04:11.420
a worker in this foam be at a low partnership or a homework,

1004
01:04:11.450 --> 01:04:15.230
a homework solving group.
I put you in,

1005
01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:19.070
I bear the costs for the at the margin for,

1006
01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:23.830
I buy the full cost at the margin for any extra unit of Fla Putin,

1007
01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:29.650
but I only reap Hoff the benefits right at the margin I'm reaping,

1008
01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:34.730
I,
I'm,
I'm bearing the cost for the extra unit of effort.
I contribute,

1009
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:38.360
but I'm owning reaping Hoff of the,
of the,

1010
01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:42.750
of the induced profits of the firm because of profit share.
All right,

1011
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:45.360
and that needs all of us to print you to,

1012
01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.570
to put in to little efforts or just the general term that captures all such

1013
01:04:50.571 --> 01:04:51.770
situations and economics?

1014
01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:58.830
It's an externality.
It's an externality.
There's an externality.

1015
01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:08.280
It wasn't asked analyse when I'm figuring out how much effort to contribute to

1016
01:05:08.281 --> 01:05:09.114
this firm.

1017
01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:14.400
I don't take into account that other half of profits that goes to you.

1018
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.130
So this isn't to do with this,
with the synergy,

1019
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:19.780
it isn't to do something complicated.

1020
01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:22.270
It's something you knew back in one 15 right?

1021
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:26.050
If you have profit sharing and affirm or profit sharing and homework assignment

1022
01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:27.130
or any joint projects,

1023
01:05:27.340 --> 01:05:31.030
you have to worry about too little effort being contributed because there's an

1024
01:05:31.031 --> 01:05:35.170
externality.
My efforts benefits you,
not just me.

1025
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.040
<v 2>All right,</v>

1026
01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:40.440
<v 0>and while we've got this on the board,
let's just think a little bit more.</v>

1027
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:44.220
What would happen if we changed the degree of the synergy?

1028
01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:50.070
What would happen if we lowered B to B is the degree to which the synergy across

1029
01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:53.940
these workers,
if we lowered be what would happen to our picture?

1030
01:05:53.941 --> 01:05:55.890
Let me redraw a picture and scribble.

1031
01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:01.910
We had a picture that it's something like

1032
01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:09.940
<v 2>this.
All right.</v>

1033
01:06:09.941 --> 01:06:11.710
This was s one

1034
01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:16.230
<v 0>and this was as to if we lowered the degree of synergy,</v>

1035
01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:20.160
what would happen to the effort level that we'd find by this method?

1036
01:06:20.161 --> 01:06:21.720
What would happen?
What happened to the picture?

1037
01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:24.850
<v 2>Okay,</v>

1038
01:06:24.850 --> 01:06:27.040
<v 0>and you already got,
this is a really one 15 and kind of exercise.</v>

1039
01:06:27.041 --> 01:06:30.760
We're going to be moving lines around.
Yeah.
A Henry,
isn't it?

1040
01:06:30.761 --> 01:06:34.020
So that it's going to make him the,
the lines.

1041
01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:36.790
We'll get shallow word eventually become horizontal and vertical respectively.

1042
01:06:36.950 --> 01:06:40.600
All right,
good.
So the,
the,
the pink client,
it's actually going to get Steve,

1043
01:06:40.601 --> 01:06:43.810
I want to know what you mean.
All right.
So the pink line

1044
01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:50.500
is going to move towards the vertical and the Blue Line is going to move towards

1045
01:06:50.711 --> 01:06:51.730
the horizontal.

1046
01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:57.570
And those is that the amount of the amount of effort that we generate goes down

1047
01:06:57.911 --> 01:06:58.744
dramatically.

1048
01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:01.910
<v 2>That's down in this direction.
All right?</v>

1049
01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:06.060
<v 0>So if we lower the synergy here,
not only do I contribute less effort,</v>

1050
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.781
but you know,

1051
01:07:06.781 --> 01:07:09.150
I contribute to this effort and therefore you can trim it this effort and so on.

1052
01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:13.380
All right?
So we get this,
this,
uh,
the scissors effects of taking out of it.

1053
01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:15.880
<v 2>That's why,
all right,</v>

1054
01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:22.140
<v 0>we can draw other lessons from this,
but let me try and move on a little bit.</v>

1055
01:07:23.070 --> 01:07:28.020
We decided that this game to Solvay's by looking at best responses,

1056
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:31.890
deleting things that were never a best response,
looking again,

1057
01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:34.710
deleting things that were never brushed,
bonds and so on and so forth.

1058
01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.320
And Luckily in this particular game,

1059
01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:41.160
things converged and they converged to the point

1060
01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:47.290
where the pink and the Blue Line crossed.
All right.
What's,
what are we,

1061
01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:49.320
what do we call that point?

1062
01:07:50.490 --> 01:07:54.380
What we call the point where the pink and the Blue Line Cross,
right?

1063
01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:00.080
That's an important idea for this class that's going to turn out to be what's

1064
01:08:01.861 --> 01:08:03.900
called a Nash equilibrium.

1065
01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.470
We know what it's cool.
How many,

1066
01:08:09.471 --> 01:08:11.570
how many of you've heard the term Nash equilibrium before?

1067
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:14.450
How many of you saw the movie about Nash?

1068
01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.940
I will come back and talk about that a bit next time.
All right,

1069
01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:20.870
so this is a national equilibrium,
but okay,

1070
01:08:20.871 --> 01:08:23.090
we know what it is in jargon and we know,

1071
01:08:23.091 --> 01:08:26.040
we kind of knew that was going to be an important point because it,

1072
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:29.480
most of you have taken economics courses before and you know that whenever lines

1073
01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:31.310
cross and economics,
it's important,
right?

1074
01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:34.543
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1075
01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:38.050
<v 0>But what does it mean here?
Why is it,
what's,
what's going on at that line?</v>

1076
01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:42.940
What does it tell us?
What does it tell us that the pink and the Blue Line Cross.

1077
01:08:43.850 --> 01:08:44.520
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1078
01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.080
<v 0>What makes that point special way?</v>

1079
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:51.530
What does it mean to say the pink and the Blue Line Cross?
There's a guy,

1080
01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.650
they're gonna get their way by like three up three rows behind you and purple

1081
01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:56.083
shout out.
Again,

1082
01:08:56.510 --> 01:09:00.110
it means that neither player has an incentive to deviate from that point.

1083
01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:02.840
All right,
well that's that's correct.
That's correct.

1084
01:09:02.841 --> 01:09:05.600
So let's try and read that through.
So,
uh,

1085
01:09:05.601 --> 01:09:10.190
I don't know your name and they made to,
Alan is saying if play a one,

1086
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:13.640
if player one is choosing this strategy in play,

1087
01:09:13.641 --> 01:09:17.990
a two is choosing her stroke,
her corresponding strategy here,

1088
01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.320
neither player has an incentive to deviate or another way of saying it is

1089
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:24.290
neither player wants to move away,
right?

1090
01:09:24.291 --> 01:09:29.291
So if play a one chooses s one star player two will want to choose as to star

1091
01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:35.410
since that's how best response and if player two is playing as two star player,

1092
01:09:35.961 --> 01:09:39.290
one will want to play as one star.
Since that's his best response,

1093
01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:44.840
neither has any incentive to move away.
All right,
so more succinctly,

1094
01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:50.200
player one and player two at this point where the lines cross player one and

1095
01:09:50.391 --> 01:09:54.440
player two are playing a best response to each other,

1096
01:09:55.900 --> 01:10:00.340
right?
The players are playing a best response to each other.

1097
01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:09.610
Best response

1098
01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:14.803
<v 2>to each other.</v>

1099
01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:22.730
<v 0>All right,
so clearly in this game it's where the lines cross.</v>

1100
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:25.550
Let's go back to the game.
We played with the numbers.

1101
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:28.880
I'm aware everyone had to choose a number and the winner was going to be the

1102
01:10:28.881 --> 01:10:32.630
person who who I was close to two thirds of the average.
By the way,

1103
01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:35.720
the winners never picked up my winnings for that,
so they still can.
All right,

1104
01:10:35.721 --> 01:10:39.710
so in in that game and watch the Nash Equilibrium in that game.

1105
01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:45.450
Yeah.
Everyone,
everyone choosing one.
However one choosing one.

1106
01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:48.060
How do we know that the Nash Equilibrium that game?

1107
01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:53.540
How do we know that everyone choosing one is the Nash Equilibrium in the game

1108
01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:57.230
where you all shows numbers?
Well,
let's just use the definition.

1109
01:10:57.530 --> 01:11:00.500
If everybody chose a one,
right?

1110
01:11:00.501 --> 01:11:02.960
The average and the cloth would be one.

1111
01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.370
Two thirds of that would be two thirds and you can't get meat.

1112
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:09.080
You can't go down below one,
so everyone's best response would be to choose one,

1113
01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:11.450
right?
Say that again.
So everyone chose one,

1114
01:11:12.110 --> 01:11:16.000
then everyone's best response would be to choose one.
Right?

1115
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:18.240
Did that would be a nash equilibrium,
right?

1116
01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:22.860
Did people play Nash Equilibrium when we play that game?
Well,
they didn't.

1117
01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:24.300
Not at least not initially at any rate.

1118
01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:26.910
But notice as we played the game repeatedly,

1119
01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:30.120
what happens as we came and played the game repeatedly,

1120
01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:34.620
we notice that play seem to converge down towards one.

1121
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:37.860
Is that right?
And in this game,

1122
01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:40.620
when we analyze the game repeatedly,

1123
01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:45.210
it seemed like a analysis converge towards the equilibrium.

1124
01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:47.760
That's not always going to happen,

1125
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.010
but it's kind of a nice feature about now she could ever,

1126
01:11:50.011 --> 01:11:55.011
I'm sometimes sometimes play tends to converge that now she could up is going to

1127
01:11:56.791 --> 01:12:01.170
be a huge idea from now to the midterm exam and we're going to pick it up and

1128
01:12:01.171 --> 01:12:03.210
see more examples on Wednesday.
