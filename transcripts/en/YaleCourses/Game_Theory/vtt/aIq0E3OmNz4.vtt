1
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.580
All right,

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.290
so today I want to do something a little bit more mundane than we did on Monday.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.820
I wanted to go back and talk about quantity competition.
So in the,

4
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:16.200
in the first half of the course,
we talked about price competition.

5
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.670
We talked about quantity,
competition,

6
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.830
we talked about competition with differentiated products.

7
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.460
I want to go back and revisit essentially the core no model.

8
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.760
So this was the core no model.
The two firms are producing a,

9
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.810
choosing their quantities simultaneously from one is choosing Q1 and from two is

10
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:34.500
choosing Q2.

11
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.370
And we had all of this is just reviews and this is all stuff that's in your

12
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.010
notes and ready.
This is the demand curve.

13
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.070
It tells us that prices depend on the total quantity being produced.

14
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.350
So this is Q one plus Q two and this is prices than the demand curve is a

15
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:56.640
straight line of Slope B.
All right?
That's what that,
that's what this tells us.

16
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.770
Is that a slope mine,
that's me.
All right.

17
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.680
And we know that payoffs are just profits,

18
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.270
which are price times quantity,
revenues minus cost,
time,

19
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:12.150
quantity costs or get swimming,
constant marginal costs.

20
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.950
And we did this model out in full in maybe the third week of class and we

21
00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:19.290
figured out what the best response diagram looked like.

22
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.850
And if you remember correctly,

23
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.940
this was the best response from one taking from two his output as given,

24
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.860
and this is the best response

25
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.440
for from to taking from one output has given.

26
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.840
And there were a few other details in here.
This was the monopoly quantity.

27
00:01:37.841 --> 00:01:40.950
This was competitive quantity and so on.
But this is,
this is enough for today.

28
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.230
And actually we'd done a bit more than that.

29
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.550
We'd actually worked out in class what the equations were for these best

30
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:50.910
responses.
Here they are,
and I'm,
I'm not going to read,
arrive these today,

31
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:51.900
but there's somewhere in your notes.

32
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:55.770
We kind of crunch through some calculus and figured out what foam ones best

33
00:01:55.771 --> 00:01:58.410
response looks like al directly.
Here it is.

34
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.710
So this is the equation of this line and similarly for from too.

35
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:08.100
So this is the equation of this one.
All right.

36
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.970
And finally we figured out what the Nash Equilibrium was and there was no prizes

37
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:12.540
here.

38
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.540
The Nash Equilibrium in Corno was where these best response is crossed and this

39
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:20.220
is the equation for the battle for that for now,
she could have them.

40
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.080
Have you made a mistake?
Uh,
the best.

41
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.100
Oh,
thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Best respond to best.

42
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:32.550
Responsible for from one is a function of Q two exactly.
Thanks Jake.

43
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.360
All right,
so this is all stuff we did before.

44
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.680
I want to go back to this model now to revisit it in the context of thinking

45
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:42.150
about sequential dynamic games.

46
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.840
So we're going to do is we're going to imagine that rather than having these

47
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:48.480
firms choose their quantities simultaneously,

48
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.860
one firm gets to move first.
And the other from moves after.

49
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.820
Let's be clear what we're going to assume that one firm is moving first and the

50
00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:59.710
other firm for what was it was assume from one's going to move first.

51
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.860
The other firm to from to is going to get to observe what foam one is chosen and

52
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:08.500
then get to make a choice.
All right.
So we're just gonna see how,

53
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.040
what difference it makes when we go from this classic simultaneous move came

54
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.950
into a sequential move game.
Alright?

55
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.880
And this model is fairly famous and I almost got the spelling this wrong,

56
00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.220
but it's due to a guy called Stackelberg.

57
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.690
So what we're looking at now is the Stackelberg mark.

58
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.040
Alright.
So how do you want to think about this?
So not a,

59
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:34.150
a natural question to have bear in mind is assuming where this world of quantity

60
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:38.000
competition,
is it an advantage to get to move first?

61
00:03:38.001 --> 00:03:42.910
Does tech one's quantity first or is this an advantage to be able to wait,

62
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.630
see what the other firm has done and then respond,
right?

63
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:51.010
Is there an advantage in going first or as an advantage in knowing a bit more

64
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.240
about what,
uh,
about the other firm and being able to move second?
All right,

65
00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.340
that's to me the question at the back of our mind for most of today.
All right,

66
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.530
so how are we going to,
how are we going to think of this?

67
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:05.110
How are we going to figure this out?
How are we going to figure this out?

68
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.070
It shouldn't be,
it shouldn't be a silence in the room.

69
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:11.650
There should be an instant answer.
How are we going to figure this out?

70
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.230
We're going to use backward induction,
right?

71
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.690
This is gonna be an exercise in backward induction.

72
00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.470
We won't be able to draw a tree here because the games too complicated because

73
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:22.630
there's a consumer of actions,
but nevertheless,

74
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.380
we are going to use backward induction.
So what does using backward induction,

75
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:31.381
Meagan here using backward induction means starting at the end and the end is

76
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:31.750
what?

77
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.670
The end here is from two right from one is going to move first from just going

78
00:04:36.671 --> 00:04:41.020
to observe that choice and then move.
So the end of the game is from too.

79
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:43.810
So we're going to solve that from two's problem first.

80
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.990
And we're actually going to do this entire analysis twice.

81
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.070
We're first of all going to do this analysis a bit intuitively looking at

82
00:04:51.071 --> 00:04:55.950
pictures and then they want to go back and crunch and out in the math.
All right.

83
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.140
You want to,
you used to seeing that we can actually do it.
Crunch Lee.
All right,

84
00:04:59.141 --> 00:05:02.590
so this but this,
but this board is just review,
so I'm going to get rid of it.

85
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:06.400
I think
I didn't manage to get rid of it.
I have mine.

86
00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.110
We're not going to be using this board.

87
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:14.770
This is just what we did do and the same in the simultaneous move game.

88
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.700
So we'll get rid of it.
All right,

89
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.410
so in the sequential move game,

90
00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.610
we're going to start by analyzing the mover from two.
All right?

91
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:28.570
So imagine yourself as a manager of from to you're coming along to meet your

92
00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:32.890
output decision,
right?
The output or from one is already set.

93
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.710
All right.
Analyze from two first

94
00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.400
from two C's.

95
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.630
Q1 Hi anonymous.
Choose huge too.

96
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.030
So what is from to going to do?
What's fun to

97
00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.863
<v 2>going to do?</v>

98
00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.420
<v 0>So I claim we already know this.
We've already solved this problem.</v>

99
00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.240
When do we solve this problem?

100
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:06.570
And they want to no know when we solve this problem,

101
00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.630
the problem of what from who's going to do,
oh,
we already solved it.

102
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.900
But a month ago when we looked at the sort of the same old tennis moved game

103
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.140
because what we worked out then was what is from tos best response for any

104
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:24.530
particular choice that foam one makes.
All right.

105
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:26.930
We already sold out that problem.
It was kind of a,

106
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.370
it took us a while to sell out,

107
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:33.371
but basically it was the Max maximize from two's pay off taking has given from

108
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:33.980
one.

109
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.280
We already know what the equation looks like and it's just remind ourselves what

110
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:40.550
the picture looked like.
Just a repeat of the picture you had before.

111
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.940
We said for any particular choice of from one from two's best response can be

112
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:49.310
drawn on a best response diagram.

113
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.593
<v 2>Okay,</v>

114
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.210
<v 0>and it looks like this.
It's exactly the picture we have up there.
All right,</v>

115
00:06:57.211 --> 00:07:02.211
so this is the best response for from to taking us given the choice of from one.

116
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.850
<v 2>Okay.</v>

117
00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.370
<v 0>All right.
And we even know the equation of it.
I went well the rewrite it,</v>

118
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.340
that ordinary equation.
All right,

119
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.520
so in some sense from two's problem is a problem.
We've already seen it.

120
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:18.260
We already worked out in months ago.
What from two should do it,
uh,

121
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.150
taking a foam ones output has given and that's exactly the problem from two

122
00:07:21.151 --> 00:07:24.210
fines herself.
And she wakes up one morning,

123
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.470
[inaudible] has been said already and now she must choose Q Q Q two to maximize

124
00:07:28.471 --> 00:07:30.570
their profits.
So there's going to choose her best response.

125
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:35.370
And just to remind you how we read this picture for any particular choice of Q1,

126
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:40.680
we'd go up to the line and look across,
this tells us what Q2 will respond.

127
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.530
All right?
Two of Q one chooses this amount.

128
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.860
Then Q2 while she was this amount,

129
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:52.250
if Q1 chooses this amount and Q two we'll choose this amount and so on.

130
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.840
All right,
so there's no mystery here.

131
00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.160
We already know what from two is going to do.
All right?
So by definition,

132
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:02.263
<v 2>my definition,</v>

133
00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:08.840
<v 0>the best response of two to Q1,</v>

134
00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:11.270
how's us

135
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:13.143
<v 2>the</v>

136
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.840
<v 0>profit maximizing?</v>

137
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.453
<v 2>Oh,
push.</v>

138
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.320
<v 0>Awesome too.</v>

139
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.570
Taking Q1

140
00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:31.803
<v 2>I was given.</v>

141
00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.940
<v 0>All right,
so we've done the second,
we'd done the second step,</v>

142
00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.130
but this is already,
we already know what from two's going to do.

143
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.020
Of course the additional step here now is it from one knows that foam two's

144
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:48.050
going to do this for one is going to move first and from one knows that after

145
00:08:48.391 --> 00:08:53.391
she sets how quantity Q1 from two will respond by choosing how corresponding

146
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:57.180
corresponding quantity,
which is the best response to it.

147
00:08:57.181 --> 00:09:00.030
So from one news that affirmed one where the shoes,

148
00:09:00.031 --> 00:09:05.031
this quantity then from two will respond by choosing this quantity and from one

149
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:07.410
knows that if he,
if she chose this,

150
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:12.500
the smaller quantity and from to all respond by choosing this larger quantity,

151
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.000
is that right?
Is that right?

152
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:19.800
So from one can anticipate how from two is going to respond to each of these

153
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:22.710
choices.
All right,
so let's just make that clear.

154
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.610
So in particular if from one was to choose Q one hat,

155
00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:27.810
I'm not suggesting it should,

156
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.810
but if from one was to choose this Q one hats than he knows,

157
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:35.040
then phone one knows that from to we'll produce this quantity,

158
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.100
which is the best response to Q one hat.

159
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:43.790
And if I'm one would choose Q one double hat and firms who will respond by

160
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:48.690
choosing the best response to Q one double hat.

161
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.870
All right,
so this is pretty straight forward so far,

162
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:56.340
but what we are able to see now is the problem of facing from one which is the

163
00:09:56.341 --> 00:09:57.174
interesting problem.

164
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:02.220
The problem facing from one is what quantity should from one shoes.

165
00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:07.370
Knowing that this is how from two is going to respond and before we saw this out

166
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.920
mathematically,
I just want to think it through a little bit.

167
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.120
So the first way I want to think this through is it's it made the following

168
00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:20.121
observation from phone one's point of view from one knows that any Q1 she

169
00:10:20.851 --> 00:10:25.410
chooses leads to a response on this line by from too.

170
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.940
That's what phone one knows.

171
00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:32.390
So from one is effectively choosing points on this line for one is effectively

172
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.500
choosing points on this line.
Let me say it again.

173
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:42.180
It's what what's actually happening is from one is choosing Q1 and from two is

174
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:46.590
responding by choosing a Kutu that puts them on this mind.
But in effect,

175
00:10:46.591 --> 00:10:50.960
that means from one is choosing points on this line.
All right?

176
00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:56.300
So you can think of from one's problem as choose the joint output level on this

177
00:10:57.121 --> 00:11:02.121
line that maximizes from ones profits that we could think of.

178
00:11:03.561 --> 00:11:03.910
Pheromones,

179
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:08.910
problem as choose the combination of outputs on this line by choosing Q one and

180
00:11:09.121 --> 00:11:09.954
Q two respond,

181
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:15.350
choose the combination on this line that maximizes profits for from one try.

182
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.530
Unbelievable.
And there's a little bit because it,
it's,

183
00:11:17.531 --> 00:11:19.440
it's a more general mathematical idea here.

184
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.980
How many of you are in Econ one 50 right now?
Right?

185
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.310
So for those of you an econ one 50 this is should be a very familiar kind of

186
00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:26.551
thing.

187
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:30.330
That is a constrained optimization problem and you've been having constrained

188
00:11:30.331 --> 00:11:33.300
optimization problems rammed into for the last month or so.
Right?

189
00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:35.690
So this is an example of a constrained optimization,
right?

190
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.310
You have to choose a point,
but you can't use a point freely.

191
00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:42.540
You have to choose a point on the line.
All right.
All right.

192
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.250
Okay,
so let's talk about it a bit more before we do the math.
All right.

193
00:11:47.251 --> 00:11:51.600
That's actually redraw it again,
since I made a mess of this picture.

194
00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:01.020
So one thing you might want to ask is in making this choice for from one should

195
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:07.321
from one shoes more or less or the same as it used to choose when the problem

196
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:11.080
was simultaneous.
All right,

197
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:15.070
so let's put in again what it used to choose when the problem was simultaneous.

198
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:16.690
I'll put it in just faintly.

199
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:19.600
<v 1>Okay,</v>

200
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.230
<v 0>so here's our old corn.
Oh,
pitcher up like this.</v>

201
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.040
All right.
And this was the quantity,

202
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:33.040
but from one show is in the core no game.
So let me call that Q one c.

203
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:34.820
<v 1>Okay.</v>

204
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:39.610
<v 0>All right.
So certainly one possibility is that from one could choose her core,</v>

205
00:12:39.611 --> 00:12:42.200
no quantity,
right?
You can certainly do that.

206
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:47.350
And she knows that if she does that from two will respond by choosing the best

207
00:12:48.621 --> 00:12:53.150
response of I'm too to from one choosing the corner quantity.

208
00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:56.630
But we know what that is.
What's what's from two's best response to foam ones,

209
00:12:56.631 --> 00:13:01.120
quantity,
quantity,
it's foam two's,
corner quantity,
right?

210
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.740
So if I'm,
if I'm too does that,
if someone chooses,

211
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:08.470
if I'm one chooses the corner quantity then from to what also choose the corner

212
00:13:08.471 --> 00:13:09.280
quantity.

213
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.630
So one thing that from one could do as effectively choose the old equilibrium.

214
00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:16.481
All right,
that's it.

215
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:18.610
And something that's something that that's available to from one,

216
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:24.250
but someone could also do other things from one could produce less than that or

217
00:13:24.251 --> 00:13:25.630
from one could do more than that.

218
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.720
<v 1>All right,</v>

219
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.180
<v 0>so who thinks from one should play?</v>

220
00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:32.940
It should choose the old equilibrium quantity.

221
00:13:34.830 --> 00:13:38.160
Who thinks Fev one to choose more than that?
He thinks from launch,

222
00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.900
which was less than that.
He went to a majority of this.

223
00:13:41.901 --> 00:13:44.900
Just try it with a camera on you.
All right.
All right,
so once again,
how am I,

224
00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:45.810
how many people think that the phone,

225
00:13:45.811 --> 00:13:50.180
why you should choose the old equilibrium quantity,
dribbling of hands.

226
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:55.570
And how about less than that?
You hadn't and they went down again.

227
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:59.400
Then how about more than that?
There's a majority of a more turns out.

228
00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:03.750
More as correct.
That's good.
That's good news.
It's good news.
Why?

229
00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.440
Why do we think from one should produce more than it used to produce before?

230
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.761
Let they take us on this.

231
00:14:13.761 --> 00:14:18.761
What does thinking about it as from one produces more or if from one month to

232
00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:20.174
produce more.

233
00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:25.660
Then from to that my voice is going then from two would produce what lasts.

234
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.190
All right?

235
00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:33.190
As from one produces more than her corner quantity from two's response is to

236
00:14:33.981 --> 00:14:37.510
produce less.
All right.
Does anyone remember the jargon for this?
What?

237
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:41.120
What do we call games where the more I do have my strategy,

238
00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:45.410
the less you do have yours.
Strategic substitutes.
Good.

239
00:14:45.411 --> 00:14:48.140
This is a game of strategic substitutes.

240
00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:56.730
It's game of strategic substitutes and what that means is that as Q one goes

241
00:14:56.731 --> 00:14:57.564
out,

242
00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:02.630
Kutu the best response affirm to the Q one goes down.

243
00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:09.570
So Watch.
So what?
We got that,
that's good.
I just want to get the picture.
Well,

244
00:15:09.571 --> 00:15:13.860
the,
so wars is now we're in,
now we're in a sequential game.

245
00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:17.340
It film one produces more than her corner quantity.

246
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.630
She induces from two to produce less as we just said.

247
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.800
And that's what that's good for from one,
right?

248
00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:30.720
My producing more inducing youtube produce last is good for me.

249
00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.810
It's going to keep prices higher and the market is that right?

250
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.560
So let's just think it through again in the core,
no equilibrium.

251
00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:42.890
The choice of from one was the best choice for from one taking.

252
00:15:42.961 --> 00:15:47.760
The choice of two is given,
but that was the quite old court over quantity,

253
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:51.270
right?
But now we're in the Stackelberg setting.
It's a sequential setting.

254
00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:55.740
There's an additional feature from one doesn't have to take from two's output

255
00:15:55.741 --> 00:15:59.370
has given.
There's an additional reason for producing all right?
At the margin,

256
00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:00.540
which is at the margin.

257
00:16:00.541 --> 00:16:03.990
If I produced the more units of output that leads you to produce last,

258
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.900
which is good for me.
All right?

259
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.010
So that suggests that I'm going to produce more than I used to produce under the

260
00:16:11.011 --> 00:16:13.590
old assumption.
All right,
so this suggests,

261
00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.390
<v 1>I suggest that</v>

262
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.240
<v 0>a fun one</v>

263
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.890
<v 1>should set,</v>

264
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:31.430
<v 0>he won bigger than Q one c to induce</v>

265
00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:40.360
Q two to be less than QTC.
Alright.

266
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.030
So the first thing we've learned,
we'll see this in the math later,

267
00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:48.070
is that from one will in fact produce more than they used to under core know and

268
00:16:48.071 --> 00:16:52.210
that will result in from to producing last one.
Now,
all right,

269
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.060
now we're already got a lot on the board.

270
00:16:55.061 --> 00:16:57.450
Now that we can actually solve that intuitively the problem,

271
00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:03.060
do we think that from one's profits by this procedure are the same as they were

272
00:17:03.341 --> 00:17:04.180
under Kono?

273
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:08.260
Are they less than they were under corno or are they more than they were under

274
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:11.440
Cornell?
Because,
let me say again from one is going first.

275
00:17:11.441 --> 00:17:14.500
Now we've argued that from one's going to produce more.

276
00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.480
Do we think the foam ones,

277
00:17:16.481 --> 00:17:20.420
profits and the end of the day are going to be the same as they were under corno

278
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:23.950
higher than than they were under corno although than they were in the corner.

279
00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:26.800
So let's have a poll again and we get ready to get the get the camera on you

280
00:17:26.801 --> 00:17:27.340
guys.

281
00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.900
So who thinks that profits are going to be the same as they were under corner?

282
00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:33.040
We thinks the province is going to go.
I've gone up.

283
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.280
I think the profit's gone down now.
We're in good shape.

284
00:17:37.281 --> 00:17:39.070
Pay Cause indeed the profits have gone up.

285
00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.460
It's a very simple argument where the profits after we've gone up,
why do,

286
00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.620
how do we know the profits must have gone up?
Let me actually,
is this simple?

287
00:17:45.621 --> 00:17:46.870
Nothing to grab a Mike on this.

288
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.480
How do we know the profits just must've got up there was a hand or the back.

289
00:17:51.481 --> 00:17:53.280
It was a hand in the back.
Yes.
Okay.
Way at the back.

290
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.460
How do we know profits must have gone up here way at the back.

291
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.030
Yeah.
If from I was going to lower their province,

292
00:18:01.031 --> 00:18:04.920
they wouldn't have chosen to produce more.
All right,
good.
Exactly.
Exactly.

293
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:07.920
The fact that from one has changed,

294
00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:12.090
the output in a particular producing more tells you they must be able to to

295
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:15.570
increase their profits by this,
by this maneuver,
right.
There's this thing,

296
00:18:15.571 --> 00:18:16.500
it's so think that through.

297
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:21.710
One option that was available to from one before was to set out on the core no

298
00:18:22.381 --> 00:18:26.190
level.
If I'm one had set output at the corner level,

299
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.500
that would have laid the firm to just set output at the corner level and on an I

300
00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.720
in that case,
profits would have been exactly the same as before.

301
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:39.100
The fight from one has moved away from that must mean they're a higher profit

302
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.943
available.

303
00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:44.610
Said another way from one could have had exactly what it had before too.

304
00:18:44.611 --> 00:18:44.990
It must do,

305
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.500
it must be doing at least as well as it was doing before and the fact it's

306
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.690
changed,
music must be doing better than it was doing before.
All right,

307
00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.660
so indeed from one's profits have gone up.

308
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:03.060
Oh,
I'm on,
profits have gone up.
We don't even need any math to prove that.

309
00:19:03.061 --> 00:19:06.810
It must,
it just must be the case.
Uh,
logically.
All right.

310
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.030
What must have happened to from two's profits?

311
00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:13.960
What are things happening to foam tubes,
profits.
So that's not,

312
00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.240
that's also immediately obvious,
right?
It's all various.
I think the foam ones,

313
00:19:17.241 --> 00:19:20.570
profits have gone up yet because foam one could have had the same old profits

314
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.950
and as chosen something else,

315
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.720
but it's not immediately obvious what happened to from two's.

316
00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.730
Profits does that right now,
before we get to what's happened to from to profits,

317
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.740
let's go through an intermediate step.

318
00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:36.040
Let's try and ask what must have happened to total outputs in the market in this

319
00:19:38.001 --> 00:19:41.870
example.
And it's nice,
simple example,
right?
We did that.

320
00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.210
That's not immediately obvious either.

321
00:19:44.211 --> 00:19:49.211
Why we've argued that from one's output went up,

322
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:54.080
but from two outputs when down roles you have to core no,

323
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:56.583
<v 1>right?</v>

324
00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:01.690
<v 0>So it's not immediately obvious whether the sum of those two Q one plus Q two</v>

325
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:04.070
went up or down,
right?

326
00:20:04.071 --> 00:20:09.071
We'd like to know what happens to Q one plus Q two total output on the market.

327
00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.280
And by the way,
I,

328
00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:17.720
one particular reason we might care about this is of course consumers would like

329
00:20:17.721 --> 00:20:20.660
it to have gone up.
If total output,
it's gone up,

330
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.630
price has gone down and that's good for consumers,
right?

331
00:20:23.631 --> 00:20:26.210
So if you're the regulator,
if you're just,
if you're designing this industry,

332
00:20:26.211 --> 00:20:29.000
if you're working for the Justice Department,

333
00:20:29.001 --> 00:20:31.130
if you're working for the European Commission,

334
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:32.930
you're going to want to know the answer.

335
00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:37.670
When we switched from a simultaneous simultaneous testing to an asymmetric

336
00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:37.941
setting,

337
00:20:37.941 --> 00:20:41.060
where there's a leader from and a follower from is not going to be good for

338
00:20:41.061 --> 00:20:45.700
consumers or bad for consumers.
All right,
well let's have a look.
Well,

339
00:20:45.701 --> 00:20:50.110
we know that foam ones output up and we know that from two's output went down,

340
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.110
but can anyone tell me what happened to total output and why?

341
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:56.500
There's a poll again.
Who thinks total outputs?

342
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:59.080
Who thinks total output went down?

343
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:00.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

344
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.620
<v 0>Who thinks total outputs stayed the same?</v>

345
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.050
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

346
00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:07.500
<v 0>I think it's total output went up.
There's lots of extensions.</v>

347
00:21:07.501 --> 00:21:10.760
Let's try that again.
Cause too many extensions.
Who thinks total output,
right?

348
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:15.630
Who thinks total output went down?
I think it's total output will stay the same.

349
00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:20.770
Who thinks total output went up?
That's pretty split,

350
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.770
so I think total out,

351
00:21:23.771 --> 00:21:28.771
I know actually the total output went up and I claim I can see it on the

352
00:21:29.261 --> 00:21:32.260
picture.
I clean.
If you stare at that picture,

353
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:36.670
you can actually see the total output must have gone up.

354
00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.810
Who's good at looking at a picture?
Let me get the mic in here,
right?

355
00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:46.610
The pictures of there.
Whoops.
Ah,
okay.
Okay.

356
00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:50.470
Let me try this person.
So your name is Andy.
Andy,
if,
go ahead.
Uh,

357
00:21:50.471 --> 00:21:52.780
judging by the slope of the line,
you know that as it moves,

358
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.950
the amount that Q one change will be greater than it not the Qq goes down.
Good.

359
00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:59.500
Good.
So it's what Andy said up.
Put it in here,
everyone.

360
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.640
What ad is saying is look at the slope of the line along which we slid,

361
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:08.380
right when we went from [inaudible] to the Stackelberg equilibrium,

362
00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:13.590
we started here and we slid in this direction down this line,

363
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.630
right?
Q.
I went up and Qsu went down.

364
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:21.950
And what Andy is pointing out is we can see from the slope of this line that Q

365
00:22:21.951 --> 00:22:26.951
one goes up more than one unit for every unit of reduction of,

366
00:22:27.521 --> 00:22:30.280
of,
uh,
of Q two.
Let me say it again.

367
00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:34.870
For every unit of increase of Q1,
there's less than that.

368
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:39.280
Less than a report.
Sorry,
say it again.
For every unit of increase of Q1,

369
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.830
there's less than the unit of decrease of Qsu.
Right?

370
00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:46.060
Another way of saying it is the slope of this line is less than one.

371
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:51.970
I want to see that.
Alright,
so we know by the slope of the line,

372
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:56.500
we know that Q one had to go up more than Q two went down,

373
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.380
which means total output went up,

374
00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:04.450
which means that prices went what I'm into price is this total output went up.

375
00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:08.710
That shouldn't be hard for everyone.
Second one 15 here,
right?

376
00:23:08.711 --> 00:23:13.150
So in total output went up,
prices went down.
Good.
Right?

377
00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.060
The cove slipping down,
it's not as important as backward induction,

378
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:18.820
but it's still quite important.
All right,
so prices went down.

379
00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:22.060
So therefore we now already just say what happened to from two's.

380
00:23:22.061 --> 00:23:27.061
Profits from two is producing less than before from two's costs to the same,

381
00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:31.690
and prices have gone down.
So what's happened to from two's profits?

382
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.630
They've got it.
They must have gone down as well.

383
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:38.520
So from tos,

384
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:43.760
profit has gone down and we know that consumer surplus,

385
00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:47.990
some sweat,
ces,
consumer surplus has gone up.
Right?

386
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.940
Consume it for those people.
Remember that one 15 prices have gone down,

387
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.530
quantity has gone up.
So consumer surplus,
yeah,
has gone up.
All right,

388
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:59.030
so we've analyzed everything qualitatively I can think of in this game without

389
00:23:59.031 --> 00:24:01.480
reference to any math at all.
Is that right?
We,

390
00:24:01.481 --> 00:24:04.250
we haven't done any math back and we generate a slope of a line.

391
00:24:04.251 --> 00:24:07.850
I guess that's Matt.
I guess that's math then the junior high or something,

392
00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:10.390
but we haven't really done any math there,
right?
Is that fair?
Is that fat?

393
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:11.241
All right,

394
00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:13.580
and we already have a pretty good intuition for it's going to go on in this

395
00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:17.750
market.
We think Q one is going to go up.
We think youtube is going to go down.

396
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:20.090
We think that from one's profit is going up.

397
00:24:20.091 --> 00:24:23.600
We think from to profits are going down.
We think total quantity is going up.

398
00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:28.530
All right,
now let's see if we're rights.
Let's go back and do the math.
All right.

399
00:24:28.531 --> 00:24:31.520
So I want to spend a bit of time grinding this out.

400
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.880
So I don't claim that during the math is fun,

401
00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:44.110
but I want to prove that we can do it because otherwise everyone's going to

402
00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.600
either thing,
this was all kind of just blah,

403
00:24:46.601 --> 00:24:51.601
Blah Blah and or people are going to be scared to do the math when it arrives on

404
00:24:52.481 --> 00:24:53.314
a homework assignment.

405
00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:56.743
<v 2>All right,</v>

406
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:03.040
<v 0>so for now we're going to more or less,
but it's a few minutes.</v>

407
00:25:03.041 --> 00:25:06.040
We're going to forget where economists and we're going to turn into nerds.

408
00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.610
That isn't a huge transition,
but what we'll do it anyway.
All right,

409
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.070
I've got the demand curve up there,
but let me,
all right,

410
00:25:12.071 --> 00:25:13.360
so the demand curve is still there.

411
00:25:13.361 --> 00:25:18.361
It's peak was a minus B Q one Q two and I've got profits written up there.

412
00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.750
Uh,
but let's put them somewhere more convenient anyway.

413
00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:25.420
So p equals a minus B.

414
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:30.430
He won plus Q two and profit

415
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
is equal to p per private firm from I is equal to Pqi minus Cqi.

416
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:47.340
Alright?
And what we were told to do and backward induction is what first of all,

417
00:25:47.341 --> 00:25:52.341
solve things out for from to taking from one has given and then go back and

418
00:25:53.281 --> 00:25:56.490
solve for from one.
So exactly the discussion we've just had informally.

419
00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:59.790
We're not going to do,
we're going to do more formally.
Alright,

420
00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.530
so backward induction tells us

421
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:08.110
solve for fum to first

422
00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:15.990
taking Q one has given.

423
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.310
And what does that problem is the sort of boring math problem.

424
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:25.580
It says maximize by choosing Q2 the profits of from one to that's going to be a

425
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.290
minus B,

426
00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:37.740
he won minus B Q two that's the price times the quantity Q2 minus c say,

427
00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:48.120
all right,
all right,
so this,
this bit here

428
00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.630
I spent here is the price,

429
00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:00.620
these two terms together,
our revenues on these spits Turner's costs.
All right?

430
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.200
Now I could do that.
I could grow in that bit out,

431
00:27:03.410 --> 00:27:06.410
but we ready ground that bit out three or three or four weeks ago,
right?

432
00:27:06.411 --> 00:27:09.140
So I'm not going to grind it out again.
We know how to do that.
But by the way,

433
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.760
this is reminding us.
That is what we did.

434
00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:15.440
We differentiated with respect to Q two we set the thing,

435
00:27:15.441 --> 00:27:17.240
we found the derivative equal to zero.

436
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.530
That was off first all the condition and then we solve for Q two.
That right?

437
00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.980
Is that right?
So when we did that,
when we did that,

438
00:27:24.981 --> 00:27:29.360
we went through the first door to condition
and then we solved this.

439
00:27:30.740 --> 00:27:32.350
We know what we actually got,
right?

440
00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:37.300
So what we actually got was that Q two star,

441
00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:41.590
if you like Q two as it's called,
this is equal to a mine,

442
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.600
the c over to B minus Q1 over to.

443
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:53.480
And in fact I've already given to help that it's,
it's on that top top board.

444
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:56.880
It's the best response for pharmacy.
So again,
I could do this again,
but we,

445
00:27:56.881 --> 00:27:59.120
since we did it a few weeks ago,
I didn't want to Redo it.

446
00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.613
<v 1>All right.</v>

447
00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.620
<v 0>All right.
Now the more interesting pause,</v>

448
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.950
no thrilling,
but a little bit more interesting.
All right,

449
00:28:12.951 --> 00:28:17.951
now let's solve full fun one.

450
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:20.961
All right,

451
00:28:20.961 --> 00:28:25.961
so what is film one doing from one is also trying to maximize profits.

452
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:31.210
Farm one is take his choosing Q one and from one at least initially it looks

453
00:28:33.171 --> 00:28:33.921
like the same problem.

454
00:28:33.921 --> 00:28:38.921
It's a minus B Q one minus B Kutu Times Q one minus c Q one.

455
00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:49.520
All right,
this is the same line we had before,
but now,

456
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:51.920
whereas from two was taking,

457
00:28:51.921 --> 00:28:56.921
Q one has given from one knows that Q is given by this formula here.

458
00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.571
All right,

459
00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:04.571
so what we're gonna do is we're going to plug this cue to enter there.

460
00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.890
All right?
Again,
for those of you in one 15 this isn't the only way to do it.

461
00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.770
Sort of one 50 this isn't the only way we could do it.

462
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.600
We could also set up a little garage in equation,

463
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:16.610
but for those people who don't know what that is,
don't worry.

464
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.920
We're going to plug in today.
All right,

465
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:23.090
so we're going to plug this in and when we plug it in,
we get a right old mess,

466
00:29:23.091 --> 00:29:24.200
but that's do it anyway,

467
00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:30.010
so we're going to get Max Q one a minus B.

468
00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:36.640
He one minus B pay brackets,

469
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:42.730
a minus c over to be minus Q one over too.

470
00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:50.380
Why don't I put this,
see inside the bracket as well when I'm here.
Okay,

471
00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:51.910
so minus c,

472
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.730
close bracket Q one.
All right,

473
00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.960
so let's just while I'm at it one night,
put the sea inside the bracket.

474
00:29:58.961 --> 00:30:02.890
Everyone okay with that?
I'm doing Algebra on the board,
which is not fun,

475
00:30:02.891 --> 00:30:06.130
but it's useful to do occasionally.
All right,

476
00:30:06.730 --> 00:30:08.170
so eventually what are we going to do?

477
00:30:08.171 --> 00:30:11.840
Eventually we're going to differentiate this thing said that you called it a

478
00:30:11.841 --> 00:30:15.640
zero in the car first or to condition and so on.
Just as we normally would.

479
00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.980
Eventually we're going to use basically a one 12 level calculus to solve this

480
00:30:20.981 --> 00:30:24.240
thing.
All right,
everyone,
them,
everyone remember how to,
how to map,

481
00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:29.170
how to solve a maximization problem.
Yeah,
but before we do that,

482
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:33.940
let's tidy up the Algebra bet.
All right,
so this thing is,
is just tied it up.

483
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:38.860
So this is equal to Max Specter Q one.

484
00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.270
A notice I've got,
I've got an um,

485
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:47.200
an a minus c here and a minus c here.
And once I take this,

486
00:30:47.201 --> 00:30:51.910
be inside the brackets,
I've got a minus a minus three over to here.

487
00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:53.320
<v 1>Okay.</v>

488
00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:57.320
<v 0>All right.
I got an a minus c minus and a minus t over two.</v>

489
00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:02.000
So that's going to give me an a minus c over too.

490
00:31:02.001 --> 00:31:05.450
And I'm really gonna pray that the TA's are watching me Catholic going to catch

491
00:31:05.451 --> 00:31:09.620
my errors here.
Okay.
If I think I'm okay so far,
but please catch me.
All right,

492
00:31:09.621 --> 00:31:10.454
what else have I got?

493
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:15.640
I've got a minus B key one here and from in this bracket I've got a minus minus,

494
00:31:18.411 --> 00:31:22.850
that's a plus B Q one over too much.

495
00:31:22.851 --> 00:31:25.880
I have a minus B,
I have a minus Bq one.

496
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:28.490
Plasa Bq won over too.

497
00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:33.170
So that's a minus B [inaudible] over two.

498
00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:39.110
So far so good.
And that whole thing is multiplied by Q one.

499
00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:41.661
Okay.

500
00:31:41.661 --> 00:31:45.200
So far let's multiply out the bracket cause I otherwise I'll make a mistake.

501
00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:50.440
So this is the same as saying a minus c over two times Q one minus B Q one

502
00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:59.930
squared over two.
So far so good.

503
00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:05.360
All right.
Now we're at the level where even my very rusty,
uh,

504
00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:08.240
memory of calc test will get us through.
Okay?
So let's try and do it.

505
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:11.270
It's all going to do is we're going to differentiate this thing with respect to

506
00:32:11.271 --> 00:32:15.470
Q one.
All right?
It's differentiate with Hector Q one.
Okay,

507
00:32:15.471 --> 00:32:18.950
so a differentiating respect to Q1.
Let's do it up here.

508
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:25.380
Differentiate with respects to Q1.

509
00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:29.420
We get a minus c

510
00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:35.530
over to from this term.
All right,

511
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:40.590
and from the minus Bq squared over two we're going to get the two are going to

512
00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.080
cancel all the pleasant late,

513
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.920
so we're going to get be Q1 from that term.

514
00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:47.490
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

515
00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:49.150
<v 0>All right,
everyone with me so far?</v>

516
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.650
I'm going through this and so slow steps.
I really,

517
00:32:53.651 --> 00:32:56.490
I agree it's not exciting but I want to try it out.
Make a mistake.
All right,

518
00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.260
so let's turn this into a first door to condition.

519
00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.910
What must be true about this derivative at that?
At the maximum,

520
00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:06.090
what must be true,
but this derivative
equal to zero.
Good,

521
00:33:06.210 --> 00:33:09.090
so you got a zero.
All right,

522
00:33:09.540 --> 00:33:12.080
we should just check the second order condition.
All right.

523
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:13.770
How do I check the second order conditioning?

524
00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:18.100
I differentiate again and check it's negative,
but I differentiate.
Again,

525
00:33:18.101 --> 00:33:21.400
I'm just going to get minus B minus B is certainly negative,
right?

526
00:33:21.401 --> 00:33:24.580
So second order conditions.
Okay.
Does that solve it out?

527
00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:30.060
Solving this for Q one I get Q1 is equal to a minus c over to Ben.

528
00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:38.290
All right.
Tell me what to leading and sheer boredom.

529
00:33:38.650 --> 00:33:40.450
It has to be done occasionally,
right?

530
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:43.900
Q one is a minus c over to be all right,

531
00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:45.700
and we're not done yet.

532
00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:49.570
No one want to go back and saw that algebraically for Qsu.

533
00:33:49.571 --> 00:33:52.690
I know Q one is now can you want as a minus t over to be?

534
00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.730
How do I find Q2 somebody shout it out.
How do I find,

535
00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.100
how do I find two to now I've got to plug it in,
right?
I got to pee.

536
00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:05.180
I'm going to go back and plug this Q one

537
00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:09.160
back into this expression here.

538
00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.900
It's my plug it back in and I'll get Q two is equal to a minus c over to B minus

539
00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:25.590
a half of a minus c over to B for a total of a minus.

540
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:36.010
Uh,
see,
uh,
over

541
00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:43.090
four B.
Is that right?
That's what happened.
My notes.

542
00:34:43.091 --> 00:34:47.230
This looks good.
All right,
so I'm now done.
I'm not found that equilibrium.

543
00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:51.850
I found that in this leader followship gave this Stackelberg version of quantity

544
00:34:51.851 --> 00:34:55.900
competition.
Q one is given by a minus C of a to B

545
00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:02.980
and Q two is given by a minus C of a for B.

546
00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:07.090
Let's see how it matches up with the intuition we developed before without using

547
00:35:07.091 --> 00:35:10.750
any boring math.
All right,
so first of all,

548
00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:15.780
what comparing Q one and Q two with what they used to produce and what they used

549
00:35:16.721 --> 00:35:19.930
to produce is on the top board?
Well they used to produce,

550
00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:24.130
I can use this to guide the camera as well.

551
00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:28.330
Well they used to produce is a minus c over three B,

552
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.063
is that right?

553
00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:35.340
So our claim was that we think the new Q one is bigger than the old corner

554
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:38.370
quantity.
So now,

555
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.680
now from one is producing a minus c over tubey.

556
00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:46.890
Previously it was bruising a minus c over three B.
It's not is indeed bigger.

557
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:49.710
That's good news.
All right,
so this is indeed

558
00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:53.850
bigger than coupon.
No.

559
00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.320
And our claim was that from two or produce less than the old corn.
Oh quantity.

560
00:35:58.640 --> 00:35:59.900
So from a,

561
00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:05.030
from to use to produce a minus c over three B and now it's producing a minus t

562
00:36:05.231 --> 00:36:09.920
over four B.
And that is indeed less than the old corner.

563
00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:14.790
Quasi.
All right,
so far so good.
What about total output?

564
00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:20.130
How do I solve for total output?
Add the two outputs together.

565
00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:22.920
That's not too hard.
All right,
so Q one

566
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.220
plus Q two

567
00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:32.900
is equal to am I in a c over to B plus a minus t over four B,

568
00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:38.080
which is in fact a three AC over three ac over four B.

569
00:36:38.081 --> 00:36:38.914
Is that right?

570
00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:43.970
So it's going to be a three a minus c over four beats.

571
00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:49.680
So I just actually for the first time today I skipped a stack,
but is that okay?

572
00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:52.410
A half plus a quarter of three quarters.
Okay.
All right,
so,

573
00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:58.160
so total outputs is three AC over four B.

574
00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:03.570
What was total output before
weight used to be the core?

575
00:37:03.571 --> 00:37:06.510
No total outputs.
It's put it here somewhere.

576
00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:16.080
This is bigger than to a minus c over three B.

577
00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.130
Which is equal to the corner quantity.

578
00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:24.590
He wants the plus QCC.

579
00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:26.651
All right,

580
00:37:26.651 --> 00:37:29.650
so everything we predicted just by looking at the picture and thinking about the

581
00:37:29.651 --> 00:37:33.400
economics works out in the math.
That's a good thing.

582
00:37:33.401 --> 00:37:35.920
We should feel a little bit relieved.
I'm getting a little bit relieved.

583
00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.680
All right.
All right.

584
00:37:38.681 --> 00:37:41.860
Everything we thought about it and she really just using the economics,

585
00:37:41.861 --> 00:37:46.030
the logic of the situation when we grind out the Algebra we get the right

586
00:37:46.031 --> 00:37:49.710
answers.
We get confirming answers.
Alright.

587
00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:53.560
Ever a case that there isn't a particularly fun exercise per se,

588
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:57.970
but I want to do it just to show that you can use backward induction to solve

589
00:37:57.971 --> 00:38:00.040
that problems.
Exactly right.

590
00:38:00.041 --> 00:38:02.290
Backward induction and a little bit of what you learned in the,

591
00:38:02.291 --> 00:38:06.220
in the high school and or freshman calculus can get you the answer.

592
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.250
<v 2>All right.</v>

593
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:09.851
<v 0>All right,</v>

594
00:38:09.851 --> 00:38:12.790
so now I want to leave aside the math and go back to the economics again.

595
00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:15.250
All right,
so we started off with a question.

596
00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:19.450
Who would you rather be from one or from to,

597
00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:21.940
and we know the answer now.
Who would you rather be from?

598
00:38:21.941 --> 00:38:24.520
One off them too from one right?

599
00:38:24.521 --> 00:38:27.700
Cause for one's profits went up and from two's profits went down.

600
00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:31.510
Let's just talk about this a little bit about what's going on here.

601
00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:37.260
So from one in previously one and two are just sending quantities and Martinez

602
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:41.590
sleep,
right?
We know now there's an advantage in going first.

603
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:46.630
So I suppose we changed the game from the simultaneous move game to a game in

604
00:38:46.631 --> 00:38:50.140
which foam one and form two can make announcements.
All right?

605
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.120
They can announce how much they going to produce.

606
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.030
So from one comes in one day and says,

607
00:38:55.120 --> 00:39:00.120
I'm going to produce this much and found two comes in and can see foam ones

608
00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:02.050
announcements,
right?
So change it.

609
00:39:02.051 --> 00:39:04.750
I've changed into a sequential game from one is announced how much it's going to

610
00:39:04.751 --> 00:39:09.280
produce from two is going to go afterwards.
Is that really a sequential game?

611
00:39:09.281 --> 00:39:12.740
Is that going to make a difference?
Why is that?

612
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:15.830
I claim that's not really enough.
Let me say it again.
We start,

613
00:39:15.831 --> 00:39:17.480
we start from the simultaneous move game.

614
00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.730
If we just change it by simply allowing from one to announce what they're going

615
00:39:21.731 --> 00:39:22.850
to produce,
don't actually produce it,

616
00:39:22.851 --> 00:39:24.320
but just announced what they're going to produce.

617
00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:28.250
You might think that's a sequential move game and you might think that from one

618
00:39:28.251 --> 00:39:31.350
now has an advantage.
But I'm claiming that's not enough already.

619
00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:34.490
The gift from one advantage.
Why?
Why is that not enough?

620
00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:37.010
Let's try and get some ideas.
Yeah.

621
00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:38.323
<v 2>Okay.</v>

622
00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:43.080
<v 0>Uh,
we come around this side,
so
yes.</v>

623
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.870
So Patrick,
why is,
why is that not enough?

624
00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.040
There's no credible commitment that you're going to produce it that level.
Good.

625
00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:54.410
Good.
So imagine these two firms are,
uh,

626
00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:59.450
let's say that they're a newspaper producing firms and one is owned by a nbcs

627
00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:04.660
parent company and one is owned by Rupert Murdoch.
Right?
And then move,

628
00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:09.520
they're moving into this new market and the market is a town that that's a but

629
00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:10.523
both.
I'm going to eat it again.

630
00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:13.500
I'm going to issue newspapers and this market and this market that currently

631
00:40:13.501 --> 00:40:16.170
doesn't have any newspapers and murder ultimately says,

632
00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:18.780
I'm going to produce lots of newspapers.
Right?

633
00:40:18.781 --> 00:40:23.280
There's no reason for NBC to believe that.
All right?
So moving first here,

634
00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:25.590
it isn't enough to just say you're going to move first.

635
00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:30.640
It isn't enough even to make a decision that's reversible,
right?

636
00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:34.560
Even if even if you want move.
But that was,
that decision could be undone.

637
00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:37.890
That isn't enough.
What we need,
and Patrick had gave us the key word.

638
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:42.000
What we need is commitment.
The word that came up last week.
All right,

639
00:40:42.001 --> 00:40:45.750
so for this,
for this,
for moving first to help you here,

640
00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.790
there really has to be commitment.
Let's just get some of this down.

641
00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.380
The really needs to be commitment for this to work.

642
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:14.660
So going back to the example of Murdoch and his competitor,
uh,

643
00:41:14.830 --> 00:41:19.540
Modo actually has to build the plant that actually has to be a factory that he's

644
00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:23.340
built in.
I'm not factory can't just be sold for scrap,
right?

645
00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.650
So what craves the commitment and the case when you've built the plant is what,

646
00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:31.640
because having built it,
it's a sunk cost.
It's there,
right?

647
00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:33.590
So sunk costs can help here.

648
00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:38.413
<v 1>Okay,</v>

649
00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:43.480
<v 0>sunk costs
can help,
we can help make you,
you committed.</v>

650
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:45.440
Once that money is gone,
you can't get it back.

651
00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:48.110
So you're really committed to that,
to that,
to that scale.

652
00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:52.070
Does everyone know what I mean by Seung costs by the way?
Yup.
Okay.

653
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:57.190
So here's a case where a strategic move entering first and sinking some

654
00:41:57.381 --> 00:42:01.970
investments can help you in the market place.
All right,

655
00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:04.340
let's also look at this another way.

656
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:10.090
Let's again go back to the simultaneous move game that we had before where a

657
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:15.140
Murdoch and his competitor,
the NBC Parent Compact Corporation,
Ah,
ah,

658
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.160
um,
in fact going to move simultaneously.

659
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:21.680
So both of them are in the business of discussing how big a newspaper plant to

660
00:42:21.681 --> 00:42:24.770
put in this new town,
which hasn't got a newspaper yet.
All right.

661
00:42:24.771 --> 00:42:27.590
Somewhere in Alabama or something.
I don't know.
All right.

662
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:32.270
I suppose suppose that,
uh,
that there are two boardrooms,

663
00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:37.250
both of which are avidly just trying to discuss how big a newspaper plant to

664
00:42:37.251 --> 00:42:41.740
bells.
All right.
So suppose that one of the board rooms,

665
00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:46.580
one of the board rooms are these four people on this,
this road.
This is,

666
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:47.590
this is the,
uh,

667
00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:52.370
NBC parent company boardroom it and they're trying to decide how big a plant to

668
00:42:52.371 --> 00:42:57.270
bells.
All right.
And uh,
over on the other side of the room is our,

669
00:42:57.271 --> 00:43:01.600
uh,
our Murdoch group,
which is in fact,
uh,
uh,
let's take the,

670
00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:02.520
the road parallel.

671
00:43:02.521 --> 00:43:06.620
So these guys over there or our mode on our news international group.

672
00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:09.580
All right,
there's this simultaneous move back games.

673
00:43:09.581 --> 00:43:10.540
So basically we're in corner.

674
00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:16.250
All right now I suppose that Murdoch just to pick a name out of the hat and

675
00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:19.250
meant what might not be the most moral gentleman in the world.

676
00:43:19.251 --> 00:43:24.251
Who knows and suppose that he in fact has hired one of the people in the NBC a

677
00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.390
board room.
In fact,
this guy,
what's his name?
Ryan.

678
00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.270
He's hired Ryan to be a spy.

679
00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.680
So Murdoch has a spy in the,
in the NBC boardroom.

680
00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:41.120
So mono has got an advantage here information wise.
Why?

681
00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:45.440
Because the NBC boardroom doesn't know what's going on in the Murdoch board.

682
00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.540
A board room,
but the murder board,
a board room,

683
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:52.400
it is going to know what's going on in the MBC boardroom.

684
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:55.830
But to make them a problem more interesting.

685
00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:01.160
Suppose that somebody tells NBC parent company then in fact there is a spy in

686
00:44:03.481 --> 00:44:07.470
their boardroom.
Right?
So these guys know that they have a spy.

687
00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:10.910
They don't know it.
It if they knew it was they beat him up or farm or something.

688
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:15.600
Well maybe not.
All right,
but,
but,
but they know that someone's,

689
00:44:15.601 --> 00:44:18.990
there aren't men.
Maybe they even suspect it's Ryan.

690
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:24.650
So what should NBC do here?
I wash it.

691
00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:27.920
What decisions did NBC mate,
one thing they could do is they could earn,

692
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:29.070
they don't know it's Ryan,

693
00:44:29.071 --> 00:44:33.000
but Ryan has a sort of Murdoch face and they might just fire him on that.

694
00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:37.920
He might be a spy,
right?
Oh,
what should they do here?

695
00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:43.530
Can you take us,
if you're on the mood,
you're in the embassy boardroom,

696
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:47.310
you know that Murdoch has some spying the camp.
What should you do?

697
00:44:49.330 --> 00:44:50.790
<v 2>You can come up with it</v>

698
00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:54.860
<v 0>fake plan and see if it goes back to Murdoch.
All right,
so,
so your,</v>

699
00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:55.930
your name is Chris.

700
00:44:55.990 --> 00:45:00.030
So Chris is suggesting come up with a fake plan to feed it back to Moodle.

701
00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:02.230
So Chris has been reading spy novels,
right?
Right.

702
00:45:02.231 --> 00:45:04.360
So this was a John Le Carre novel.
That's certainly what you do.

703
00:45:04.361 --> 00:45:08.380
You create a whole bunch of fake information to feed back to the Russians right

704
00:45:08.381 --> 00:45:11.690
through this by who in fact you've discovered all right.
And,
and that,

705
00:45:11.691 --> 00:45:13.840
that isn't a bad idea.
That might,
that might be a good thing to do.

706
00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:15.940
It's pretty hard to do,
right?
Because ultimately this,

707
00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:18.790
this actual decisions have to be made in the boardroom.

708
00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:21.520
Contracts have to be assigned and so on.
But I think Chris,

709
00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:23.050
to the right idea here so quick,

710
00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:27.240
Chris's idea is create a fake plan to feed back to Modok to give mode up some

711
00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:30.520
misinformation.
But there's another thing you could do.
I mean,

712
00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:34.000
and it gets my husband,
it's contributed yet.
Anyone and anyone else.
Yeah.
Yeah.

713
00:45:34.001 --> 00:45:36.210
What's your name?
What's going on?
So it was mine.

714
00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:40.780
What would you do these guys get the first move now effectively because they can

715
00:45:40.781 --> 00:45:43.600
just decide.
They know,
say what you just said,

716
00:45:43.601 --> 00:45:45.280
but shout out to everyone going to hear.
Um,

717
00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:48.940
NBC now gets the first move because they can decide and they know the other

718
00:45:48.941 --> 00:45:53.080
people are going to respond to it.
All right,
good.
Good.
So,
so I was man,

719
00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:58.060
what asthma is suggesting is maybe you don't feed Murdoch a fake plan.

720
00:45:58.270 --> 00:46:01.140
You fake you,
you feed mode out in the true plan.
Right?

721
00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:06.250
Offensively what's going to happen now is if NBC decided to build a large plant,

722
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:11.110
this information will be fed back to Murdoch and Murdoch is now in the position

723
00:46:11.111 --> 00:46:15.190
of being the second mover,
right?
What,
when,
when murder moves,

724
00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:19.960
he or she knows what NBC is doing,
right?

725
00:46:19.961 --> 00:46:23.770
And NBC knows that Murdoch is going to choose the best response to that.

726
00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:27.100
So it has,
if NBC has been moved,

727
00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:31.210
has been put in the position of I'm one and Murdoch has been put into the

728
00:46:31.211 --> 00:46:35.500
position of I'm too even with the correct plan.
So the correct,

729
00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:39.500
the correct thing to do here from NBC is not,
not necessarily to mislead Murdoch,

730
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:41.470
but just go ahead and build a big pumps,

731
00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:45.460
have that information be fed to Murdoch and that Murdoch respond to it.

732
00:46:45.940 --> 00:46:49.360
So notice here isn't it as a slightly paradoxical thing.

733
00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:54.900
You might think that having a spy in the camp of the other team having a spy,

734
00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:00.990
you might think having a spy would help you,

735
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:06.860
but here having a spy or having more information that you like,

736
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:12.860
having more information

737
00:47:15.410 --> 00:47:17.780
can actually end up hurting you.

738
00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:23.510
All right.
I want to see that.
Paradoxically,

739
00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:26.720
Murdock ends up losing by the fact that he,
he,

740
00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:30.910
he was able to predict what NBC we're going to.
Now there's a key to this.

741
00:47:30.911 --> 00:47:34.750
Of course it was crucial to the arguments.
What was crucial to the argument.

742
00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:39.751
It was crucial to the arguments that NBC knew that Murdoch had a spy.

743
00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:42.700
Right?
The key here is,

744
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:44.733
<v 2>Huh?</v>

745
00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.780
<v 0>That the other side,
the other players,</v>

746
00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.230
the other players new

747
00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:58.760
you had,
we're going to have more information,

748
00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:04.283
<v 2>right?</v>

749
00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:08.750
<v 0>So what's the bigger idea here?
There are two bigger ideas.
Bigger idea.</v>

750
00:48:08.751 --> 00:48:13.751
Number one is games being simultaneous or sequential is not really about timing

751
00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:18.740
per se.
It's about information.

752
00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:21.920
It's about who knows what and who knows that.

753
00:48:21.921 --> 00:48:24.170
Who's going to know what my,

754
00:48:24.171 --> 00:48:29.171
in a situation where from one our boardroom over here knows that Murdoch is

755
00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:33.440
going to have this information before MODOK moves.

756
00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:37.570
That's actually a sequential game,
right?

757
00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:41.030
The timing is how much I like a relevant,
how's the first observation.

758
00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:43.400
And the second observation is already on the board.

759
00:48:43.790 --> 00:48:48.160
What we've learned is sometimes more in strategic settings,

760
00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:52.790
sometimes it's not always more information can hurt you.

761
00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.350
Sometimes more information can hurt,

762
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:57.680
will be careful here because that's not always true.

763
00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.400
But sometimes it's true and the way that,

764
00:49:00.401 --> 00:49:04.040
the reason that's true is the reason is

765
00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:11.880
it can lead other players.

766
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:14.803
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

767
00:49:15.090 --> 00:49:19.050
<v 0>So take actions in this case to create a large plant</v>

768
00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:24.663
<v 2>that hurts you.</v>

769
00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.500
<v 0>Have you put Monday's lecture together with today's lecture,</v>

770
00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:30.540
we've seen something in uh,

771
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:34.140
to two very simple things arose on Monday's lecture.

772
00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:36.420
Having fewer options,

773
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:41.750
burning your boats ended up helping you or having lower payoffs by putting

774
00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:46.680
collateral down ended up helping you.
And that might seem like a paradox,

775
00:49:46.681 --> 00:49:50.760
but it isn't really a paradox because what happened was provided the other side

776
00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:52.410
knows you have fewer options.

777
00:49:52.411 --> 00:49:55.610
I know you've brought your boats or they know your software,

778
00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:58.050
a few defaults on the loan,
they know you've posted collateral.

779
00:49:58.200 --> 00:50:01.950
It will lead them to take behavior that helps you.
In the case of the loan,

780
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:06.260
it led to the lender giving you a bigger loan.
In the case of the sacks,
know me,

781
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.140
you at least hope it leads to the Saxon army running away,
right?

782
00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:14.610
Today we see that more information can hurt you.
And once again,

783
00:50:14.611 --> 00:50:17.040
it isn't really a paradox.
It's the same kind of argument.

784
00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:18.960
The fact that the other side,
no,

785
00:50:18.961 --> 00:50:23.010
you're going to have this extra information leads them to take actions that end

786
00:50:23.011 --> 00:50:27.090
up hurting you.
Alright?
So in games,

787
00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.920
unlike him in a standard single person decision problems,

788
00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:35.630
more information can hurt and more options can hurt.
All right,

789
00:50:35.631 --> 00:50:40.040
and here's the reason.
All right,
now one other thing to say about this.

790
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:46.130
The game we just looked at the Stackelberg game we just looked at as an example

791
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:50.720
of something pretty famous.
It's an example of first mover advantage.

792
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:57.950
It's an example of a game with a first mover

793
00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:05.030
advantage.
Alright?
Now,

794
00:51:05.031 --> 00:51:07.310
how many of you have heard how many are in the room,

795
00:51:07.311 --> 00:51:12.311
have heard the term first mover advantage before spheres that seriously,

796
00:51:12.381 --> 00:51:13.790
how many of the rest of you,

797
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:16.290
how many of you have not heard the term first mover advantage before?

798
00:51:16.291 --> 00:51:18.150
We don't want to see.
All right,

799
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:21.770
so I'm always wary of first mover advantage as a terminal.

800
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:24.050
If you ask the students in the business school,

801
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:25.940
how many of you have heard the term,
they've all heard it.

802
00:51:26.090 --> 00:51:28.490
It's a very popular business school term.

803
00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:32.570
It's a very popular term that you see in bad books.

804
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:36.650
So let me just warn you a little bit about this.
So if you go to the,

805
00:51:36.651 --> 00:51:37.550
to the airport,

806
00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:41.690
let's say to Hartford airport and the flight you want to get on his late,

807
00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:46.840
which is usually the case and you hence you end up in the bookstore and you find

808
00:51:47.211 --> 00:51:49.130
yourself on the economics and business shells,

809
00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:53.750
you start looking at the a a strategy books and typically the kind of book you

810
00:51:53.751 --> 00:51:58.070
find that the airports on business or strategy or economics is a pretty bad
book.

811
00:51:58.770 --> 00:51:59.600
All right,
so it has some,

812
00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:04.250
it has some embossed cover and it says strategy for dummies or uh,

813
00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:07.490
my boring life by a famous CEO,
right?

814
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:13.390
And I worry about these books because you ended up buying these books.

815
00:52:13.431 --> 00:52:17.930
You've got time on your hands and you read them and they give you absolutely

816
00:52:17.931 --> 00:52:22.010
terrible advice.
All right?
So not always,
but almost always.

817
00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:26.630
And the kinds of things they'll say is it's always a good idea to move first

818
00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:30.410
because that way you'll have a first mover advantage.
Alright?

819
00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:32.160
And this sounds right.

820
00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:37.040
I'm always worried about things that sound rights because they may be sound

821
00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:40.140
right,
Mimi in there,
right?
But the promise,
if they're wrong,
that tempting they,

822
00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:42.290
there's,
there's,
there's a law you in,
right?

823
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:46.280
So it's good to move first cause that we have a first mover advantage sounds

824
00:52:46.281 --> 00:52:49.160
right,
but it's nonsense,
right?

825
00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:52.610
There are situations of which this is one,

826
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.410
there are situations where it's good to move first in quantity competition.

827
00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:01.130
It's good to set your quantity to be committed and that will lead the other side

828
00:53:01.131 --> 00:53:02.420
to produce things,
a smaller quantity,

829
00:53:02.421 --> 00:53:07.421
which helps you so sure that all situations that are games in which you want to

830
00:53:07.941 --> 00:53:08.774
move first,

831
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:13.430
but there are also games in which you'd rather move second.

832
00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:17.060
Let me give you an example.
All right?

833
00:53:17.061 --> 00:53:20.900
This is his own voice in this class before rock,
paper,
scissors.

834
00:53:22.810 --> 00:53:26.550
All right?
If anybody is going to read those books and believe them,
you know,

835
00:53:26.551 --> 00:53:28.920
so if anyone's going to read,
uh,
you know how,

836
00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:32.780
how to discover your Inner Bill Gates and base their life on it and therefore I

837
00:53:32.810 --> 00:53:35.430
think there's a first mover advantage.
I want to play rock,
paper,
scissors.

838
00:53:35.431 --> 00:53:38.530
Was that person?
All right?
All right.
Everyone happy that you'd,

839
00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:40.370
you'd rather go second and rock,
paper,
scissors.

840
00:53:40.440 --> 00:53:43.920
Do I need to prove that or is that all of it?
Okay.
Okay,
good.
All right.

841
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.390
Let me just expand a little bit,

842
00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.060
a bit more and more into a more real world setting.

843
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.960
There are plenty of settings in the real world where the advantage of moving

844
00:53:51.961 --> 00:53:54.480
second,
isn't it?
Because as in rock,
paper,
scissors,

845
00:53:54.481 --> 00:53:55.890
you've just got to crush the other guy.

846
00:53:56.340 --> 00:54:00.480
It's simply that you learn from their mistakes.
All right,
so for example,

847
00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:04.470
in the game of buying new equipment for the office or home,

848
00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:08.880
it's great to move.
Second,
the other guy goes out and [inaudible] samples,

849
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:11.090
some new piece of equipment.
I wait to see if it's,

850
00:54:11.091 --> 00:54:13.950
see if it works and then buy it.
If it does,
all right,

851
00:54:13.951 --> 00:54:16.950
or if I'm sitting up from in a new expanding market,

852
00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:19.530
let's say a new part of the former Soviet Union,

853
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:22.920
I'm quite happy to let some other firms go in there first and then watch what

854
00:54:22.921 --> 00:54:24.660
they did and try and learn from their mistakes.

855
00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:27.810
If I'm seeing a new curriculum for a university,

856
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:32.430
I'm quite happy to let other universities do can Cornell and so on move first

857
00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:34.410
and then I can go in and Yay,

858
00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:36.810
I'll see what they did and for sure that we've made mistakes and I learned from

859
00:54:36.811 --> 00:54:38.210
that.
All right.

860
00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:42.810
There's plenty of obvious situations where moving second helps you for the

861
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:47.690
obvious reason,
that information is often very useful,
right?

862
00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.790
We all,
you'd hear information can hurt you,

863
00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:55.110
but there's plenty of other perfectly natural situations we're in a information

864
00:54:55.111 --> 00:54:59.020
is to your advantage.
All right,
so they're all games is first mover advantages,

865
00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:01.290
but there are also games with second mover advantages.

866
00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:05.100
And let me give you one example of a game that neither has a first mover

867
00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:08.160
advantage or a second mover advantage just to convince you that can happen as

868
00:55:08.161 --> 00:55:10.530
well.
So when you were a child,

869
00:55:10.770 --> 00:55:15.770
you probably occasionally a hat to divide a cake and or candy bar with your

870
00:55:16.351 --> 00:55:17.580
siblings,
anyone,

871
00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.910
anyone to be in this situation there was some candy bar or a cake and you had to

872
00:55:20.911 --> 00:55:24.240
divide.
This thing was in you and your brother and our sister,
is that right?

873
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:28.170
And there's a way in which there's a typical way in which we divide things among

874
00:55:28.171 --> 00:55:31.440
siblings in that setting.
There's a game we played to divide it.

875
00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:34.920
What's the game we play?
Anyone?
Yeah,

876
00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:37.560
all cotton you choose or vice versa.
Right?

877
00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:42.720
So all cotton you choose Nike that has a first mover advantage or a second mover

878
00:55:42.721 --> 00:55:43.554
advantage.

879
00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:46.440
I assuming you can cut accurate late at night that has a first mover advantage

880
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:47.440
or a second movie volunteers,

881
00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:50.970
which is precisely why it's a good way to divide the candy bar.

882
00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:53.193
All right?

883
00:55:53.730 --> 00:55:57.150
Not a rub this point home and because we've had a very dry and extra up are now

884
00:55:57.450 --> 00:56:01.920
let's play a game.
All right,
so everyone would wake up.
Now math is over.

885
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:07.530
I want to play a game and the game I want to play for the rest of today is

886
00:56:07.531 --> 00:56:08.460
called Nim

887
00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:13.860
and it's not going to surprise you that one of the things we're going to learn

888
00:56:13.861 --> 00:56:18.450
in this game is that sometimes games have a first mover advantage and sometimes

889
00:56:18.451 --> 00:56:21.510
games have a second mover advantage.
So I'm giving away the punchline.

890
00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:29.600
How many of you have played in them before?
Okay,
if you played it before,

891
00:56:29.601 --> 00:56:33.050
you can't play now,
right?
So it didn't,
don't shout out.
All right,

892
00:56:33.051 --> 00:56:34.010
so this is the game.

893
00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:38.630
There are two players and there are two piles of stones.

894
00:56:38.810 --> 00:56:42.890
We'll make the piles of stones into,
into just chalk lines on the board.

895
00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:47.500
The players are going to move sequentially in each turn.

896
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:49.940
The player who's turn it is to move,

897
00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:54.860
picks one of the two piles and removes some of the stones,

898
00:56:54.861 --> 00:56:56.320
which will just be lines on the board.
So they did,

899
00:56:56.330 --> 00:57:01.330
they decide how many of those lines to delete each time it's your turn you out,

900
00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:03.830
you get to move again.
You can choose the other pile.

901
00:57:03.831 --> 00:57:06.160
This time you move sequentially.
And the only,

902
00:57:06.161 --> 00:57:11.161
the rule that matters is the person who gets the last stone wins.

903
00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:17.480
All right?
So for example,
here's a case where there's one,
two,
three,
four,

904
00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:22.190
five,
six,
seven stones on this pile and one,
two,
three,

905
00:57:22.191 --> 00:57:25.040
four stones on this pile.
All right,

906
00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:27.620
so I'm going to get some volunteers to come on the stage and do this,

907
00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:32.330
but I was told I should choose a volunteer.
So is uh,
is leashing Chang here,

908
00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:38.020
at least in Shanghai.
It's Allegion.
Shannon's going to volunteer for this.
I'm,

909
00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:41.810
I'm volunteering.
Leashing Chang cause it's his birthday.
All right,
so,
so,

910
00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:44.520
so then you get a round of applause.
Felician Chang,
you come on and say

911
00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:49.660
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

912
00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:54.560
<v 0>who wants to play against leashing Chang?
That's it.
That's it.</v>

913
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:57.710
Maybe anyone else wanna play.
Who hasn't played a game yet.

914
00:57:58.370 --> 00:58:02.450
How about the guy with a Yale hat on back there?
Uh,
the white yellow hat.

915
00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:06.170
I'm staring right at the guy.
He's not,
yeah,
you,
this is going to come up.

916
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:11.060
All right.
What's your,
what's your name?
Evan.

917
00:58:11.330 --> 00:58:15.560
Evan and unleashing T.
Is it leashing?
Leashing and haven't come up on the stage.

918
00:58:15.561 --> 00:58:16.550
There's a step up yet.

919
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:20.780
<v 1>Come on.
Come on.
Come on.</v>

920
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:23.133
<v 0>All right.</v>

921
00:58:27.690 --> 00:58:28.523
All right,
so we'll let,

922
00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:31.740
we'll let leashing go first and when I haven't go second then you played this

923
00:58:31.741 --> 00:58:35.610
game before.
Okay.
How did you hear the games?
Who explained the rules again?
Well,

924
00:58:35.611 --> 00:58:37.890
these people are sleeping.
All right.
All right.
And who was sleeping then?

925
00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:40.650
The game is backward induction,
but,
okay,
so,
all right,

926
00:58:40.651 --> 00:58:42.720
so the rules of the game of this,

927
00:58:42.930 --> 00:58:47.670
they're going to take turns in each turn Vegan to pick one of these two piles.

928
00:58:47.671 --> 00:58:52.671
This is pile a and this is pile B and they're going to tell me how many of these

929
00:58:53.551 --> 00:58:57.660
chalk lines to delete.
Yeah,
that's a good idea.
Thank you.

930
00:58:59.150 --> 00:59:01.740
They're going to tell me how many of these chalk lines to delete.
Thanks.

931
00:59:02.090 --> 00:59:05.970
All right.
And I'm going to leave this lines.
We're going to go on playing until,

932
00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:08.220
until somebody gets the last line.

933
00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:13.230
The person who gets the last line wins.
Okay.
I guess the last one,

934
00:59:13.231 --> 00:59:16.320
when you can take,
you can get the last line tended to go.
It doesn't have to.

935
00:59:16.321 --> 00:59:18.180
It doesn't have to be the only one on the board when you get the last time.

936
00:59:18.181 --> 00:59:20.940
But the person who gets the last line wins.
All right,

937
00:59:20.941 --> 00:59:25.350
so have to pick a pile each go and tell me how many lines to remove.
So Lisa,

938
00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:26.061
why don't you go first?

939
00:59:26.061 --> 00:59:29.390
You can choose pylay or pile B and tell me how many lines to remove.

940
00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:34.850
Any advice from the audience?
No advice is you want to on your own hand.

941
00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:36.193
<v 1>Okay.</v>

942
00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:42.610
<v 0>Can you remove three from pile a three from pile a.
Okay,</v>

943
00:59:42.611 --> 00:59:47.350
so three from pile a uh,
Evan,
your time.

944
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:52.550
<v 1>Okay.</v>

945
00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:54.690
<v 0>What are you standing there with the board so we can get you in there.
Have A,</v>

946
00:59:58.870 --> 01:00:02.170
and your move to from pilot to firm to firm pile a.
Okay,

947
01:00:02.171 --> 01:00:04.540
so pile is the pocket up while on here.

948
01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:21.780
Two from pile B two from pile of B.

949
01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:26.880
<v 1>Okay.</v>

950
01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.210
<v 0>Spence,
this building here,</v>

951
01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:41.590
one from pile B,
one from pile B.
Right.

952
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:49.920
Should get fostered the stage.
Go on to from pile a weight loss.
Don't wins.

953
01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:50.763
Last stoneware

954
01:00:52.020 --> 01:00:53.610
<v 1>lost.
Don't wind Catholic.</v>

955
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:57.510
It's his birthday.
Come on.

956
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:05.470
<v 0>Last stone wins the person who gets the last stone winds personally.</v>

957
01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:09.470
So one from a,
all right.
One from a

958
01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:15.130
kind of stay.
And so I from B,

959
01:01:15.290 --> 01:01:18.620
one from beat the Lisa is the winner here.

960
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.440
<v 1>All.
Alright.</v>

961
01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:25.090
<v 0>Hi.
Very good.
Very good.
Let's get two more volunteers.</v>

962
01:01:25.110 --> 01:01:29.440
All so everyone understand the game now.
Thank you very much then hun.
All right,

963
01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.080
two more volunteers.
Yeah.
Have you played before?
Come.
Come on.

964
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:38.800
I want to get some female volunteers.
It can't be a male only class.
There we go.

965
01:01:38.801 --> 01:01:39.634
Thank you.

966
01:01:49.630 --> 01:01:52.570
This may not be as important in economics and doing the Stackelberg model,

967
01:01:52.571 --> 01:01:55.510
but it's probably a little more fun.
All right,

968
01:01:55.511 --> 01:02:00.310
and your names are John,
Christine,
John and Christine.
Okay.

969
01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.540
All right,
so,
okay,
so let's make it a bit more complicated this time.
So one,
two,

970
01:02:04.541 --> 01:02:09.340
three,
four,
five,
one,
two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,
eight,
nine,

971
01:02:09.341 --> 01:02:14.200
10,
11,
12,
13 and one,
two,
three,
four,

972
01:02:14.201 --> 01:02:15.460
five,
six,
seven.

973
01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.500
So I'll pick two prime numbers if that's important and see what is,

974
01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:24.390
uh,
why don't we say ladies first?
I think we've probably today.
So Christina,

975
01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.930
your choice.
Uh,
this one started off at 13,

976
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:33.870
I believe.
And this one started off at seven to me,
I counted correctly.

977
01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.213
We get out of the way.

978
01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:42.410
Six from piling six,
six for about here.
One,

979
01:02:42.411 --> 01:02:46.520
two,
three,
four,
five.
Is that right?

980
01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:49.850
Is that right?
One,
two,
three.
Okay.

981
01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:53.040
Three from pile bay three from pile,
B,

982
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:59.090
three from piling.
Three from pile,
a,

983
01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:05.060
one from pile day one from pile,
be right.

984
01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:09.920
Here's one from Thailand.
All right.
It's right.
We're onto this right.

985
01:03:09.921 --> 01:03:14.450
One from pile B,
one from pilot.

986
01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.840
Alright,
one from pal bit.
All right.

987
01:03:19.070 --> 01:03:23.630
One from Pilate.
Alright,
one from pile.
A.
Ah,
okay.

988
01:03:23.631 --> 01:03:26.930
It'll switch one from pile B.
All right,
so I'm going to see it as the way now.

989
01:03:26.931 --> 01:03:31.190
Okay.
Okay,
so round of applause for these two.
All right.

990
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:36.950
So I think everyone's figured out now how to play this game.
Is that right?

991
01:03:36.951 --> 01:03:41.120
Does everyone figured it out?
All right,
let me,
uh,

992
01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:44.630
take one of these mics and go down and make sure that I'm asking people to

993
01:03:44.631 --> 01:03:46.790
figure this out.
All right,
so,
so what is the,

994
01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:49.280
what is the role of how to play this game?

995
01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:51.020
What's the rule of how to play this game?

996
01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:55.250
People haven't figured out with the pie again,
Susan,
let's try over here.

997
01:03:55.251 --> 01:03:59.090
Someone that someone has a,
an onset.
How should you play this game?

998
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:06.000
Yeah,
it depends on whether the piles have the same number in them.
All right?

999
01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:10.230
If they have the same number you want to be second player and if they have

1000
01:04:10.231 --> 01:04:12.900
different numbers,
you want to be first player.
All right?
And what's your go to?

1001
01:04:12.901 --> 01:04:16.410
What should you do you want to,
this is,
do they have different numbers?

1002
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:18.690
If they have different numbers,
you want to make them equal.

1003
01:04:18.780 --> 01:04:20.820
You want to make them equal.
All right.
All right.
So the,

1004
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.550
the trick to playing this game is,
thank you.
Very good.

1005
01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.820
The tricks we're playing this game is you.

1006
01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:29.000
If the piles are on,

1007
01:04:29.010 --> 01:04:33.660
even then you want to make them even want to make them equal.
I want to see that.

1008
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:38.990
So you start off with the piles being on equal as we did both times.

1009
01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:43.440
For example,
three and two.

1010
01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.230
Then you want to be player one.

1011
01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:51.500
There's a first mover advantage and the correct tactic is to equalize the piles.

1012
01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:57.540
All right?
And what you'll notice now is the player to can't do anything.

1013
01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.920
If they take two from here,
you'll win by taking both of those two.

1014
01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:06.060
I think one from here you'll equalize the piles again and if they take then one

1015
01:05:06.091 --> 01:05:08.850
from here you've won.
All right?

1016
01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:12.870
So the way to play this game is to equalize the piles.

1017
01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:16.170
What does that mean?
It means if you're,

1018
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:21.200
if the initial position has the army cool piles on even piles,

1019
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:26.410
then you would rather be player one.
It has a first mover advantage,

1020
01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:30.820
but if the initial position has an even number of uh,

1021
01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:34.900
has even numbers in the piles,
then you'd rather be playing it too.

1022
01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.730
Is that right?
Right.
Because if it's,
if,
if you start off with an even number

1023
01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:46.390
in each pile,
the person moving first it's going to make them honor you quilt

1024
01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:50.470
and thereafter the next person's in a winning position.

1025
01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:52.840
So I want to do is two things from this game.

1026
01:05:52.841 --> 01:05:57.841
First notice in this game that from any initial position we can very quickly

1027
01:05:59.291 --> 01:06:04.270
tell who is going to win and who's going to lose assuming they play.

1028
01:06:04.271 --> 01:06:09.010
Well
three things nightmarishly third,

1029
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.180
second,
sorry.
Second,

1030
01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:14.530
we didn't actually use backward induction here but it's pretty obvious.

1031
01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:16.090
You do want to use backward induction here.

1032
01:06:16.091 --> 01:06:19.930
You want to figure out what the end game going to look like.
That right?

1033
01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:25.220
It's very easy to see you this game if you look at the end game.
Alright?

1034
01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.980
And the third lesson is what we just said in this game.

1035
01:06:28.070 --> 01:06:30.800
Sometimes there's a first mover advantage,

1036
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:33.520
sometimes there's a second mover advantage of the first.
That's not,
you'd ever,

1037
01:06:33.521 --> 01:06:34.650
ever have any cycles,
right?

1038
01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:37.310
So sometimes there's a first mover advantage in this game.

1039
01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:41.240
Sometimes there's a second mover advantage in this game.
All right.

1040
01:06:41.241 --> 01:06:42.950
I'm just illustrating the point we made earlier.

1041
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:45.860
That is that it is not always the case that you want to move first.

1042
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:47.320
Sometimes you want to move second hour.

1043
01:06:47.321 --> 01:06:51.500
Today I thought the piles with on equal piles.

1044
01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:53.120
So there was a first mover advantage,

1045
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:55.790
but that was just to give an advantage to the guy whose birthday it was.

1046
01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:56.570
All right.

1047
01:06:56.570 --> 01:07:01.570
I could have set things up with equal equal lines in each pile and made the

1048
01:07:01.971 --> 01:07:05.180
other guy,
the guy who I,
uh,
the other guy,
you go first.
