1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:01,821
All right.

2
00:00:01,821 --> 00:00:06,821
So last time we were talking about the
investor game and this was a coordination

3
00:00:07,611 --> 00:00:10,370
game and we learned some things.

4
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:12,010
There's been a recall from
the things we learned too.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,270
I can highlight them events.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,640
One thing we learned was
that communication can help
in a coordination game.

7
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:24,020
So I forget who it was, but someone down
here who was disappeared, uh, was, uh,

8
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:28,640
it was our Jimmy Stewart character
and helped coordinate you on a better

9
00:00:28,641 --> 00:00:33,530
equilibrium simply by suggesting
what you should do. And this,

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,140
there's two lessons here.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,890
One is this is very different
from the prisoner's dilemma.

12
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,010
So we learned the very
first time it doesn't,

13
00:00:50,011 --> 00:00:53,940
the prisoner's dilemma
communication per se won't help.

14
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,770
But in the coordination problem,

15
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:59,310
which could be just as serious
socially as a prisoner's dilemma in a

16
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:01,710
coordination problem,
it may well help.

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,100
And the reason it helps is you're trying
to coordinate onto a nash equilibrium.

18
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,720
And one way to think about now she
equilibria is that they are self enforcing

19
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:13,680
agreements.

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,900
So it provided on believed that everyone
else is going to go along with this

21
00:01:16,901 --> 00:01:20,760
agreement. Then, uh, everyone
in fact, well, all right.

22
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,410
I want to make another slightly more
philosophical remark associated with this

23
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,660
and it's to do with
the idea of leadership.

24
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,950
So leadership is kind of a big word
that you see written probably too often

25
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:36,420
these days in too many newspaper
articles and it comes up in too many Yale

26
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,930
classes and I don't claim to know
anything about me to ship. All right.

27
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,910
Bought and under they get game
theory is going to contribute.

28
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:44,760
Anything to understanding
about leadershape bots.

29
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,860
One thing we can do is tell you
where leadership may help. All right?

30
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:52,290
And then the coordination game,
we are where the,

31
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:56,250
the idea is to try and get people to
coordinate on a particular equilibria

32
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,460
rather than an another
equilibria or worse.

33
00:01:58,461 --> 00:02:02,970
Still all just be uncoordinated
entirely in those kinds of games.

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,750
Leadership can help tremendously in
little bit of leadership can help

35
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,490
tremendously.
So these games,

36
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:12,960
these coordination games are
games where there is a scope

37
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,563
for leadership.

38
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,880
And just to see that, uh, in
a very simple example, again,

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,090
we didn't need a such a complicated
example is the one we looked at last time.

40
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:28,810
You could imagine a game,
a really trivial coordination game,

41
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,680
which looked like this.

42
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,810
All right? One one zero, zero
is there a zero one, one?

43
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:42,850
And clearly in this game,
what matters is coordinating,

44
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:47,350
you either want to coordinate on Aarp
left or you want to coordinate on down,

45
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:51,010
right? You don't want to end up, uh, to d.

46
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:55,930
You don't want to end up uncoordinated
on down, left or upright.

47
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,900
Everyone see that? So in this
game, if you just played it,

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,480
it's quite likely going
to end up uncoordinated.

49
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,980
But if a little bit of leadership can
say, okay, let's make sure this is where,

50
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,010
this is where we coordinate all, let's
make sure this is where we coordinate.

51
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,120
All right?

52
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,750
So this matters a lot and I don't want to
overplay the social importance of this,

53
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:18,160
but go back a couple of years to what
was happening in the aftermath of Katrina

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,910
and realize how important,
how,

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,990
how bad things get when
things fail to be coordinated.

56
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,103
All right.

57
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,470
One other remark before we leave this
in the game we played last time in the

58
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:30,430
investment game.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,110
One feature of that game was that the
more you thought other people were going

60
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:39,500
to invest, the more you wanted to invest
that, right? The more you thought, oh,

61
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,343
he'll going to invest,

62
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,560
the more likely you are going to invest
and he'd go back to the time before that.

63
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,350
We talked about this partnership
game and the partnership game.

64
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,190
You were contributing efforts to a joint
project. It could have been a law firm,

65
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:54,700
it could have been working in a study
group on a homework assignment and that

66
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,400
game, if you remember what the
best response is, look like,

67
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,450
okay,

68
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:04,450
they look like this or this was the effort
of player one and this was the effort

69
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:09,200
of player to this was this was the best
response of player one and this was the

70
00:04:09,201 --> 00:04:13,940
best response of planets to this game.
Also has the feature that the more effort,

71
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,870
the other person, the more
the other person does, the
more you want to do, right?

72
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:20,270
The more efforts your partner
provides into this projects,

73
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,280
the more effort you want
to provide in this project.

74
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,350
And was when they introduced
a bit of jargon here,

75
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,830
these games in which the
more the other person does,

76
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:32,830
the more I want to do these are called
Games of strategic compliments, right?

77
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,090
These are games of strategic compliments,

78
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,640
strategic
how funds.

79
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:43,841
All right?

80
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:48,820
So both the investment game and
the game with the partnership,

81
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,110
the partnership from game or
games or treated components,

82
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,730
we can call the strategies
strategic compliments.

83
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,140
And we'll come back to this
later on today. All right,

84
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,060
so before we leave coordination games,

85
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,750
I want to look at another one and a little
bit more complicated one perhaps that

86
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:08,760
we mentioned briefly last time.
Uh, so we're looking at that.

87
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:13,660
We'll look at an play another game and
we'll call this game going to the movies.

88
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:21,801
All right.

89
00:05:21,801 --> 00:05:26,801
So I always regard one purpose of this
class to help hapless Yale students in

90
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:31,400
their dating strategies. Uh, that seems
like a good thing to do. Uh, and, uh,

91
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,950
how many of you just don't, uh, we
didn't need to show the camera on this,

92
00:05:33,951 --> 00:05:35,420
but how many of you are econ majors?

93
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,720
There's a lot of people who probably
did a lot of help with our dating

94
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:42,110
strategies. Right, right, right. Okay.

95
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,440
So the idea of this game is a couple
is going to meet up at the movies and,

96
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,420
uh, well let's have a
look at the movies, uh,

97
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,760
concerned here and we'll draw
the three possible movies.

98
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,233
Okay.

99
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,770
All right. Well the is we're
going to look at our, um,

100
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,440
the born Alto Mason

101
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,530
and the,
uh,

102
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,640
movie called Good Shepherd
and a movie called Snow White.

103
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,643
Okay.

104
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,560
And I'll explain the game
more detail in a second.

105
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,800
I used to be in the old days before I
had kids, I could list off for 15, uh,

106
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,160
current movies and help you a bit more
with your dating strategy by giving you

107
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:34,050
instant movie reviews.
But now I have kids,

108
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,960
I get to see precisely two movies a year.
Uh,

109
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,190
and the toolkit moves I've got
to see this year where, uh,

110
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,040
the Bourne ultimatum and, uh, the good
shepherd. And now I think about it,

111
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,410
both of those have Matt Damon
in it and my wife chose both.

112
00:06:46,411 --> 00:06:47,780
So maybe I need to work out some more.

113
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,040
So just to give you some
idea about how many,

114
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:56,580
how many of you saw Bourne ultimatum?
Quite a lot of you. This is a movie.

115
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:59,010
It has pretty good action.
Virtually no plots.

116
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,900
A basic lesson of this movie is a,
uh, if you, if you take home lesson,

117
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:06,330
it's that all spy is a psychos
or something like that.

118
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,050
And then I how many so good shepherd,
a lot of used to that as well.

119
00:07:10,051 --> 00:07:12,840
That's actually a pretty good,
it has a lot of plots and no actions.

120
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:16,710
It's helping other way around. And
uh, the basic lesson of this movie is,

121
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,430
and nobody knew this already, uh,
everyone at Yale, at the technical yell,

122
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,340
everyone at Yale is a spy. And
by the way, also a psychos.

123
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,020
And the third movie is, um, is Snow White,
which I haven't gone out to see. But, uh,

124
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,090
my,
uh,

125
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,740
four year old daughter has seen on
24 of the last 27 lates on video.

126
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,950
Uh, and this movie, um, I don't know if
I'd recommend it that much. Uh, it's, um,

127
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,700
as I'm being too PC,

128
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:47,820
but I'm not convinced that for
the modern woman hanging around,

129
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:52,590
waiting for your printers to come is
really a good strategy. Um, by the way,

130
00:07:52,591 --> 00:07:55,620
for those of you who are, you are, but
if you were ordering that strategy,

131
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm gonna get in trouble.
Then mind if you're in that strategy,

132
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,970
take it from a Brit. Most printers are as
dumb as toast, not worth way. All right,

133
00:08:02,971 --> 00:08:04,320
so let's,
let's put the payoffs in here.

134
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,780
So the idea here is that these
people are going to move.

135
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,300
They're going to meet at the movie. I'm
going to go, went to a movie, and they've,

136
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,920
they've decided to go to the,
to the criterion or the local movie house.

137
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,250
And there were these three movies showing
and they're all excited to this movie

138
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:20,830
excepts being economics majors
and not very good at dancing.

139
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,920
They have to gotten to,

140
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,370
to tell each other which movie
they're actually going to go to.

141
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,730
Aren't they going to meet in the,
you know, in there on the back row?

142
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:34,260
Probably and uh, um, uh, but
they're not, they're not telling us,

143
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:34,980
uh,

144
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,670
which movie there's a problem and it's
put in the payoffs and we'll put in the

145
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:42,570
payoffs that roughly I think would
correspond to my preference is,

146
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:45,750
and we'll talk about it,
what these preferences mean in a second.

147
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,880
Okay.

148
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,550
So here we go.
So minus one,

149
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,910
minus one zero minus one
zero minus minus two.

150
00:08:56,731 --> 00:09:01,110
So here are the preferences for these
movies of player one and player two.

151
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,660
And you can see from these preferences,

152
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,920
I have heard from these payoffs that uh,
the,

153
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,530
the best thing for player
one is for both players,

154
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,490
both people to meet and go to the Bourne
ultimatum. This is the action movie.

155
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,790
All right, so, so as not to be
sexist, I assume this is the,

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,440
this is the she and this is the heat.

157
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,680
So she would like to go and see a Matt
Damon beat people up and coordinate that,

158
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:30,090
how her favorite thing, uh, and she gets
nothing if they fail to coordinate, uh,

159
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,300
and uh, so on and so forth. Uh,

160
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,600
her second choice is at a managed to
coordinate at Matt Damon being a gale spy.

161
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:43,050
Uh, all right. And then she really
doesn't want to go and see snow white.

162
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,300
And the worst thing of all,
actually this is for both buyers,

163
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,390
the worst thing of all is to coordinate
it snow white because then you've got to

164
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:53,130
talk about it afterwards at coffee. All
right? And some of the other person,

165
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,340
same thing exactly except that uh,

166
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,170
he would rather meet at a of
the good shepherd. Uh, you know,

167
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,670
since he's a Yale Guy,

168
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:05,130
he probably thinks of themselves as the
Matt Damon character that'll perhaps

169
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:06,870
knock coming, but, and uh, you know,

170
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,810
failing that you'd like to coordinate
at the Bourne ultimatum. But again,

171
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:14,040
the disaster is to fail to coordinating,
go to the different movies. All right,

172
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,730
so these are the provinces. What can
we, what can we tell immediately if,

173
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:19,290
if any of you are stuck in this situation,

174
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,350
what can you tell immediately about
this, about this game? What God wants?

175
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:23,910
An easy first step is get the,

176
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,950
the guy in red here

177
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,550
snowy, it was snow white is dominated by
both players. Good. So for both plans,

178
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,670
for both planners,
Snow White is a Dominique is strategy.

179
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,680
So both players having taken this class,

180
00:10:36,681 --> 00:10:38,330
I told you I was helping with her dating,
but right.

181
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:42,410
So both planners will realize that they
shouldn't at least not going to Snow

182
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,060
White, is that right? Right.
Great animation, but not pat.

183
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,790
Not perhaps a good date movie.
So, uh, it's gone. All right,

184
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:50,624
everyone see that?

185
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:55,810
So that leaves us just
with these two options, uh,

186
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,580
the two Matt Damon movies,
Bourne ultimatum and good shepherd.

187
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:03,110
And here are the remaining payoffs. And
let's, let's see how we play this out. So,

188
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,010
so again, let's, let's pick on some
people. I don't want to pick on somebody.

189
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,140
Okay.
It kind of goes on as well.

190
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,423
All right.

191
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,290
All right. So, okay. Okay. So we would
pick on somebody that, uh, when do you,

192
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,140
the person who Alec picked
on you understand up.

193
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,840
Okay. And your name is, say
again, loudly, Nina, Nina,

194
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,060
and enter the shout out to run his
Aina. And Carl, did you pick on a guy?

195
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:38,570
Nina. Nina. Okay. Nina. I'm
sorry, Nina and car you get, get,

196
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:42,740
get your guy to stand up there.
And your name is David. David.

197
00:11:42,741 --> 00:11:47,300
So do you know each other? No. No,
you're okay. So your practical on a date.

198
00:11:47,301 --> 00:11:51,200
So this is all right. All right.

199
00:11:51,201 --> 00:11:55,570
So Nina's preferences mean
his preferences. I'll play
a one's preferences here.

200
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,550
So she,
uh,

201
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:01,960
her best thing now is to successfully
meet David at the Bourne ultimatum.

202
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,750
And David's preferences are a payer.

203
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:08,530
Twos preferences are his favorite thing
is to successfully meet at the good

204
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:12,200
shepherd. And why didn't you
write down, uh, a second, uh,

205
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,390
on the corner of a new pad?

206
00:12:13,391 --> 00:12:17,020
What it is you're going to choose to do
with my tas watching cause you really

207
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:21,330
can't cheat.
All right.

208
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,660
Both written down. All right. We have good
luck here. We go to a good look at them.

209
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:29,140
So we just embarrassment of it. We looked
at them already, I guess. Okay. Okay. So,

210
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,290
uh, Nina's a shout out to the crowd.
What it is, you've went where it is.

211
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:35,980
You've chosen to go or an ultimatum,
but what else makes him and David,

212
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:36,601
why don't you choose to go?

213
00:12:36,601 --> 00:12:39,630
I also put down born
ultimately I can think in the
coordinator. That's attention.

214
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,533
Very good.

215
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,493
Alright.

216
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,080
I don't,
I don't know what this test,

217
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,280
I don't know what this tells us
about David and Nina, but don't, no,

218
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:54,530
nothing off the hook quite
yet. So now, um, that was good.

219
00:12:54,531 --> 00:12:55,490
We managed to coordinate all the way.

220
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:57,560
I think we can all see that
we might not have done right.

221
00:12:57,561 --> 00:13:00,560
We all see we might not have
done it. All right. Let's, um,

222
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,630
let's try some communication in this game.

223
00:13:02,631 --> 00:13:06,740
We said the coordination games are
helped by communication. All right,

224
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,740
so let's imagine we're playing
the game again. Once again,

225
00:13:09,741 --> 00:13:12,800
you're going to the movies. Once again,
these are the first one didn't happen.

226
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:14,570
So you didn't have somebody
that was council that night.

227
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,130
Someone had a bad cold or something.

228
00:13:16,131 --> 00:13:20,700
And then you are about to go off on a
Friday night to see these movies and, uh,

229
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,400
let's allow some communication ahead
of time. So, so David, uh, uh, uh,

230
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,010
he brought it to get, Oh, you know,

231
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,300
you realize you've got
this coordination problem,

232
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,580
so you phone meaner up and
you can say whatever you like.

233
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:34,750
So what would you say to Nealon?
Uh,

234
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,620
it looks like you want to
go to Bourne ultimatum.

235
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:40,740
Okay. Uh, I'd rather I'd rather go

236
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,850
and if you're going to be stubborn,
I'd rather go see the board ultimately

237
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,190
with you then, uh, then
not knock on a date. Okay.

238
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:51,580
So here's another clue. Stubborn
is not a good first date. Right.

239
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,600
All right. But okay. So Nina, what
would you say in response to that?

240
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,860
I'll go to Bourne ultimatum.
Alright. Alright. All right.

241
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,600
So write down where you're
going to do this time.

242
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,483
Okay.

243
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:14,760
All right. And Nina, what did you do for
an ultimatum? David Bourne ultimatum.

244
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,760
They're still managing to
coordinate, but you can. Okay.
So, so thank you. Thank you.

245
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:19,380
Thank for this couple.
I was giving a round of applause.

246
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,370
We may come back and pick out you later
on in the course, but we'll, we'll,

247
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:30,010
we'll leave it for now.
All right. So in this case,

248
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,930
could look at the
communication worked alright,

249
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,270
but how am I liked him thinking
that the communication isn't,

250
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,570
isn't such an instant solution as
it was in the game we saw last time,

251
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:45,340
this games a little bit harder to
get communication to work. And why?

252
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:48,790
I mean is, is that right? First of all.
So what's, what's the problem here?

253
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:52,250
Why is this a slightly more difficult
game? Let's get the handy a second.

254
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,500
Why is this a more difficult
game to attain coordination
and um, yeah, that's it.

255
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,260
That's the case you get.
Can You

256
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:06,140
well I know, hang on a second. Hold on a
second. That's a good, that's a good one.

257
00:15:06,141 --> 00:15:08,070
That's, let's start with
that. What are the national,

258
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,620
what are the Nash
Equilibrium in this game?

259
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,040
What are the Nash Equilibrium this game?
Uh, somebody that says pick on somebody.

260
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,120
Just pick on anybody. K. Yeah. What
are the Nash Equilibrium? This game?

261
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,700
Both players doing Bourne ultimatum
in both players doing good shepherd.

262
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,020
All right. So, so in fact if
we, if we check the notion,

263
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,020
the magic whatever in this game,
the Nash Equilibria,

264
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:32,021
and you can check that they are in fact
best responses are both people doing the

265
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,790
Bourne ultimatum or both
people doing the good shepherd.

266
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,580
And the reason for that is if the other
person's going to go to Bourne ultimatum,

267
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:43,640
I want to do that. And if the other
person is going to go to good shepherd,

268
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,760
I wanted to do that. So these are both
Nash Equilibria. That isn't too much.

269
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:49,190
The problem.
That was true last time as well.

270
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:52,060
There were two well
coordinated Nash Equilibria.

271
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,470
The one of them was better than the Alba,
which the tricky thing here, what's,

272
00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:00,350
what's the extra tray?
Yeah. Somebody uh, yeah. Uh,

273
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,960
it's real camera. It's built
with Mike on this side. Sorry.

274
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,080
It was me. There was a handout that,
yeah, Yup, Yup, Yup. Go, go, go, go.

275
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,810
Yeah, you go stand up. Great.

276
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,750
Prefers a different Nash equilibrium.
All so,

277
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:21,990
so unlike the other game that the two
dead zone was a coordination game.

278
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:26,150
If we saw so far,
we're really pure coordination problems.

279
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,070
That right there were pure
coordination problems.

280
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:32,540
There was no conflict at all in, in the
case of the investor game last week,

281
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:36,530
every plan preferred one equilibrate
to the other, right? In the game.

282
00:16:36,531 --> 00:16:38,360
I just put up this a triggered example.

283
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,530
It didn't really Massa which
equilibrium we played here,

284
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,510
we just wanted to play an equilibrium.
Is that right? Is that right? But here,

285
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,620
there's a potential
source of conflict here.

286
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,940
Both people would rather be at an
equilibrium than to be mal coordinated,

287
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,020
uncoordinated,

288
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,490
but play a one wants to go to Bourne
ultimatum and play a two wants to go to

289
00:17:01,491 --> 00:17:04,190
good shepherd. And actually I thought
Nina's strategy there was pretty good.

290
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,810
Nina's version of communication was,
I'm going to Bourne ultimatum, right?

291
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,290
Right. That that basically
fix things. Right?

292
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:15,890
But you could imagine that a
communication could break down here.

293
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:19,890
There could be a negotiation going on.
All right. So think about, uh, I mean,

294
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:22,130
I don't think,
I don't want to push this too hard,

295
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,550
but think about other games where people
are communicating to feel an or to

296
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:27,380
avoid a feeder of,
of coordination.

297
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:30,520
There's a strike negotiation
going on as we speak. Events.

298
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,160
It's a critical moment this morning,
uh,

299
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,140
up in Detroit between General
Motors and the United auto workers.

300
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,350
And I didn't want to say that strikes only
about ms coordination, but clearly, uh,

301
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,800
everyone's better off if they come to
some agreement. Uh, rather than strike,

302
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:48,410
there's at least some agreement is
going to be better for everybody than a

303
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:49,440
strike.
And yet,

304
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:52,950
because they personally were conflicting
interests that basically in that case,

305
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,680
conflicting interest about
health and pension payments.

306
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,900
It could well be that you
end up failing to court.

307
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,803
All right.

308
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:01,970
All right,

309
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,520
so this game has a name and
actually somebody mentioned
it last time and one who

310
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,000
is the person who mentioned this last
time, somebody, somebody mentioned this.

311
00:18:08,001 --> 00:18:09,320
What, what, what was the,
what is this game called?

312
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,230
W shattered out battle of the sexes.

313
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,750
That's good to this game is
called the battle of the sexes.

314
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,033
Yeah,

315
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,410
I will. We'll see it in various forms
over the course of the semester.

316
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:30,910
It's actually very interesting game games
like it, they are coordination games,

317
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,720
but different people disagree about
where you'd like to coordinate.

318
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,400
All right,
so,

319
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:42,330
so much for talking about coordination
games and helping you real dating

320
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,510
strategy, um, this being
a game theory class,

321
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,710
there's at least one game we have to
discuss. Uh, and we, we'll come to it now.

322
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:55,000
So we're going to spend most of the
rest of today, uh, talking about, uh,

323
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,110
[inaudible]. And before I
do that, let me just check.

324
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,070
How many of you have seen Cornell
duopoly before? Raise your hand.

325
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:05,240
The sentence just for me year.
I said maybe at half of you,

326
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:08,430
so those of you who have, don't worry.
I mean, this will be a bit review,

327
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,370
but we'll see it more through the
eyes of game theory this time.

328
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,230
And for those of you haven't, don't worry,
we're going to go through it. Okay. Okay.

329
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,940
So this is a classic game habits, one
of the most famous games. And therefore,

330
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,020
uh,
we're studying in the class.

331
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,870
That was a purely game theory exercise.

332
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,490
One reason for studying Kono do you openly

333
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:42,640
is that so far we've discussed how to
find Nash equilibrium when there are a few

334
00:19:42,641 --> 00:19:43,450
players,

335
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,160
each of whom has few strategies and we've
discussed how to find Nash equilibrium

336
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,120
where there are many players,
each of whom has few strategies.

337
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,480
And this is a game where there
are few players and be too,

338
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,730
but they have many strategies.
All right?

339
00:19:57,731 --> 00:20:00,510
They actually have a continuum of
strategies. All right? All right.

340
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:04,360
For those people who aren't familiar
with this and are worried about the

341
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:05,770
economics of it in particular,

342
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,720
it's gone over in considerable detail in
chapter six of the textbook in chapter

343
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:11,554
six of the textbook.

344
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,690
All right,
so just motivate this a little bit.

345
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,110
So there's two reasons why this game is
interesting. So I say what would it is?

346
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,640
So this is a game in which there are
two firms who are competing in the same

347
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:32,400
market and we'll give a bit
more detail in a second.

348
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,210
And one reason this game is interesting
from the point of you of economics is

349
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:40,830
this game lies between the two extreme
cases that you learn about in your

350
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,880
interaction.
Omics pass,

351
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
one extreme case is perfect competition
or the other extreme case is monopoly.

352
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,350
So this isn't,

353
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:52,450
this is really the first attempt way back
in the late century to study a market

354
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,630
that somewhere in the middle of what had
happened, most markets are all right,

355
00:20:55,631 --> 00:21:00,010
there are two firms and we're
interested in two things here.

356
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,470
We're interested in what's going
to happen in these markets.

357
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,710
And then from a welfare point of view,
from a policy point of view,

358
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,860
we're interested about whether this
is good for consumers or good for uh,

359
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,170
producers or what, right? How,

360
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,470
how this relates to profits and
consumer surplus. All right?

361
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,930
So with that in mind,
let's just set the game up.

362
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,970
So the players in this
game are two phones,

363
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,300
two firms, and the strategies
in this game for the firms,

364
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,760
and this is going to
turn out to be important.

365
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,970
The strategies are the quantities that
they produce of an identical products.

366
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,910
All right?
So they have the quantities

367
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,510
they produce.
So each of them producers,

368
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,150
okay.

369
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:55,780
Oh, of an identical product. So front,

370
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,990
as far as the consumers are concerned,

371
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,660
these two products are
perfect substitutes.

372
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:04,290
You could think of these as two
companies producing bottled water.

373
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:07,020
And now I'm going to get
hundreds of letters saying
novel bottled waters are the

374
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:10,020
same, especially from it,
uh, Italians and the French.

375
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:12,840
But nevermind does a switch to
pretend that they are. All right.

376
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,730
So just to emphasize that the strategies
are quantities rather than using s,

377
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,430
let me use Q today to be the
strategist. So, so Qai and,

378
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,493
and uh,

379
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:27,710
a Q minus sigh oh Q one and
Q two will be the strategies.

380
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,720
All right?

381
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,340
Now I need to give a little bit more
structure on the payoff when I get to the

382
00:22:32,341 --> 00:22:36,030
pay offs. So in particular, I need to
tell you what is the cost of production

383
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:43,310
and the cost of production in this game
is simply going to be c times cute.

384
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:48,240
All right? So if I produce
one unit, it costs me.

385
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,460
See if I produced two units,

386
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,490
it costs me to see if I
produce a hundred units,

387
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,030
it costs me a hundred c
and high produce, uh, 0.7,

388
00:22:57,031 --> 00:23:01,110
three five units like cost me 0.7,
three, five, six. Awesome. All right,

389
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,410
so for those people who took intro
economics, which is most of you,

390
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,210
this is a game.
This is a,

391
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,260
a setting in which we have
constant marginal costs,

392
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:18,090
constant marginal cost, the constant
marginal costs. It's, see, all right,

393
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,960
and I'll need to tell you about how
prices are determined in this market.

394
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:28,500
So prices are determined as follows.
Uh,

395
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:33,180
prices depend on some parameters.
I'm just going to call a and B.

396
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,291
Uh,
I looked it up.

397
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,300
Let me write the equation and
then we'll see what it looks like.

398
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:42,350
So basically the idea is that
the more these firms produce,

399
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,070
so the more of the total
quantity produced Q1 plus Q two,

400
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,290
the lower is the price in the marketplace
for this product. All right. I,

401
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:55,010
let's just draw a picture of the hat.
We'll come back to this in a minute.

402
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,940
Let's draw a picture which
we can keep for later.

403
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:04,200
Actually that's saved myself
some time and written this down.

404
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,450
All right,

405
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:12,690
so this, this, uh, Mr
Equation I've just written,

406
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:18,110
you can imagine Q1 plus Q2 total quantity
on the horizontal access and you can

407
00:24:20,221 --> 00:24:24,270
imagine price on the vertical access.

408
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,540
And basically what we're saying is that
prices depend on total quantities as

409
00:24:30,691 --> 00:24:31,560
follows,

410
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:36,710
where the slope of this line
smoke with this line is minus B.

411
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,540
All right? Now for those of you who
took economics one 15 or coolant,

412
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:47,320
what is the name of this lion?
I've just drawn because that was,

413
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,430
that was way fewer responses and they
wanted, all right, let's try again.

414
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,970
What's the name of this downward sloping
hint, hint line that I've just drawn?

415
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,940
It's a demand Kat. Thank
you. So demand curve.

416
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,913
All right.

417
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,070
This is the demand it tells me,
but they'll be around and look at the,

418
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:08,010
look at how prices
correspond to quantities.

419
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:11,340
It tells me the quantity
demanded at any given price.

420
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:17,160
All right, we'll come back to
that in a second. But meanwhile,

421
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:21,090
let's just finish up what we're
doing here and put in payoffs.

422
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:26,820
So payoffs for these firms
are going to depend on,

423
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:32,910
uh, on profits or pay off the farms. Aim

424
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,940
to maximize
profit

425
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,560
and profit is going to be given by

426
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,530
p times Q minus.

427
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,060
Sorry, it's just to throw this dude.
Let's do this for from one. Alright,

428
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
let's be careful.
Let's do this.

429
00:25:56,410 --> 00:25:58,530
The Fun one I'll do if I want
us to come to in a second.

430
00:25:58,531 --> 00:26:03,531
So the payoff for from one as it depends
on the quantity that she produces and

431
00:26:04,141 --> 00:26:09,141
the quantity that the other firm
produces is going to be prices times the

432
00:26:11,131 --> 00:26:15,690
quantity that foam one
producers minus costs

433
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,660
times the quantity that she
produces. All right? All right,

434
00:26:21,661 --> 00:26:25,920
so this is,
this term here is revenues.

435
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,290
It's Tom.
Here

436
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:36,120
it's revenues. And this term
here is total costs, right?

437
00:26:36,121 --> 00:26:38,640
Revenues minus costs makes profits.
And again,

438
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,800
those people who are less
familiar with economics,

439
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,260
I'm hoping this is not gonna be too hard,
but you read up on the, okay. All right.

440
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:50,040
I want to going to do here is I'm
going to substitute in for prices.

441
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,710
All right? So I've got this
expression for prices here.

442
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:02,550
Here it is.
And I want to plug it into that p that.

443
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:07,200
Okay. All right, so let's, I'm going
to want to rewrite it now with that,

444
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:11,410
with that p expanded hours.
All right, so I'm going to get,

445
00:27:11,411 --> 00:27:16,050
and I'm going to multiply out at the
same time. So I'm going to have a Q one

446
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:22,010
minus B squared.

447
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:23,960
Okay.

448
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,960
Minus B Q one Q two

449
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:35,310
minus c Q one. All right,
so all I'm doing here,

450
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,080
nothing,
nothing particularly exciting.

451
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:42,310
I'm simply plugging this expression then
for p and then I multiplied the whole

452
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:44,660
thing out cause I,

453
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:47,850
cause it was all multiplied by Q
one and I should warn you again,

454
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm very likely to make mistakes
when doing this kind of thing.

455
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,820
So please catch me if I do.
All right?

456
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:58,180
So here I have a new expression for from
ones profit and I could do the same for

457
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:03,890
from too, but I'm not going
to because it's, that would
get boring. Okay. All right.

458
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:08,180
So this is, this is just
from one spot. Okay.

459
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,820
Now with this in hand,
what I want to do is,

460
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:12,500
I mean for him to have
a similar expression.

461
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:17,950
What I want to do is I want to figure
out the Nash equilibrium of this,

462
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:22,140
of this game.
I know I won't get down on the board.

463
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,010
I want to figure out the Nash equilibrium

464
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,670
off this game.
Both firms are producing quantities.

465
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,220
Both firms are trying to maximize profit.

466
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,800
And I want to find out the
Nash Equilibrium. How do
I go about that exercise?

467
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:43,280
What's the what? What do I need to do
to find each firm's Nash Equilibrium?

468
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:45,680
How do we always find Nash
equilibrium when we're not guessing?

469
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,060
What are we doing?
Anybody?

470
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,020
So when you were over there, who's gonna
be way off camera, but we can perhaps,

471
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,610
I'm going to make him mad
quick. I'm, I'm sorry.

472
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,660
I see he's way in the corner that
come, come, come this way a little bit.

473
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,840
It's a bit closer to the aisle.

474
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,383
There you go.

475
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:09,060
Well, we would just delete the, uh, we
would eternal iterative lead, delete,

476
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,293
dominated.

477
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,380
Could do that. We could do that.
We could try it for the domain.

478
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:18,030
His strategies and see if I can see that
process converged high and something

479
00:29:18,031 --> 00:29:20,660
else in mind here. Something that's more
of more straight forward. What else?

480
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,200
What else does that,
so the guy in red,

481
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,023
mmm.

482
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:27,280
Identify the best responses of each player
as a function of the others and find

483
00:29:27,281 --> 00:29:29,410
out where they intersect.
I guess that more that was correct.

484
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:30,820
I sent more loudly shouting,
um,

485
00:29:30,821 --> 00:29:34,900
identify the best responses of each player
as a function of the others and find

486
00:29:34,901 --> 00:29:36,130
out where they intersect. Okay, good.

487
00:29:36,131 --> 00:29:40,420
So what we're gonna do is we're going to
figure out play or one's best response

488
00:29:40,421 --> 00:29:42,340
quantity to each possible

489
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,540
choice to flare to.

490
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,810
And then we're going to flip it around
and figuring out player twos best

491
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:49,690
response quantity to each
possible choice of player one.

492
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,850
And then we're going to see
where they were. They were,

493
00:29:51,851 --> 00:29:54,550
those were those coincide
where they cross. All right?

494
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:57,730
So just like we've done several
times from four, all right.

495
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,740
It's only ordained to do then is I need
to figure out what his player ones best

496
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:07,440
response for each possible choice.
Q2 of player too.

497
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,730
All right. So how do I do
that? How do I do that?

498
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:14,620
I wanted to find the best response.
How do I do that?

499
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,680
Everyone's looking like this
is a bit your Mo. Really?

500
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,590
Anybody, anybody to
cold call somebody? No?

501
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,720
Yeah, I the thought of that. Yeah. Yeah,
yeah. Uh, sorry. Athletic Day for you.

502
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,930
Somebody that way at the back there.

503
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,383
Sorry

504
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,763
that up.
And shout.

505
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:42,150
Find the best response function by
differentiating this and maximizing the

506
00:30:42,151 --> 00:30:45,780
function for every Q two. Okay, good.
Good, good. So what we're going to do is,

507
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,400
all right, good. We're
good. We're going to,

508
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,350
we're trying to maximize the best
response is going to maximize these, uh,

509
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,690
these prophets. All
right, so in particular,

510
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,670
what we're going to do to find out what,

511
00:30:56,671 --> 00:31:01,410
what quantity Q1 maximizes this
profits for each choice of, of Q2.

512
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,310
We're going to differentiate this
with respect to Q one and then what?

513
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:10,920
And then still equal to zero. Okay. So
again, let me just take a look out there.

514
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:13,620
How many of you remember this?
We did this once before I did this bus.

515
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,080
How many of you remember
this from, from your, uh,

516
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:20,100
high school calculus days
or from one 12th? Quite a.

517
00:31:20,101 --> 00:31:21,930
Quite a number of you actually
were on it, right? Okay, good.

518
00:31:21,931 --> 00:31:25,140
So we're gonna do is we're going to
differentiate this thing to find a first

519
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:25,974
order condition.

520
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,460
We're going to differentiate,

521
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,213
okay.

522
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,540
With respect to Q1, right? The thing
we're trying, the, our control variable,

523
00:31:37,541 --> 00:31:41,350
they were trying to maximize the thing
with those back to and set it equal to

524
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:45,790
zero. All right, so what I'm going
to get, so this, this term here,

525
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:50,791
a Q one is going to become an ae and
this term here minus B Q squared is going

526
00:31:53,381 --> 00:31:54,220
to become a

527
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:00,790
to B Q one and this term here minus B
Q one Q two is gonna become a minus B Q

528
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,720
two and the last term minus CQ
one is going to become a minus c.

529
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:16,660
All right? And we're happy with that. I
don't want to, there was a differentiated,

530
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,710
this fairly simple function
with respect to key one.

531
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,290
And since I want to find them a maximum,

532
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,730
but I'm going to do is I'm going to
set this equal to zero. All right?

533
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:32,060
At my maximum up to Hato retro
indicate this is the Arg Max, uh,

534
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:35,500
at my maximum, I'm going to set this
thing you will deserve now, but it's just,

535
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:38,380
it is in some sense we're being nerdy
in this class despite our attempts to go

536
00:32:38,381 --> 00:32:43,130
dating, we're being nerdy. Lex
Actually, uh, be a little bit careful.

537
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,820
This was a first order condition or first
on a necessary condition actually need

538
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:48,170
to check the second order condition.

539
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,000
So how do I check the
second order condition?

540
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,443
Yeah,

541
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:56,310
I differentiate again, right?
I differentiate a second
time and check the sign.

542
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,000
The second oral condition,

543
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,030
I differentiate this expression
again with respect to Q one,

544
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:06,040
the early phase Kuwan appears here is
here. So when I differentiate again,

545
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:11,100
I must going to get minus two B
and sure enough that's negative,

546
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:12,400
which is what I wanted to know.

547
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,860
That's just to check that
what I'm finding this thing,

548
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,630
I'm finding a maximum and not a
minimum. All right, good. Good. Okay.

549
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,550
So this is our key expression

550
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:27,010
and I'm going to use this expression,
I'm going to solve it for Q one.

551
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:32,730
So the best response for player one as a
function of what player to chooses Kutu

552
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,170
is just equal to the Q one Hatton,
this expression.

553
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:42,790
And if I solve that out carefully, I will
no doubt make a mistake when it's dry.

554
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:46,810
It, uh, I'm going to have a minus c over

555
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,910
to be

556
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:51,590
minus

557
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:57,220
Q two over two.

558
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,220
All right? So try that at home. But I
think I did that right? So I took the,

559
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,280
I took this to the other side and I
have divided through by two B and the B

560
00:34:08,331 --> 00:34:13,050
here, counsel. All right, I want
to just start that a second.

561
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,920
Make sure I don't right. And very, very
capable of getting this things wrong.

562
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,440
All right,
good.

563
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:24,770
So what I have here is an equation that
tells me player one's best response for

564
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:31,290
each possible choice of player too.
All right?

565
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:34,420
And I could do the same
thing for player to,

566
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,880
to find player two's best response for
every possible choice of player one or

567
00:34:38,881 --> 00:34:41,070
the other hand. We know it, you know
the math is going to be the same.

568
00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:42,120
So let's cheese.

569
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:43,880
Okay.

570
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,880
I know that play a his best response
for every possible choice of player one,

571
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:54,700
which if we'd done it would be Q two hat
is going to equal a minus c over to B

572
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:58,580
minus Q. Want over to right? So I'm just,

573
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,800
I'm just flipping around
the twos and the ones.

574
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:09,610
So at this point I found player one's
best response as a function of Q two I

575
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:14,690
found player two's best response as a
function of Q one and the way I did it,

576
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:19,280
just remember the way he did it was I
applied a little bit of one 12 and our

577
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:21,950
high school calculus, right?
Essentially single variable.

578
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,770
All right. Now before we could just
solve at this point, but it's not,

579
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,970
let's draw this. Let's draw this. Okay.

580
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:35,210
So what I'm going to do is I'm
gonna go back to my picture

581
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:41,100
and draw these functions.
I'll just remind us what is function.

582
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,720
It's a minus c over to B minus Q two over
two as equivalently for a plan to all

583
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,140
right. That's it. That's the thing,
I it just hidden by the board.

584
00:35:58,141 --> 00:36:01,830
Now what I want to do is I want to draw
a picture I little bit like we did for

585
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:05,490
the partnership game.
Turn the partnership game.

586
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,330
We put efforts on these axes and now I'm
going to put quantities on these axes.

587
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,850
So this is going to be the choice of
player one and this is going to be

588
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:20,080
the choice of player too. And what I
want to do is I want to figure out what,

589
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,900
what this looks like, what, uh,

590
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:26,190
for each Q two that you give
me or that player to chooses.

591
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:30,780
I want to find out and draw what
is player ones. Best response.

592
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,660
All right, everyone happy what I'm doing
here? All right, so let's start somewhere.

593
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,540
And what we're gonna do is we'll
refer back to this other picture,

594
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:44,340
which is why I left it here.
All right, so in particular,

595
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,530
what would be player ones?

596
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:50,780
Best response if a two.

597
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,080
It didn't produce it all.

598
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:56,640
How we find that without worrying
about the economics of it? A second.

599
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,920
How will we find that?
This is a math exercise.

600
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,850
Just oppose play a two doesn't produce it.
All

601
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:08,370
right. What is player one's best
response? Someone read it off of me.

602
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,050
Wait when we cold call
somebody out or you can,

603
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,813
yeah.

604
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:20,110
Hey mine minus c over to B.
All right,

605
00:37:20,111 --> 00:37:24,430
so so shout that out over two weeks.
If I plug it,

606
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:28,360
plug it Q two equals zero and
to hear this term disappears,

607
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,450
right and I just get a minus c over
to be so of that's what's that?

608
00:37:34,331 --> 00:37:36,910
What's that telling me?
I mean put the 45 degree line in here.

609
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:42,370
What's that telling me? It's as if
play a two chooses not to produce,

610
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:47,570
then play a one's best
response is a minus c

611
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:54,940
over to be.
Now I claim it that conscious,

612
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,810
a minus c over to be
actually has another name.

613
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,770
What's the name of that quantity?
What's the name of the quantity?

614
00:38:03,771 --> 00:38:07,720
A minus C of a to be. Once we,
once we escape the Algebra,

615
00:38:07,721 --> 00:38:11,780
just think about it in terms of economics.
What does thinking about it the best?

616
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:16,600
Let's go back to the previous picture.
If player two is producing nothing,

617
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,950
player two is producing nothing. Then
what is player one? Oneness. Effectively,

618
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,010
he's a monopolist or she's a monopolist.
All right,

619
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:28,660
so we know how to figure out monopoly
quantities from what we did in one 15 or

620
00:38:28,661 --> 00:38:32,620
equivalent courses. Let me just finish
the picture here. Here's my demand curve.

621
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:39,930
Here's my constant Marshall cost
at, see. All right. I want to,

622
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,200
I want to use this picture on the left
now to figure out what the monopoly

623
00:38:44,201 --> 00:38:48,430
quantity is. Can anyone tell me out?
It's cold. Call Tom Buddy again. Ah,

624
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:53,570
well raise your hand if you took
one 1501 10 oh one 50 oh no, no,

625
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,470
no, no. I know more. He took it than that.
It's so it's, it's a Prereq for the class,

626
00:38:56,471 --> 00:39:01,170
right? Raise your hands if you didn't
take any of those things. Right.

627
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,230
All right, so keep your hands up a
cocoa. Do you haven't got the hand up?

628
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,360
Yeah.

629
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,650
Anybody, anybody? Go ahead

630
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,740
passing the buck yet. Do you door
to tell me what the, where's the,

631
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:23,370
where's the monopoly quantity
on this picture? No, try
it. Try to work with that.

632
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,540
The one with the woman and woman one
in there. Yeah. That's where you are.

633
00:39:26,541 --> 00:39:30,020
There's a woman here. Yeah. Oh really?
Don't remember. I don't remember.

634
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:34,430
I don't remember who else.
Who else doesn't remember?

635
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,560
What was it?

636
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,060
Somebody I don't remember is a good reply.
Or if you're,

637
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:43,070
if you're auditioning for it
to be the attorney general,

638
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,460
but it's not such a good offer.
Anybody,

639
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,880
somebody hit somebody
help me out. Hey, where's,

640
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:54,390
where's the monopoly quantity on this
picture? It's good review exercise.

641
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:57,310
Yeah. It's where the marginal revenue
is equal to the marginal cost. Oh,

642
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,960
it's where marginal revenue
equals Marshall because I
should have picked him out

643
00:39:59,961 --> 00:40:00,860
of there. So when people, by the way,

644
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,800
it's where marginal revenue
equals marginal costs. Right.

645
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,330
The reason I speak on the SOM people,
if they their,

646
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:09,020
their ambition in life is to Ronald
Monopoly, right? Say, alright,

647
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,140
couple days I haven't drawn the marginal
revenue curve yet. Right? Right.

648
00:40:12,141 --> 00:40:14,000
You can't actually see
the marginal revenue here.

649
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,120
What is the marginal revenue look like?
And this pitch,

650
00:40:16,121 --> 00:40:18,320
I don't even go to the same guy.
The guy in in Brown. Where's,

651
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:20,660
where's the marginal revenue look like?
What's the most,

652
00:40:20,661 --> 00:40:22,010
whenever you look back on
this picture on the left,

653
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:25,940
it's one half the slope of
the price. Yeah. Oh, it's, I
guess it's twice the slope,

654
00:40:25,941 --> 00:40:27,980
but that's fine. And I know
what you mean. All right.

655
00:40:27,981 --> 00:40:30,290
So the marginal revenue here
that's been in a different color,

656
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,640
the marginal revenue
look,

657
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:40,990
something like this.
Alright.

658
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,861
And as,

659
00:40:41,861 --> 00:40:46,720
I don't know what your name is as the
guy who said the monopoly quantity,

660
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,250
monopoly quantity,

661
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,860
it's when marginal revenue
equals marginal costs. All right.

662
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,750
And as we know,

663
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:59,950
this line here has twice the slope of the
original line of the [inaudible] cove.

664
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:04,210
So the slope of this thing is minus two

665
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,543
B.

666
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,590
I know I'm going to claim that this
monopoly corner, the I claimed before,

667
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,680
it's like our intuition says if
the other firm isn't producing,

668
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,990
my best response must be
produced by monopoly quantity,

669
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:19,310
which I can see on this shut.
And I also planned,

670
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:23,260
but the math is telling me just to kind
of nerdy math is telling me that that

671
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:27,880
quantity is a minus c over to B and
I claim that they're the same thing.

672
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,100
How can I see that? The same thing. Well,

673
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:35,101
look here I have a line of slope minus
two how far down does it have to go?

674
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:40,450
It has to go a minus c down as pink line
has to drop off from a all the way to

675
00:41:40,851 --> 00:41:45,851
see how far along do I have to go to drop
off a minus c when I have slope minus

676
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:50,240
to be honest,
a minus seat over to be right.

677
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:52,920
That's not even calculus something he
really all at the high school. Okay.

678
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,200
All right. Okay, so this
monopoly quantity is indeed.

679
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,710
Hey, minus c over TV. All right,

680
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,320
I'm going to ask again if some of
this being coming out of the fog,

681
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:08,030
I mean you mental sent
with the Algebra before,

682
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:11,030
but some of this sort of pictures have
you seen before as good review exercise

683
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:15,530
for some of you who have taken one 50
and are about to take one 50 or that now.

684
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:17,773
All right,

685
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:22,970
so we found precisely 1.0
this best response picture
and there's a lot of points

686
00:42:23,551 --> 00:42:27,190
to find and it's 20 past 12 so
we're gonna get going. All right,

687
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:31,140
so let's try and find another point.
All right, so it's a different question.

688
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:36,620
How much quantity would from to have
to produce in order to induce from one,

689
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,590
not to produce it all.
That again,

690
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,680
how much quantity would from two half
to produce in order to induce from one's

691
00:42:49,081 --> 00:42:50,970
best response to be zero.

692
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:59,880
All right. There's that. That helped
me out. [inaudible] it's Katy, right?

693
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:03,180
Is that right? The woman in green
and it's going to make to Katie. Oh,

694
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:06,960
there's Mike posted buyers. No
of mine. Sorry. Yeah, yeah. Hey,

695
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,940
mine is c over to B. All right, so, so
that's just solving out the Algebras.

696
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:14,490
We're saying, we're saying what, what?

697
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:19,491
Q solves 80 minus c over to B
minus Q two over two equals zero,

698
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,810
right? What Q to Purdue
makes the sink? Well,

699
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:27,390
does zero and Katie's answer
is solving out the Algebra.

700
00:43:27,391 --> 00:43:31,840
Here is the Q two.
The soul is,

701
00:43:31,841 --> 00:43:36,650
this must be a minus c, uh, over over B.

702
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:40,690
All right,
that's right.

703
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,260
Why can I see that one on the picture
though? Let's go back to the economics.

704
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:48,010
All right, so I'm claiming
that the song quantity up here,

705
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:53,370
I claim this quantity is a minus c Overbey
such that if from two producers that

706
00:43:54,761 --> 00:43:58,030
much quantity from one
we'll just produce nothing,

707
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:02,110
right?
But that's just kind of Algebra and math.

708
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:06,370
What can I say it on this picture?
What quarter?

709
00:44:06,371 --> 00:44:11,050
See if produced by from two would cost
from one to shut down on this picture.

710
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,280
Yeah, it's going to Mike
and in here, sorry, again,

711
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:24,880
that's where the marginal cost and the
demand thing demand lines intersect.

712
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,850
All right, so, uh, it's
here, right? It's here.

713
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:31,860
It's where it's where marginal.

714
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,710
It's where the marginal cost
and the demand curve intersects

715
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:41,090
and watch Dan tuition.
Well, let's work it out,

716
00:44:41,091 --> 00:44:46,091
I suppose from two has produced
all of this quantity up to here.

717
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,420
All right? So from two is already
producing all of this quantity.

718
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:53,900
So already just from,
from two's production,

719
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:58,550
the price has been driven
all the way down to costs.

720
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:04,240
All right? So if I, I'm from one,
if I produce any more quantity,

721
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:07,330
what's going to happen
to the price fibers?

722
00:45:07,390 --> 00:45:09,460
Any quantity at all in addition
to what's out there already.

723
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,440
What's going to happen to the price?
It's going to be pushed below. Cost.

724
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:19,250
All right, so I'll be producing
this stuff is water at cost.

725
00:45:19,251 --> 00:45:23,440
See and only getting P, which is isn't
going to be less than. So you in return,

726
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,710
Toby losing money on any product,
any product that I produce,

727
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:28,960
I want to see that and I'll say it again.

728
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:32,470
So from to from to produce
is all the way up to here.

729
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:33,933
Yeah.

730
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,640
That any product produced by from one
is going to push prices even lower in

731
00:45:39,961 --> 00:45:40,351
particular.

732
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:44,820
There'll be lower here than costs and
so you'll make losses on that product.

733
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:47,163
All right.

734
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,930
What's the name of going back to
economics one 15 what's the name for this?

735
00:45:50,931 --> 00:45:54,860
Quantity. The quantity where
demand and Marshall costs equal.

736
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:00,590
That's the, that's the
competitive quantity. All right,

737
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:05,210
so this is the perfect
competition quantity in a
perfectly competitive market.

738
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:07,400
That's exactly where
prices are going to end up.

739
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,490
This is not a perfectly
competitive market, but if it were,

740
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,910
that's where price is going to end up.
All right?

741
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:19,090
So we have the monopoly quantity here
and we have the competitive quantity here

742
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:24,200
and in between. What does this
best response curve look like?

743
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:32,170
Somebody, it's a straight line. It's
a straight line. Thank you. All right,

744
00:46:32,171 --> 00:46:35,050
so in between,
this is just a spray line.

745
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:39,571
All right,

746
00:46:39,571 --> 00:46:44,571
so here is the best response of from
one to each possible choice of I'm too.

747
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,820
All right. Everyone's looking
really like this was hard,

748
00:46:50,821 --> 00:46:53,580
but it can't be that hard. You see in
most of you seen this before. All right,

749
00:46:53,581 --> 00:46:55,920
so don't, if you haven't
seen before, don't panic.

750
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:58,410
All I did was I did a
little bit of calculus.

751
00:46:58,411 --> 00:47:00,510
It's a bit of Algebra and
then I drew the thing.

752
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:01,943
I just drew the thing.

753
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:04,960
Okay,

754
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:09,990
so this is from one's best response as
a function of Q two what is from two's

755
00:47:10,631 --> 00:47:15,631
best response as a function
of Q one let's just get that.

756
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:20,800
Just to remind you, the way we read this
is you give me a quantity of from too,

757
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:25,720
I find from one's best response by going
across to the pink client and dropping

758
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:28,390
down,
so a from to produces this amount.

759
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,550
Then one's best response is
this amount if from Jupiter is,

760
00:47:31,551 --> 00:47:36,150
is this amount than foam ones?
Best response. Is this. Alright.

761
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,660
Now conversely,

762
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:42,760
how do we find from two's best response
as a function of Q one what does that

763
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:47,280
look like? Yeah, to take it to get the,

764
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:51,510
I guess two guys in front of you,
shout it out.

765
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:57,010
It's a symmetrical across the
45 degree. All right. Right.

766
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:01,590
It's reflected across the 45 degree line.
So let's reflect these two points.

767
00:48:02,570 --> 00:48:04,910
That's will be here.

768
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:09,820
This will be what would be a bit
more careful, but miss by a mile.

769
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:10,790
Let me just try again.

770
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:20,730
I missed by a mile, which is, which
is a problem in drawing my lines,

771
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,564
but never mind.

772
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:22,693
Yeah.

773
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:27,471
All right,

774
00:48:27,471 --> 00:48:32,471
so this will be the monopoly
quantity for from to,

775
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:34,520
and this is the competitor quantity.

776
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,910
All right,
so if I draw on that better,

777
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,650
it would look as if this was
half of this distance, right?

778
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:48,290
I didn't draw it. Well, try and
draw it better in your notes.

779
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:52,320
All right. All right? So this is

780
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,760
a minus c over B and this
is anyway a c of a to B.

781
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,160
So this distance and this
distance and had to be the same.

782
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,110
And the way I've drawn it
this donut at the same at all.

783
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,053
All right?

784
00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:09,850
Okay.

785
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:14,850
And the way we read this green graph is
you give me a choice of from one he won.

786
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:21,220
I go up to the Green Line and go across,
and this tells me the best response

787
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:25,580
for fun too.
All right?

788
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:30,850
So at this point, how many of you
have seen this picture before? Good.

789
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:34,940
Many of you have seen it
before. All right? So, uh,

790
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:39,190
I think we can really cold call somebody
for this one. All right? So, uh, uh,

791
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,180
somebody tell me and
pick some time to cope,

792
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,660
but when you cold call somebody alia,
anybody can close by.

793
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:49,920
Okay? Okay. Okay. So
here's the tough question.

794
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:53,550
Watch the Nash Equilibrium on this
picture where the green and the pink line

795
00:49:53,551 --> 00:49:56,850
intersect. All right, where are the
green and the pink line intersect? Right?

796
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:01,140
All right, so this must be, this
must be the Nash Equilibrium, right?

797
00:50:01,141 --> 00:50:05,380
That wasn't hard. Right. Okay. Okay.
All right. Now. Okay, so why, what was,

798
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,830
go back again.
Why is this the Nash Equilibrium?

799
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,440
Because at this point as
in the partnership game,

800
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:14,080
was there a similar thing
as on the partnership game
where the best response is

801
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:18,720
Intersex is where player Wong is playing
a best response to play a two and play

802
00:50:18,721 --> 00:50:20,670
a two is playing a
restaurant supplier one.

803
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:25,530
So this is the Nash Equilibrium
in this corner of game, right?

804
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:29,390
Let's do a little bit of,
just to make sure we can find this thing.

805
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:34,270
All right,
so we're going to do is

806
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,630
set these two things
are equal to each other.

807
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:42,063
Okay.

808
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,520
Put in stores here.

809
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,673
Yeah,

810
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:51,080
so at at the national equilibrium
quantities shouldn't really do this,

811
00:50:51,271 --> 00:50:53,190
but never mind at the Nash Equilibrium.

812
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:58,220
Quantity's I'm going to have Q one star
is equal to a minus CEO to be Q two

813
00:50:58,351 --> 00:51:02,170
stars that Dra and Q two
star is equal to amen.

814
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:06,510
A C of a to B you one star two.
All right,

815
00:51:06,511 --> 00:51:11,220
and I'm going to solve this out by sending
[inaudible] since I know the game is

816
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:15,120
symmetric
and they weren't on the 45 degree line.

817
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,150
All right,

818
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:21,150
so all I have to do here to do this
algebraically is to solve out these

819
00:51:21,151 --> 00:51:23,640
equations.
So let's try and do that.

820
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:28,680
So putting Q1 in here,
right?

821
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,770
If I substitute Q one in here,
what would it give me?

822
00:51:31,771 --> 00:51:36,771
It'll give me Q one star is equal
to a minus c over to B minus Q one.

823
00:51:40,771 --> 00:51:45,360
Start over to,
let's multiply both sides by two.

824
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:50,630
I'll get to Q one star is
equal to a minus c over B

825
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:58,570
minus Q one star.
Take that to the other side.

826
00:51:58,571 --> 00:52:03,571
They have three Q one star is equal to
a minus c over B and finally divide by

827
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:10,920
three Q one star is equal to a minus C

828
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,300
I have a by three B.

829
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:19,460
All right,

830
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:24,460
so that crossing point actually occurs
at a minus c over three B and they're

831
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,120
going to look desperately. My ta
is, it didn't make her to did.

832
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:30,340
I didn't screw that up, I think. I think,
I think I didn't screw that up. All right,

833
00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:32,600
so this is sometimes called the corn Oh,
quantity.

834
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:37,710
This game,

835
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,190
this game of imperfect competition between
two firms competing in court disease

836
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,700
was thought up and,
and and uh,

837
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:48,650
studied by a French economist
called core know, uh,

838
00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:50,730
almost a hundred years before nash.

839
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:55,050
And I said a hundred is really before
the invention of Game Theory, right?

840
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,070
Someone had figured out
this arm stuff for this guy.

841
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:59,940
All right.

842
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:05,580
Okay. So what do we know so
far? I'll leave the Algebra.

843
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,190
They're transferred up here.

844
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:10,771
You stuck.

845
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:15,771
He one star equals Q two
star equals a minus c

846
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,633
over three B.

847
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:25,750
All right.

848
00:53:28,730 --> 00:53:32,150
So so far we've hit, we've been
working pretty hard and we haven't,

849
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:34,760
I guess moon's a lot.
We just kind of solve the thing out.

850
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,610
Now we get to draw some lessons
on this thing. All right?

851
00:53:37,611 --> 00:53:40,160
So everybody who's feeding a little bit
shell shocked from having been doing

852
00:53:40,161 --> 00:53:44,540
Algebra and calculus and drawing pictures
and feeling like they've been cheated

853
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:48,050
into taking a class that looks far
too much like economics. Calm down.

854
00:53:48,051 --> 00:53:49,490
We're going to actually talk about it now.

855
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,360
Okay.
All right.

856
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:55,490
So one thing to remark about this gay,

857
00:53:55,491 --> 00:53:59,720
why don't we learned immediately is that
this game is different in a significant

858
00:53:59,721 --> 00:54:02,750
way to different from the
partnership game. I mean,

859
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,520
obviously it's different because
it's about to make a difference,

860
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:06,530
but I mean in terms of the
game theory is different.

861
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,330
It's different from the partnership game.

862
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,250
It's different from the investment game.

863
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:12,860
What is it that's different
about this came from the Po?

864
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:15,740
What's the obvious thing I was looking
at this picture that makes it different

865
00:54:15,741 --> 00:54:19,970
from the partnership? Yeah.
In the partnership game,

866
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:24,260
the best response lines sloped up.
Is that right?

867
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,080
The more I did have my strategy,

868
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,920
the more the other player did is a
best response in the investment game.

869
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,950
The more likely I was to invest,
the more likely you are,

870
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,480
the more you want to do invest.
Right? But in this game,

871
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:40,100
we have the exact opposites.

872
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:43,640
The more player one produces,

873
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:49,430
the more player one produces the less
player to wants to produce and the more

874
00:54:51,201 --> 00:54:55,610
player to producers,
the less player one wants to produce.

875
00:54:56,450 --> 00:55:01,100
All right, so this game is a
game, not a strategic compliments,

876
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,060
but a strategic substitutes.

877
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,890
I don't want to be careful here.
It's not,

878
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:17,330
it's not that these goods are substitutes.
I mean clear. That's also the case,

879
00:55:17,331 --> 00:55:21,410
right? If both your firms are producing
bottled water and it's identical,

880
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:25,340
right, then, then the goods
themselves are substitutes.

881
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,100
That's not the point I'm making here.
Strategic substitutes as a strategy is,

882
00:55:29,101 --> 00:55:30,890
is a statement about
the nature of the game.

883
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:36,290
So strategic substitutes is telling
me that my strategy is the strategic

884
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,890
substitute of your strategy.
If the more I do have my strategy,

885
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:42,890
the less you want to do of yours,
and conversely,

886
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,800
the more you want to do of your strategy,
the less I want to do.

887
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:50,990
Right?
Okay.

888
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,610
Well, let's come back to the
question we started with,

889
00:55:56,611 --> 00:55:59,070
which has to do with profits
and so on and society.

890
00:55:59,730 --> 00:56:02,400
We know that if these players
play these games, if we,

891
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,620
at least if we believe
in Nash equilibrium it,

892
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:08,280
then they're going to produce these
quantities they're going to produce here.

893
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:10,723
Right?

894
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:12,840
Well,
let's ask a different question.

895
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:16,880
He usually these firms is trying
to maximize profit. All right,

896
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,410
but how about the total profit in the
industry? Whereas each of these firms,

897
00:56:22,411 --> 00:56:26,110
we know where the, that playing a bass
response is maximizing their profits.

898
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:27,880
Taking this,
given what the other firms doing,

899
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,130
but how about total industry profits?
Are they being maximized here?

900
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:39,000
Who thinks total industry
profits are being maximized?

901
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:42,810
Who thinks total energy profits and not
being maximized? All right, good. Good.

902
00:56:42,811 --> 00:56:46,320
So not to shout out. Okay, so total
ownership of it to not being maximized.

903
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,830
Where on the picture? I don't know.
Getting on a bit of cold calling in here.

904
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:54,330
Where on the picture maximize
this total industry profits.

905
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,150
Hmm. We're on the pitch of
maximizes total industry profits.

906
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,460
We had, we had it before. That's what
else? Yeah, no, no idea. No idea.

907
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:08,450
People taking the fifth. Yeah.
Yeah. The guy in there. Yeah.

908
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,790
Is it at the monopoly,

909
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:12,460
right? Monopoly. Exactly.

910
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,150
So clearly if we punish
the monopoly quantity,

911
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:20,320
by definition the monopoly quantity
maximizes total industry profits.

912
00:57:20,321 --> 00:57:21,220
And for example,

913
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:26,340
if from to shut down and from one
produced it's monopoly profits,

914
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:31,690
it's monopoly quantity that would
maximize profits. And conversely,

915
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:36,580
if from one shot down and from to
produced it's monopoly quantity,

916
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:40,690
that would maximize industry profits.
All right,

917
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,810
where else in ms pet shop
maximize energy profits.

918
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:49,070
So this point maximized industry
industry profits and this point maximizes

919
00:57:49,481 --> 00:57:51,910
industry profits.
Where else maximizes industry profits?

920
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,773
Anybody?

921
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:57,251
Well,

922
00:57:57,251 --> 00:58:02,251
how about all the points in between here
from one produced nothing and from to

923
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:06,520
produce the monopoly quantity and
hear from to produced nothing.

924
00:58:06,521 --> 00:58:08,920
And from one produced
the monopoly quantity.

925
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:13,480
But you could also just split the
monopoly quantity for example,

926
00:58:13,481 --> 00:58:15,310
half half at this point here.

927
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:16,933
All right,

928
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:19,620
so the first,
what did to make more money?

929
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:25,080
One thing they could do is they
could sign an agreement saying,

930
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:28,130
why don't each of us
produced not our core,

931
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:32,510
no quantity but produce half
monopoly profits. Sorry,

932
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:34,500
half monopoly,
half a monopoly quantity.

933
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:40,060
And that would produce this much.
All right?

934
00:58:40,061 --> 00:58:45,061
It's a foam one would be producing half
its monopoly property quantity in fem.

935
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:49,260
Two would be Buddhism, Hellfest
monopoly quantity. All right.

936
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:54,160
So what's wrong with that agreement? So
he had to have that, whether they there,

937
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:58,780
uh, to water companies are that
Poland Spring and uh, and uh, um,

938
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:02,460
cocacola I guess these days of signing
this agreement saying that each one's

939
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:05,430
going to produce Hoffman off like one
did eat and what's gonna go wrong with

940
00:59:05,431 --> 00:59:06,264
that agreement?

941
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,490
Yeah,
the got the guy in red.

942
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,620
First of all, it's illegal. It's
illegal. It's illegal, right? So,

943
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:17,630
so even without the being
an attorney general,

944
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:20,970
somebody might be awakened the Justice
Department and know and notice that

945
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,920
actually illegal. All right? It's
illegal to sign an agreement, uh, to, uh,

946
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:29,210
to sign a contract saying you're going
to restrict a quantities. It's illegal.

947
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,280
So they can't sign that as a contract,

948
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:33,800
but hey are they could just
agree in the doers, right?

949
00:59:33,801 --> 00:59:35,530
So Coca Cola in Poland spring,

950
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:39,350
it could just agree to produce half
the quantity of water each day.

951
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:40,783
All right,

952
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:43,750
what's going to go, what, what might
go wrong in that agreement? It's just,

953
00:59:43,751 --> 00:59:47,470
let's just suppose that that game is
just being played once for now. Hi.

954
00:59:47,471 --> 00:59:51,640
And suppose that this is Coca Cola is
quantity and this is Poland springs

955
00:59:51,641 --> 00:59:56,180
quantity. And suppose your, the, your,
the manager of Poland Spring, right?

956
00:59:56,181 --> 01:00:00,280
So water is coming out of the ground
in Maine for you. All right. And you,

957
01:00:00,281 --> 01:00:05,260
you know that it's Coca Cola guy is
going to produce this quantity here.

958
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:11,350
Alright, so this is Q m those are
two. Do you ever receive? All right,

959
01:00:11,351 --> 01:00:13,240
so let's,
let's pick on our two managers.

960
01:00:13,241 --> 01:00:14,640
It's have to people who've spoken before.

961
01:00:14,641 --> 01:00:18,340
So the guy in the red shirts name is
Steve and I guess in red he should be the

962
01:00:18,341 --> 01:00:21,820
coca coca cola gay. Right. All
right. And uh, let's pick on our,

963
01:00:21,821 --> 01:00:25,410
our Jimmy Stewart from last week, whose
name is Patrick, right? Uh, and again,

964
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:27,490
can I get a mic? Come on,
Patrick. All right. All right.

965
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:29,830
So Steve and Patrick of
the art respectively,

966
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:34,420
the managers of Coca Cola and uh,
and Poland spring.

967
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:36,880
And uh, here it is, right, right.

968
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:42,090
And Patrick Patrick believes that the
coca cola manager he's going to is just

969
01:00:42,371 --> 01:00:45,840
make this coke and Pepsi's, it's two
identical that near enough of identical,

970
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:49,120
right? So there's a coke and
Pepsi went that, that will
confuse me last. All right,

971
01:00:49,121 --> 01:00:49,841
so Patrick,

972
01:00:49,841 --> 01:00:54,130
our manager of Pepsi believes that Coca
Cola is going to produce this quantity

973
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:58,030
and he's agreed to produce this quantity.
What is Patrick actually going to do?

974
01:00:58,031 --> 01:00:59,620
Patrick, are you going to do? Huh?

975
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:03,650
So I should cheat and,
and picnic on me on my best response line.

976
01:01:03,651 --> 01:01:06,350
It's much farther out so I'll, I'll
produce it more than that. Quantity.

977
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:09,800
All right, so Patrick, just being Jimmy's
do it or not? Actually, when he's in the,

978
01:01:09,801 --> 01:01:14,240
in the, when he's playing, the manager of
Pepsi is going to produce more of this,

979
01:01:14,241 --> 01:01:17,120
uh,
undrinkable liquid and produce

980
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,250
this quantity here. All
right, so what is this?

981
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:26,730
This is Patrick's best response

982
01:01:28,350 --> 01:01:32,010
to the other guy producing
the monopoly quantity.

983
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:34,263
Alright.

984
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:34,750
All right.

985
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:39,610
So Patrick's response and Pepsi is to
overproduce rolls up to the monopoly

986
01:01:39,611 --> 01:01:44,560
quantity. Actually overproduce even
roads into the corner quantity, right?

987
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:47,980
And produce all the way out of here.
Okay,

988
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:52,900
so Patrick's producing here,
but what about Mister Coca Cola guy?

989
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,720
All right. Now, Mr Coca Cola
Guy knows Patrick pretty well,

990
01:01:56,721 --> 01:02:00,040
but you know there've be in the same
industry for a while. I missed uh, uh,

991
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:02,680
Mr. Koch, Hilda, his
name is Stephen. Stephen.

992
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:07,890
Stephen Presumably knows that Patrick
is actually going to produce this

993
01:02:09,071 --> 01:02:10,660
quantity. Sorry, this quantity.

994
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:12,220
Okay.

995
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:13,980
So Steven, what do you, what, what,
what, what should you produce?

996
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:17,750
Increased my own production to,
to match my of my best response line.

997
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:21,060
Good.
So anticipating

998
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:25,070
that Patrick is going to
think that Steven's a sock
habit and to Patrick's going

999
01:02:25,071 --> 01:02:26,970
to cheat on him and produce too much.

1000
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:31,320
Steven's going to produce the best
response to that and he's going to produce

1001
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:36,180
this quantity here.
So what is this?

1002
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:40,020
This is player twos best response.

1003
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:42,360
So player ones,

1004
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:47,630
best response to play it to
producing half monopoly out but

1005
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,073
alright.

1006
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,810
But Patrick knows Steven pretty well.

1007
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:56,750
He knows those guys who run in Coca
Cola are pretty snow mark guys.

1008
01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:01,430
So Patrick knows that the guy who runs
coca cola is going to anticipate that the

1009
01:03:01,431 --> 01:03:04,730
guy who runs Pepsi is going to
cheat on the guy who runs coca cola.

1010
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:07,430
And hence the guy Runscope of color
is going to be our best response to

1011
01:03:07,431 --> 01:03:11,630
Patrick's cheese in quantity.
So what quantity is, uh,

1012
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:13,080
is Patrick and a produce

1013
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:18,740
auction then out on a pretty close to
the Cornell, you delivery. All right,

1014
01:03:18,741 --> 01:03:23,120
so you're going to go to here to this
point here is don't even write this.

1015
01:03:23,121 --> 01:03:28,000
This is the best response of planning
one to the best responsive player to,

1016
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:32,150
to the best response of player
one to play or to producing

1017
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:37,850
half monopoly output and the lots
of brackets. Yeah. All right. Hey,

1018
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:42,260
can anyone see where this process is going
through? This process is going right?

1019
01:03:42,261 --> 01:03:46,160
It's going back. It's going back
to the Nash Equilibrium, right?

1020
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:47,940
Each of them is trying
to buy a best response.

1021
01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:51,170
What we anticipate the other person's
going to do, and in this game,

1022
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:52,640
if they keep on doing that,

1023
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:56,120
it's going to drag them back to
Nash equilibrium to be careful here.

1024
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:57,500
This will be true of all games,

1025
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:00,590
but in this game playing
best response to each other,

1026
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:04,700
figuring out that in fact the other guy
is going to going to cheat on me or the

1027
01:04:04,701 --> 01:04:07,490
other guys or anticipate that I'm going
to cheat on him with other guys and I

1028
01:04:07,491 --> 01:04:09,530
anticipate that I'm going to anticipate
that he's going to cheat on me,

1029
01:04:09,531 --> 01:04:13,460
et Cetera, et cetera. We'll eventually
drag us back to the court. Oh, quantity.

1030
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:15,103
All right,

1031
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:19,370
so it's going to be pretty difficult
for us to sustain this joint monopoly

1032
01:04:19,371 --> 01:04:23,300
output. There's collusive agreement.
We can't let the courts enforce it.

1033
01:04:23,690 --> 01:04:26,830
What Coca Cola and Pepsi is, we really
don't want to bring the math yet again,

1034
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:28,880
although maybe we do, I
don't know. All right?

1035
01:04:28,881 --> 01:04:32,450
So basically we're stuck with this
verbal agreement and we both have an

1036
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:35,960
incentive to cheat and produce
more whatever it is, sugar water.

1037
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:39,170
Right?
Okay.

1038
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:41,000
No,
in practice,

1039
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:45,440
this is not the only problem facing two
firms who are producers who are trying

1040
01:04:45,441 --> 01:04:47,830
to produce the monopoly output,
right?

1041
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:52,070
In practice when firms trying
to have these, uh, agreements,

1042
01:04:52,071 --> 01:04:55,280
which are not contracts to try
and produce joint monopoly output.

1043
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,420
What else goes wrong?
What else goes wrong?

1044
01:04:59,450 --> 01:05:02,480
So here you could imagine some
firms trying to have an agreement.

1045
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:05,270
We know they can't sign the
legal agreements, but let's,

1046
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,940
let's take that off the table. So for
example, in around 1900 and America,

1047
01:05:08,941 --> 01:05:12,020
or a little bit earlier, let's say,
let's say a eight and 18 in America,

1048
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:15,050
it really isn't clear that it was
illegal to write agreements to say,

1049
01:05:15,051 --> 01:05:16,990
we'll restrict what it is.
Right?

1050
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:21,220
Firms didn't use to write that kind of
agreement, but still something went wrong.

1051
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:22,833
What went wrong?

1052
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:25,900
So we're getting a little bit further
away from the game and more back into the

1053
01:05:25,901 --> 01:05:29,870
real world. Yeah. What kinds
of things went wrong? I want
to get some news nearer.

1054
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:32,500
Mike, can I, can I, can I get the
woman here they are the Yale shut

1055
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:37,030
without a contract.
Yeah.

1056
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:41,030
There's no means of enforcement. All
right. So, so it might be, again,

1057
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:42,210
there's a problem with enforcement,

1058
01:05:42,211 --> 01:05:43,980
although actually in each
and each year in America,

1059
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,550
it's not clear that they couldn't have
enforced that contract. All right,

1060
01:05:47,551 --> 01:05:52,020
so one problem is unenforceable se,
right. But no new far I'll go with that.

1061
01:05:52,021 --> 01:05:55,020
Might have been a problem. What
else? The guy next, next time.

1062
01:05:55,230 --> 01:05:56,063
Yeah.

1063
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,710
If they're not at the competitive outcome,

1064
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,590
they could undercut price
and take the entire market.

1065
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:06,040
Let's be careful.
I will come back that next time,

1066
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,830
but right now we're competing in
quantities, right? So, so we're not,

1067
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:11,020
we're not fixing prices here
and even leaving prices,

1068
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:14,710
we're just producing coca cola and
Pepsi and for want of a better word,

1069
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:19,030
spewing it out into the market. All
right. What? What else goes wrong here?

1070
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:24,540
Well, one thing that goes wrong
is it supposed coke and Pepsi?

1071
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:28,680
Why able to either to write a contract
or whatever just to stay in giant

1072
01:06:28,681 --> 01:06:32,100
monopoly outputs at this high price
is price, which is, oh, I'm sorry.

1073
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:35,460
I just called con presumed positive
profits and the industry and he's going to

1074
01:06:35,461 --> 01:06:37,890
turn out. Therefore, the price
is going to be above costs.

1075
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:41,850
These firms making a lot of profits.
What is going to happen in this industry?

1076
01:06:42,780 --> 01:06:45,470
It's interesting.
It's got a lot of profit or a around that.

1077
01:06:45,471 --> 01:06:48,660
What's gonna Happen in this industry?
Yeah, the the guy in the blue shirt here.

1078
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:50,670
I like this guy here.

1079
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,343
I know

1080
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:55,950
editor could join the market.
All right.

1081
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,700
Another foam is going to come
in and produce similar products.

1082
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:02,280
So Dr Pepper or something that
the same is that the third one?

1083
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:05,670
Someone else is going to come in and
Produce Cola and this industry and that's

1084
01:07:05,671 --> 01:07:09,630
exactly, that's exactly what happened in
the u s at the turn of the last century

1085
01:07:09,810 --> 01:07:12,840
companies did Bruce agreements
to restrict, for example,

1086
01:07:12,841 --> 01:07:16,800
the production of paper and the production
of rubber and the production of steel

1087
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:21,780
and the production of iron and the
production of, of uh, of a railway lines.

1088
01:07:21,781 --> 01:07:24,120
Actually he didn't quite
complicated things and sure enough,

1089
01:07:24,121 --> 01:07:28,560
what you see very quickly emerging is
new entrants entering the market to say,

1090
01:07:28,561 --> 01:07:31,110
hey, these firms restricting
that their quantities,

1091
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:33,450
we can get in there and make money.
All right,

1092
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:38,580
so new and a competitive fringe of firms
is going to enter and drive prices down.

1093
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,740
Now,
I talked about that in 1900 America.

1094
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:44,240
Where is that happened in the
20th century? More dramatically.

1095
01:07:44,241 --> 01:07:47,640
So we know the early example in
sort of sort of Golden Age America,

1096
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:51,720
but what else did we see a competitor
fringe enter when there was a collusive

1097
01:07:51,721 --> 01:07:54,090
agreement to keep prices,
keep quantities down

1098
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:56,443
airlines

1099
01:07:56,650 --> 01:08:00,540
to airlines. Okay, good. The airlines
as an example, we've seen that. What,

1100
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:01,800
where else?
Oh,

1101
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:04,360
y'all is probably the classic example
of airlines is a good example. Okay,

1102
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,470
so an oil,

1103
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:09,430
we all know that in the s and the late
sixties early seventies OPEC was formed

1104
01:08:09,431 --> 01:08:13,270
precisely to restrict quantity among
the major oil producing countries.

1105
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:17,960
And very quickly we see, take it,
other countries take advantage of this,

1106
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:20,390
just start producing oil profitably.
So who,

1107
01:08:20,450 --> 01:08:22,820
who are the competitive
French against OPEC

1108
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:26,993
anyway?

1109
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,680
Well, the bread swa for
a start, the Brits, uh,

1110
01:08:31,870 --> 01:08:34,600
England and Scotland, I
should say Britain. Anyway,

1111
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:36,810
started producing oil in the North Sea.

1112
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:41,110
Lots of countries in Latin America
started looking and finding oil.

1113
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:46,160
And of course, Russian oil,
uh, uh, started being a very,
very profitable. All right,

1114
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:47,740
so there's two,

1115
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:51,280
there are various reasons why it's hard
to maintain this collusive agreement.

1116
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:55,210
One is there's an incentive to cheat and
another is that other firms are going

1117
01:08:55,211 --> 01:08:57,400
to enter.
But before we leave this,

1118
01:08:57,430 --> 01:09:01,150
let's just pose the question we
started with suppose. In fact,

1119
01:09:01,151 --> 01:09:03,820
we do end up back at
the corn. Oh, quantity.

1120
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:07,260
So here we are back at the
corner quantity, right?

1121
01:09:07,570 --> 01:09:12,250
How does this quantity compare and how
does that for the prices compare and how

1122
01:09:12,251 --> 01:09:17,251
to profits compare with monopoly prices
on the one hand and competitive prices

1123
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:21,600
on the other? All right, so we
know, we know the courts did.

1124
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:24,820
It's going to be produced. We
figured that out. Here it is.

1125
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:30,610
We know that the contract is
going to be produced. Each firm,

1126
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:37,470
each firm is going to produce a minus
c over three B and there are two such

1127
01:09:38,711 --> 01:09:41,890
firms. So the total quantity
produced in the market,

1128
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:47,730
total quantity

1129
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,690
will be to a minus c over three B.

1130
01:09:52,440 --> 01:09:53,300
All right.

1131
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,660
How does that compare to
the monopoly quantity? Well,

1132
01:09:56,661 --> 01:10:01,661
the monopoly quantity
was a minus c over to be,

1133
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:08,090
the competitive quantity was a minus c
over B to remind you of those that are on

1134
01:10:09,691 --> 01:10:10,524
a picture.

1135
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:15,470
Here's a minus t a Tubie
and here's a MSC over B.

1136
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:21,950
So this is the total quantity produced
on this equilibrium in this corner,

1137
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:26,180
Nash Equilibrium. How does it
compare to the monopoly quantity?

1138
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,460
Enter the competitive quantity.

1139
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:34,183
Anybody

1140
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:38,220
a little bit of just staring at the
board, which, which of these is bigger?

1141
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:43,490
So I claim that this total quantity being
produced is less than the competitive

1142
01:10:43,941 --> 01:10:44,774
quantity,

1143
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:49,170
but more in total than
the monopoly quantity.

1144
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:51,403
All right.

1145
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,390
I was about to hit it the wrong way round.
That's right.

1146
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,350
So the total quantity being produced
is less than will be produced on the

1147
01:10:58,351 --> 01:11:02,040
perfect competition,
but more than we produced under monopoly.

1148
01:11:02,670 --> 01:11:05,360
And consequently prices are
going to go the other way, right?

1149
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:09,060
And consequently prices are going
to be highest on the monopoly.

1150
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:14,370
Lowest under competition. I'm somewhere
in between in this corner situation.

1151
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:20,400
All right, so from the point of view
of, of point of view of the producers,

1152
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:24,240
this corner equilibrium
is worse than monopoly,

1153
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:27,390
but better than perfect competition and
but what have you have the rest of us,

1154
01:11:27,391 --> 01:11:28,410
the consumers,

1155
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:32,550
this corner quantity is worse
than perfect competition,

1156
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:37,620
but better than monopoly.
All right there he ride on that being,

1157
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:41,370
if that producing Coca Cola and you
have any kind of concern for your teeth,

1158
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:45,780
maybe you can, maybe you shouldn't
produce so much. Anyway. All right,

1159
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:51,060
so so far what we've done is we've
looked at this classic, if I had,

1160
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,310
it's not the most exciting
game in the world,

1161
01:11:53,311 --> 01:11:57,000
but it he'll classic and the application
of Game Theory to imperfect competition.

1162
01:11:57,300 --> 01:11:59,460
Next time, I'm actually going
to take us a bit further,

1163
01:11:59,461 --> 01:12:03,180
but I'm going to leave this game behind
and look at other ways in which we can

1164
01:12:03,181 --> 01:12:05,370
study imperfect competition
using game theory.
