1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:05,670
So last time we finished up
by playing the game of Nim,

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,631
I never remember,

3
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:11,631
I hope that the game of men was a game
where I would those two piles of stones

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:12,620
are we,

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:17,620
we may do with lions on the board and
the winner was the person who who picked

6
00:00:17,761 --> 00:00:19,340
up the last stone,
I'm gonna be Agile,

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,350
you have to pick piles and I want to use
the game of naming to make a transition

8
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:25,231
here.

9
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:30,120
So we'd pointed out about the game of Nim
was it illustrated very nicely for us.

10
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,450
That's a games can have first mover
advantages or they can have second mover

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,640
advantages,
a very small change in the game.

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,500
Essentially a suppose small change in it.

13
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:43,800
And where we started from could switch
a game from a game with a first mover

14
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:47,700
advantage to a game with a second
mover advantage. All right,

15
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,730
now today I want to make it just draw
a slightly grander lesson out of that

16
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:58,470
game. So not only was it the case that
that's the game sometimes has first mover

17
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:01,260
advantages and sometimes
has second mover advantages.

18
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,590
But moreover we could tell when it had a
first mover advantage and we could tell

19
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,780
when he had a second mover advantage.
It's not right.

20
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:11,940
When we actually looked at the
initial setup of those stones,

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,020
we knew immediately that's a game
in which player one is going to win.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,370
Or alternatively we knew immediately
that's a game which player two is going to

23
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,230
win.
All right?

24
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:27,410
Now it turns out that that idea is very
general and actually has a name attached

25
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,360
to it.
And that name is de Mello.

26
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,940
So today we'll start off by talking
about a theorem due to a guy called zoom

27
00:01:39,941 --> 00:01:42,380
mellow and the idea of this therapist.
Next,

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,120
we're gonna look at games
more general than just Nim.

29
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,320
And we're going to ask the question,
uh,

30
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:51,900
under what circumstances would you know
about a game? I either the player one,

31
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:56,901
the person who goes first can force a
whim or the player to can force a win or

32
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:02,430
what allow a third possibility, which
is it's going to be a tie. All right,

33
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,230
so here's the theorem. Suppose
there are two players in this game,

34
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,900
like the game we looked at last time,

35
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,810
and suppose I won't to
find this formally now,

36
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:17,220
but suppose the game is a
game of imperfect, infamous,

37
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,330
or have perfect information.
So we're only my perfect information.

38
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,760
I'll define that later on the class.
But for now,

39
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:28,680
all I mean is that whenever play,
whenever it player has his turn to move,

40
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,780
that player knows exactly
what has happened prior in
the game. So for example,

41
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:35,230
all these sequential move gains,

42
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,640
we've been looking at our moves of
perfect information. When I get to move,

43
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,560
I know exactly what you did yesterday.

44
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,680
I know what I did the day before
yesterday. I was so, all right,

45
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:45,060
so it's a game of perfect information.

46
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,830
I'm going to assume that the game
has a finite number of nodes.

47
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,600
So two things here. It can't
go on forever. This game,

48
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,400
and also there's no point
at which it branches in an
infinite way. All, all right?

49
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:03,370
There's a finite number of nodes and
we'll assume that the game has three

50
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:07,460
possible outcomes. And actually there's
a more general version of this therapy,

51
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,560
but this will do for now.

52
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:14,010
The three possible outcomes are
either a win for player one,

53
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:18,970
so I'll call it w sub one
or a loss for player one,

54
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,850
which is obviously a win for player too,
or tie.

55
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,520
All right? So the game like name
last time literally had two outcomes.

56
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,510
So here we're going to go up for three
outcomes or a three Oh three or fewer

57
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:36,100
outcomes I should say. All right,
so these are the conditions

58
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,301
and here's the results.

59
00:03:39,301 --> 00:03:42,550
So I said three it could be three
but it could also be to here.

60
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,110
I'm just allowing for three.
One is true. All right?

61
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:50,290
So under these conditions,
the following is true.

62
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,520
Either play a one

63
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,600
can force or win.

64
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:03,550
So either it's the case that this game
is a game that had player one plays as

65
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:07,000
well as they can. They're going
to win the game. All right.

66
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:12,001
No matter what player
two Dash Oh two oh sorry.

67
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,653
Oh one

68
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,950
can at least to tie.

69
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,400
Yeah.

70
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:20,671
All right.

71
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:23,700
Which means player one complaints such
a way that they can assure themselves of

72
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:28,560
a tie regardless of what player too does.
Oh,

73
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,870
it could be a game in which to

74
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:37,600
can force a loss on one.

75
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,710
All right, so when is this? All right.

76
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,880
All right,

77
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,700
so this third, when you first look at
it, it doesn't seem to save very much.

78
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,200
I you're staring at this thing.

79
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:53,730
You might think that we already knew that
we're looking at games that only have

80
00:04:53,731 --> 00:04:57,540
three possible outcomes, win, loss or tie.

81
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,390
All right,
so it doesn't seem so surprising.

82
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:01,660
If you look at this third minute says,

83
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,570
why are they going to end up
with a win or a loss or Tai Chi?

84
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,540
But that's not quite what the Theorem
says, right? The therm say is not,

85
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,470
and you're going to end up there.
We knew that already,

86
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,820
but but games divided themselves get
into these foam divide themselves into

87
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:17,940
those games in which player
one has a way of winning,

88
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,300
regardless of what player too does,
right?

89
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,190
Or Games which pay one has
a way of forcing a Thai
regardless of what player one

90
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:29,790
does. By two days or play
a two as a way of winning,

91
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:34,290
regardless of what our player one does.
Ratchet, these games all have a solution.

92
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,010
It's just go back to Nim to illustrate
the point. All right, so in Nim, uh,

93
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,230
actually there's no ties.

94
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:44,520
We can forget the middle of the years
and in Nim under certain circumstances,

95
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,940
it is the case that player
one can force a win.

96
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,240
Who remembers what the case was for
when player one can force a win?

97
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,110
Anybody when people who played last time,

98
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,603
Oh

99
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,640
yes, I know some. Somebody
here just, yeah, sure.

100
00:06:02,641 --> 00:06:03,780
I just shout it out

101
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,010
of,

102
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,700
all right, so if the, if the
piles starts on the call,

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,900
if the pile start on equal,

104
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,100
then player one can actually force a win.
So in Nim

105
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,130
in them, if the piles are
on equal, not the stars,

106
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,550
then one can force a win.

107
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,340
It really doesn't matter what
two does to his toast. All right.

108
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,110
Or the alternative case is the
piles are equal at the stars.

109
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,980
And if that equal at the start,
then it's play a one who's toast,

110
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,250
right player to is kind of oh
well the force, the loss on one.

111
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,160
So to can force.

112
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,190
I lost on one [inaudible].

113
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,970
All right everyone remember
that from last time? Yeah,

114
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,550
it just before the weekend and be so
far. Let me go. All right, so, so this,

115
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,360
this theorem applies to
all games of this form.

116
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,840
So what games are this fullness
and think of some other examples.

117
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,880
So one example is tic TAC toe. All right?
Everyone knows the rules of ticked out.

118
00:07:15,881 --> 00:07:17,470
I didn't even know we call
it noughts and crosses,

119
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,330
but you guys call it a tic TAC toe.
Is that right?

120
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,580
Everyone know what Tic Tac toe is?
Yeah. So in Tic Tac toe, oh, which,

121
00:07:24,581 --> 00:07:26,500
which category is Tic Tac toe?
Is it the game?

122
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:30,610
Which player one can force a win or is
it the category in which player one can

123
00:07:30,611 --> 00:07:32,590
only force a tie or is it a category?

124
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:35,070
What you'd rather go second
and play two could force it.

125
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:38,440
Force of wind for buy a two or lost
replay one, which just tic TAC toe.

126
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,350
That's a show of hands here.

127
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,140
Who Thinks Tic Tac toe is a game
which play one can force a win.

128
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,460
Who Thinks Tic Tac? That is a game which
would play, won't get any force a tie.

129
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,180
And I think it's probably one who
thinks a player is going to win.

130
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,730
I think you'll read most of you're right.
It's a game.

131
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,300
It's a game in which if
people play correctly then
it will turn out to be a tie.

132
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,070
All Right,
so tic TAC toe

133
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,090
TGC TIC TAC toe is a
game that leads to a tie.

134
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,750
All right? Play a one can still make a
mistake, in which case they can lose,

135
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,940
play a tube and make a mistake,
in which case there would lose.

136
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,400
But there is a way of playing
that forces a tie. All right,

137
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,370
so these are fairly simple games.
Let's talk about more complicated games.

138
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,470
So what about the game of checkers?
Right?

139
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:27,370
So the game of checkers meets these
conditions. It's a two player game.

140
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:32,350
You always know all the moves prior to
your move. It's fine. I, it's all right.

141
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,130
There's some rules and checkers that
prevented going on forever and there are

142
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:37,990
two or three outcomes.
I guess there's a third outcome.

143
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:40,090
If you've got into a cycle,
you could tie, all right,

144
00:08:40,091 --> 00:08:43,960
it's a checkers is a fits all these
disruptions and what this theorem tells us

145
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,930
is that checkers has a solution,
right?

146
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:49,300
I'm not trying to know what that solution
is or I think actually somebody did

147
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:51,700
computer it quite recently,
even though the last few months,

148
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:53,590
I just forgot to Google it
this morning to remind myself,

149
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,730
but what the storm shelters, even
before this, people have computed it.

150
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,200
Check has has a solution. All right,
let's be a bit more ambitious.

151
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,090
What about chess? Chess meets
this description, right?

152
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:09,630
Chest is a two player game.
Everybody knows all the moves before them.

153
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,570
It's sequential. All right?
It has finite number of moves.

154
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:16,270
It's a very large number,
but it is finite. All right,

155
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,590
and it has three possible
outcomes, a win, a loss or a tie.

156
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,760
That's been to be careful. The reason
it's finite is that if you cycle,

157
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:25,860
I forget what it is, three
times, then they get them.

158
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:29,490
The game is declared a drawer at a
time. All right, so what's this there?

159
00:09:29,491 --> 00:09:30,300
I'm telling us,

160
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,710
it's telling us that there
is a way to soul chess.

161
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,850
Tell just the is a way to solve
test chest has a solution, right?

162
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,780
We don't know what that solution is.

163
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,680
It could be that solution is that
player one. Who's the Pi with the white.

164
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,080
The white pieces can force awareness.

165
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:52,980
It could be that probably one can only
force a tie and it could even be that

166
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:55,350
player Tuk and forced to win. All
right? We don't know what it is,

167
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,550
but there is a solution. All
right? There's a catch to this.

168
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:04,410
There are much the catch.
The catch is it doesn't actually tell us.

169
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,110
This term is not going to
tell us what that solution is.

170
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,700
It doesn't tell us how to
play this through in it of
itself doesn't tell us how

171
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:14,670
to play chess.
It just says there is a way to play chess.

172
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,060
Alright.
Alright,

173
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,210
so we're going to try and prove this.
We don't often do proofs in class,

174
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,900
but the reason I would approve this
particular one is because the proof is

175
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:29,610
instructive as part of it,
of the Qr at Yale. All right?

176
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:34,310
So here's another example here and some
other examples you could think of chess

177
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,360
as being the most dramatic example.

178
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,580
All right?

179
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:48,901
All right.

180
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:52,020
So the reason I want to actually spend
some time proving this today is because

181
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:53,520
we're going to prove it by induction.

182
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,840
We're gonna prove it. My induction. All
right, I'm going to sketch the program,

183
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,470
not gonna go through every possible step,
but I want it.

184
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,310
I want to give people here a feeling for
what a proof by induction looks like.

185
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,380
And the reason for that is my guest is,

186
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,380
but it's find out how many of you
seen a proof by induction before?

187
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:21,270
How many have nots? Right?
So for those who haven't,

188
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,010
I think it's a good thing in life at
one point in your life to see a proof by

189
00:11:24,011 --> 00:11:25,900
induction.
And for those who have,

190
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,280
my guess is you source and I'm awful
math class in, uh, in high school.

191
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,100
And it gets when, you know, it didn't
take over your hay, but it kind of,

192
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,520
the excitement of it doesn't catch on.

193
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,250
I'm hoping to make this is a context
where it might appeal. All right,

194
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:44,350
so proof by induction,
we're going to prove this by induction on

195
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:49,870
the maximum
length

196
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,840
of the game. Well, cool.

197
00:11:55,841 --> 00:12:00,370
That n n the maximum. Next look,
it's what do we mean by this?

198
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,930
If I write down a tree,

199
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,220
I can always look at all the pause
from the beginning of the tree,

200
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,270
all the way through to the end of the
trash that your wife and beginning of the

201
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,430
tree all the way through
to the end of the tree.

202
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,020
And I'm gonna look at the path in that,

203
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,940
in that particular tree that has
the largest length. All right?

204
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,680
And I'll call that the length of the game,
the maximum length of the game.

205
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,880
All right? So we're gonna do induction
on the maximum length of the game.

206
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,320
All right? So how do we start a proof by
induction? It's just remind us to house.

207
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:30,700
There's people who've seen the before.

208
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,580
We're going to prove
that this therom is true.

209
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:38,581
The claim and the Theorem is true for
the easy case when the game is only one

210
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:41,030
move long.
All right?

211
00:12:41,031 --> 00:12:45,850
That's the first step and then we're going
to try and show that if it's true for

212
00:12:45,851 --> 00:12:50,530
all games of length,
less than or equal to n whatever n is,

213
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:54,910
then it must therefore be true
for games of length and plus one.

214
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,540
All right? That's the two. That's the way
you do a proof by induction. All right,

215
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,560
so let's just see how that works
in practice. All Ryan says,

216
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:05,200
start with the easy step and we'll do
it in some detail more detail than you

217
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:09,310
really need to in a math class.
So if any equals one,

218
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,370
what are these games look
like? Well, let's look at
some examples here. So here's,

219
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,580
I came, it's pretty triggered of KF and
is equal to one, but let's do it anyway.

220
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,480
All right,
so the game might look like this.

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,460
Play a one is going to move his player
one moving the games or your length

222
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:26,800
wanting to play. One is the only
player who ever gets to move.

223
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,040
So the game might look like,
like this,

224
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,980
I'm not put in a fifth branch
might look like this. All right?

225
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,320
And at the end of this game,
rather than putting payoffs,

226
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,620
let me just put the outcome.

227
00:13:36,621 --> 00:13:41,110
So the outcome must either
be a win or a tie or a loss.

228
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,460
So I suppose it looks like this.

229
00:13:42,461 --> 00:13:47,461
Suppose it's a win or here we could have
a tie or here we can have a win again

230
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,390
or here we can have a loss
and here we could have a tie.

231
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:00,700
All right, so in this particular gay
man, in this particular game, uh,

232
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,520
I claim it's pretty clear
this game has a solution.

233
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:07,720
It's pretty clear what one should
do. All right. What should one do?

234
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:12,520
One should pick one of her choices
that leads to a win to be careful.

235
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,430
I'll put one in here just
to distinguish who it is.

236
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:18,850
He's actually winning and losing.
All right, so in this, in this game,

237
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:22,600
I claiming that this game has a pretty
obvious solution. Either play a one,

238
00:14:22,601 --> 00:14:26,950
it's going to choose this brunch that
leads to a win or this Bronx that leads to

239
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:31,930
awareness. And either way play a one
is going to win, right? The obvious,

240
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,470
it's all this. It's kind of painful.
All right, so I claimed this game,

241
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:40,030
we can actually replace this first
node with what's going to happen,

242
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,920
which is probably the one one's going
to win. Is that right? That was easy.

243
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,330
That's a good enough to example.
We'll do three. All right,

244
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:51,260
so here's a another possible example,

245
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:54,020
and this is again play a one is
gonna move here at this time,

246
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:58,790
the possible outcomes or
a tie or a loss or a loss.

247
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,450
All right? Once again,
it's a one player game.

248
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,690
This time he has three choices and the
three choices need to a tie or he loses.

249
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,740
So I claim on together this system,
Paul,

250
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:12,990
what player one should do is what choose.
The tie isn't,

251
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:14,000
it says no way of winning,

252
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,570
but in that case you can actually force
it and you can actually choose the tie,

253
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:18,770
in which case he's going to die.

254
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,890
So this game has a solution
called choose the tie. And again,

255
00:15:21,891 --> 00:15:26,240
we could replace the first note of the
game with what's actually gonna Happen,

256
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:31,340
which is a tie. Everyone happy?
Alright, there's one other possibility.

257
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:36,341
I guess the other possibility is
that if I want has a lot of choices,

258
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,390
maybe, maybe four choices in
this case. Once again, play
a one, he's going to move.

259
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,610
But in each case, unfortunately
for player one, in each case

260
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,970
the outcome is the player one loses.
All right?

261
00:15:53,971 --> 00:15:57,300
So this is a game in which player one
is going to lose no matter what they do.

262
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,650
Once again,
it has a solution.

263
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,620
The solution is player one is
toast and he's going to lose.

264
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,170
All right,

265
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:11,040
so I claim this is where he captured
all the possibilities of games of length

266
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,350
one. All right. I mean you can bet,

267
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:15,240
you could imagine that they
could be more branches on them,

268
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,660
but basically they're doing these
three possibilities. Either.

269
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:20,370
It's the case that one of
those branches leads to a win,

270
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,010
in which case the solution
is player one wins.

271
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,880
Or it's the case that that none
of the branches have wind in them,

272
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:30,780
but one of them has a tie, in which case
probably one was going to time orange.

273
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,760
The case that all the
branches have lost in them,

274
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,130
in which case player one's going to lose.
All right,

275
00:16:35,131 --> 00:16:38,700
so I claim I'm done for games
of length one everyone. Okay,

276
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,070
does that SAP is deceptively easy,
but there it is.

277
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,090
All right. Now we do the inductive
step, the big step. All right.

278
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,540
We're going to do is we're going to
assume that the statement of the Theorem,

279
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:54,360
which I've now hidden, unfortunately
that, I mean that'd be on the height.

280
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,510
I can,
let me easy.

281
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,500
All right.
It's now visible.

282
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:06,990
Good.

283
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,990
So now let's assume that the statement
of this theorem is true for all games

284
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,990
length less than,
less than or equal to add.

285
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,890
All right.
I suppose that's the case.

286
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:25,340
Suppose
the claim is true

287
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:35,290
for all games of this type of length,

288
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,270
less than or equal to some end.
All right,

289
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:45,830
well we need to show is we're going to
try and show is therefore it will be true

290
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:50,040
for all games of length. N
Plus One. What we want to

291
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,310
show is
we claim

292
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,830
therefore therefore

293
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,340
it will be true

294
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,340
for games of length

295
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,333
n plus one.

296
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,400
Wow, that's a key step in
inductive proofs. All right,

297
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,290
so how are we going to do that? Well,
let's have a look at a game of length.

298
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:25,040
N Plus One. All right? Now obviously
I can't use thousands. He has, let me,

299
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,100
let me choose some relatively small
numbers, but the idea we'll go through.

300
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,520
So let's have a look at a game.
All right,

301
00:18:31,521 --> 00:18:33,500
so here's a game in which

302
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,020
play a one moose first
player to move second.

303
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,780
That's supposed if player too does this,

304
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,580
then one only has little
choice here, uh, up here.

305
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:50,210
Then one has a more complicated
choice perhaps to could move again.

306
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,450
One, two. Okay. All right,

307
00:18:53,451 --> 00:18:55,820
so this is quite a complicated
little game up here and down here.

308
00:18:55,821 --> 00:18:58,730
Just make a little bit
less complicated here.

309
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,410
The game looks like this, and then
comes to an end right to the tree.

310
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,440
Looks like this. I haven't put the
end, I haven't with the outcomes on it,

311
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:11,420
but the tree looks like this. All right,
so how long is this tree? First of all,

312
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,900
while I claim that the longest path in
this tree from the beginning to the end

313
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:23,150
has four steps. It's just
check. All right, so one,

314
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,170
two, three, fourth. I came as
the longest, the longest path,

315
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,770
and the path going down this way only
has three moves in it. All right,

316
00:19:30,771 --> 00:19:34,850
so this is a game of length
four. All right. All right.

317
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:38,720
This is the game of length for so,
so we can apply it to our claim.

318
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:43,840
Let's assume that the theorem holes
for all trees length three or fewer.

319
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:51,140
So that n plus one is four for the purpose
of our example. All right? All right,

320
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:55,070
so here's in this example,
in this example,

321
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,760
I don't know if it hit
after hit and this example

322
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:04,700
and equals three.
So the n plus one equals four.

323
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,030
All right, I'm going to have a happy
with this and this and the example.

324
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,860
All right,

325
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:15,280
now what I want to observe about this is
the following contained in this n plus

326
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:21,290
one or the game of length
four awesome smaller games.

327
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:26,000
You could think of them as sub games,
the games within the game. Is that right?

328
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,810
So let's have a look
I claim in particular,

329
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:34,340
let's draw around them in pink.
There's a game here

330
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,080
that follows player one choosing
up and there's a game here

331
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,400
that follows play one choosing down.
Is that right?

332
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,510
All right, and I guess, okay, so
these are both games. All right,

333
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:59,440
and what do we have here?
So this little game and here,

334
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:04,441
the game and the top circle the game
that follows player one moving up,

335
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,520
that's a game and it has a length. All
right, so this is the thing is a game.

336
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,280
Okay,

337
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,320
this is a game and I'm going to
call it a sub game. Some jargon we,

338
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,310
well we're getting used to,
they throw them this semester.

339
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:21,900
It's a game within the game. It's based
off. Again, this is a sub game and

340
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,250
okay,

341
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,170
this is a sub game following

342
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,250
one choosing

343
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,830
op pets put up in here.
Following up,

344
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,710
I claim that this game has a length.
This sub game has a link.

345
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,910
So we knew that we started from a game
of length four we've taken one of the

346
00:21:45,911 --> 00:21:47,210
moves and it's meant Mesh.

347
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,730
Make sure this is actually a
game of length three right?

348
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,400
It's the game started here.

349
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,940
It's a big game of length three
because you could go one, two,

350
00:21:54,941 --> 00:21:58,540
three moves that right? So this is
a game of length three. Alright,

351
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:02,200
so this is a sum game
following one choosing up and

352
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:06,970
it's the sub game has length

353
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:11,123
three.

354
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,700
All right and down here,
down here,

355
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,690
this is also a sub game.

356
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,320
It's a game that follows
play a wireman choosing down

357
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,740
following,
one choosing

358
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:38,990
down.
And this little sub game

359
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,413
has

360
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,910
Lincoln high.
We have to be a little bit careful.

361
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,940
You might think that since we started
from a game of length for after the first

362
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:49,640
move,

363
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,140
we must be in a move of games of length
three but actually that's not true.

364
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,020
And if we don't carefully,
we'll notice that this game down here,

365
00:22:57,021 --> 00:22:59,450
that game starting here, uh, actually, uh,

366
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,420
isn't a blank three it's
of length to that, right?

367
00:23:02,421 --> 00:23:05,810
So even though we started from a game
of length four by going this way,

368
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,370
we put ourselves into a game of length
two. Is that right? Right. So one,

369
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:13,490
two or one two. What up?
All right. But it has length

370
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:18,360
two.
Okay.

371
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,140
All right.

372
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,140
So in this example and his three
and n plus one is four and our,

373
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,400
our assumption, our induction
assumption is what we've assumed

374
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:38,050
that the claim of the theorem holes for
all games less than or equal to n which

375
00:23:39,921 --> 00:23:43,880
in this case means less than
or equal to three. All right.

376
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,530
So what does that tell? That tells
us, it tells us by our assumption,

377
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,470
by our assumption,
this game,

378
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,150
which I've put a pink circle around on
the top, this is the game of length three.

379
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,710
This game has a solution, right? It must
have a solution because it's the length,

380
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,050
it's a length three or less.
All right?

381
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,290
So by

382
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,540
the induction hypothesis as
it's called by the induction,

383
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,343
okay.

384
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,150
Hypothesis. This is a technical term,
but what's the induction hypothesis?

385
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,710
Niche thing?
Why?

386
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:26,240
The assumption that we made
this game has a solution.

387
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:35,530
This game has a solution,

388
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,330
right? It's a game of length. Three.
Three is less than or equal to.

389
00:24:38,331 --> 00:24:40,640
And in this case,
so this guy must have a solution.

390
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,280
Now I didn't immediately know
by starting at it what it is,

391
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,660
but let's suppose it was w

392
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,900
yeah, say it was probably all right.

393
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,770
And the game down below.

394
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:57,830
This is also a game and it's a game of
length two but two is less than three as

395
00:24:58,141 --> 00:25:01,980
well too. Is that something equal to
three? So this game also has a solution.

396
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,810
Okay.

397
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:09,800
This game also by the same assumption,

398
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,560
I had the same assumption has a solution.

399
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,470
So it's solution is say, I
don't know, maybe it's out.

400
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:29,390
All right, so what does that mean to
say that these games have solutions?

401
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:34,510
In this case we're going to assume
W is this one and is this word.

402
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,820
What does it mean? It means that we could
just, as we did with the games up there,

403
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,490
we could put the solution at
the beginning of the game.

404
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,430
We know that if we get into this game,

405
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:50,450
we're going to get the solution of this
game and we know if we get into this

406
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:53,750
game, we're going to get the
solution of this game. All right?

407
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:55,940
So we can replace this
one with its solution,

408
00:25:56,540 --> 00:26:00,680
which by assumption was w
and this one by it solution,

409
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,760
which by assumption was owl.
And here I want to be really careful.

410
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,710
I need to keep track
of which person it is.

411
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:11,600
It's a win or a loss for this was a win
for player one and it was a loss for

412
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:15,520
player too, and this was a loss for
player one and it was a win for biopsy.

413
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,800
All right? All right, so these games,

414
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,540
each of them have some
solution and this case,

415
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:28,190
I've written down the
solutions as w o l all right,

416
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,270
so now what can we do?
Let me just bring down this board again.

417
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,010
I can translate this game
into a very simple game.

418
00:26:37,011 --> 00:26:40,280
That's all I'm going to translate up here.
So this game can be translated,

419
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:43,770
just follows,
play a one moves.

420
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:47,430
If he goes up then he hits

421
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,943
a w

422
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,150
and if he goes down,
he hits a loss.

423
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:06,010
All right?

424
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,680
So in this particular example,

425
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:13,010
player one is effectively choosing
between going up and finding himself in a

426
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:15,810
game which has a solution
and the solution is he wins.

427
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:20,550
It's all going down and finding himself
in a game which has a solution and the

428
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:25,350
solution is he's toast.
All right? But that's what,

429
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:28,770
that's a one move game.
That's a one move game.

430
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,940
So we knew this is the
solution in particular. He's
going to choose up, right?

431
00:27:32,941 --> 00:27:37,470
This one has a solution. All right, this

432
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,120
hi.
Hey solution.

433
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:50,750
It is a game off the length one.

434
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,550
So what do we do?
All right.

435
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:02,200
It's almost schematically we took a game
of length n plus one in this case that

436
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:07,201
was four and we pointed out that once
play or one that has made her first move.

437
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:13,150
In this game we are in a game
or in a sub game if you like,

438
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:17,230
that has length less than four. It
could be three, it could be to whatever,

439
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,870
whatever,
whatever.

440
00:28:19,871 --> 00:28:24,280
Stop getting more in by assumption
that game has a solution.

441
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,340
So it's really effectively pay a one is
choosing between going into a game with

442
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,520
solution win or going into
a game with Ellucian loss.

443
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:35,980
And if there were 50
another sub games here,

444
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,560
each one would have a
solution in each one play.

445
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:41,080
One will able about associate that
solution with what he's going to get,

446
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,780
what she's going to get.
All right,

447
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:49,260
so I claim that if it in fact is true
that each of these sub games of a length,

448
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:54,670
three or less how to solution,

449
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:00,100
then the game of length four must
have a solution, which is what?

450
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:04,170
It's the solution which is play a
one should pick the best sub game.

451
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,770
Alright.
People convinced by that step.

452
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,380
People are looking slightly,
um, during the headlamps now.

453
00:29:14,381 --> 00:29:17,140
So I'm going to say it
again. All right. All right.

454
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:22,260
We started by assuming that all games
have length three or last one and or less

455
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,393
have a solution.

456
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:29,790
We pointed out that any game that has
length n plus one can we thought of as an

457
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:35,251
initial move by player one followed by
a game of length and or less and a few I

458
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,630
should say.
All right.

459
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:43,720
Each of those games of an or
fewer steps has the solution.

460
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,040
So player one is just going to choose
the game that has the best solution for

461
00:29:48,041 --> 00:29:51,670
her and we're done. All right.
In this particular example,

462
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,830
play I won is going to choose up

463
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:01,030
and therefore the solution to
this parent game, it's polite,

464
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,550
it's player one witness.

465
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,223
All right?

466
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,070
Now the hard step,

467
00:30:08,071 --> 00:30:11,730
I think it improves by induction
is realizing that you're dumb.

468
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:15,810
So I claim when now dumb.
Why are we done?

469
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,800
While we know that was pretty easy that
all games of length one have a solution

470
00:30:22,831 --> 00:30:27,831
that was pretty trivial and we've shown
that if any game of length n or fewer

471
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:32,880
has a solution, then games of
end pass one have a solution.

472
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,160
So now to see how we could proceed.

473
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,800
We know that games of length
one to have a solution.

474
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:39,900
So let's consider games of length to

475
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:45,240
write games of length to uh, two
games. The like to have a solution.

476
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:47,670
While that set any quarter one,

477
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:52,110
we know that we know that if games or
ninth one to have a solution that any game

478
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:55,590
of length two could be thought of as
an initial step followed by a game of

479
00:30:55,591 --> 00:30:57,330
length one but then as a solution.

480
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,160
So therefore games with
links to have a solution,

481
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,400
but I don't think of it that games
have length three. All right.

482
00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:04,970
We've shown the games with length one of
a solution and games were links to have

483
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,800
a solution, right? And he gave
him a blank. Three can be,

484
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:12,170
can be thought of as a game in which
there's an initial step followed by iser

485
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,240
game of length one or a game of links
to each of which have a solution.

486
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,690
So once again, play a game, a game of
length three has a solution and so on.

487
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,210
All right,
so games deduction,

488
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,930
they work by building up on the length
of the game and we'll run the APP knowing

489
00:31:24,931 --> 00:31:27,400
that we're done.
All right.

490
00:31:27,401 --> 00:31:29,770
For those people who've never seen
a proof by induction, don't worry,

491
00:31:29,771 --> 00:31:34,390
I'm not going to test you on a proven
induction on the, uh, on the, uh, uh,

492
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,670
um,
on the exam.

493
00:31:36,671 --> 00:31:41,170
I just wanted you to see one once and
it'll take a deep breath and try and

494
00:31:41,171 --> 00:31:45,400
digest this a little bit by
playing a game. All right,
so I'll leave it up there.

495
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,990
I'll leave it up there
as you can stare at it.

496
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,680
Yeah,
I want it down and get it later,

497
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,200
right.

498
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:57,300
I,

499
00:31:57,300 --> 00:32:02,300
let's try and actually play a game and
see if we can actually throw any light on

500
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:04,224
this.

501
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,523
Yeah.

502
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:09,040
All right. So when I'm going to pick
out volunteers like I did last time,

503
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:12,970
but first of all, let me tell you what
the game is. So once again, I'm going to,

504
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,040
I'm going to have rocks in
this game and once again,

505
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:18,880
I'm going to approximate this rocks
with marks on the blackboard. All right?

506
00:32:18,881 --> 00:32:19,960
So here's an example.

507
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:22,830
Okay.

508
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:27,390
And the example is this,
the game involves an array of rocks.

509
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,640
So here the array has one,
two, three, four, five rows,

510
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,700
and three columns.

511
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,550
So the rocks and all range
as they were before in piles,

512
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:44,330
but rather in a sort of pretty
array, right? She made it more even.

513
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:48,440
But this is one, two, three, four,
five rows and one, two, three columns.

514
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,400
That's in this example. All
right, but in general, in general,

515
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,230
there's an array of rocks

516
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,530
and times n

517
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,960
alright.
And

518
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,820
we're going to play sequentially with the
players. And the way that, the way they,

519
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,960
the game is gonna work is this
is meant to be in this row.

520
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:12,803
The way the world's going,

521
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,500
the way the game is going to work
is when it's your turn to move,

522
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,800
you have to point to one of these rocks
and whichever rock you points too,

523
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:23,880
I will remove.

524
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:28,881
I will delete that rock and all the rocks
that lie above or to the right of it

525
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,180
all rocks that to the northeast of it.
So for example,

526
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,380
if you pointed to this rock,
right,

527
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:41,010
then I will remove this rock.
And also this one, this one,

528
00:33:41,011 --> 00:33:43,430
and this one.
Right.

529
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,940
And if the next person comes
along and chooses this one,

530
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:52,190
then I will remove this one and also
that one. Okay. I'm gonna understand.

531
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:54,770
All right.
And the game

532
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,173
is,

533
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,330
the game is lost because we care.
This is important.

534
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:07,510
The game is lost by the person
who ends up taking the last rock.

535
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:13,150
The loser is the person who
ends up removing the last rock.

536
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:19,570
All right.
Perhaps some volunteers.

537
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,500
Can I volunteer people?
One.

538
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,330
How about the guy with the white tee
shirt with the yellow on there? All right.

539
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:33,280
Okay. Come on up front. All right. And uh,

540
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,220
who else can I volunteer?
Everyone's looking away from me. Uh,

541
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,680
desperate looking away from me. Uh, okay.

542
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,340
How about the guy with the Yale
sweatshirt on the Yale Law? Yeah,

543
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:46,540
the l football sweatshirt on.
Okay. All right, so come on up.

544
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:50,200
Your name is, I just get them. Let
me get a mic up here. Thank you.

545
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,550
Great.
Your name is Noah Noah,

546
00:34:56,551 --> 00:35:01,330
and your name is to the when
it Koran. Koran. Okay. So no,

547
00:35:01,331 --> 00:35:04,530
and Kronner our players. All right.
Everyone understand the rules.

548
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,690
You understand the rules.
Good? Yup. All right,

549
00:35:06,691 --> 00:35:08,850
so what do we make that
Noah go first and Noah,

550
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,430
which rock are you going to
removed from the last rock?

551
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:16,200
Loses that one. That one.
Okay, so no, it chose this one.

552
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,150
So I'm going to move this
one on the one above it.

553
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:24,500
All the rocks and and east or deleted all
the rocks to the north and east of it.

554
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,130
I believed it or wait, wait, that. That,

555
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:32,600
that means you lost rock losers.
Okay, last one. Ah, okay. Okay.

556
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:37,740
Okay. Okay, good. All right, so all right.

557
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,070
That one, that one. Okay,
so now we have an l shape.

558
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,413
Okay.

559
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,050
No, that one. All right.

560
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,820
That one. That one. Okay. Okay.
Okay. All right, so, so we're
done. All right. All right.

561
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:10,980
Okay. Everyone understand
how that works. All right.

562
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:12,270
Round of applause for our players,

563
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:15,190
please. All right, thank you.

564
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,360
Let me get to more volunteers
now. Everyone's seen it. These,

565
00:36:19,361 --> 00:36:23,890
these guys had the hard job that to
figure it out. Cold. Two more volunteers.

566
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:28,510
Oh, I'd have to volunteer. I mean, there's
somebody volunteering, volunteering.

567
00:36:28,511 --> 00:36:31,690
Great. I have one volunteer. You
can pick an opponent to do bike.

568
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,573
Okay,

569
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:40,320
there you go. Okay. Thank
you. Uh, your name, what is
this? Wait for the mixer here.

570
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,770
So your name is Peter. Peter, and
your name is Justin. All right.

571
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,690
All right. Let me put
some, a new array up here.

572
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:58,650
All right, so let's put a newer array
up here and it's telling us, make it,

573
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,840
it doesn't have to be all,

574
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,800
it doesn't make it this time it a
bit more complicated. So I'll have

575
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,273
five,

576
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:14,980
that's a four rows and five columns this
time. All right, so this time, okay,

577
00:37:14,981 --> 00:37:19,060
so last time I, last time I had five
rows and three columns, and this,

578
00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:23,140
I'm going to have four rows
and five columns, four rows,

579
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:27,790
and five columns. All
right? Uh, away you go.

580
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,170
Move out the way.
What did you stand a bit nearer the board?

581
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,610
Make it a little easier for people to
see what's going on. They go. All right.

582
00:37:33,611 --> 00:37:36,780
So Peter, you want to go first? Sure,

583
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,820
that one. Okay, so this one goes,
which means, which means, uh,

584
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:46,030
all of the ego as well.
All right.

585
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,880
Then we're going to advice from the
floor and we just shout things out.

586
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:54,120
Not too loud. I try. Go on here.

587
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,870
Okay.
Well we're back to our l shape again.

588
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:06,860
Yeah.
Ah,

589
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,850
all right. Now if you look can see what's
going on. All right. All right. Oh,

590
00:38:14,851 --> 00:38:18,120
go here and speed it. All right. All
right. All right. Thank you. All right,

591
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:19,800
so round of applause again.
All right.

592
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,213
Thank you guys.

593
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:29,080
So here's what I claim about this game
first. And this is the formal pain.

594
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,050
This is a lot harder than the
game we played last time, right?

595
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:36,790
Everyone convinced by that. All right,
so here's going to be a, an exercise. Uh,

596
00:38:36,791 --> 00:38:38,050
I'll sell it as a challenge.

597
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,290
I may even put it formally on the
problem set this week, but if, if,

598
00:38:41,291 --> 00:38:44,530
if that's what just say, if I do put
this on the problem set this week,

599
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:47,140
I don't expect you all to solve it.
All right?

600
00:38:47,141 --> 00:38:49,810
If I do put it on the promise that
it's an optional problem, right?

601
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:52,200
But here's the challenge.
The challenge is

602
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:59,340
I claim, Oh, I know from
Somalia who's Theorem that no,

603
00:38:59,341 --> 00:39:03,160
most of what an is and
no matter what em is,

604
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:06,940
this game has a solution,
right?

605
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,893
Yeah.

606
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,900
So there's a mother's theorem tells us

607
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:17,800
this game highs,

608
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,251
a solution.

609
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:25,420
I notice it could have a different
solution depending on the end and the amp

610
00:39:25,421 --> 00:39:27,520
depending on how many rows and
how many columns is that right?

611
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:32,110
So depending on an and a,
each [inaudible] has a solution,

612
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:35,500
is that right? Is that
right? Right, right.

613
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,680
So which could depend

614
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:47,140
good. Depends on the m and m on
the number of rows and columns.

615
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:51,680
Just as a Nim. It depended on how
there's piles started out. All right,

616
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:56,210
so what's going to be the homework
assignments? Find the solution,

617
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,100
find the solution.

618
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:06,770
Homework.
What is

619
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,053
this?

620
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,050
All right, so I claim,
let me give you a hint.

621
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:18,200
I claim it is useful to remember

622
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:22,640
that there is a solution.
All right.

623
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,950
It turns out to be useful to remember
that that wasn't much of a hint.

624
00:40:24,951 --> 00:40:28,520
You knew that already, but then
I just emphasize that. Okay.

625
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,540
Okay.
So I want to do a bit of a transition now.

626
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:37,400
Where are you from these games like chess
and checkers and like this game with

627
00:40:37,401 --> 00:40:41,690
the rocks or Nim and I want to be a
little bit formal for a while. All right,

628
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:43,040
so why don't we haven't done for a while.

629
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,640
Actually we listened to the midterm
is write down some formal definitions.

630
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,810
So I'm going to do that now.

631
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,273
Yeah.

632
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,080
Oh,
at least one of these boards back.

633
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,043
All

634
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:14,903
right.

635
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,350
So as I warned right,
very early on the class,

636
00:41:18,530 --> 00:41:23,090
there were some points of the day when
we have to stop and do some work and the

637
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:25,280
next 20 minutes or so is such a point.

638
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,000
All
right.

639
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,280
So, okay, what is this? This is formal

640
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,163
stuff

641
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,820
and the first thing I want to do is I
want to give you a formal definition of

642
00:41:51,821 --> 00:41:55,390
something I've already mentioned today
and that's the idea of perfect and for

643
00:41:55,391 --> 00:41:58,750
the inflammation. So what we've been
looking at, or listening to the mid term,

644
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:02,840
our games have perfect information.
So at gay men

645
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,100
all have perfect information.

646
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,090
Game of perfect information

647
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:18,640
is one
in which

648
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,920
at every node or each node,

649
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,120
each node in the game,

650
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:33,520
the player

651
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,750
who's turn

652
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,110
it is to move with that note.

653
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,680
All right, who's turn it is to move? No,

654
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:52,920
it was which node

655
00:42:58,140 --> 00:42:59,310
she is at.

656
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,270
Okay.

657
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:02,890
All right.
It's just a very simple idea.

658
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:05,320
Like every game we've seen since
the mid term, how's this property?

659
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:09,160
When you're playing this game, you knew
where you are. You know where you are,

660
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,450
so you know which node your
ass. You know what, what's uh,

661
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,790
you know what your choices are
and what that means implicitly is

662
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:19,910
she must know how she got there.

663
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:30,190
All right? So the whole history of the
game is observed by everybody. I'm, I'm,

664
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,710
when I get to move,
I know what you did yesterday.

665
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,060
I know what I did the day before yesterday
from playing with a third person that

666
00:43:36,061 --> 00:43:40,480
I know what they did the day before
that. All right? So very simple idea,

667
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:45,480
but it's turns out to be an idea that's
actually allows us to a very simple idea.

668
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:50,170
Did you use for things like backward
induction? Very simply. All right. Now,

669
00:43:50,171 --> 00:43:53,380
so far all we've been doing
is thinking about such games.

670
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,120
The games like perfect competition
kicks for games like a competition,

671
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,820
contrary competition between firms or
games like the games where we were setting

672
00:44:00,821 --> 00:44:04,480
up incentives or games like Nim and
we've have been solving these games by

673
00:44:04,481 --> 00:44:07,120
backward induction rather informally.
All right.

674
00:44:07,121 --> 00:44:11,230
What I want to add in now is the notion
of a strategy in these games, right?

675
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,930
When we had, when we had to
simultaneous move games strategies,

676
00:44:13,931 --> 00:44:18,820
we're really unproblematic obvious what
strategies were, but when we have games,

677
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:23,170
there's sequential that go on over over
a period of time and inflammation is

678
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,760
emerging over a period of time.

679
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:29,110
We need to be little careful what
we mean by a strategy. All right,

680
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:34,140
so what I wouldn't want to do is I want
to define a pure strategy at least as

681
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:36,240
follows,
so a pure strategy,

682
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:41,700
a pure strategy

683
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,450
that's apply.
Hi,

684
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:53,590
in a game of perfect information.

685
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:57,963
Okay.

686
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,400
Some of the Games we've
been talking about games,

687
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:04,840
if you can represent by trees is what?
It's a complete,

688
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,180
it's a complete,

689
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:14,180
it's a complete plan.
It's a complete plan

690
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,153
of action.

691
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:25,390
In other words,
what it does is it specifies

692
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,900
which action
I should take.

693
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:37,683
Okay.

694
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:41,470
Should take her, cause that's what make
it should say gonna say we'll sake.

695
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,500
We'll take at each

696
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:54,280
of eyes nodes each of i's decision nodes

697
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,560
21st read this definition.

698
00:45:59,561 --> 00:46:04,561
It seems completely uninteresting and
unproblematic a pure strategy for player.

699
00:46:04,631 --> 00:46:09,430
I just tells you in this game,
whenever you might be called upon to move,

700
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:12,360
it tells you how you're going to move,
right?

701
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,290
So you're going to move
three times in the game.

702
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:16,120
It tells you how you're
gonna move the first time.

703
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:18,670
It tells me how you're gonna move to the
second time and it tells you how you're

704
00:46:18,671 --> 00:46:19,570
going to move the third time.

705
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:21,650
All right?

706
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,460
All right, so so far, none
of this seems difficult,

707
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:29,630
but actually it's a bit more difficult
than it looks. So let's have a look.

708
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:37,383
Okay.

709
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,660
What I want to do is I will look at
an example, and this is all fine.

710
00:46:44,661 --> 00:46:49,400
I'm hoping it's going to illustrate
some subtleties about this definition.

711
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,080
So here's an example,

712
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:04,910
and this example,

713
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:09,530
polio one moves first and they can
choose in or out or if you're like,

714
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,810
that's quite an up or down to it.
That's the way you've drawn it.

715
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:18,500
So they can choose down or up.
And I'll use capital letters,U and d.

716
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:21,590
Then plant,
if shoes is APP,

717
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:25,100
then player two gets to move and play.

718
00:47:25,101 --> 00:47:29,500
A two can choose left or right.

719
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,900
And if player one moves up,
followed by a player to choosing left,

720
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:37,270
then play a one gets to move.

721
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,690
In which case player one
could move up or down.

722
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:43,570
I'll use little letters this time.
Little U and D.

723
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,030
Okay.

724
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,730
All right, let's, that's
some payoffs in this game.

725
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:52,520
So the payoffs are one zero here,
zero two here,

726
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:57,710
three one here, and two, four,

727
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:58,693
yeah.

728
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:04,240
All right, so on paper, on your, it's
on the board, you first look at it.

729
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:06,580
This is a perfectly simple game.

730
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:09,130
It's just like many of the Games we've
been looking at since the mid term.

731
00:48:09,131 --> 00:48:11,920
It has a tree, we could analyze
it. My back had an induction.

732
00:48:11,921 --> 00:48:15,250
In a moment we will analyze it
by backward induction. All right.

733
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,060
But what I want to do first is I want
to say what are the strategies in this

734
00:48:19,061 --> 00:48:23,170
game? All right? So let's
start with player too,

735
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:24,880
since it's easier.

736
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,980
Play a tos strategies.
Yeah.

737
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:35,830
Oh, wash. I'm pretty simple.
Play at two strategies.

738
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,750
Prior to only has one decision node,
here's player to his decision node,

739
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:41,801
right?

740
00:48:41,801 --> 00:48:45,880
And the strategy has to tell a player to
what he's going to do at that decision

741
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,820
node. So there's only two
choices left or rights.

742
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:54,120
So player a WHO's trenches
are either left or right.

743
00:48:56,110 --> 00:49:00,220
Okay. Newsies, however, already
won state subtlety here,

744
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:04,030
play a two may never
get to make this choice.

745
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,440
All right,
so play a two is choosing left or rights.

746
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:11,800
But player to me don't ever get to me
to make this choice. In particular,

747
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:13,270
if one shows down,

748
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:17,290
it's really irrelevant whether a player
too has chosen left or right, right?

749
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,350
Nevertheless,

750
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:22,870
that strategy has to specify
what play out to would do,

751
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:27,610
where he called upon to make that move.
All right,

752
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,740
now it's like a play on one strategies.

753
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:41,800
So what a player one strategies
in this game. What to play?

754
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,760
One strategist,
I didn't take hers.

755
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,233
Don't want to guess.

756
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,830
So I claim it's tempting,
it's tempting,

757
00:49:56,831 --> 00:50:01,831
but it turns out to be wrong to say that
player one has three strategies here.

758
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:07,810
It's tempting to say I
either player one moves down,

759
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,190
in which case we're done.

760
00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:13,820
Oh playing one moves up,

761
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:18,620
in which case at some later dates she may
be called upon to choose our pour down

762
00:50:18,621 --> 00:50:19,454
again.

763
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:21,043
Yeah,

764
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:26,270
it's very tempting to think the player
one has just three strategies here down,

765
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:30,500
in which case we're well up
followed by either up or down,

766
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:34,350
depending on what,
a little bit,

767
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:37,640
either up or down if she's
reached to that point, right?

768
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:40,520
But actually if we followed
this definition carefully,

769
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:45,770
we noticed that player one
actually has four strategies here.

770
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:48,830
Let me see what they are and
you'll see why it's a little odd.

771
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:53,540
So here's one of the strategies
we talked about up followed by up.

772
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,950
And here's another one we talked
about up followed by down,

773
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:03,080
but I claim there are two others down,

774
00:51:03,081 --> 00:51:06,470
followed by up and down,

775
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,270
followed by down,

776
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:11,590
right?

777
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,210
So what's a little weird about this?

778
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:18,360
What's weird is we know perfectly
well that is player one chooses down.

779
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,350
She's not going to get to me because the
choice, the second choice up or down.

780
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,570
But nevertheless,

781
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:30,690
the strategy has to tell us what she
would do at every node regardless of

782
00:51:32,951 --> 00:51:37,330
whether that note actually is reached
by that strategy. Let me start again.

783
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:42,540
The strategy has to tell you what payer
one would do at that node regardless of

784
00:51:44,411 --> 00:51:48,100
whether that node is actually
reached by playing that strategy.

785
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,410
All right. Just a little weird, right?
There's a bit of redundancy here.

786
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:55,710
It's a bit redundant.

787
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:03,570
All right, now why? Well,

788
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:07,890
we'll see why in a second. Let's
first of all, consider, uh, what,

789
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:12,360
how this game will be played according
to backward induction. All right,

790
00:52:12,361 --> 00:52:15,810
so how do we play this game according
to backward induction? What do we start?

791
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,380
Shouldn't be a trick question,
right?

792
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:24,620
Where do we start the game according
to backward induction at the end? Okay,

793
00:52:24,621 --> 00:52:29,621
so the end here is player one and
player one will choose here to go down.

794
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:35,180
It's not right because
three is bigger than two.

795
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,910
So if we roll back to play
a tos move play a two.

796
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:45,740
If she chooses left, she knows that she'll
be followed by playing one going down.

797
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:49,400
In which case she'll get one.
But if you choose is right,

798
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,930
she'll get to so play a
two we'll choose right.

799
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:59,450
All right, so play a
one. So play a one here.

800
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,850
If she chooses op then play a two.

801
00:53:02,851 --> 00:53:05,180
We'll choose rights and
pay a one will get zero.

802
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:07,760
And if you shoes his down she'll get one.

803
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:12,580
So play on one. We'll shoes down. Alright,

804
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:17,620
so backward induction suggests that player
one will choose down and followed by

805
00:53:19,371 --> 00:53:23,510
player too. If pair two didn't get to
move to choose rights for applied by one,

806
00:53:23,511 --> 00:53:26,010
if you do get to move again,
choosing down again.

807
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:27,973
All right.

808
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:33,390
GNOSIS that backward induction had to
tell us what player too would have done

809
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:36,670
had she got to move

810
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:43,760
and backward induction had to consider
what player too would think that player

811
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,550
one would have done.

812
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:50,590
We're play or one that to get to move
again to do backward induction play,

813
00:53:50,591 --> 00:53:55,591
a one has to ask herself what
player two is going to do and play.

814
00:53:56,201 --> 00:53:59,890
It too has to therefore ask herself
what player one would have done,

815
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:03,460
which means play a one has to also vote
player two things by a one would have

816
00:54:03,461 --> 00:54:07,990
done, which means we actually needed
to say what player one did over here.

817
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:09,490
Okay,

818
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:13,720
miss that again. So backward induction
here tells us that play one chooses down,

819
00:54:13,721 --> 00:54:16,990
in which case the game is over.
But to do backward induction,

820
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:18,970
to think through backward induction,

821
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:24,070
we really needed to consider not
just what player two is going to do.

822
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:25,810
We're here to get to move,

823
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,830
but also what player too would
think player one would do.

824
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:34,270
We're player to to get to move on
toward ordered shoes left. All right,

825
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:38,800
so all of these redundant moves or
actually part of our backward induction,

826
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:44,240
right? We need them there so we can
think about what people are thinking.

827
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:46,163
All right,

828
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:51,220
so backward induction tells us that
the outcome of the game is down.

829
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,580
All right? But it tells in
terms of strategies, play out,

830
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:59,180
one chooses down and worship.
You get to move again,

831
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:03,710
which shoes down again and
play a two chooses, right?

832
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,393
Right

833
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:12,140
now let's analyze this game
a totally different way.

834
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:13,820
Okay,

835
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:18,020
we now know what the strategies are on
the game play or two has two strategies

836
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,130
left and rights and sorry,

837
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,400
prior to I left and rights and play
a one has four strategies up, up, up,

838
00:55:25,401 --> 00:55:29,570
down, down, up and down, down. All right,

839
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:32,030
so let's write out the
Matrix for this game.

840
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,160
All right,
so here it is.

841
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:42,230
It must be a four by two matrix play a
two is choosing between left and rights

842
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,710
and play.
A one is choosing

843
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:52,740
between her four strategies up, up, up,

844
00:55:52,741 --> 00:55:57,510
down, down, up and down,

845
00:55:57,511 --> 00:56:00,810
down
and we can put all the payoffs in.

846
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:05,400
So up up left gets us to here,

847
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:10,320
which is too full up, up, up right,

848
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:12,840
gets us here,

849
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:16,090
which is zero to

850
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:21,190
up down left gets us here,

851
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:26,380
which is three Oh put down, right,

852
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:31,660
gets us here again,
which is zero two and down,

853
00:56:31,661 --> 00:56:35,620
up or down up or gets us going right
out of the game of Middle East.

854
00:56:35,621 --> 00:56:40,621
So we're going to go to one zero and in
fact that's also true for down up right.

855
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:48,610
And it's also true for down, down
left and it's also true for down down,

856
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:50,620
right.
All right,

857
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:54,520
so all of these four strategies at the
bottom started off by player one choosing

858
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:56,800
down,
in which case the game is over.

859
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,970
So once again in this matrix you can
kind of see the redundancy I was talking

860
00:57:00,971 --> 00:57:04,480
about. All right. And this
matrix, the third row,

861
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:09,550
the down up row looks the
same as the down down row.

862
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:14,260
Everyone's happy with that.
All right.

863
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,350
So when we've had major
season in the past,

864
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:22,240
how have we sold the game and we've been
doing this a backward induction stuff

865
00:57:22,241 --> 00:57:24,520
for a couple of weeks,
but prior to the midterm,

866
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,610
if effectively given you this on the
mid term, what would you have done?

867
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:33,240
You're just don't. You'd looked for Nash
Equilibrium, right? So how does this,

868
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:34,870
let's do that.
Let's look for Nash Equilibrium.

869
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:38,320
So if player two shoes is left,

870
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:43,750
then player one player, one's
best response is up, up,

871
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,380
and if player to chooses rice,

872
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:52,480
then play a one's best response is
either down or up or down. Down,

873
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,580
right?

874
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:59,840
Conversely, if player one
chooses up up, then play a tos,

875
00:57:59,841 --> 00:58:04,430
best response is left.
If player one chooses up down,

876
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,610
then play it as best response is rights.

877
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:12,650
If player one chooses down up,

878
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,560
then player two doesn't care
because they're getting zero anyway.

879
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,990
And if player one chooses down down,

880
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:22,430
then again play a two doesn't care
because they're getting a zero anyway.

881
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:24,753
All right,

882
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,640
so the Nash equilibrium in this game,

883
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:31,510
how was so one of them is here.

884
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,320
All right,
so that's one nash equilibrium.

885
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:43,910
One of them is down, down, followed by,

886
00:58:44,930 --> 00:58:45,763
right.

887
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:49,043
Okay.

888
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,870
[inaudible] Nash Equilibrium.
We actually found by backward induction,

889
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:56,130
right?
They,

890
00:58:56,130 --> 00:59:01,130
the Nash equilibrium down down rights
corresponds to the one we found by

891
00:59:02,061 --> 00:59:05,580
backward induction.
All right,

892
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,800
but there's another nash
equilibrium in this game.

893
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:11,610
The other now she could have
run this game. It is this one.

894
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:17,100
All right. That's also a nash
equilibrium. And what does it involve?

895
00:59:17,101 --> 00:59:21,950
It involves down,
up and writes down.

896
00:59:21,951 --> 00:59:25,690
Up and right. Sorry. Down, down,

897
00:59:25,691 --> 00:59:27,070
up and right

898
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,320
down. Up and right. All
right. It's what w what?

899
00:59:36,321 --> 00:59:38,260
What happened in that equilibrium player?

900
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:43,090
One went down which made everything else
kind of irrelevant player to play to

901
00:59:43,091 --> 00:59:46,090
write and play a one in this,

902
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:49,780
in that plan of action was
actually going to choose up

903
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:52,583
right to it again,

904
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:57,600
play a one in fact went down player to
had they got to move would have chosen,

905
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,750
right? Right. And playing one.

906
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:05,590
How'd they got to move at this
second time would have chosen up.

907
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,350
So how can that be a nash equilibrium?

908
01:00:08,351 --> 01:00:09,940
It doesn't correspond
to backward induction.

909
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,850
I in particular player one player,

910
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:18,160
one up here is choosing a
strategy that seems silly, right?

911
01:00:18,161 --> 01:00:20,380
That's choosing up rather than down,

912
01:00:20,381 --> 01:00:25,381
which gets them to rather than three
runs or how could it possibly be that

913
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:26,950
that's an equilibrium strategy.

914
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:32,050
The reason is the reason they can be
in equilibrium strategy is it doesn't

915
01:00:32,051 --> 01:00:36,340
really matter what player one chooses
up here from player one's point of view

916
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:38,410
because it's never going
to be reached anyway.

917
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,350
As long as player two is
going to choose little rights,

918
01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:46,470
one of the player two is choosing rights.
It really doesn't matter.

919
01:00:46,471 --> 01:00:50,140
Master what player one decides to do
up there from play one's point of view,

920
01:00:50,310 --> 01:00:53,980
it doesn't make a difference
isn't reached anyway. All right,

921
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:58,900
so we're highlighting here a
danger and the danger is this.

922
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:03,850
If you just mechanically find
the Nash Equilibria in a game,

923
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,960
you're going to find people choosing
actions that if they ever were called upon

924
01:01:10,601 --> 01:01:15,010
to make them are silly.
Is that again,

925
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:18,940
if you're just mechanically find the Nash
equilibrium in the game just as we did

926
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:19,774
here,

927
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:24,220
you're going to select some actions in
this case and action by player one that

928
01:01:24,221 --> 01:01:29,200
was she called upon and take that action
would be a silly action and the reason

929
01:01:29,201 --> 01:01:33,100
it's surviving our analysis is because
in fact she isn't called upon to make it

930
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:38,170
all right.
Now to make that more concrete,

931
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:42,070
let's take this to an economic example.
This same idea,

932
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:53,500
all
right?

933
01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:01,940
One or you want to imagine is a market
and in this market that is a monopolist

934
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:07,090
who controls the market
entrance?

935
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:11,230
Who is thinking of entering
into this market? All right,

936
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:14,700
so right now this market is
a monopoly in it. All right?

937
01:02:14,701 --> 01:02:18,960
So in in the monopolist isn't incumbent,
that's called them ink and an

938
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:25,790
who is trying to decide whether or not
to enter the market or whether just stay

939
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:30,150
hours.
If they stay out,

940
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:35,450
then the entrance gets nothing
and incumbent continues
to get monopoly profits.

941
01:02:36,781 --> 01:02:38,250
I think that this is 3 million a year,

942
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:40,913
right?

943
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:45,200
If the entrant enters their name,
common can do one of two things.

944
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:49,400
The incumbent could choose
to fight the entrance.

945
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:53,180
By which I mean charge low prices,
advertise a lot,

946
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,330
try and drive them out of the market.
You can pay very competitively,

947
01:02:56,630 --> 01:03:01,630
in which case the entrance will actually
make losses from incumbents will drive

948
01:03:02,751 --> 01:03:03,860
higher profits down to zero.

949
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,720
All right.
Conversely,

950
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:13,880
the incumbent could choose not to fight.
If they don't fight,

951
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:17,750
then they'll certainly share the markets
and they'll move. They'll both make,

952
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:21,080
let's say Cornell profits or
duopoly profits of a million each.

953
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:26,310
All right? So in this game, as I
say again, there's a market there.

954
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:30,150
The monopolist is in the market and the
monopolist is making 3 million a year,

955
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:33,870
which seems pretty nice for
the monopolist. Alright?

956
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:37,710
The entrance is trying to decide
whether to invade this market.

957
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:42,300
If she invented this market, if
she's fought, she's in trouble.

958
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,150
But if the,
if the monopolous accommodate sir,

959
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,930
then they just go to [inaudible] profits
and then in front does very well.

960
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:52,290
It gets $1 million in profit.
All right,

961
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:56,880
let's have a look at this game
analyzed at first of all this time.

962
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:59,610
Let's analyze it by nash equilibrium.
All right,

963
01:03:59,611 --> 01:04:02,520
so I claim in this game
just pretty simple.

964
01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:05,430
The entrance has two strategies.

965
01:04:06,270 --> 01:04:08,100
You put it straight into the matrix.

966
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:13,490
The entrance has two strategies there
either to go in order to stay out,

967
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:24,020
and the incumbent has two strategies.

968
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,970
They are either to fight the
entrance or not to fight.

969
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:34,710
All right? And the payoffs
of this game are as follows.

970
01:04:34,711 --> 01:04:36,300
It's been a minute in fights,

971
01:04:36,301 --> 01:04:41,301
was minus one zero in a not
fights was one one and out

972
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:46,260
led to the incumbents
maintaining a monopoly profits.

973
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:52,210
Let's have a look at the Nash
equilibrium of this game. All right,

974
01:04:52,211 --> 01:04:56,470
so the first thing to do is to look at
the best responses for the entrance.

975
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:59,110
So if the incumbent chooses fights,

976
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:03,130
then the entrance best
response is to stay out.

977
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:06,820
If the incumbent chooses not fights,

978
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:10,030
then the entrance best
response is to answer.

979
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:17,530
Alright, how about for the incumbent?
If the entrance chooses to come in,

980
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,450
then the incumbent's best response is
not to fight because one is bigger than

981
01:05:22,451 --> 01:05:25,270
zero.
But if the entrance space,

982
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:30,190
it really doesn't matter what the income
does, they'll get three either way.

983
01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:33,010
All right,

984
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,350
so the Nash Equilibria here,

985
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:41,500
I either in followed by not fighting.

986
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:45,860
You end up with a duopoly
or

987
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,910
I out followed by fighting.
Of course,

988
01:05:51,911 --> 01:05:56,911
the fight doesn't take place out followed
by we would afford had you entered.

989
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:00,053
All right,

990
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:04,470
so these are the Nash Equilibria. Let's
analyze this game. My backward induction,

991
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,920
right from the incumbents point of view.

992
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:13,980
If the incumbent gets to move, then as
you're going to choose fight or not fight,

993
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:17,400
she's going to choose not fight.

994
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:20,670
So the entrance should do what,

995
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:23,350
okay,

996
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:26,480
somebody, they understood her
cause if she ends up, she gets one.

997
01:06:26,481 --> 01:06:29,840
If she stays out to get zero.
So backward induction,

998
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:31,610
backward induction

999
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:35,840
just gives us this equilibrium.

1000
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:39,410
All right?

1001
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:44,810
Now the question is what do we think's
going on with this other equilibrium?

1002
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:48,830
Let's talk it through. All
right? So here you are.

1003
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:50,990
You're about to enter the market.
You leave Yale,

1004
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,950
you set up your business and your
business is challenging some monopolist or

1005
01:06:54,951 --> 01:06:59,780
cause a monopolist like um, Microsoft
say, and you go out there and you put it,

1006
01:06:59,781 --> 01:07:01,850
you, you're, you're about to put
out your new operating system.

1007
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,600
And you knew that your offer,

1008
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:07,580
your new operating system will make
plenty of money provided Microsoft doesn't

1009
01:07:07,581 --> 01:07:11,900
retaliate and charged a drop its prices
by half and advertise you out of the

1010
01:07:11,901 --> 01:07:16,210
market. All right, so what
does Bill Gates do? Bill Gates,

1011
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:20,420
the head of Microsoft, he says, wait a
second, before you graduate from Yale,

1012
01:07:20,421 --> 01:07:24,890
it goes up this company. Ah, let me
just tell you, I'm going to fight.

1013
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:29,310
If you answer, I'm going to fight right?

1014
01:07:29,870 --> 01:07:33,140
And if you believe him,
if you believe that he's going to fights,

1015
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:34,370
what should you do?

1016
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:38,480
You're not going to bother to enter his
market or you believe that you're gonna

1017
01:07:38,481 --> 01:07:42,290
get fought by Bill Gates, then you,
then you believe that if you enter,

1018
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:45,170
you're going to make losses.
So you choose to stay hours.

1019
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:47,720
And this threat,

1020
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:51,890
this threat that that Bill Gates makes
here is that it doesn't cost them

1021
01:07:51,891 --> 01:07:55,700
anything. Provided you go out, he
doesn't actually have to fight at all,

1022
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:58,510
right?

1023
01:07:58,510 --> 01:08:02,950
That's why it is in fact an
equilibrium to imagine you staying out,

1024
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:07,300
believing that you're going to get
fought if you enter and it is the best

1025
01:08:07,301 --> 01:08:10,510
response for the guy to fight,
knowing that you're going to stay out,

1026
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:16,100
but this doesn't sound right.
Why this sound right?

1027
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:21,110
It doesn't sound right because you
really shouldn't believe the guy who says

1028
01:08:21,111 --> 01:08:26,111
he's going to fight you when you know
that if you did answer facing would cost

1029
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:32,120
the incumbent money. If you did
answer, if he fights you get zero.

1030
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:36,320
If he doesn't fight, he
gets $1 million. All right,

1031
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:39,230
so this threat that the
guy is going to fight you,

1032
01:08:39,470 --> 01:08:41,720
this threat is not credible,

1033
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:44,380
okay?

1034
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:45,730
Right?
This isn't equilibrium,

1035
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:53,950
but it realize it relies on believing.

1036
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:58,040
I'm believing

1037
01:08:58,900 --> 01:09:00,460
an incredible threat.

1038
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:11,810
It's true that if you're,

1039
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:14,900
if you think about entering the
markets that Microsoft is in,

1040
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,250
you're very likely to get a
little email from bill gates.

1041
01:09:17,251 --> 01:09:18,900
So it won't be an email cause
that can be taken to court,

1042
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:21,930
but some of the freshman and remark
and your air from Bill Gates,

1043
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:26,490
it's true if you entered into the
market that the people who build airline

1044
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:31,380
aircraft to in the head of Boeing might
pay you a call one day or send someone

1045
01:09:31,381 --> 01:09:36,180
round, right? But these threats are
not credible. France, is that right?

1046
01:09:36,181 --> 01:09:41,040
Then not credible threats because we know
that if you did into it isn't in their

1047
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:45,030
interest to fight that making
a little noise about it,

1048
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:49,260
but you notice you did into backward
induction tells us they're not going to

1049
01:09:49,261 --> 01:09:50,094
fight.

1050
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,700
All right.
All right,

1051
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:56,590
but now we're in slightly
in obs situation. All right.

1052
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:01,270
Why are we in an odd
situation? Two things. One,

1053
01:10:01,810 --> 01:10:05,350
we seem to be finding that there
are Nash Equilibria in Games.

1054
01:10:05,351 --> 01:10:08,500
We found one here and one up here.

1055
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:17,060
There are Nash Equilibria that are
not supported by backward induction.

1056
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,380
That's the first.
That's the first reason we're,

1057
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:23,900
we're a little worried here and the
second reasonable worried it's even the

1058
01:10:23,901 --> 01:10:28,520
economics of this doesn't
quite smell right. Right.

1059
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:32,960
For example, if you in
fact did inter, sorry,

1060
01:10:32,961 --> 01:10:35,530
if you did in fact announce
you're going to operate a,

1061
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:38,870
you're going to build a new operating
system and got a threatening phone call

1062
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:43,730
from Bill Gates. The might be a reason
why you might actually believe that call.

1063
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:45,950
Why might you believe that call?

1064
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,650
Why might you believe that? Cool. Can
we get it? Can we get a mic out? Let me,

1065
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,970
let me try it. I'll do it. I'll do it.

1066
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:57,200
So why might you believe a call from Bill
Gates saying he's going to beat you up

1067
01:10:57,230 --> 01:10:59,150
and not be, you are, but he's
going to charge low prices.

1068
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:00,560
If you produced an operating system,

1069
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,900
he looks at the,
if you look at the future revenue streams,

1070
01:11:05,901 --> 01:11:10,040
like for the next 10 years
and he consistently gets
$1 million for the next 10

1071
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:10,460
years,

1072
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:13,530
you'll be better off if he just drove
you out of the market for the first year

1073
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:13,980
and then get

1074
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,980
$3 million for the next nine
years. How that one? Yeah. Okay.

1075
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:19,830
That wasn't quite what I'm thinking.
I'll be like, okay, it's true if we,

1076
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:23,970
if we cheats of base and make one of
the, okay. So what you're saying is, uh,

1077
01:11:23,971 --> 01:11:26,110
I could get three forever unless
there's one from it. As soon.

1078
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:29,270
These are both present. This
kind of devalues a future
future cash Eddings right.

1079
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,970
So we've done, we've done the, we've done
the future cash flow analysis of this,

1080
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:37,590
right? So this isn't an
accounting mistake. All right?
Not for accounting reasons.

1081
01:11:37,591 --> 01:11:40,920
There's some other reason why gates,
when gates threatens you,

1082
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,560
you might want to believe it.
I'm gonna try up here first.

1083
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:48,510
You can afford to make an example of
you so know other people in vain, right?

1084
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:52,950
Right. So one of the thing that's in
Bill Gates mind is he's right now,

1085
01:11:52,951 --> 01:11:55,620
he's thinking about competing with you,
right?

1086
01:11:55,620 --> 01:12:00,180
But down the road there's a lot more
of you guys coming, right? This,

1087
01:12:00,181 --> 01:12:00,661
whatever it is,

1088
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:04,860
280 view in this room and there's another
280 and next years passed and so on.

1089
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:08,490
And Bill Gates knows that each of you
might come out and threatened his monopoly

1090
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:11,590
in his Microsoft monopoly and he wanted,

1091
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:15,060
he might think that by setting
an example to one of you,

1092
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:20,330
he might be able to keep the others out
and somewhere that kind of arguments,

1093
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,920
the argument of making an example
of somebody is missing here missing

1094
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:28,440
completely, but it's going
to be important, right?

1095
01:12:28,441 --> 01:12:31,110
It's got to be an important idea.
Alright,

1096
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:35,040
so we're going to come back and spend
the first half of Wednesday's class

1097
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:37,620
picking up that just precisely that idea.
