1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:06,650
Last time we looked at how
to apply our new ideas.

2
00:00:06,651 --> 00:00:09,510
I've perfect equilibrium
to a whole bunch of games.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,590
And our general idea for how to solve
for subgame perfect equilibrium was as

4
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:14,424
follows.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,490
We looked at each sub game we solve for
the Nash Equilibrium in the sub game.

6
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:24,510
That's something we learned to do long
ago. And then we rolled back the payoffs,

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,470
we rolled them back up the tree and
towards the end we learned something

8
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:30,830
interesting. I don't know, I'm not
going to go back to [inaudible].

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,700
That's one to emphasize it.
We learned that strategic effects matter.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:39,330
So in that investment game we looked
at last time when you were considering

11
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:41,820
whether to rent a new piece of machinery,

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,270
it made a very big difference
whether you considered how, uh,

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,430
how this action would affect the
actions of the other side. In this case,

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,500
how it affects your competition.
And this is a very general idea.

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,840
Very general point. So just, just to
give you a couple of more examples.

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,050
When you're designing tax systems,
I mentioned this last time,

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,160
when you're designing a tech system,
make some changes in the U s tax system.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,660
It's not good enough to look at how
people are behaving and the old tax system

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,150
and just calculating
and accounting manner,

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:13,980
how much more money you're going to raise.
Well,

21
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:15,270
how much money it's going to cost you.

22
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,320
You have to take into account how that's
going to lead to changes in behavior.

23
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,810
And once again,
that's a strategic effects.

24
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:25,810
And in the homework that
you're handing in today, uh,

25
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,370
all of you would have had it nice example
of that in the toll booth problem.

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,080
So in the toll booth problem,

27
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,800
when you're putting tolls on roads or
more generally when you're building new

28
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:36,690
roads, new bridges, new flyovers,

29
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:40,770
new bypassed is you need to take
into account how those new tolls,

30
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:44,070
how there's new roads will
affect all of traffic flow,

31
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,560
traffic flow down the tree. We'll, we'll,

32
00:01:46,561 --> 00:01:50,930
we'll form a new equilibrium and you need
to, you need to consider that in, in, uh,

33
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,330
in designing your told in designing
your road system. All right?

34
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:56,280
So that's another example of sp.

35
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,730
So today I want to do thing
quite different a little
bit like what we did with

36
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:00,330
dual.

37
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,330
I want to play a game today and probably
spend the whole of today analyzing this

38
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:10,470
one game. So it's quite a complicated
game, but it's been a fun game. All right,

39
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:12,260
so what's the game we're going to look at?

40
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,230
The game is going to involve two players,

41
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:20,940
okay?

42
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,730
Right in each,
each play out in each period,

43
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,510
each period

44
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,570
they shoes each chooses,
I should say,

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,433
each chooses,

46
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,900
he chooses whether to fight or to quit.

47
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,190
All right? So ask me in his fights and
Q means quit and they make this choice

48
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,270
simultaneously. All right,
I'm the game and this,

49
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,540
the game ends as soon as someone quits,

50
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,050
as soon as someone quits all tell,
there's good news and bad news for this,

51
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:04,900
for this game.
Let's do the good news first.

52
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,870
The good news is

53
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,173
Vat.

54
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,300
If the other player quits first,

55
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,930
if the other player quit first,

56
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,450
you win a prize,
you win a prize.

57
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:31,270
And generally will call this Prize v
but we'll play for it for some cash in a

58
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,610
minute.
The bad news is,

59
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,633
okay,

60
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,600
the bad news is each period

61
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,240
in which

62
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,890
both fights,
sorry,

63
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,330
in which both players choose to fight

64
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,350
each player.
Hey,

65
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,070
he's a cost,
so they paid minus c.

66
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,890
All right,

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,510
and just to keep things interesting,

68
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,020
let's fill in the other thing here
would cheese if both credit ones.

69
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,470
So it's both quit at once,

70
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,050
then they get zero that period.

71
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,803
All right,

72
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,420
so this is a game we've
seen a little bit before.

73
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:29,020
We start a little bit under
the auspices of Hawk dove,

74
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,470
those people in the Mba class
sort of game a lot like this.

75
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,480
But we're going to analyze this in much
more detail than we did before as we can

76
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:40,120
from the whole of today talking about it.
So to start this out,

77
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,270
let's actually play this game. All right?
So I want to volunteers. Uh, let me just,

78
00:04:45,271 --> 00:04:48,220
uh, since this is a football,
see college football season,

79
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,920
let me see if I can
play off the rivalries.

80
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,560
So don't have anybody here
from the great state of Texas.

81
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,250
Whole Bunch of texts is all right. All
right. What does keep your hands are on a,

82
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,120
using a second and uh,
I guess the rivalry here is Oklahoma.

83
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:02,290
Anybody from Oklahoma?

84
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,340
Okay.

85
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,040
Mirror Oklahomans are,
what we'll do is we'll pull,

86
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,920
pick two texts and then we'll just
assume this is Texas and Texas a and m.

87
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,670
All right. So texted them, trace
their hands again. All right,

88
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:17,600
we're going to pick out to Texas.
All right.

89
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:22,880
And uh, I'm going to give you a
mic each. Uh, so your name is nick.

90
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,360
Nick,

91
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,640
why don't you keep hold of them or you
can just point it towards you when you

92
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:28,280
speak, but still shout because
we know the rest of the,

93
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,610
everyone here wants to hear
you. All right, so this is nick.

94
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,120
What was my other texts and back?
Yeah,

95
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:38,360
I just want to hear when they go for
the poster one. All right. That's okay.

96
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:42,800
We'll start here. And your name
is Alec. Alec. So started at Alec.

97
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,310
That's better. Okay. All right,
so the game is this. All right,

98
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:50,680
they're going to have to write down for
the first period whether they choose a

99
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,720
fight or quit.
Oh,

100
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,610
with each player will have a
referee for the person behind Alec,

101
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,380
it's going to be Alex referee
to make sure that, uh, the, uh,

102
00:05:58,381 --> 00:06:01,010
that Adec is actually saying
what he says he's going to do.

103
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,440
And what happened to my other texts,
him, I've lost my Alexa there is,

104
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,570
and your name again was nick and nick is
going to write down fight or all quit.

105
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,500
And uh, to make this real, let's play for
some real cash. So we'll make the prize.

106
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,100
Why don't we make the
prize equal to a dollar

107
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,020
and the costs equaled a 75 cents.

108
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,390
All right, so I've got some dollars
to, here we go. This is a, uh,

109
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,110
what did you call this in, in Texas?
We called this a fistful of dollars.

110
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:33,980
Is that right? Does that mean all
right? So, okay, so where am I playing?

111
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,840
Right when you stand out you guys
so everyone can see you.

112
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,740
All right. All right. Can I made this
difficult night? No, no, no, no, no.

113
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:45,410
You're going to write down your strategy.
So we'd have to go grab a pen.

114
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,940
And what I did,
I didn't make that easy for you.

115
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:51,260
Let me come down and make it easier for
the camera person. All right. All right,

116
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:52,760
so, so, uh, what did you, uh,

117
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,400
write down what your strategy is going
to be and tell your neighbor what it's

118
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:58,100
going to be?
I want to see what happened.

119
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:06,790
All right. Show you. Show you a referee.
Have you found your referee? All right.

120
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,290
And, uh, again, nick speaking into the
microphone, what did you do? A quit.

121
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:14,980
He quit. I quit as well. So
much for the [inaudible]. What?

122
00:07:14,981 --> 00:07:17,950
I'm going to remember the Alamo.
I mean this is all right.

123
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:20,830
So Texas didn't work very
well. Okay, fine. Let's try it.

124
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,960
Let's try a different state.
I have to say it. My, uh,

125
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,250
my wife's from Texas and my wife's
family is from Texas. And I had them had,

126
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,050
I thought they had more
fight in them than that.

127
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,720
Maybe that's why they're sliding in the
polls. Let's try somebody from Ohio.

128
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:38,560
Anyone from Ohio?
Nobody from Ohio and the whole class.

129
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,830
That's no good. That's
like, I'm going to pick,

130
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:44,140
I'm going to pick a higher against
Michigan. How about some people from some,

131
00:07:44,141 --> 00:07:45,490
from some of our own teams.

132
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,850
So are there any players on the football
team other than the other than the two

133
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:53,400
I picked on before? There we go now
and got something. Here we go. So, uh,

134
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,870
oh, I need a different team.
Anybody from the hockey team?

135
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,750
Anybody from the baseball team. Ah,
okay, good, good, good. All right. So,

136
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,490
uh, a friend from the baseball
team, I get, uh, your name
is Chris, Chris and our,

137
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,830
our new football team player
is Rollin Rollin Rollin.

138
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,910
Okay.
Okay.

139
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:16,770
So Ryan and Andy and Chris are going to
play this or seeing the need and easy

140
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,060
use nearly as from Texas.
I take it all right,

141
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:23,080
so we have some hope or something
happening here. All right. So, uh, uh,

142
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,570
write down what it, what it is you're
gonna do. You're gonna have to choose.

143
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,553
Yeah.

144
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,770
All right. Has both written something
down? Yeah. All right. And uh, Ryan,

145
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:38,580
what did you choose? Fight and Chris, I'm
going to quit. Oh, well that was easy too.

146
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:42,450
Okay. Okay. So the football team looking
pretty good here. All right. All right,

147
00:08:42,451 --> 00:08:46,020
so we're getting not getting much in
the way of, uh, of action going here.

148
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:52,230
Anyone else want to try here?
Another little state rivalry here?

149
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:54,840
I don't suppose I've got
anyone from Oregon that's
asking too much. I went from,

150
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,740
you guys must be from somewhere.
It's gotta be,

151
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,550
it's gotta be a state where at least one
of you is prom. All right. All right,

152
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:05,800
well let's try something like New
Jersey. How about that? Alright,

153
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,870
so it doesn't play as from New Jersey.
That's good. All right. All right.

154
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:13,140
There we go. So, all right. And we'll
try New Jersey in New York, that seems,

155
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:15,990
but that seems like there's a bit of
a rivalry that you're from New York.

156
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,120
Excellent. Here we go. Here we go. So,

157
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:22,950
and your name is Kiersten and your name
is Andy. Andy. Okay. So guessing and,

158
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:25,740
and these are show up. They'll send up.
Someone comes to you on it. Let's see if,

159
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:30,060
uh, if there's any fight in,
in New York and New Jersey.
All right. All right. Okay.

160
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:31,440
So write down your strategies.

161
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,210
All right, good. Now, so, all right. So,
uh, uh, Andy, the, what did you choose?

162
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:46,090
I'm going to fight. Fight. Ah, here
we go. This is better now. Hey,

163
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,510
worried there for a time. I know, I
know it's there. The thanksgiving,

164
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:52,140
what the has to be some sort of spark
left in the class. That's okay. All right,

165
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:54,030
so we have,
we have both people facing,

166
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,110
which means right now they're down 75
cents, but the prize is the dollar.

167
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,890
So the game goes on. So write down again
what you're going to do second period.

168
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:03,780
Okay.

169
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,730
All right. The 75 cents is gone. So now
we're just looking at the game for dollar.

170
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,690
All right. And let's, let's go to New
York. What does New York, I'm gonna fight.

171
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,280
Fight. Fight. Okay. So this is, you have
to stay on the east coast to get life.

172
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:18,410
There's no point of going away. It's just
that, that's not that. That makes sense.

173
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,750
All right, so, so write down
again what you're going to do.

174
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,973
Okay.

175
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:30,440
Okay. And let's go though
around a New Jersey fight.
Fight, fight again. All right,

176
00:10:30,441 --> 00:10:34,200
so right now we're down with three
75 cents, whatever that is. And uh,

177
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,940
it's a still this prize of a dollar out
that plus perhaps a bit of pride here.

178
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,590
All right,
so write down again.

179
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,620
All right, let's try again. Let's go with
the York. This time I'm going to fight,

180
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,270
fight, fight. Okay. I'm guessing,

181
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,820
I'm guessing we could keep this going
for quite a while. Is that right?

182
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm going to think he's a good
thing for quite a while now.

183
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:56,190
It might make a difference by the way,
if there are to talk to each other here.

184
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,020
So let's see if it does.
Okay,

185
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,350
so let's allow New Jersey and
New York to talk to each other.

186
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:04,610
You can't insult each other about
bridges and tunnels. Just regular Salk.

187
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,280
All right? So, uh, anything
you want to say to your friend
from New Jersey here? I,

188
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,270
I can't let New Jersey when
it's just the New York pride.

189
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,660
You guys are just every weekend,
every round. So I'm sorry. All right,

190
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,030
well I'm going to keep fighting your
best choices to give up. All right.

191
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:23,280
Let's see if that works.
I see that we're getting out of that.

192
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:25,140
So choose the strategies again.

193
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,160
Yeah.

194
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,020
York, I just can't let Jersey women fight.
Bring it on. Fight. All right. All right.

195
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,100
So it's clear that we kept this going
for awhile. It would pay for my lunch.

196
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,830
Is that right? Is that right? All
right, well we'll, we'll, we'll,

197
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:46,150
we'll hold it here a second. We'll
talk about it a bit, but thank you.

198
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,670
A round of applause for our team.

199
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,360
Feisty, feisty, Fyi.

200
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,003
All

201
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,610
right, so what's doing on
here? So clearly we can carry,

202
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,720
we can see what can happen in this game.
You can get people quitting early.

203
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,710
All right. And, uh, uh,

204
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,330
it could be that one side is quit and the
other side doesn't equate that towards

205
00:12:07,331 --> 00:12:08,890
something can happen that
can happen pretty quickly,

206
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,440
but it's possible and
we just saw it happen.

207
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:15,670
It's possible that a fight could
go on quite a while. All right?

208
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:18,760
A fight could go on quite a
while here. All right. Now why,

209
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:21,940
what's going on here is
this, I mean, the prize,

210
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
the prize here was what was a
dog and the cost was 75 cents.

211
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:27,971
All right?

212
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:30,790
I could have raised the stakes maybe on
these guys and says that that meant that

213
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,320
made a difference. But you know, I think,

214
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,660
I think a dollar and 79
something my hands we'll do.

215
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,660
And by the time they'd
fought the second time,

216
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:42,430
they exhausted the possible pry pries
of a dollar. Is that right? Right.

217
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:45,670
So it's true that if you won
this in the first period,

218
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,450
then that's fine because you
just got a dog and he wouldn't,

219
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,720
he wouldn't have cost you anything.
And even if you want in the second period,

220
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,411
you'd be okay.

221
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:56,470
You know he cost himself 75 cents
for fighting in the first period,

222
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,390
but you know you're getting a dollar.
So that's good,

223
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:01,150
but their arm and they're all
went on for plenty of time.

224
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:05,650
In this case they're on, you're just
accumulating losses. So what's going on?

225
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:07,780
So it, there are various
conclusions possible here.

226
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:12,910
One is that people from New York and
New Jersey are crazy, right? That's a,

227
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:14,590
that's a possible thing.
All right,

228
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,470
but what else could we w w why
do we get involved in this fight?

229
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:20,590
What happened here? Why do we tend
to see fights like this emerging?

230
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
I containing this isn't touch
an implausible situation.

231
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:25,780
Why don't we see the motor hits?
Let's talk to our friend from New York.

232
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,470
Shout out. By the time she fought
with me on the second round,

233
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,780
I knew I was going to be losing money
anyway. So why not just keep going?

234
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,870
All right. There was no reason
I wasn't going to win anyway.

235
00:13:38,871 --> 00:13:40,310
Somebody said just keep
fighting so she quit.

236
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,490
All right. All right, so there's,
I think there's two things.

237
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,010
There's two parts that answer.
All right.

238
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:48,600
Part of the answer is I'm going to be,

239
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,810
I'm sorry I have lost of money
anyway. Right? It's hold that piece,

240
00:13:52,811 --> 00:13:56,530
that piece of it, and the other part
of it is what the other part of it is,

241
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,100
I really determined to win this
thing. All right. All right,

242
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,990
so there's two things going on
there and they're quite different.

243
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,630
Let's take the second one first.

244
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,640
It's possible that the reason these
fights emerge and can go on for quite a

245
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:14,641
while is that even though the
prize is only a dollar in honey,

246
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,080
it could be that the actual thing
that the players care about is, well,

247
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,740
what are the players
actually care about here?

248
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,160
Somebody just raise your
hand or put you on the mic.

249
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:28,180
What do people tend to care about
in these situations? Winning.

250
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:31,250
They care about winning or they care
about pride. Is that right? It's not.

251
00:14:31,251 --> 00:14:32,830
Know that,
that's why I started with Texas,

252
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,920
but I couldn't find any pride in Texas,
so we had to go to New York. Right?

253
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,280
All right, so people care about,
people care about winning per se.

254
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:43,300
It's a pride thing. All right. So
it could be that a dollar simply,

255
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:46,180
isn't it a good description
of the true payoffs here?

256
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,620
It could be that the payoffs are
actually about winning. All right?

257
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,800
It also be that both of these guys know
that they're going to be interacting

258
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:59,600
with you at other times in the
class or other times at Yale,

259
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,180
and they want to establish a reputation,

260
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,560
both of them as being the kind of guys
who fight, right? In particular when they,

261
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,160
when they got to talk about it, right?
Both of them said, look, I'm a fight.

262
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,720
Since I was nothing we've seen before
with ally and his peace and his a pizza

263
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:19,100
shop, both of them said, I am a fighter.
You bet it back out. Is that right?

264
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,460
To both of them tried to signal the facts
that they were going to fight to try

265
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:25,520
and get the other side to quiz? All
right? So that's about reputation.

266
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,010
And that reputation could
extend beyond this game.

267
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,910
It could be that they're going to
be involved in this kind of, uh,

268
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,880
conflicts later on in life. All right?
So both of those things are around.

269
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,180
All right?
Uh,

270
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:38,930
there's another element to this and that's
the other part of what are our friend

271
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:41,450
from New York said,
which is about the costs.

272
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,630
What's true about the costs in this
game as we move from period to period?

273
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,490
What's true? If somebody said
it, say it again. Say it loudly.

274
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,060
It's a sunk cost.
All right?

275
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:00,130
So all of those costs that you
accumulate as the game goes on there.

276
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:03,920
Irrelevance.
Looking forward because they're sunk.

277
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:09,490
The fact I've played this game for 10
periods and hence lost 10 10 times 75

278
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,720
cents, which even I can
do that. Seven 50 right?

279
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,000
The height I've lost 750 is irrelevant
because I've lost it anyway.

280
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,370
I can't get that back.
That's a sunk cost.

281
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,440
So the game 10 periods through looks
exactly the same as the game did at the

282
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:28,290
beginning when fighting seemed
a good option. That right?

283
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,270
Alright,
he's a 10 periods through the game.

284
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,880
You have the same view about
facing as you did at the beginning.

285
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,720
Now that's not quite true because at some
point you're going to run out of money.

286
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,220
All right? But do we ignore that?
Basically those sunk costs are irrelevant.

287
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,630
All right,

288
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,820
so what we're seeing here is reasons why
people fights and some of these reasons

289
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:53,090
seem to be substandard economic
reasons like sunk costs,

290
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,520
and some of them seem to be about
things that are outside the game,

291
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,210
like pride or possibly reputation,
right?

292
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:05,090
And it's certainly the case that in the
real world we do see fights like this,

293
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:07,760
or is it, let's just spell out
what the key feature of this is.

294
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,680
The key feature of this is in
these fights over a period of time,

295
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,520
even though you may only be losing a
little piece in each period over a period

296
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:19,070
of time, you could lose a lot. In fact,

297
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:23,060
you could lose far more than the prize
that was originally at stake, right?

298
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,710
It's all right. So, so the, the, the,

299
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,790
the lowest is you could accumulate and
that our friend from New Jersey and New

300
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:28,820
York,

301
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,380
but Los isn't the accumulated vastly
outweighed the prayers that was at stake

302
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,390
after a while. All right. That's,
that's a worry. That's a worry. Right?

303
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:42,800
Okay. So this, this is gonna occur in
real life, not just in the classroom.

304
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:47,540
What do we call these kind of fight
these fights where that's that they're

305
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:52,410
holding out for this possibly small
prize and incurring, possibly small,

306
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:55,290
but they're humid into being
large costs each period.

307
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,030
What do we call those fights?

308
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,370
Okay?

309
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,060
Nobody,
well,

310
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,960
let's think about some examples if see
if they would come side of examples.

311
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:07,790
So one example, let's do
some examples. He yet,

312
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:16,230
one example is, uh, what
happened in World War One?

313
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,880
All right. Two in Walmart as a,
I'm assuming most of you know, uh,

314
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:30,160
the, uh, on the, uh, on the western
front at least the, uh, the, the,

315
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:30,670
uh,

316
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:34,570
German and allied and an to Germany armies
faced off with the British and French

317
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:39,400
and allied armies for an extraordinary
long time fighting over extraordinarily

318
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:44,020
small patches of land, little pieces
of northern France and Belgium.

319
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,010
All right? And you could argue that these
pieces of northern France and Belgium,

320
00:18:48,011 --> 00:18:49,810
I didn't wish to offend anyone
in French [inaudible] here,

321
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,320
but you could argue that those few
acres of northern France and Germany,

322
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:57,850
one worth a whole lot. Anyway.
All right? Nevertheless,

323
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,990
the troops are the two sides kept on
fighting for our firm from what 1914 to

324
00:19:03,281 --> 00:19:07,480
1918 and enormous losses of wife
were accumulated over that period.

325
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,950
All right? So that, that was a
really costly longterm battle.

326
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:15,670
Neither side would quotes each year,
huge numbers of lives were lost.

327
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,630
If you doubt that,

328
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:21,190
go and look at the memorial and Yale
that shows how many Yale American lives

329
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:25,090
were lost and America was only in
that war for about a year. All right?

330
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:30,700
Okay, so that's an example. Another
example, and more a business example.

331
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:35,170
An example we talked about in our MBA
class, but not in this class so far,

332
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,011
is uh,

333
00:19:36,011 --> 00:19:40,870
examples in business where
there's a market and that
market is really only going

334
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:45,550
to hold one from, all right? Well, that
markets are you going to hold one firm?

335
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,320
You can end up with an extremely long
fights about who's going to end up being

336
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,590
the one from in that market,
right? So a famous example,

337
00:19:53,591 --> 00:19:58,190
actually it's a famous business
school case, is the fight
that, uh, that incurred,

338
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,750
uh, to control satellite
broadcasting, uh, in Europe.

339
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:07,050
So there was a fight between Sky
television and the British Satellite

340
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,380
Broadcasting Company,
uh,

341
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,500
that went on for a number of years and
these companies were doing things like

342
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:15,310
charging zero prices and giving away
satellite dishes and this, that,

343
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:17,770
and the other.
And over the course of the fights,

344
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:21,700
they accumulated so many losses that
it would, if you did the accounting,

345
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:26,850
the entire future projected profit flow
of winning this fight vastly outweighed

346
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,760
the amount of money that they'd
lost during the fight. All right?

347
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,030
That was a fight that involve on one side,
Rupert Murdoch.

348
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,420
And you could argue maybe Rupert Murdoch
is a little crazy and had a reputation

349
00:20:37,421 --> 00:20:40,510
to keep up, but still it looks
like another example of this.

350
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,560
So that example was British
satellite broadcasting

351
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,320
versus sky.
So with those two examples there,

352
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,990
and they won't think of a general term,
we call these fights.

353
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,480
What do people refer to it?
How do people refer to the,

354
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,830
the method of fighting and well,

355
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:59,470
the one or for that matter during
the American civil war. Yeah.

356
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:02,920
Somebody in the back, shout it out.
It's a war of attrition. All right,

357
00:21:02,921 --> 00:21:04,300
so these are wars of attrition.

358
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,373
Yeah.

359
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:15,670
These are wars of attrition and what
we know about wars of attrition is that

360
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:19,870
they can go on a long time and a lot
can be lost. A lot of life can be lost.

361
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:20,920
In the case of real wars,

362
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,790
I don't know if money can be lost in
the case of business wars. All right.

363
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:28,510
And actually it turns out a lot of
games have this structure of a war of

364
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:30,520
attrition.
Let me give you one more example.

365
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,700
Suppose that two companies
are competing for a market,

366
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,880
not in the manner of BCI be a of BSB and
sky basically advertising or whatever,

367
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,320
but in the form of paying bribes. All
right, so I suppose there's a company,

368
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,200
let's say in France and a company,
let's say in Britain,

369
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:50,530
and these two companies are
trying to control a try.

370
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:55,270
I tried to win a contract in some
country where paying bribes is a,

371
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:56,680
is a successful strategy.

372
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,590
And here I'm going to be careful about
the film and not mentioning the real

373
00:21:59,591 --> 00:22:02,290
country. So let's call this
imaginary country free Donia,

374
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,320
which comes from a Marx brothers film.
All right? So here's this French company,

375
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,163
this British company,

376
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:10,450
and they both want this contract to
build a bridge in Fredonia and they start

377
00:22:10,451 --> 00:22:13,900
playing bribes to the general who
controls for Donia. All right?

378
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:18,190
And what happens when you're not going
to get the bride back? So both sides,

379
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,100
no pay a few thousand
dollars to this general.

380
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,330
And then the general comes back and say,

381
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:25,240
what are you both pay the thousand dollars
which of you wants to pay the bridge?

382
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,630
So they'd go on and they put more money
in and more money in. And you can see,

383
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:32,200
once again, this is a war of attrition.
There's Brian was that they've paid,

384
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,630
they're never getting back.
But once you've paid them,
there are some costs, right?

385
00:22:36,631 --> 00:22:40,210
Once you pay that bribe, good luck
saying, I paid you this bribe.

386
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,500
You didn't let me build the bridge.
Give me my money back right there.

387
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,750
It doesn't the caught in the world
that's going to enforce that. All right?

388
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,570
So these bribery contests
look a lot like this,

389
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,480
or there's a technical name for these
bright contests. They're sometimes called,

390
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:02,560
Ooh, pay auctions. All right, so

391
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,650
what do we want to establish today? We
want to establish, uh, what to talk about,

392
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:12,550
why you fighting occurs here.
And we wanted to do so in some details.

393
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:16,090
So there maybe in his formal reasons why
fighting a, and we've talked about that.

394
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,320
It could be that one side is crazy.
It could be the both sides are crazy.

395
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,770
It could be that national
or regional is at stake.

396
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,950
All of these things could
affect why we get fighting.

397
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:32,020
But what I want to try and establish
today is that you can get long fights

398
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,530
emerging in what?
Potential wars of attrition,

399
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,750
even if everybody is rational,
even if the payoff is just that $1.

400
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:44,470
All right? And even if there's
no reputation at stake. So again,

401
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:45,980
my goal today is to try and convince

402
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,120
you that you can get huge loss
of life and world war one,

403
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:54,530
a huge loss of money in these business
contexts without having to argue

404
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,430
something outside the model, like a
rationality or reputation. Alright?

405
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:04,160
Even rational players can get themselves
in trouble in wars of attrition,

406
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,230
right?
So that for the rest of the day,

407
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,910
I want to try and analyze this and
to get us started, I want to look,

408
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:16,380
I had a version of this game
at a simplified version,

409
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,930
which only lasts for two periods.
All right?

410
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:23,220
So we'll do a two period version
of the game we played just now

411
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,770
and eventually by the end of today, I want
to look at the infinite version. Okay?

412
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:31,540
So we'll start, we'll start
small. We'll start with a two

413
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,583
to pray,

414
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:38,770
right?

415
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,520
The trick and analyzing these things is
to be able to come up with a tree and

416
00:24:42,521 --> 00:24:47,521
the other come up with payoffs and apply
the analysis that we know about to get

417
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:50,920
us to where we want to
be. All right? So here's,

418
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:55,090
here's the game I claim I claim,
but it has the following tree.

419
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,460
So first of all,
player a chooses and play.

420
00:25:00,461 --> 00:25:05,080
An hey can either fight or quit.
And then we put a one in brackets,

421
00:25:05,081 --> 00:25:08,020
we'll see what the one is in a second,
then play it.

422
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,550
Then we got a mobile player too.

423
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,880
But of course this is a simultaneous move
game and he just hung on hangers move.

424
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:14,740
So this is an information set.

425
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,500
I'm not going to play a
tournament player B to play a.

426
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:22,300
B doesn't know what a has done that
first period when B is making her choice.

427
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:27,301
This is the simultaneous move
and B is choosing between,

428
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,410
between, uh, fighting or quitting.
And just to distinguish them,

429
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,910
let me use small letters for B for B.
So once again,

430
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,050
fight or quit

431
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,570
and fight or corns.

432
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,210
All right,

433
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,410
now if both sides fights,

434
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,040
then the game continues and everyone
knows that both sides of sport at that

435
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,800
stage.
So at this point on,

436
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:58,730
we're actually at a singleton information
node and it's player a turn. Again.

437
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,890
Thank you. Thank you.
Sorry. All right. Thank you.

438
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,770
All right. So here we go again. So
in the second period, once again,

439
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:14,820
we've got a choosing
whether to fight or critic.

440
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,710
And this time we'll put it to to indicate
where in the second period and after

441
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:24,660
player to his moves. Once again, uh,
well off to a has moved. Once again,

442
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:29,220
play a B is moving up to simultaneous
move. And once again that choosing

443
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,693
Fido question,

444
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,890
I'll put twos to indicate that
we're in the second stage.

445
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:44,760
All right? So that's the structure
of this two Ed gain. Okay.

446
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:48,330
And let's write down what the payoffs are.
Starting with the easy pay offs.

447
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,020
So if both people quit in the first stage,
they get nothing.

448
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:57,530
If a quits and be fights than a gets
nothing and be gets V if a fights and be

449
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:05,160
quits,
then a gets V and B gets nothing.

450
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,180
And if they both fight, we go
into, we go into the second stage.

451
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,840
So it's right down the payoffs and
the second stage. So the second stage,

452
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:14,850
if they both quit on the second stage,

453
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,940
then their payoffs are going to be for
any minus c the cost they accumulated in

454
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:25,641
the first stage plus zero and for
B and for B minus c plus Sarah,

455
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:29,641
if they,

456
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:34,641
if a quit and be fights in the second
stage than the payoffs are minus c plus

457
00:27:36,061 --> 00:27:39,570
zero and minus C plus B.

458
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,330
If a fights and be quits,

459
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,420
then the payoffs are minus
C plus B minus c plus zero.

460
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:52,470
And if they both fight for two periods,
we have a decision to make.

461
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,380
But how we're going to end the game
and this two periods in the super game.

462
00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:00,530
But let's just assume that what we'll
get here is minus c minus c minus C minus

463
00:28:03,991 --> 00:28:04,750
C.
Right?

464
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,090
What are some of they both fights the
game ends and no one gets the prize or

465
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,160
just to make it just to make life simple.
Alright,

466
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,280
so this is a to period to period version
of the game and the only change I've

467
00:28:14,281 --> 00:28:17,060
made other making it two periods
is I have to put on a pay off.

468
00:28:17,061 --> 00:28:21,000
That's what happens if the game didn't
resolve and I've assumed as the game

469
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:24,960
didn't resolve, no one wants,
no one got the price. All right.

470
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:29,190
Now there's another assumption I'm going
to have to make before we analyze this.

471
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,890
There are two possible
cases to consider here.

472
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:37,050
There's the case where the is
bigger than C, which is the case.

473
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:41,790
We just played it in the class and there's
also the converse case when the cost

474
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,680
is bigger than v.
All right,

475
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:48,710
so today we'll focus on
the case the bigger than C,

476
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,240
which is the case. We've
just, we just played in class.

477
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,970
I'm going to leave you to
analyze the other case,

478
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:57,390
the case when the cost is bigger than
the prize as a homework assignment.

479
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:02,610
All right? All right, so v bigger than
c is the, is uh, is our assumption.

480
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,110
All right? Is everyone okay
with the tree or this tree,

481
00:29:07,111 --> 00:29:11,490
I hope describes the game? Uh, at
least a two period version of the game.

482
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,331
Now,

483
00:29:12,331 --> 00:29:16,110
the first thing I want to point out here
is if we look at the payoffs that are

484
00:29:16,111 --> 00:29:20,040
incurred at the end of
the second period game,

485
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,450
we noticed that they
all contain a minus C.

486
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,030
All right? There's a minus c everywhere,
all right? What is that minus c?

487
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,650
It's the cost that you accumulated
from having fought in the first stage,

488
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,990
all right? But the observation I want
to make straight away is that this cost,

489
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,700
so here it is. Here it is.
Here it is. Here it is.

490
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:50,320
Here it is. Here it is, and
here it is. And here it is.

491
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,500
This cost is sunk.
Hi,

492
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:57,580
there's these objects here are sunk costs.

493
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:04,720
There's nothing you can do once you're
in the second period of the game to get

494
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:08,230
these sunk costs back. They've
just gone there, there,

495
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,650
but the fact that they enter everywhere
is going to make them strategically

496
00:30:11,651 --> 00:30:16,180
irrelevant. All right? Okay,

497
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,890
so what I want to do here is we want
to find all of the subgame perfect

498
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,280
equilibria of this level game.
All right?

499
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:27,130
So let me push this up quite high.

500
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:29,773
We'll see

501
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,590
and let me get rid of the rules.
We all know the rules by now.

502
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:52,280
So our goal here is to
use our solution concepts,

503
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:57,500
which is subgame perfect equilibrium
to try and analyze this gate.

504
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,203
So how are we going to,

505
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:02,780
how are we going to analyze this gay man
in terms of subgame perfect equilibria.

506
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,770
How are we going to start that discussion
when I got a lot of work to do here?

507
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,710
Where are we going to start and
finding so perfect equilibrium.

508
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,340
What's the first thing we should do?
When I came,

509
00:31:13,341 --> 00:31:16,160
the first thing we should do is just
figure out what the sub games are.

510
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,790
Let's start with that. All right,
so having just pushed it far away,

511
00:31:19,791 --> 00:31:24,010
I'm going to need to use the
pointer, but I claim that the, the,

512
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:27,580
the obvious sub game to it to
analyze first is this sub game.

513
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,030
It's the sub game.

514
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,190
If you should end up in period two,

515
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,120
I noticed that he's a sub game.
It starts from a singleton node.

516
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:43,180
It doesn't break up any information set
and it contains all of the descendants

517
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:48,300
of the mode from which it starts crying.
That is genuinely messed start again.

518
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:49,940
All right,

519
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,560
so we're going to start our analysis
by considering the second sub game.

520
00:31:59,030 --> 00:31:59,863
Okay,

521
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,680
the second slot game.
All right,

522
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:08,210
so let's write down the
matrix that corresponds to
that second sub game and I'm

523
00:32:08,491 --> 00:32:10,080
going to write it down
in the following way.

524
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,880
So I claim in this second sub game,

525
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:18,480
each plan has two choices.

526
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,870
They can fight well quits fights,

527
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:30,570
oh wait. And I'm going to write
the payoffs in a particular way.

528
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,840
I'm going to write the payoffs
as minus c plus this thing.

529
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,800
All right? So rather than keep that in
mind to see in all the which one to get,

530
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,570
it's going to get boring after awhile.

531
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:46,450
I'm going to pull that minus c out and
just put it in front. Is that okay? Right.

532
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:46,970
We had this,

533
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:51,800
we had this sunk cost box everywhere
and I'm going to pull out this sunk cost

534
00:32:51,801 --> 00:32:54,320
box and put it in front of here it is.

535
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:58,940
If you get into the second period
of the game, if you've incurred this

536
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:04,740
sunk cost, all right? And
your payoffs in this game,

537
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,270
if you both fight,

538
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,500
then you incur minus
c for the second time.

539
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,920
If a fights and be quits,

540
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,670
then a is going to win the prize.
So they'll get the,

541
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:22,710
and a player two will get nothing.
If I, if I be gets nothing,

542
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:23,910
if be fights and ache,

543
00:33:23,911 --> 00:33:28,911
which then conversely a gets nothing
and play a bee gets the prize.

544
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:33,850
And if they both quit, they
just get nothing, right?

545
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,340
She just knows what I did here.

546
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:40,370
I could've written out in the box with
minus c minus C here minus c minus c

547
00:33:41,041 --> 00:33:45,800
here, minus c Plus v here, minus C
plus zero here, minus c Pissarro here,

548
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,530
et cetera.

549
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:49,920
But I just pulled out that minus c
because it's just distracting everything.

550
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:55,030
All right? So I pull out that minor
seed and put it in the front. All right?

551
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:59,940
Okay. So now we can analyze this,
uh, this little, this little game.

552
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:04,140
And let's start off by talking about
pure strategy equilibrate in this game.

553
00:34:04,141 --> 00:34:07,530
So again, our goal is to find
subgame perfect equilibria.

554
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:12,180
So the way in which we find some gaming
equilibria is what we start at the last

555
00:34:12,181 --> 00:34:13,230
sub games.

556
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:18,830
We look for Nash Equilibria in those
last sub games and then eventually we're

557
00:34:18,901 --> 00:34:22,680
going to roll those back. All right,
so there's our lost I've gained,

558
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:26,160
there's the matrix for it lets us find
the, it's fine, the Nash equilibrium.

559
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,070
So if player B,

560
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,730
player B is fighting,

561
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,540
then pay it [inaudible]
best response is to quit.

562
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:42,840
And if Perrier is fighting, then play a
bes best responses to quit. Conversely,

563
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:47,841
if pay a be as quitting player A's best
responses to fight and if B is fighting,

564
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,250
play a [inaudible] a is quitting,

565
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,950
then play a bes best responses to
fight it didn't say that right?

566
00:34:55,951 --> 00:35:00,270
Let me try it again. So if a is fighting,
uh, if the other side is fighting,

567
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,220
you want to quit. If the other side
is quitting, you want to fight right?

568
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:08,060
That clip. All right. So
there are actually two,

569
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:14,270
there are two to be careful here.
Your strategy,

570
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,970
there are two pure strategy,
Nash Equilibria

571
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,870
in this odd game.
And what are they?

572
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,360
They are fight,

573
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,430
quit and quit

574
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:40,810
fight. So if we get into the second
some game and if we're gonna,

575
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,670
if we know we're going to play up your
strategy and the second sub game and this

576
00:35:43,671 --> 00:35:44,570
is what's going to happen,

577
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,793
that's our claim.

578
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:50,070
All right? All right. I
noticed that it didn't matter.

579
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,340
The Sun cost doesn't matter that I
could have included the sunk cost in the

580
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:56,550
payoffs, but I had to find exactly
the same thing with or without,

581
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,410
with or without the
sunk cost. So as, as we,

582
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,880
as we expect this one cost is irrelevant.
All right,

583
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,810
so we've gone, we've got both
the equilibrate and the son game.

584
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,670
Let's roll this back.

585
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:12,300
Let's roll these back into
the first stage of the game.

586
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:14,413
All right,

587
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,340
well I do that.

588
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,690
The payoffs associated with these,

589
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:27,970
the payoffs associated with this one
Oh v and zero and the payoff associated

590
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:32,540
with this one is zero and v one okay,
well that,

591
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,750
okay,
let's revisit the first stage of this game

592
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,050
and now things get a little
bit more complicated.

593
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,710
It's what I'm going gonna do is I'm going
to redraw the first stage of this game.

594
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,830
So Harrison,
there it is.

595
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:05,520
Hey Ken,
fight walkways,

596
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,630
justice before and following this

597
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,970
beacon.
Phyto just as before.

598
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,540
Well, this is a picture of
the first stage of the game,

599
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,190
but I'm going to chop off
the second stage. All right,
that's what the payoffs in.

600
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:33,520
All right. What? So the payoffs down here,
the same as they were before. Xero, Xero,

601
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:38,440
rocking up zero V if
a fights and be quick,

602
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:42,020
then it's v zero but what about
the payoff if they both fights?

603
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,910
So what I want to do now is I want to get
the pail for them when they both fight

604
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:51,010
by considering what they would get if
they both fight in the second period of

605
00:37:51,011 --> 00:37:54,970
the game. All right, Mariah
idea is our idea is fine.

606
00:37:54,971 --> 00:37:57,190
The Nash Equilibrium in the
second period of the game,

607
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,630
I'm rollback these possible payoffs.
All right,

608
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:06,631
so here the payoffs are
going to B minus C plus

609
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,130
stage two.

610
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,893
Yeah,

611
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,400
Nash Equilibrium.

612
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,893
Hey offs

613
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,540
the player one and minus
c plus the same thing.

614
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,430
Stage two

615
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,500
Nash equilibrium payoffs

616
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:40,270
for play B. All right, just
understand what I've written here.

617
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:45,271
Then I got the same pay office before
but I've replaced can reach it back.

618
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,820
I've replaced that enormous thing.
That was the second stage of the game.

619
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:53,080
Just with the payoffs that we know that
we're going to get in the second stage

620
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:57,520
of the game if we play Nash equilibrium
on the second stage. All right,

621
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,170
so these objects,

622
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,340
these objects have a name and the name is

623
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,800
continuation pals.

624
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,620
These objects are the continuation power
for the pals I'm going to get tomorrow

625
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:20,980
and possibly forward in a more complicated
case if in this case if I fight,

626
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,990
if we both fight in the first period.
All right?

627
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:30,060
Now what want to do is we want to draw
up the matrix that corresponds to this

628
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:33,420
first stage game and we're going to have
to do is to twice we're going to have

629
00:39:33,421 --> 00:39:38,421
to do so once for the case where the
continuation payoffs are v zero whether

630
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:45,030
equilibrium we're playing tomorrow is
fight grid and we're going to have to do

631
00:39:45,031 --> 00:39:50,031
so again for the case where
the continuation pay off
tomorrow are Zero v namely

632
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,920
the continuation payoff. The continuation
play is quit fight. All right,

633
00:39:55,921 --> 00:39:59,910
I'll do it twice. All right, so let me,

634
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,480
you've got this to do
Asian power ups downs.

635
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:04,370
I convinced them to give us a
little bit of rum. All right,

636
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,140
so the matrix is going to look as follows.

637
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,040
Nice big matrix.

638
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,080
Do you buy to play an a is
choosing fights or quit the play?

639
00:40:19,901 --> 00:40:24,901
A two is choosing phyto
quits and how much is easy?

640
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,850
It's what we put in here that matters.
So let's do all the easy cases first.

641
00:40:28,851 --> 00:40:29,301
So quit.

642
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:34,301
Quit is zero zero quit fights is zero.

643
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:39,140
V Fight.
Quit is v zero.

644
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:44,360
And in here it's going to
depend which of these two games,

645
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:47,210
which of these two equilibria
is being played tomorrow.

646
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,630
So that we're going to do
here is where they do the case

647
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,520
for the equilibrium
fight.

648
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:02,110
Quit
in Stage two.

649
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,430
All right. When we gonna write
it in the Matrix for the case,

650
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,580
we're going to pay fight quit tomorrow.
So if we play fight,

651
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:19,500
okay. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you. And try
and keep, it's a good idea.

652
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:22,560
Try and keep you consistent today cause
it's very easy to slip. So that's good.

653
00:41:22,561 --> 00:41:25,590
So once again,
I'm going to use capital letters for play.

654
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,150
A and small us will play a
beat. Thank you. All right,

655
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,560
so what happens if we both fight?

656
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:36,830
We both incur costs of c from fighting
and tomorrow we're going to get the pay

657
00:41:39,721 --> 00:41:42,440
offs from the equilibrium

658
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
fights equates that to
this equal equilibrium.

659
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,720
So we're going to get v zero tomorrow.
That's add those in.

660
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,820
So this will be plus V
and this'll be plus zero.

661
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,933
All right.

662
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:05,080
And this has put some short crown here
to indicate that these are going to be

663
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,150
continuation payoffs, right? So this
is what they get. This is what the are.

664
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,040
This is the matrix going to use to
analyze the first age of the game.

665
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:17,480
In the case where the equilibrium
we're playing tomorrow is fight quit.

666
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:20,030
And as they promised me,
if you do this twice.

667
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:23,900
So the other case of course is if
the only other equilibrium tomorrow,

668
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,770
so it's just do that.
So once again,

669
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:33,110
we have fight one quit one fight,

670
00:42:33,111 --> 00:42:38,111
one quit one and the payoffs are
same as we had zero zero's viz there.

671
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:46,990
And then here this time we're going to
have minus C plus zero and minus c plus

672
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:53,390
v. And the reason for the change is that
we're now looking at the continuation

673
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:56,930
game,
the continuation play

674
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:03,230
words player, what his player,
Hey, who quits in the second stage.

675
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,520
This is for the case,

676
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,530
quick to fight too

677
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:15,440
in period two.
All right,

678
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,070
so let's just pause, make sure
everyone's got that down one. Okay.

679
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:24,020
So what we've done here is we started off
by analyzing what's going to happen in

680
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:26,930
period two and that really
wasn't very hard. Is that right?

681
00:43:26,931 --> 00:43:30,050
That was a pretty simple game to analyze
it. Pretty easy to find the equilibrium.

682
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:35,740
Then what we did was we rolled back the
equilibrium payoffs from period two,

683
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:40,450
and we plunked them on
top of the relevant. Uh,

684
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,300
I taught on top of the relevant payoffs
in period one. So in particular,

685
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,410
if you both fight and you know
you're going to play the fight,

686
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,030
quit equilibrium tomorrow,
then you'll pay.

687
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,710
Payoffs will be minus C plus
V and minus C plus zero.

688
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:59,360
If you both fight and you know you're
going to play the quit fights equilibrium

689
00:43:59,361 --> 00:44:03,440
tomorrow, then you'll pay offs
will be c plus zero minus D,

690
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:08,210
Pissarro and minus c plus v.
And just to emphasize,

691
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:12,260
once again,
these four boxes we created,

692
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,030
these four boxes we created,

693
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:18,090
correspond to the stage
to Nash equilibrium pay.

694
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,850
So the continuation payoffs of the gate.
All right?

695
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:27,290
Okay, so now we're ready to analyze
each of these games. All right,

696
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:29,360
so this isn't going to be too hard.
All right,

697
00:44:29,361 --> 00:44:34,290
let's try and find out the Nash of this
game. So it's not with the left hand one.

698
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,730
This is the case where a player a is
going to fight and win in period two.

699
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,320
Alright, so if player, if player, uh, B,

700
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:48,420
if plan B is going to quit in
period one then if payer a fights,

701
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,860
she gets a v if she quits,
she gets zero.

702
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,510
So she's going to want to fight,

703
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,670
never.
Okay with that.

704
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,760
And if player B fights in period two,

705
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,220
then if pat [inaudible] fights,

706
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:09,340
she gets minus c Plus v and
if she quits he gets zero.

707
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,490
And here's where our assumptions going
to help us. We've assumed what, what are,

708
00:45:13,491 --> 00:45:16,280
we are still using V as bigger than C,
is that right?

709
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,280
Just like we played in class. So
because of the is bigger than, see

710
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:23,450
this is going to be the best response.
Again, fighting to of the best response.

711
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,411
All right,

712
00:45:24,411 --> 00:45:29,411
so we know that in fact player
a here has a dominant strategy.

713
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:33,260
The dominant strategy is
to fight in period one

714
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:38,600
and this little in this analysis
look, Amen. And Shinsei is fighting.

715
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,560
Not surprisingly, but we're going
to find that B is going to quit.

716
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,210
All right? So, so, uh, bes
best response is to quit.

717
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:53,420
All right, so here, here is our Nash
equilibrium in this. Okay. All right,

718
00:45:53,421 --> 00:45:54,560
so this,
this,

719
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:59,860
this game has a Nash equilibrium and he
has one and that equilibrium is fight

720
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,273
one

721
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:04,913
quick one

722
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:08,390
and let's just do what it intuitively
you for a second. Intuitively,

723
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:11,300
if I know I'm fine playing Jake,

724
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:16,570
and I know that Jake is going
to fight tomorrow and I know,

725
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:20,660
uh, sorry I'll be around. I know
that Jake's going to quit tomorrow.

726
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:23,810
I know Jack's going to quit tomorrow
and I'm going to fight tomorrow.

727
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:28,760
I know that tomorrow I'm going to win.
That prize is there for me tomorrow.

728
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:32,300
So why would I want to quit
today? Right? I don't, I'm,

729
00:46:32,301 --> 00:46:36,290
I'm going to get a dollar tomorrow,
right? I just fight in this period.

730
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,320
So why would they want to quit
today when it, worst case scenario,

731
00:46:39,410 --> 00:46:43,430
I'm only going to lose 75 cents today.
So I know Jake is quitting tomorrow.

732
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,760
I'm going to stay on and fight
and fight now. And conversely,

733
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:50,570
if Jake knows he's quitting tomorrow
and she knows I'm going to fight now,

734
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,560
he might as well just quit.

735
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:55,100
It's what we're learning here
is in this particular example,

736
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,600
in this particular example,
if we know that tomorrow I'm going to win,

737
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:03,710
I'm gonna win the war, I'm
going to actually going to
win it today. Is that again,

738
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,740
if we know that tomorrow
I'm going to win the war,

739
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,890
I'm actually going to win it today.
All right?

740
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:14,660
And the converse is true for the case
where I'm the quitter and Jake's the fight

741
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,910
tomorrow. So once again, it's pretty
quick to see that if I'm going to, uh,

742
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,040
uh, from [inaudible] point of
view, if I'm going to fight,

743
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:25,190
he's gonna want to fight. If I'm going
to quit, he's going to want to fight.

744
00:47:25,191 --> 00:47:28,070
So in either case, he's going to want
to fights. So I'm going to want to quit.

745
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,720
So the NASA could I run
this game is, uh, is quit.

746
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:40,810
It's quick. One fight to my show.

747
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:42,520
He can write that in a better
angle. That's probably, again,

748
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:52,320
quit one
fight too.

749
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:53,930
All right.

750
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:58,930
So at this stage we found all of the pure
strategy subgame perfect equilibria in

751
00:48:01,581 --> 00:48:05,270
the game. Let's describe them
before I write them up, right?

752
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:06,770
One pure strategy,

753
00:48:06,771 --> 00:48:11,771
Nash equilibrium has me fighting in
period one and Jake quitting in period one

754
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:16,190
and if we got to Paris
to which about we won't,

755
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,470
then I fight again and he quits again.

756
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,670
All right, so let's write that
equilibrium up and we'll do it here.

757
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,570
Uh,
we do it on the top board actually.

758
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,760
Thank you.
Thank you.

759
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,000
So let, let, let, let me get it
right when I write up as that.

760
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:41,290
There's a whole equilibrium.

761
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:47,440
So I claim I have now found
all of the pure strategy, yes.

762
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,800
Coffee in this game.

763
00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:01,260
One of them involves my facing in the
first period and facing in the second

764
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:03,424
period.

765
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:09,970
I'm Jake quitting in the first period
and quitting in the second period.

766
00:49:14,090 --> 00:49:16,190
And the other one just flips it around.

767
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:21,470
I quit in the first parade that I got
that I would quit on the second period

768
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,873
and Jake

769
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,280
fights in the first period.
And if he got there,

770
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,500
he would also fight in the second period.

771
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:34,700
All right?

772
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,850
So these are perfectly natural equilibrium
to think about if you're wanting to

773
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:41,670
get intuitively one of the,

774
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,180
each of these equilibria
involves a fighter and a quitter.

775
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:50,040
The Phytel always fights.
The quitter always quits.

776
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:54,330
If I know I'm playing a quitter,
I'm always going to fight.

777
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:58,650
So that's the best response.
If I know I'm facing a fighter,

778
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:01,290
I'm going to want to quit.
So that's the best response.

779
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:05,370
And those are two very simple
equilibrium, right? That's the good news.

780
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,410
What's the bad news here? The bad
news is we haven't achieved our goal.

781
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:15,560
Our goal was to argue that rational
players might get involved in a fight and

782
00:50:17,731 --> 00:50:21,960
notice that in each of
these to pure strategy,

783
00:50:21,961 --> 00:50:24,600
subgame perfect equilibria
in each of them,

784
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,190
no real fight occurs.
It's not right.

785
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:31,250
And each of them,
one person fights the first pro,

786
00:50:31,251 --> 00:50:36,170
but the other person just runs away.
That isn't much of a fight. All right?

787
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,560
Say it again. In each of these
equilibria, one side is willing to fight,

788
00:50:39,561 --> 00:50:42,800
but the other side isn't.
So no fight occurs in a particular,

789
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:46,500
no costs are incurred in
either of these equilibria,

790
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:53,540
but I claimed at the beginning I wanted
to explain how we can have costs occur

791
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:57,140
in equilibrium by Ryan.
Rational players are going to incur costs.

792
00:50:57,380 --> 00:50:58,370
So what are we missing here?

793
00:50:58,371 --> 00:51:01,190
What should I do to try and
find a more costly equilibrium?

794
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,280
I claim I'm still missing
some equilibria here.

795
00:51:04,281 --> 00:51:08,900
What kind of equilibrium I missing? I'm
missing the mixed strategy equilibrium.

796
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:14,260
So far all we've done is sold out
the pure strategy equilibrium,

797
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:20,720
but we need to go back and
reanalyze the whole game.

798
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:24,350
Looking now for mixed strategy,
whatever.

799
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:30,140
All right,

800
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:31,970
so we're going to do the entire,

801
00:51:31,971 --> 00:51:35,630
take a deep breath because we won't
take the whole analysis we just did.

802
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:39,020
We're going to repeat the
entire analysis we just did,

803
00:51:39,050 --> 00:51:43,640
but this time we're going to look at
mixed strategy whenever. All right,

804
00:51:43,641 --> 00:51:46,820
everyone happy what we're doing.
So first of all,

805
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:49,580
we're going to go back
to the second sub game.

806
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,100
Here's the second sub game and we
already found the pure strategy.

807
00:51:55,101 --> 00:51:56,360
You color breast.
Let me get rid of them

808
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:05,760
in your notes.
You probably want to rewrite this matrix,

809
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:08,400
but I'm not going to be ready to here
cause we were a bit short of time.

810
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,460
This is exactly the same
payoff matrix we saw before.

811
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:16,320
But now I want to look for a mixed
strategy equilibrium in this game.

812
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,740
How do I go about finding
as good review this,

813
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:24,780
how do I go about finding a mixed
strategy equilibrium in a game like this?

814
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:28,290
What's the trick for finding
mixed strategy equilibrium?

815
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:33,580
So we try our guys from New Jersey
and new in New York. My God,

816
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:37,940
let's try our guys from New Jersey,
New York. How do I, whereas I'm like,

817
00:52:37,941 --> 00:52:39,500
where's my, uh, New York, right?

818
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,750
We will have the true battle here
with him in New York and New Jersey.

819
00:52:41,990 --> 00:52:43,700
How do we find a mixed
strategy equilibrium?

820
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:46,960
Um, yeah, he's like, ah,

821
00:52:46,961 --> 00:52:49,800
the and q's and set them equal
to one another. That's okay.

822
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,230
Crude thing.
Okay.

823
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:56,280
So the answer was we find the p's
and q's and quotes sent to them.

824
00:52:56,281 --> 00:52:59,010
Are you called to one another? What is
it? We're actually still equal to what?

825
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:02,580
What are we saying equal to one?
Let's try and get some response on this.

826
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,440
What does that do it I knew Jersey pie
fleet, whereas I it as the question, yeah,

827
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:09,450
they fled. Uh, we could give our
texting's and challenge was our tech.

828
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,650
There was a text and down here somewhere.
What does it like I said,

829
00:53:11,651 --> 00:53:12,484
have you called a what?

830
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:16,810
I guess the chances that one,

831
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:21,150
that one would fail and yet or that d
one more the other way to fight. Mm,

832
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:26,100
not quite. Not quite that. The
remark about using and q's as

833
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:28,120
right, but what does that, this
is a good review for the final,

834
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,620
what is it I'm going to do with those
p's and q's? Yeah, sure. You have it out.

835
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,650
You use the other players, payoffs,
you use the other players. Pay Offs,

836
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,780
an indifferent between the
strategies. Goods. Good.

837
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:41,310
I'm going to choose,

838
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:46,370
play a bees mix in such a way as to make
player a indifference between choosing

839
00:53:48,211 --> 00:53:53,040
fight and quits. So as to make
it plausible that be, is it a,

840
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:56,940
is actually mixing. So again, the
intuition is for a to be mixing.

841
00:53:57,090 --> 00:53:59,640
They must be indifferent
between fighting and quit.

842
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:04,820
So I'm going to choose the mix
of B to make a indifference.

843
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:09,510
That's good review. Let's do that.
So here I've used a user that a cue,

844
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:12,720
but to avoid confusion here,
let me use the letter p.

845
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:14,701
All right,

846
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:19,430
we're going to choose P to
make player a indifference.

847
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:22,140
So if a,

848
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,420
if a fight a fight,

849
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,540
then their payoff is what?
It's all like.

850
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:35,310
It's minus C with probable OCP.

851
00:54:36,450 --> 00:54:39,060
And can I minus C with Probo,

852
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:42,960
OCP and VI with problems c one minus p.

853
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:51,110
All right? Is it just should be coming
back. Now, this is before the midterm,

854
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:53,710
but you guys were alive
before the midterm, right?

855
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,970
So you were should remember this,
do they fight?

856
00:54:56,150 --> 00:55:00,230
They get minus c times
p Plus v one minus P.

857
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:05,210
Alright, if they quit, if they quit,

858
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:10,690
then they get zero with problem OCP and
zero again with probability one minus p.

859
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:19,880
So we know that if a is mixing,

860
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:25,040
B must be mixing in such a way as
to make these two numbers equal.

861
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:29,090
So we know these two must
be equal to one another.

862
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:34,100
Students that equal, we can
now solve for p. All right,

863
00:55:34,101 --> 00:55:35,210
so what's that going to give us?

864
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:40,300
It's going to give us v one
minus P is equal to p c.

865
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,870
Okay.

866
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,960
And that I think is p is equal to
v Over v plus six is that right?

867
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,150
I'm just check my order.

868
00:55:56,270 --> 00:56:00,660
And if you remember the game of Hawk
dove that we saw just before the midterm,

869
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,710
the game involving a two, it was
the, it was a game we looked at.

870
00:56:03,711 --> 00:56:04,850
When we look at evolution,

871
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:08,060
this is essentially the same
game more or less as that game.

872
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:11,210
And then you'll notice it's the same. How
to make sure we've got here. All right,

873
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,420
so p is equal to v Over v Plus C,

874
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:20,020
which means one minus P is
equal to c over the bossy.

875
00:56:20,241 --> 00:56:22,300
I'm leaving it up there a bit,
hoping that one of the Tas,

876
00:56:22,310 --> 00:56:25,780
he's going to just do my for me. I
think that's right there. That's right.

877
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,380
All right, so this game is symmetric.
So both players are going to,

878
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,140
we could do the same.
We can do the same for B,

879
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:34,840
but we'll find the same thing
right to symmetric game. All right,

880
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:37,000
so the mixed strategy equilibrium,

881
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:44,100
the mixed Nash equilibrium
in this game has both mix,

882
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:50,700
both fights with probability
equal to v Over v Plus C.

883
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:56,930
All right?

884
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,280
Now this is good news because they
were getting some fighting going on,

885
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:03,230
but we need to do something.

886
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:05,820
We need to take this Nash
Equilibrium we've just found,

887
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:09,230
which is a nash equilibrium
in the second sub game.

888
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:14,120
It's a Nash equilibrium in
the sub game way up here.

889
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:20,640
And we need to roll back the
payoffs from this sub game.

890
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:25,780
The equilibrium payoffs in this sub game
into the first stage. That's our method.

891
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:28,900
How are we going to do that?
Well, if not better, first of all,

892
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:33,580
figure out what those payoffs are. So
what are the payoffs in this equilibrium?

893
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
The payoffs in this
mixed nash equilibrium.

894
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:47,110
Oh,
what do you want to see?

895
00:57:47,111 --> 00:57:50,980
What the payoffs are going to be if they
post playing this mix while presumably

896
00:57:50,981 --> 00:57:55,810
the payoff from fights and the payoff
and quit must be the same. Is that right?

897
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,910
So we miss,
we'll choose the easier one.

898
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:03,120
So I claimed that the payoff from quit
is zero times p plus zero times one minus

899
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:10,300
P, which is zero ve over v
Possy poss zero Cov posse,

900
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:13,810
but that's equal to
watch zero. Okay, good.

901
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:17,860
So it's got to be the case
kind of conveniently did.

902
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:21,100
If they do play this mixed
strategy equilibrium in Stage two,

903
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:24,430
the payoff they'll get
from playing it is zero.

904
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,810
That's going to make life a little
bit easier later on. All right,

905
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,980
that's our new equilibrium
in the second psalm game.

906
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:36,610
Now let's roll that
back to the first game.

907
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:37,723
Okay,

908
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:46,690
here's our first game again.
Alright.

909
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:49,200
And everything about this is is correct.

910
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:54,340
Everything about it is correct
except what's down here.

911
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:55,680
Let's get rid of what's down here.

912
00:58:58,870 --> 00:58:59,703
Yeah.

913
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:04,300
Our analysis from before
is more or less than tax.

914
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,650
It's still the case that if
they both quit, they'll get
zero. If they quit fight,

915
00:59:08,651 --> 00:59:12,850
they'll get zero Viavi zero and it's
still the case was they both fight.

916
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:18,330
They'll both incur costs of c and r both
then get stage two continuation Nash

917
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,080
Payoffs,
is that right?

918
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,320
But now instead of those continuation
Nash Payoffs Being v Zero Zero v,

919
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:33,860
those continuation Nash Payoffs are going
to be what? They're going to be zero.

920
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:34,940
They're going to be zero.

921
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:39,260
So we're going to do here is we're going
to backward and doctor rollback those

922
00:59:39,261 --> 00:59:44,261
zero pay offs and come up
with the corresponding may
to describe the first stage

923
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:50,150
of the game and heritage is fight,
quit

924
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:52,843
live,
laugh.

925
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:57,170
Try and get it right without Jake having
to correct me this time. A little laugh,

926
00:59:57,171 --> 00:59:59,720
middle laugh. It'll cue. This is a,

927
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:03,320
this is B and the payoffs here,

928
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:05,960
oh zero zero

929
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,630
zero V v zero just as
before and in this box.

930
01:00:11,631 --> 01:00:16,631
Now we've gotten minus C plus
zero and minus C plus zero.

931
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,330
All right, so it's exactly the
same box we saw before, but now

932
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:30,310
the continuation payoffs,
how justice zero.

933
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:34,240
All right, and again, what is this?

934
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:38,050
This is for the Nash Equilibrium,

935
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:43,480
as I say, for the mixed, for the mixed

936
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:49,270
Nash Equilibrium in period two.

937
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:53,020
All right.

938
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:58,560
I want, I want to do is I want to find
the mixed equilibrium in parade one,

939
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:01,440
right? We found the premixed
equipment period two.

940
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,670
Now I want to find the mix
equilibrium and her ed one.

941
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:08,540
So what I could do here is I could spend
a lot of time, I could put it a piano,

942
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:12,900
a piano, one minus P and I could
work out what mix of player B.

943
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,030
We'll make a indifference.

944
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,620
I could work at what point mixed of
player hey would make be different.

945
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,710
But does anybody notice
something about this matrix?

946
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:25,560
What do you notice about this matrix?
Somebody, somebody help me out.

947
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:31,760
Somebody got to help me out here. Tell
me something about this matrix. W what?

948
01:01:31,761 --> 01:01:34,750
What? What? What's true at this
matrix? The same as the one above.

949
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:37,000
It's the same as the one above,
right?

950
01:01:37,270 --> 01:01:41,340
The Matrix I just drew when
I rolled back the pay offs,

951
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:42,821
when I roll back,

952
01:01:42,821 --> 01:01:47,821
the payoffs is exactly the
same matrix that I had here.

953
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,010
It's exactly the same matrix.

954
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,100
So we already know what the mix
strategy you could ever have. Isn't this

955
01:01:56,020 --> 01:02:00,400
the mixed Nash equilibrium in this matrix

956
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,593
is

957
01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:10,830
to fight is is both fight

958
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:19,170
with probable a c p Equals v over v Posse.

959
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:24,480
So when now ready,
just show on new,

960
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:28,920
on new subgame perfect equilibrium.
It's dried it down.

961
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:35,360
Here's our whole game.
We found the pure group.

962
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:38,700
Sorry we found a pure spes,

963
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:44,540
but now we're ready to find the mixed sp.

964
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:51,220
The mix of getting perfect
equilibrium has player a while.

965
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:56,190
Before I do that, let me just give this
PNA. Let me call this p p star. Okay,

966
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,290
so Vov Posse,
that's quite Pete star.

967
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,930
So the mix of getting perfect
equilibrium has player one mixing,

968
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:09,180
fighting with property, pea stone and the
first stage. And then the second stage.

969
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:13,620
Again, mixing fighting prop with
proper OCP star. This is player one

970
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,850
and player two does
exactly the same thing.

971
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:29,470
And while we're here,
watch the expected payoff for each player.

972
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:34,030
If they're playing this mixed
subgame perfect equilibrium,

973
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:39,190
what does that, it's zero. It's Sarah.

974
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:42,550
The payoff from this,
the expected payoff

975
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:49,900
is all right,
so now we're actually getting somewhere.

976
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:51,070
Now we're really getting somewhere.

977
01:03:55,400 --> 01:03:59,750
Let's just take a deep breath and see
where we are. We, we broke this game down,

978
01:03:59,751 --> 01:04:03,290
this complicated game we played in
class that it conceivably, for example,

979
01:04:03,291 --> 01:04:06,380
when it New York is playing New Jersey
conceivably could go on all night.

980
01:04:06,830 --> 01:04:09,190
Apparently not when the Texans are
playing each other or the football team's

981
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,120
playing the baseball team,
but when we have New York and Jersey,

982
01:04:11,121 --> 01:04:15,350
you could go on all night, hey, we
could tell it to a two period game,

983
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:19,160
but in a minute, want to go back to the
infinite game, right? In this two period,

984
01:04:19,161 --> 01:04:22,800
gay man,
I tried to argue that we could,

985
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:27,860
I'm trying to convince you that you
could get fighting occurring Justin

986
01:04:28,101 --> 01:04:32,150
equilibrate with absolutely
standard rational players.
Nothing to do with pride.

987
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:33,540
It was reputation.

988
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:36,590
Nothing to do with the fact that these
guys are crazy guys who've drunk the

989
01:04:36,591 --> 01:04:39,620
wharf for Newt New York and New
Jersey. God held them all, right,

990
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:44,180
you're going to s you can get fighting
with ordinary people in equilibrium.

991
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,530
All right, and what we've shown is
the way which you can get fighting,

992
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:53,550
is it a mixed strategy equilibrium
in each period of the game.

993
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:56,060
People fight with pro books.
Eep.

994
01:04:56,270 --> 01:05:01,270
That's just enough fights to give the
other side at an incentive to quit and

995
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:03,170
just enough problems.

996
01:05:03,171 --> 01:05:05,820
You have the other side quitting
to give the other side of a,

997
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,300
an incentive to fight just exactly enough.

998
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:14,180
If they play that equilibrium in every
period there's some chance of the game

999
01:05:14,181 --> 01:05:16,410
ending.
But with problems,

1000
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:19,210
the p the game goes
forward to the next period.

1001
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:24,250
So you could potentially have
fights per two prayers by the way.

1002
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:28,030
With what problem? See? Would
there be a fight in both periods?

1003
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,320
That's a good homework question.
I won't answer it here. Right?

1004
01:05:31,321 --> 01:05:32,160
You can work it out at home.

1005
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,360
Alright. Alright. Alright.
So what do we do it here?

1006
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:38,830
Anyone want to tell me that? So, okay.

1007
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:40,970
And what problem we will
probably lose you do.

1008
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,230
We're going to fight in the first parade.

1009
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,210
A real fight to fight
involving both players.

1010
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,900
What do you both players to fights
each a fighting with Bono. Cep.

1011
01:05:51,930 --> 01:05:55,890
So the problem is you have both of them.
Fighting is one p squared. All right,

1012
01:05:55,891 --> 01:05:57,690
so we're going to fight
in the first period,

1013
01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:01,140
the problems he is p squared to
get to fight in both parades.

1014
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,500
It's what better Pete Peters,
the fourth. All right?

1015
01:06:04,501 --> 01:06:08,220
But we get a fight with probably the
of the fourth going through. All right?

1016
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:11,220
We get fighting and equilibrium.
Moreover,

1017
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,740
we get some very intuitive things that
we already learned in the Hawk dove game,

1018
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:19,410
right? The probability
of fights, and they said

1019
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:23,880
the probability of fights occurring,

1020
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:30,560
the problems occurring, it goes, oh,

1021
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:36,480
how's the fee goes up? So the prize gets
bigger. You're more likely to see fights.

1022
01:06:36,481 --> 01:06:40,970
The car that seemed right,
and it goes down

1023
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:47,050
and see the problems your fights occurring
goes up in the size of the prize.

1024
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:50,450
That seems intuitively right and
down in the cost of fighting.

1025
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:53,213
All right?

1026
01:06:54,350 --> 01:06:58,820
No. Okay, that's reasonable. But
I claimed I could show you this,

1027
01:06:58,821 --> 01:07:02,270
not in a two period game,
but in an infinite period game.

1028
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:07,010
So let me spend the last five minutes
taking us to infinite parade games.

1029
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,980
All right?
So everybody take a deep breath.

1030
01:07:10,010 --> 01:07:12,380
We're now going to come to
something we'd never done before.

1031
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:15,560
We're going to consider a gay
man that could go on forever,

1032
01:07:17,250 --> 01:07:18,230
could go on forever.

1033
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:20,970
All right?

1034
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:23,180
And the way we're going to do that

1035
01:07:28,350 --> 01:07:30,780
is to use the following idea
and the following picture.

1036
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:43,830
So I can't really draw a true
tree for the infinite period game.

1037
01:07:44,410 --> 01:07:49,110
And the reason they can't draw a true
tree for the infinite parade gay man is

1038
01:07:49,111 --> 01:07:53,370
one I would run out of shock and
two, I'd run it lunch. Lunchtime.

1039
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:57,150
All right? But you could imagine what
it looks like. It looks like this.

1040
01:07:57,151 --> 01:07:58,080
Roughly speaking.
Yes.

1041
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:03,000
Uh hmm.

1042
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:07,050
Can I get this right? It's not.
Again, you can put a period game look,

1043
01:08:07,051 --> 01:08:08,060
something like this

1044
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,880
and that has again,

1045
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:20,830
all right.
And that goes again.

1046
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:21,773
Okay,

1047
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:24,480
that's so awesome.
All right.

1048
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:26,720
How did it go right the way
through the board and what?

1049
01:08:26,721 --> 01:08:30,230
Right the way across whatever street
that is right across campus. All right.

1050
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,430
That's what the infinite
tree would look like.

1051
01:08:31,431 --> 01:08:33,500
So I clearly can't really
analyze that object,

1052
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:37,790
but what I want to show you is that we
can still solve this game even though

1053
01:08:37,791 --> 01:08:40,670
it's an infinite period game.
How are we going to do that?

1054
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,310
Let's look at a particular stage.

1055
01:08:43,590 --> 01:08:48,590
Let's call the stage
stage 4,503 all right,

1056
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:51,380
whatever that number works right?
For 4,503 whatever it was, right?

1057
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:54,020
So here is the stage,
it's all arbitrary stage,

1058
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:58,910
and then the tree for this
arbitrary stage looks like this.

1059
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:03,820
All right?

1060
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:07,100
And then what I'm going to do is this
is, you know this, this is stage.

1061
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:12,290
What was it? 5,000 was
it 4,503 all right, this,

1062
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:14,480
this is the stage,
all right?

1063
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:18,980
And what I'm going to hide to this is
that before you get into this stage,

1064
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:22,790
you're going to incur some costs,

1065
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,033
all right?

1066
01:09:25,090 --> 01:09:30,070
And if you go on playing off to
this stage, then you're going to get

1067
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:39,420
continuation values,
all right?

1068
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:42,540
So going into the beginning of the game,
you've incurred some sunk costs,

1069
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,630
and if you come out on the
other side and go on playing,

1070
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:48,120
you're going to play some equilibrium
and get continuation values.

1071
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:53,520
But otherwise everything else is the same.
We still have zero zero here.

1072
01:09:53,521 --> 01:09:55,530
We still have zero V v here.

1073
01:09:55,590 --> 01:10:00,590
We still have visa zero here and here
we still have minus C plus continuation

1074
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:04,770
values and minus c plus continuation.

1075
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:11,630
All right,

1076
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:14,970
and this is something we've seen before,
right?

1077
01:10:14,971 --> 01:10:16,740
They said the box is
something we've seen before.

1078
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,990
Essentially we've got sunk costs in front,
but they're relevance.

1079
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:23,160
We've got continuation values at the end,

1080
01:10:23,161 --> 01:10:27,180
we know how to handle that and we just
put them into the payoffs. All right,

1081
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:32,810
so suppose now suppose that in the
continuation game people play the mixed

1082
01:10:35,641 --> 01:10:37,500
strategy that we just found.

1083
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:43,130
Suppose that in the continuation
game people makes with provosts VP,

1084
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:48,150
so they fight with problems. He p Star
and quit with Aldi, one minus p stone,

1085
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:52,380
exposing the continuation game.
They're playing a mixed strategy.

1086
01:10:53,070 --> 01:10:56,700
In that case, what is the
continuation value of the game?

1087
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:02,710
Miss that again? All right,
what is it? It's zero, right?

1088
01:11:02,711 --> 01:11:06,410
If I'm mixing in the future,
they always had the option to quit.

1089
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,090
So it must be that the
continuation value is zero.

1090
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,530
So if they mix in the future,

1091
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:21,620
then the continuation value
is zero.

1092
01:11:21,621 --> 01:11:24,650
Zero. All right, so now

1093
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:30,250
let's go back to this board.
All right.

1094
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,750
To make this board or call
them to the board above,

1095
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:37,780
all they need to do is one thing I need
to add on some sunk costs at the front.

1096
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,580
I've got sunk cost at the front.

1097
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:47,180
I'm going to play the game
and then I'm going to get,

1098
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:50,750
isn't it a stage two values? I'm
going to get stage, what was it,

1099
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:55,610
4,503 in all stages in the future.
Values in here and here,

1100
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:59,390
but otherwise it's the same thing and
what's convenient is all of those is zero

1101
01:11:59,391 --> 01:12:02,420
anyway,
since they're all zero anyway,

1102
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:05,330
this matrix is still correct,
right?

1103
01:12:05,331 --> 01:12:10,331
The continuation values are zero and
zero is another continuation values.

1104
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:15,000
These are the continuation values

1105
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:23,230
and so if I look for a mixed
strategy equilibrium in this game,

1106
01:12:23,950 --> 01:12:26,860
it's something I've sold already watched
the mixed strategy equilibrium in this

1107
01:12:26,861 --> 01:12:27,694
game.

1108
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:29,913
Anybody?

1109
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:35,810
It's tough. It's exactly what
we found before justice before.

1110
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:41,090
I'm going to mix with
pro se ve over v Posse,

1111
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:45,113
right?

1112
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:49,060
Let's summarize. We did something today
just now that we've never done before.

1113
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:54,780
We've looked at an infinite or these
potentially infinite period game I gained

1114
01:12:55,751 --> 01:12:56,800
that could go on forever.

1115
01:12:57,550 --> 01:13:02,550
And the way in which we handled the game
that could go on forever was what we

1116
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,330
noticed.
Two things.

1117
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:09,480
We noticed that part of the game that
comes before that part of the game that

1118
01:13:09,601 --> 01:13:14,200
was passed already, anything that
happened there is just a sunk cost.

1119
01:13:14,650 --> 01:13:17,680
It's irrelevant. It's just, I
mean, it hurts. If it's a cost,

1120
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:20,920
it's nice if it's a gain, but it's
sunk. You can't affect it now.

1121
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:23,800
Anything in the future,

1122
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:28,660
anything in the future can
be summarized by the value,

1123
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:32,470
the payoff I'm going to get in the
future by playing the equilibrium in the

1124
01:13:32,471 --> 01:13:37,070
future, right? And this
case, the future man mixing,

1125
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:39,200
mixing gave me a value of zero.

1126
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:45,040
So here I am getting a zero in the future
and then I can just analyze the game

1127
01:13:46,821 --> 01:13:51,470
in the stage of which I'm in, just as
if it was an ordinary bog, standard,

1128
01:13:51,471 --> 01:13:52,460
simultaneous move game.

1129
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:55,430
All right?

1130
01:13:55,610 --> 01:13:57,500
When we did,
so in this particular example,

1131
01:13:57,501 --> 01:13:59,150
we're going to see more examples
like this after the break.

1132
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,900
But in this particular example we
found out something quite surprising.

1133
01:14:03,740 --> 01:14:07,670
The thing we found out was in these
war of attrition and settings,

1134
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,250
that is an equilibrium with rational
players. Everyone mold, not common

1135
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:15,820
knowledge or rationality.
Everybody's rational. Everyone
knows hypnosis rational.

1136
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:20,080
There are equal ever and which not
only people fights but they could fight

1137
01:14:20,081 --> 01:14:25,081
forever in every period they fight
with some policy and we got an extra

1138
01:14:26,021 --> 01:14:26,854
prediction out,

1139
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:30,190
a prediction that we weren't expecting
and let me just give you that prediction

1140
01:14:30,191 --> 01:14:33,310
and then we'll leave the class with
the hat. The extra prediction is this.

1141
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:38,790
If we look at these wars of attrition
and we keep track all the time in which

1142
01:14:40,961 --> 01:14:44,050
the, hang on guys don't know
rusty bags yet. One more thing.

1143
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:49,030
We look at the time at which the Games
have gone on and keep track of the

1144
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:54,031
probability that a war
will end at that time.

1145
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,860
So imagine this is, well,
the one you could imagine,

1146
01:14:56,861 --> 01:15:00,670
what would one going for one year or
two years or three years or 20 years or

1147
01:15:00,671 --> 01:15:03,910
whatever the problem is,
distribution in this war of attrition

1148
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:08,500
is going to look like
this in every period.

1149
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:12,740
The prevalency of continuing
is just p star squared,

1150
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:16,240
so on every period, the chance as
you get further into the future,

1151
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:20,170
there's a greater chance of the war
will end. You can get very long,

1152
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:23,680
very costly wars.
That's the bad news.

1153
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:27,550
The good news is it doesn't
happen very often. All right.

1154
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:30,730
I guess we're all involved in a
rather large and costly war right now,

1155
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:33,220
so I'll leave you that without
pleasant thought over thanksgiving.

1156
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:34,840
Have a good break. Almost.
See you afterwards.
