1
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.071
Okay.

2
00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:02.520
Well,

3
00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.750
we've seen now how the early tutors managed to reestablish the authority of the

4
00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:07.584
monarchy,

5
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.870
how that achievement was threatened by the succession crisis,

6
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:14.610
which was looming under Henry the eighth.

7
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.350
How that problem was met by actions,

8
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:23.520
which further extended royal authority over the church.

9
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.660
But at the same time of course introduced a new form of instability into the

10
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:31.240
kingdom,

11
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.620
um,

12
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.020
potential conflict over religion.

13
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.473
Um,

14
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.190
but that wasn't all that was going on.

15
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.370
And there are other sources of instability which was set in motion at around the

16
00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:47.580
same time in the second quarter of the 16th century.

17
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.990
Um,

18
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.990
what adds additional complexity to the whole situation is the fact that there

19
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:59.280
was simultaneous shifts in some of the basic aspects of economic and social

20
00:00:59.281 --> 00:00:59.940
life,

21
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.690
which in 1500 would have been more or less taken for granted.

22
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.360
The problem then had been political instability,

23
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.430
not social instability,

24
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.510
but soon social instability was to be on the agenda.

25
00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.810
And people knew by the 1530s and 1540s that they lived in radically changing

26
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:19.584
times,

27
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.920
uh,

28
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.420
in more ways than one.

29
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.460
The phenomenon of which they were most acutely aware was rising prices,

30
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.360
rising prices for the basic necessities of life.

31
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.820
Prices of goods had been fairly stable for most of the 15th and early 16th

32
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:39.654
centuries,

33
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.180
but around about the second decade of the 16th century,

34
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:43.230
they began rising.

35
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.560
If you look at your handout section one you'll find there an index of prices for

36
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.460
what's described as a basket of basic consumables,

37
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.730
mostly food stuffs and other essentials of life.

38
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.710
I can see from that index,

39
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:06.711
which stands at around 100 in 1500 how prices rose rapidly in the course of the

40
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:09.870
16th century.

41
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.300
At first it was a modest trend.

42
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.980
It picked up momentum in the 1530s price rises.

43
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:21.420
We're very rapid indeed in 1540s and fifties and they continued to rise more

44
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:23.160
slowly thereafter,

45
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.520
so they faced a problem of inflation and the causes of that inflation,

46
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.893
um,

47
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.980
we're complex,

48
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.240
they're much debated.

49
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.261
But amongst the,

50
00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:40.261
one of the most principals seems to have been the fact that population was also

51
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.713
growing.

52
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.080
The pressure was being felt of increasing numbers of people on relatively

53
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.400
inelastic resources,

54
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.770
forcing up prices.

55
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.670
If you look at section two of your handout,

56
00:02:56.671 --> 00:03:01.671
you'll see the best figures available from historians of what the population of

57
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:06.040
England was at different points in the earlier 16th century.

58
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.511
Best estimates,

59
00:03:07.511 --> 00:03:11.440
we have suggested in 1520s about 2.4 million

60
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.120
by the 1550s that had risen to about 3 million by 1573 point 3 million and still

61
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.823
rising.

62
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.160
The annual rate of increase can be calculated and it's there on the right hand

63
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:32.161
side in the 1540 is about 0.64% per annum,

64
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.730
1560s almost 1% per annum,

65
00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.980
1570s over 1% per annum.

66
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.580
These are quite rapid rates have increase for a preindustrial population.

67
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.033
In fact,

68
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.960
that kind of rate of population increase was not matched again in England until

69
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:55.690
the late 18th century at the height of the industrial revolution.

70
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.420
So the population was rising now explaining why that was.

71
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:02.920
So it's far from easy,

72
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.730
uh,

73
00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.680
but in all likelihood it was to do with a fall in death rates in the early 16th

74
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:13.681
century in a population which had a fairly high fertility rate and a high

75
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:16.030
propensity to grow.

76
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.960
If it wasn't cold by severe mortality,

77
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.550
so death rate's still high by our standards seem to have been falling somewhat.

78
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.510
If you're interested in that kind of historical demography and we'd like to

79
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:30.550
pursue the issue of population dynamics,

80
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:33.790
then I'd be happy to advise you on more detailed reading,

81
00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.060
but for the moment it's enough to just register the essential facts.

82
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.080
Prices are rising,

83
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.580
population is rising,

84
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:43.900
the two are probably connected.

85
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.880
What I want to focus on today is the fallout from all of that,

86
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.180
some of the stressors in society which were produced by this dynamic of

87
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:57.070
population growth and price inflation,

88
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.180
how it impacted on different groups in society

89
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.820
and one can start at the top with the landlords.

90
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.420
Gentlemen,

91
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.253
no woman,

92
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.113
the monarchy

93
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:12.221
in most cases,

94
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:14.080
the bulk of landlords in comes as you know,

95
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:19.081
came from the rents and they needed that income to sustain the lifestyles which

96
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:24.241
were appropriate to their station as gentlemen to sustain their magnificence in

97
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:27.130
that situation.

98
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.160
Their biggest problem as a 16th century went on was rising prices,

99
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:34.960
but an inflexible income

100
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.211
at worst.

101
00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:40.450
Many of them had tenants who enjoyed fixed rents.

102
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.330
They'd been granted fixed rents at some point in the past.

103
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:44.733
At best,

104
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.150
they were in a position to periodically modify the rents they got for their

105
00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:49.984
lands,

106
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.720
but they were still relatively inflexible.

107
00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.620
Land was often granted for long periods of time on a fixed agreement for that

108
00:05:57.621 --> 00:05:58.220
term.

109
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.840
It might be 2030 years.

110
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.730
Land was also let,

111
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:03.470
according to the customs as you know,

112
00:06:03.471 --> 00:06:05.810
which had been established in particular areas,

113
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.670
which might inhibit the landlord's capacity to adjust the rent levels.

114
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.700
That's very bad news when prices are rising.

115
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.240
So how did these people cope?

116
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.580
For the most part,

117
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.410
landlords coped by gradually trying to alter the terms on which they granted

118
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:28.760
their land to the peasantry.

119
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.940
They tried to let it for shorter leases,

120
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.490
which they could renegotiate more often,

121
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.910
try to get the lease down to seven years,

122
00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:39.980
10 years or whatever rather than 90,

123
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.080
which had been quite common in the past.

124
00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.900
They also tried to change local customs regarding what kind of fine or down

125
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:50.180
payment they could get when they let land.

126
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:52.461
For example,

127
00:06:52.461 --> 00:06:54.530
on the estates of the Herbert family,

128
00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.341
uh,

129
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:58.220
which were located in wheelchair in the southwest.

130
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.060
In the first half of the 16th century,

131
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:07.390
they manage to roughly double the fines which they were getting when a new

132
00:07:08.301 --> 00:07:09.930
tenant took land from them.

133
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:12.051
Well,

134
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:15.650
it was only possible for landlords to squeeze their tenants a little harder in

135
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:18.710
that way because land was in demand.

136
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.490
The rising population rising population for the first time in a century and a

137
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.310
half meant that there was demand for land in a way that hadn't really been known

138
00:07:28.311 --> 00:07:29.720
since the 14th century.

139
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.970
There's a lot of evidence of people nibbling at wasteland forest land,

140
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.833
more land,

141
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.830
bringing land into cultivation in the forest of Inglewood,

142
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:40.371
for example,

143
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:43.100
which is located up in the northwest of England up here,

144
00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.000
there was a survey made of illegal encroachments in the forest.

145
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:52.250
People cutting out a little piece of land for themselves where they could squat.

146
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:52.851
Ah,

147
00:07:52.851 --> 00:07:57.290
and it revealed that over a period of 20 or 30 years,

148
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.220
almost 200 encroachments had been made into the forest there.

149
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.500
So pressure on the land and inevitably also has the population rose these size

150
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:11.600
of the holy landless population.

151
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:12.920
Rose too.

152
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.120
There were more young people survive into adulthood for whom there was no

153
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:17.954
inheritance,

154
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:19.970
no place on the land.

155
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.560
Although shifting circumstances,

156
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:25.700
the pressure's on landlords,

157
00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:28.130
the pressures that they pass on to their tenants.

158
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.730
The pressure of population growth help to explain the emergence in the early

159
00:08:34.011 --> 00:08:38.840
16th century of some quite severe tensions in the relationships between

160
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.330
landlords and farm tenants.

161
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.000
Tensions in particular over customs

162
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:50.240
and the emergence of one particular cardinal grievance.

163
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.550
The grievance of enclosure,

164
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:59.130
not as I've explained earlier in some areas of the kingdom,

165
00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:03.480
agriculture had never been practiced in great open fields,

166
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.320
but had been practiced already on end closed farms

167
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:12.420
before 1500 in the areas where there was,

168
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.220
there were open fields.

169
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.760
Some of them had been reorganized by enclosing them to make sheep pastures.

170
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.040
This was done by landlords who were short of tenants.

171
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:28.580
They found that doing that was a good way of keeping their land in production,

172
00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.890
although a low intensity production when otherwise it might go vacant or might

173
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:35.610
be unprofitable.

174
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.620
Wool was in demand for the cloth industry,

175
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:41.550
so they went over to a kind of sheep ranching at the time that wasn't

176
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:42.900
particularly controversial,

177
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.960
but after the 1510s steps to end close land,

178
00:09:48.961 --> 00:09:50.370
which had formerly been open,

179
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:53.010
became much more controversial,

180
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.730
uh,

181
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:55.650
in the Midlands,

182
00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.410
which was a major wolf supplying area,

183
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:03.650
many landlords withdrew land from the plow to turn it into sheep ranches.

184
00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:08.820
Despite the growing demand from tenants for land,

185
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:15.630
some landlords also took in and then closed for their own use land,

186
00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:19.260
which had formerly been the common pasture land of particular villages.

187
00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:24.390
Thereby they reduced the area of common pasture available to their tenants,

188
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.220
which was a further grievance,

189
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:31.200
especially since common land was particularly valuable in conditions of land

190
00:10:31.201 --> 00:10:32.034
hunger.

191
00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.970
While these changing conditions meant that and closure,

192
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.470
which had previously been merely a tactic you could adopt on your estate,

193
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:45.510
became a quite significant grievance in many areas of the kingdom.

194
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:51.140
It seemed to many people a very visible sign of the changing balance of power in

195
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:54.750
rural society between Lords and tenants.

196
00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:01.070
So Thomas Moore in his utopia refers to the phenomenon of sheep eating men in

197
00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:03.000
England.

198
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.270
At this time reflecting that sense of grievance.

199
00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:13.550
It's for these reasons that issues of rents and fines and customs and common

200
00:11:14.011 --> 00:11:17.910
land became a quite explosive cocktail in London,

201
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:21.120
landlord tenant relations by the mid 16th century

202
00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:26.040
and there was also a little more to it than that.

203
00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:31.590
The economic trends and the population trends of the period with gradually

204
00:11:31.591 --> 00:11:36.591
producing a greater differentiation in village society amongst tenants.

205
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.840
There were those who did quite well in these circumstances,

206
00:11:42.841 --> 00:11:44.310
especially the bigger farmers,

207
00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:49.290
the yeomanry quite often they held part of their land in freehold.

208
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.970
They were somewhat protected.

209
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.273
Quite often.

210
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.310
They produced a large surplus which they could market and if prices were rising,

211
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:58.660
they could make bigger profits.

212
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.410
They were able to pay higher rents without too much trouble.

213
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.890
They might take on more land to extend their operations and if they wanted to do

214
00:12:07.931 --> 00:12:08.530
that,

215
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:13.300
they were in a far better position to compete for available land than where

216
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:14.620
their poorer neighbors.

217
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.120
So this is a period when one sees the yeomanry becoming increasingly

218
00:12:19.121 --> 00:12:24.121
differentiated in their wealth and living standards from the poorer neighbors.

219
00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.930
These were people who were able to benefit from the trends of the period.

220
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:36.350
They showed a lot of ambition in the way they did that and the ambition of those

221
00:12:36.541 --> 00:12:41.541
who are best able to take advantage of the trends of the this generation.

222
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:47.940
That ambition is also shown in response to another economic development of the

223
00:12:47.941 --> 00:12:52.260
period and this time it's an economic development which wasn't directly

224
00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.620
connected to population or price trends,

225
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.550
but was connected to the religious changes and I'm thinking of course,

226
00:12:59.551 --> 00:13:04.470
of the dissolution of the monasteries and bringing onto the market of vast

227
00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:07.710
quantities of former monastic land.

228
00:13:09.770 --> 00:13:10.603
<v 1>Okay.</v>

229
00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.960
<v 0>Some figures relating to this are there on your handout in section three,</v>

230
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:21.430
basically between 1536 and 1540 about 60% of the land,

231
00:13:22.791 --> 00:13:24.650
which was owned by the church,

232
00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:30.130
was transferred to the crown through the dissolution of the monasteries.

233
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:37.040
Many studies have been done of individual counties and the county of Essex down

234
00:13:37.041 --> 00:13:38.510
here to the east of London,

235
00:13:38.511 --> 00:13:39.344
for example,

236
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:44.470
the Church had owned about 28% of the manners in that county by 1540 after the

237
00:13:45.831 --> 00:13:46.371
dissolution,

238
00:13:46.371 --> 00:13:47.600
it owned only 2%.

239
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:50.330
It's a massive transfer of land.

240
00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:51.561
Well,

241
00:13:51.561 --> 00:13:56.561
these seizures of church land we'll probably intended by Thomas Cromwell to

242
00:13:56.871 --> 00:14:01.190
endow the crown in perpetuity with massive land holdings,

243
00:14:01.191 --> 00:14:06.191
which would render it absolutely unchallengeable and indeed it might even render

244
00:14:06.381 --> 00:14:09.860
it independent of any grants of taxation from parliament.

245
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.670
But if that was Cromwells intention,

246
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:18.910
it failed to materialize because most of the monastic land was quite rapidly

247
00:14:19.461 --> 00:14:21.530
disposed off by the crown.

248
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.880
By the time Henry the eighth himself died in 1547 he had already sold something

249
00:14:28.971 --> 00:14:31.280
like two thirds of the monastery land,

250
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.520
which had come into him and still more of this land was sold later.

251
00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:37.520
Um,

252
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.031
for example,

253
00:14:38.031 --> 00:14:41.090
there's been a study done of the of the whole of Wales,

254
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:44.510
which shows that of the monastic land there,

255
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:49.840
60% had gone by the death of Henry in 1547 and by the time Elizabeth to the

256
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:52.910
throne in 1558,

257
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:57.320
75% of the monastery land had been disposed off.

258
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.340
Why would the crown dispose of the land in this kind of way?

259
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.160
Well basically to pay for wars,

260
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:05.121
wars,

261
00:15:05.121 --> 00:15:06.650
which were getting more expensive,

262
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.410
requiring fortresses,

263
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.700
modern weapons,

264
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.260
new ships and so forth.

265
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:13.890
Henry the eighth in his last year,

266
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.170
engaged in short,

267
00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.490
inconclusive,

268
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.810
utterly,

269
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:18.790
utterly futile.

270
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:20.183
Um,

271
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:24.920
assertions of his rights as he sold them against France and against Scotland

272
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.270
resulting in wars and massive expenditure which are counted for much of the

273
00:15:29.271 --> 00:15:30.104
monastic land.

274
00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.280
For our purposes today,

275
00:15:35.281 --> 00:15:38.940
it's interesting to note the results of studies which have looked at the

276
00:15:38.941 --> 00:15:41.670
identities of who's buying this land from the crown

277
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:47.640
quite a lot when to the heads of established noble and gentry families,

278
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:53.270
people who are anxious to take advantage of this wonderful opportunity to

279
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.990
consolidate their estates,

280
00:15:54.991 --> 00:15:57.690
to rationalize the estates and so forth,

281
00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.750
to build up their holdings in particular areas of their strength.

282
00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:06.840
Another group who emerged quite strongly are people who are the youngest sons of

283
00:16:06.841 --> 00:16:09.720
such gentry and noble families.

284
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.400
People who are in the normal course of events would expect most of the family's

285
00:16:14.401 --> 00:16:16.230
property to pass to their older brothers,

286
00:16:16.890 --> 00:16:21.000
but who now had an opportunity to get in and get some land for themselves.

287
00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:22.380
Younger brothers,

288
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:28.430
they could set up cadet branches of the family and sometimes they did so with

289
00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:33.830
the money which they had generated in trade or in professionals.

290
00:16:34.051 --> 00:16:38.520
Younger sons were often put into trade or into professions and we're able to

291
00:16:38.521 --> 00:16:43.500
make the money which enabled them to return to Landon society and set themselves

292
00:16:43.501 --> 00:16:45.450
up as minor gentleman.

293
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:46.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

294
00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:51.940
<v 0>Another significant group were upwardly mobile people from the middle ranks of</v>

295
00:16:51.951 --> 00:16:52.784
society,

296
00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:58.420
Yeoman farmers piecing together field to field until they could emerge with a

297
00:17:00.111 --> 00:17:02.540
sufficient to state to call themselves gentlemen,

298
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.010
people from the towns who had no gentry ancestry,

299
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.540
perhaps lawyers,

300
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:09.560
perhaps actions,

301
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:14.570
prosperous craftsmen and tradesmen who were able to acquire land and it's

302
00:17:14.571 --> 00:17:19.571
superior social status perhaps in some cases on a level which would again bring

303
00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:23.120
them into the lower ranks of the gentry.

304
00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:29.410
So they were customers enough for this monastic land and to serve their needs.

305
00:17:29.871 --> 00:17:31.010
There were many speculators.

306
00:17:31.011 --> 00:17:35.060
A lot of the monastic land was bought by speculators who rapidly sold it on

307
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:42.370
the overall effects of this was a kind of feeding frenzy in the landmark it.

308
00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.280
It resulted,

309
00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.920
of course not only in this severe reduction of the position of the church as a

310
00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:50.880
great landowner,

311
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:56.960
but it also resulted ultimately in a very significant rise in both the numbers

312
00:17:58.111 --> 00:18:03.111
of those who called themselves gentlemen and in the relative wealth of the

313
00:18:03.511 --> 00:18:04.830
Gentry as a whole.

314
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.010
So some people who were doing very well out of all of this,

315
00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:14.820
but of course it's not all buoyancy,

316
00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:17.790
no process of change of this kind ever is,

317
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.050
and so one has to ask who are the losers in these processes and there are some

318
00:18:22.051 --> 00:18:26.880
large and quite obvious groups amongst the losers.

319
00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:31.260
We're a small farm tenants who couldn't easily meet rising rents,

320
00:18:31.261 --> 00:18:34.260
who didn't sell enough on the market to produce the profits,

321
00:18:34.261 --> 00:18:35.130
which would pay them,

322
00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.580
who were finding it difficult to make ends meet.

323
00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:44.670
Then there were those who were one could think of is would be farm tenants.

324
00:18:44.671 --> 00:18:48.480
Those who might aspire to getting a foothold on the land,

325
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:52.200
but found it increasingly difficult because rents were rising,

326
00:18:52.201 --> 00:18:54.360
fines were rising and so forth,

327
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:59.070
and they couldn't compete with the bigger guys in the village who could take up

328
00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.860
land that came available on the local market.

329
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.340
It could be quite a difficult time for the young in that respect,

330
00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.830
but above all,

331
00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:11.670
there were the growing numbers of landless people in the countryside or in the

332
00:19:11.671 --> 00:19:16.671
towns whose living dependent principally on what they could earn from wage

333
00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:23.091
earning as laborers and the rights to use Commons,

334
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.670
which they might enjoy in the places where they live.

335
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:34.620
Those who dependent on wages were particularly hard hit by inflation and despite

336
00:19:34.621 --> 00:19:36.390
the fact that prices were rising,

337
00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.400
squeezing their living standards,

338
00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:43.730
wages rose only slowly because the population was growing and there was plenty

339
00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.360
of labor available.

340
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.720
Wages tended to remain pretty sticky at customary levels for long periods of

341
00:19:51.661 --> 00:19:52.494
time.

342
00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:55.800
That meant that people's real wages,

343
00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.130
the real purchasing power of their wages was falling.

344
00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:03.900
Some quite close studies of this had been done and they suggest that between 15,

345
00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:08.901
10 and 1550 the purchasing power of wages fell by about 40% in the south of

346
00:20:12.031 --> 00:20:12.864
England.

347
00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:18.690
By the 1550s they were down 50% and they began to recover modestly only in the

348
00:20:19.441 --> 00:20:20.730
latest 16th century.

349
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.940
So these were quite hard times for a lot of people.

350
00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:28.470
Um,

351
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:29.340
William Harrison,

352
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.060
who wrote a famous description of England at the beginning of the reign of

353
00:20:33.061 --> 00:20:33.894
Elizabeth,

354
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:39.110
described how many of what he described as the inferior sot of people lived

355
00:20:39.691 --> 00:20:41.910
principally on what he called white meats,

356
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.730
eggs and cheese and bread

357
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:47.530
in times dearth.

358
00:20:47.531 --> 00:20:51.460
They were particularly hard hit and might have to live on peas and beans or even

359
00:20:51.461 --> 00:20:52.600
ground acorns,

360
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:54.160
which they tried to bake into bread.

361
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:55.863
He added,

362
00:20:56.170 --> 00:21:01.170
I will not say that this extremity is often also found in times of plenty,

363
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.480
but if I should,

364
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:06.700
I could easily stand my trial.

365
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:11.680
And that's Harrison's ironic comment on the living standards of the poor in his

366
00:21:11.681 --> 00:21:12.514
time.

367
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:14.681
Well,

368
00:21:14.681 --> 00:21:19.630
all of this was reflected in a growing contemporary concern with the problem of

369
00:21:19.631 --> 00:21:20.464
poverty.

370
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.430
There had always been poor of course,

371
00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.410
but poverty as a major social problem hadn't been a major issue in the 15th

372
00:21:29.411 --> 00:21:30.244
century.

373
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:35.430
It was more a matter of the poverty that resulted from lifecycle crises of a

374
00:21:36.251 --> 00:21:37.900
small minority of people.

375
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.190
The widowed,

376
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:40.720
the aged,

377
00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.730
the sick orphan children.

378
00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.020
These were the ones that contemporary is referred to as the impotent poor.

379
00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.120
Those who could not help themselves,

380
00:21:49.121 --> 00:21:53.020
those who are poor by circumstances beyond their control.

381
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:59.910
But as the 16th century advanced people began talking and writing about poverty

382
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:03.640
into worryingly expanded forms,

383
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.070
they first became aware of the problem of vagrancy,

384
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.760
the problem of what they called rogues and vagabonds

385
00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:19.260
homeless people visible on the streets of the towns or on the roads of the

386
00:22:19.631 --> 00:22:20.560
countryside.

387
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:25.390
People like one man who was arrested by the justices of the peace over near the

388
00:22:25.391 --> 00:22:26.320
Welsh border,

389
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:27.130
uh,

390
00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.230
who in the examination,

391
00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:30.880
which they took from him,

392
00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.810
told them that he was a person who dwells,

393
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:35.201
no,

394
00:22:35.201 --> 00:22:36.430
I'm quoting the examination.

395
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:37.630
He dwells nowhere,

396
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:39.730
nor has no abiding,

397
00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.130
but where he might find work.

398
00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:46.060
The vagrant looking for work moving around the countryside.

399
00:22:46.061 --> 00:22:46.841
People like this.

400
00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:50.920
We're a much more common site as the 16th century advanced.

401
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:55.720
It's quite interesting that in his translation of the New Testament,

402
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:56.650
William Tyndall,

403
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.170
in trying to describe a scene from the acts of the apostles where Saint Paul is

404
00:23:02.171 --> 00:23:05.320
attacked by a mob in Thessalonica,

405
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.310
uh,

406
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:08.320
translated the Greek word,

407
00:23:08.321 --> 00:23:10.690
which literally means people standing in the street.

408
00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.120
He translated it as vagabonds.

409
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:17.000
When Tyndall tried to imagine people hanging around in the street,

410
00:23:17.001 --> 00:23:21.940
he imagined them as somebody vagrants who he would have seen on the streets of

411
00:23:21.941 --> 00:23:22.774
London.

412
00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:24.520
So vagrancy,

413
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:25.601
rogues,

414
00:23:25.601 --> 00:23:30.190
and vagabonds or emerging as a significant problem.

415
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:32.973
On the other hand,

416
00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:38.010
there was the growing problem of what they described as the laboring poor people

417
00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:43.500
whose whole style of life was based increasingly on a kind of economy of

418
00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.440
makeshifts getting work wherever they could working,

419
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:49.363
certainly,

420
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:54.400
but finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet the laboring poor people

421
00:23:55.251 --> 00:24:00.251
who would also fall into really severe poverty if they suffered any misfortune,

422
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.880
if they couldn't find work,

423
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.520
if there was a depression in the cloth industry,

424
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:07.490
if they felt sick and so forth.

425
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:12.080
These people were especially visible in areas where wage workers were

426
00:24:12.081 --> 00:24:12.920
concentrated,

427
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:18.020
principally the towns or those areas of the countryside where many people worked

428
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:19.730
in rural industries.

429
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.211
Okay.

430
00:24:23.211 --> 00:24:23.570
Then that,

431
00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:24.800
let's just take stock

432
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:31.600
by the 1540s rising prices and demographic growth had seen in some ways a

433
00:24:34.611 --> 00:24:36.560
quickening of economic activity.

434
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:38.930
For some people,

435
00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:43.931
this brought new opportunities and indeed enhanced prosperity,

436
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:51.310
but at the same time there was also a growing sense of tension in the

437
00:24:51.441 --> 00:24:56.441
relationships between landlords and their peasant tenants and an emerging

438
00:24:57.261 --> 00:24:58.580
problem of land hunger,

439
00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:03.470
a growing problem of a wage labor in population which was very vulnerable to

440
00:25:03.471 --> 00:25:05.930
poverty on an unaccustomed scale.

441
00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:09.050
Our people were aware of these changes.

442
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:11.960
They were aware of the tensions,

443
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.920
but from their perspective at the time it was the symptoms of change which were

444
00:25:19.491 --> 00:25:22.340
more apparent than the actual causes.

445
00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.230
It,

446
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:28.230
it was exceedingly difficult for people in the 16th century to comprehend what

447
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.780
was happening to them.

448
00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:32.450
They didn't keep official statistics.

449
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.280
The figures which are on your handout,

450
00:25:34.281 --> 00:25:37.610
I've been calculated by historians using a variety of sources.

451
00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.420
Contemporaries didn't have information of this kind.

452
00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:47.110
They tended to perceive changes and emergent problems of this kind through their

453
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:49.580
inherited attitudes.

454
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.930
They're essentially medieval moral philosophy,

455
00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:59.870
a view of the world in which economic behavior wasn't treated as a distinct area

456
00:25:59.901 --> 00:26:00.621
of activity,

457
00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:04.280
a phenomenon to be studied in itself by the science of economics.

458
00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:09.640
They saw it as a branch of personal and social morality.

459
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.730
The ideal world,

460
00:26:13.731 --> 00:26:14.181
in their view,

461
00:26:14.181 --> 00:26:15.470
was the world of the Commonwealth,

462
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:17.870
which I've described to you.

463
00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:22.700
They saw these problems as failings in the ideal of the Commonwealth failings,

464
00:26:22.701 --> 00:26:27.410
which could be attributed to the misdeeds of specific people.

465
00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:29.691
Well,

466
00:26:29.691 --> 00:26:33.350
these ideas not only persisted throughout the early 16th century,

467
00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:38.650
but they were powerfully reemphasized in the 1540s with the emergence of a group

468
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:40.790
of moralists,

469
00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:45.900
most of them Protestant clergymen in the reign of Edward the sixth who addressed

470
00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:47.820
these social and economic grievances.

471
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.850
They were known at the time as the Commonwealth's men,

472
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:55.410
because they talked constantly about the needs of the Commonwealth.

473
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:01.080
Such people also saw the reformation,

474
00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:07.020
not simply in terms of the jurisdictional independence of the Church of England

475
00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.760
from the Church of Rome,

476
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.980
or simply in terms of fundamental doc trinal changes.

477
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:19.160
They also thought it was an opportunity for the re moralizing of society,

478
00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:26.420
the revitalization of Christian values in society.

479
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:31.950
They advocated an ideal Christian Commonwealth.

480
00:27:31.951 --> 00:27:34.950
They thought this was the opportunity to achieve it,

481
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.520
and yet they saw all around them evidence of the corruption of social

482
00:27:41.011 --> 00:27:46.011
relationships by what they saw as the cardinal sin of covetousness.

483
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:48.720
One of their favorite words,

484
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:49.740
covetousness,

485
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:50.783
greed,

486
00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:55.380
and the punishes idea again,

487
00:27:55.381 --> 00:28:00.381
which they constantly refer to that quote every man may do with his own as he

488
00:28:02.491 --> 00:28:03.324
will,

489
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.200
the notion that every man may do with his own as he will,

490
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.280
which they regarded as an unchristian attitude

491
00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:14.483
in their view.

492
00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:19.890
Worldly goods were given by God to be handled with stewardship,

493
00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.560
with an interest to society as a whole.

494
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.970
So there are social vision was essentially conservative.

495
00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:32.630
They saw a change in terms of social dislocation and moral corruption.

496
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.900
They denounced the representatives of covetousness,

497
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:38.430
whom they identified.

498
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.451
They spoke,

499
00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:42.330
for example of and gentle gentlemen.

500
00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:48.170
They attacked what they call the caterpillars of the Commonwealth eating up it's

501
00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.673
green shoots.

502
00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:55.410
They attach what they saw as exploitation and oppression of the poor,

503
00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:01.520
and they did all of this in a language reminiscent of Old Testament prophets.

504
00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.270
Um,

505
00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:06.030
rh Tawney greatest story in of these changes.

506
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:11.350
It says they used the moral rhetoric in his words of an age that had

507
00:29:11.581 --> 00:29:13.020
rediscovered the Bible.

508
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:14.520
Well,

509
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.600
it hadn't rediscovered it.

510
00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:18.870
It had discovered it for the first time in English.

511
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:20.970
And as I said,

512
00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:25.470
the language of Jeremiah or Isaiah is the kind of language that they used to

513
00:29:25.471 --> 00:29:26.304
denounce

514
00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.570
what they saw as a world out of joint.

515
00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:32.160
Well,

516
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:37.160
the pamphlets written by these people in the 1540s and 1550s are quite

517
00:29:38.161 --> 00:29:41.680
magnificent literature of moral indignation.

518
00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:44.590
It still has the capacity to thrill when you read it.

519
00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:51.600
It indicated also what's been described by one recent historian as a crisis of

520
00:29:51.611 --> 00:29:54.250
legitimation crisis of legitimation.

521
00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:58.210
The world seemed out of joint in so many ways,

522
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:04.510
but response to change also took a more direct form.

523
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:07.750
There were not only those who were appealing for reform,

524
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.130
for moral reformation,

525
00:30:09.131 --> 00:30:11.260
for people to behave as they should.

526
00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:16.840
They were also those who were prepared to directly resist these changes,

527
00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.260
especially in the countryside.

528
00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:22.900
A,

529
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.270
from about the 1530s onwards,

530
00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:25.990
um,

531
00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:30.990
researchers working on records of local government and on the courts find that

532
00:30:31.451 --> 00:30:36.451
the country was increasingly pockmarked with minor forms of disorder as the

533
00:30:37.601 --> 00:30:42.601
peasantry of particular localities really resisted initiatives on the part of

534
00:30:42.911 --> 00:30:43.744
their landlords,

535
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:49.170
perhaps rioting against the enclosing the fields or of common land and so forth.

536
00:30:51.850 --> 00:30:56.850
Oregon's changes in their customs and 10 years and such resistance becomes above

537
00:30:59.081 --> 00:31:02.830
all evident in some of the great risings of the Commons,

538
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:07.950
which took place in the middle third of the 16th century risings,

539
00:31:08.801 --> 00:31:13.060
which convulsed first the north of England and then the east of England in

540
00:31:13.061 --> 00:31:13.894
particular.

541
00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:19.890
The first of these risings was the pilgrimage of grace of 1536 arising of much

542
00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:22.270
of the north of England.

543
00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.140
This was a complex event.

544
00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:31.260
It combined religious hostility to the reformation and a desire to defend the

545
00:31:31.631 --> 00:31:32.464
monasteries,

546
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:37.570
which had been ordered to be dissolved with a variety of other grievances.

547
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:42.600
And in particular agrarian grievances against the enclosing of Commons and the

548
00:31:42.731 --> 00:31:46.360
forcing up of entry fines to land.

549
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:52.230
It was described by those who took part in it as a pilgrimage of grace for the

550
00:31:52.481 --> 00:31:53.314
Commonwealth,

551
00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.450
for the Commonwealth as a whole.

552
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:59.020
And those who mustard for the pilgrimage.

553
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.460
Some 20,000 men,

554
00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:01.570
um,

555
00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:05.410
regarded themselves as defending each branch of the Commonwealth.

556
00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.740
They wanted the king to turn away from his evil counselors.

557
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:12.850
They wanted the ancient rites as an ability to be properly recognized.

558
00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:16.390
They wanted the rights of the church to be respected.

559
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:20.080
And as they put in one of their statements of grievances,

560
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:25.230
they also demanded that the commonalty be used as they should be.

561
00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:30.220
The commonalty be used as they should be,

562
00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.370
particularly in matters relating to the land.

563
00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:35.980
So this was a complex event.

564
00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.120
It led to the rebel army eventually mustering near Pontefract in South

565
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:41.121
Yorkshire,

566
00:32:41.121 --> 00:32:46.121
having taken the city of York where it faced a standoff with royal troops under

567
00:32:46.851 --> 00:32:48.260
the Duke of Norfolk.

568
00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:51.200
The Duke negotiated with the rebels,

569
00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:56.890
persuaded those gentlemen who had joined them in particular to act as our

570
00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:02.010
negotiators with the crown promise that their grievances would be met and

571
00:33:02.661 --> 00:33:04.430
persuaded them to disperse.

572
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:08.570
The rebels were wrong to trust.

573
00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:09.763
Um,

574
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:10.633
Norfolk,

575
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.450
he was already writing to the crown that he regarded no promises made to a rebel

576
00:33:14.451 --> 00:33:15.284
as binding.

577
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.120
And when the crown got the opportunity with the flurry of a few more agrarian

578
00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.410
troubles in the northwest,

579
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.300
at the beginning of the following year,

580
00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.740
royal troops went in and suppress them with considerable violence.

581
00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:35.150
Robert ask the leader of the rebels who was a lawyer from York,

582
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:36.403
um,

583
00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.630
along with a number of other figures,

584
00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:39.800
was arrested,

585
00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.710
tried and executed for treason.

586
00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:45.590
That was the pilgrimage of grace.

587
00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.610
Probably the biggest threat that the tutor Monica ever faced.

588
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:56.050
Then in 1549 came another widespread burst of unrest known as the camping time

589
00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:05.290
because many tenants from particular areas we're gathering together in protest

590
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:07.580
and forming camps.

591
00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:08.570
Uh,

592
00:34:08.570 --> 00:34:12.110
these were scattered all over central eastern and southern England.

593
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.150
Many of these camps where ultimately dispersed,

594
00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.090
um,

595
00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:19.670
the Earl of Arundel in Sussex for example,

596
00:34:19.671 --> 00:34:22.460
down towards the south coast met the,

597
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:22.910
um,

598
00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:27.910
protesting peasants assured them that he would speak for them on their behalf

599
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:31.970
and persuaded them to disperse.

600
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:34.220
This was the way that it could sometimes be handled.

601
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.113
And Aaron [inaudible],

602
00:34:35.130 --> 00:34:35.591
Aaron dealt,

603
00:34:35.591 --> 00:34:36.424
kept his word.

604
00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.393
He did speak for them,

605
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.850
but one particular rising did not disperse.

606
00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:43.300
And that was the one in the county of Norfolk,

607
00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:44.930
led by Robert Cat,

608
00:34:45.410 --> 00:34:46.490
a yeoman farmer,

609
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:48.531
cats,

610
00:34:48.531 --> 00:34:49.220
rebels,

611
00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:52.490
advanced to set up a camp just outside knowledge.

612
00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:53.600
Um,

613
00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:58.160
on most hold heath outside knowledge where cats who was very well organized,

614
00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:00.280
had a supply system to keep the,

615
00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:00.651
the,

616
00:35:00.651 --> 00:35:01.400
the uh,

617
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.570
to keep his army as it was.

618
00:35:02.571 --> 00:35:05.000
By then a well supplied a,

619
00:35:05.001 --> 00:35:07.100
he sat under an oak tree on the heath,

620
00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.020
which was known as the OIC of reformation.

621
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:10.700
And there with his counsel,

622
00:35:10.701 --> 00:35:11.900
he delivered justice,

623
00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:12.290
uh,

624
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:16.070
to the local farm tenants against their gentlemen,

625
00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:17.240
landlords,

626
00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:22.640
the principal grievances of the Norfolk rising where agrarian,

627
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:27.560
they were protesting against enhanced rents and against the abuses of common

628
00:35:27.561 --> 00:35:29.780
land by their landlords.

629
00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:35.990
And their also remarkable in the cat's rebels refused to disperse.

630
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:39.420
Eventually a royal army was sent against them.

631
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:44.040
It consisted mostly of mercenaries who had been hired from Germany and Italy.

632
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.450
Um,

633
00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:47.430
they didn't dare use English troops for fear.

634
00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:49.380
They would sympathize with the rebels.

635
00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:54.760
A cat's army refused to disperse and went down fighting in a battle at Dustin

636
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:57.300
Dale just outside the city of knowledge.

637
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:04.070
It's been said of these peasant rebels that they were trying to create a world

638
00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:09.420
in which gentleman were kept at arm's length.

639
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:14.460
They were trying to preserve the rights that they had in the land,

640
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:17.010
in a changing economic climate,

641
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:21.600
which threatened to diminish them trying to create a world in which gentlemen

642
00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:24.180
were kept at arm's length and their statements of grievances.

643
00:36:24.181 --> 00:36:27.570
And demands make very interesting reading.

644
00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:28.141
Uh,

645
00:36:28.141 --> 00:36:29.970
there's a rich literature on these rebellions.

646
00:36:29.971 --> 00:36:31.740
If anyone's interested in that for an essay topic,

647
00:36:31.741 --> 00:36:33.990
I'd be happy to advise you.

648
00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:41.020
So in seeking to restore what was essentially an idealized vision of stable

649
00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.600
social relationships,

650
00:36:45.601 --> 00:36:47.340
the just Commonwealth,

651
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:52.020
an ideal which they located in a past golden age,

652
00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:57.660
both the peasant rebels and the literary Commonwealth men,

653
00:36:57.661 --> 00:37:00.870
the preachers and clergy had a great deal in common.

654
00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.880
And together they give perhaps the most vivid expression,

655
00:37:05.881 --> 00:37:10.881
literary expression and practical expression to the sense that many people had

656
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.880
in the mid 16th century that the bonds of society,

657
00:37:14.881 --> 00:37:18.180
the bonds of Commonwealth were fraying and falling apart.

658
00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:25.320
But neither the Commonwealth's men in their books and sermons nor the peasant

659
00:37:25.321 --> 00:37:28.380
grapples could turn back the dynamic of change,

660
00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:34.010
moral exhortation or localized protest by people who couldn't face a royal army.

661
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.990
Effectively,

662
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:38.310
we're not enough.

663
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:42.090
And both were swept aside after 1549.

664
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:48.200
It's one of the nice ironies of history that the place outside Norridge now in

665
00:37:48.631 --> 00:37:49.464
the suburbs,

666
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:50.220
uh,

667
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:52.920
where cats rebels were finally defeated,

668
00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:53.910
very bloodily,

669
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.870
many were slotted.

670
00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.113
Um,

671
00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:56.551
uh,

672
00:37:56.551 --> 00:37:59.430
Dustin Dale is now the site of a shopping mall.

673
00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:06.320
So the English peasant who made their last stand there and it's now a shopping

674
00:38:06.481 --> 00:38:06.791
mall.

675
00:38:06.791 --> 00:38:08.880
There's sort of shrine to modern consumerism.

676
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.290
Um,

677
00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:12.000
amongst the murals are decorated.

678
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:15.330
There's one of Robert Cat sitting under the tree of reformation,

679
00:38:15.331 --> 00:38:19.530
which I hope schoolchildren in Norridge will or recognize as they go about their

680
00:38:19.531 --> 00:38:20.364
shopping,

681
00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:24.900
but it wasn't all repression.

682
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.000
There's another side to the story.

683
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:32.460
By 1549 some people in positions of authority in the kingdom.

684
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:35.290
We're equally concerned about all of this

685
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:40.390
and they were trying to come to grips with changing an alternative way.

686
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:46.800
A striking piece of evidence of this is a wonderful composition written for

687
00:38:46.811 --> 00:38:51.811
circulation in manuscript in 1549 by Sir Thomas Smith and entitled the discourse

688
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:55.330
of the Commonweal of England.

689
00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:57.430
It's a remarkable piece of writing.

690
00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:02.140
It wasn't published until after Smith's death and at one time it was actually

691
00:39:02.141 --> 00:39:03.460
attributed to William Shakespeare,

692
00:39:03.461 --> 00:39:07.000
but it's now pretty certain that it was written by Sir Thomas Smith.

693
00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:11.950
He was professor of civil law at the University of Cambridge and a leading

694
00:39:11.951 --> 00:39:16.951
member later in his career of the Royal Privy Council under Edward the sixth and

695
00:39:16.961 --> 00:39:18.250
subsequently under Elizabeth.

696
00:39:18.251 --> 00:39:19.084
The first

697
00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:24.880
Smith was trying to think out the problems of his day,

698
00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:29.530
not to denounce the moral failings of particular individuals or groups,

699
00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:32.770
but to try to understand what was going on,

700
00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:37.270
to try to understand the motives and the pressures that were felt by different

701
00:39:37.271 --> 00:39:38.530
people in society.

702
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.770
And he did that by having a discussion.

703
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:46.210
He wrote a dialogue between a gentleman husbandman,

704
00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.193
a peasant,

705
00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:48.550
a craftsman,

706
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:49.510
a wage worker,

707
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:54.870
and I figure called the doctor who was a sort of academic figure who acts as a

708
00:39:54.971 --> 00:39:57.400
kind of moderator for this discussion.

709
00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:01.690
He imagines them all sitting outside a pub discussing the affairs of the

710
00:40:01.691 --> 00:40:02.524
Commonwealth.

711
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:05.650
It's because it was dialogue form that it was once attributed to Shakespeare.

712
00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:11.530
The representatives of the different groups in the discourse of the common wheel

713
00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.450
put their own perspectives,

714
00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:14.770
their own grievances,

715
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.680
the different voices of different interest groups are heard.

716
00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.350
The doctor who acts as moderator,

717
00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:22.540
provides a kind of disinterested,

718
00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.960
analytical authority helping to explore the underlying causes to propose

719
00:40:28.781 --> 00:40:32.350
solutions to think of ways that the interests of different groups might be

720
00:40:32.351 --> 00:40:33.184
reconciled.

721
00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:35.500
So for example,

722
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:40.860
when the view is put by the gentlemen that all men are free to make their most

723
00:40:40.931 --> 00:40:41.860
advantage of that,

724
00:40:41.861 --> 00:40:42.730
which is their own,

725
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.490
the phrase or close to the phrase,

726
00:40:45.491 --> 00:40:49.900
which was always being denounced by the Commonwealth men Smith has the doctor

727
00:40:49.901 --> 00:40:53.110
reply not by denouncing covetousness,

728
00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:56.200
but by saying yes they may,

729
00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:02.100
but they may not use their own to the damage of the common Commonweal.

730
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:08.230
Good Lord should set limits to the pursuit of individual economic interest.

731
00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:10.301
In short,

732
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:15.280
then he's willing to accept the simple reality of self interested behavior,

733
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:21.390
but he seeks to prevent abuses or to channel that behavior in ways that it might

734
00:41:21.731 --> 00:41:25.570
serve the common interest through the encouragement of enterprise.

735
00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:31.090
It's because of that kind of attitude that Smith has been described as the

736
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:35.720
father of political economy and does some justice in that,

737
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:39.650
but essentially putting him in his own time.

738
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:43.160
He was in the classical humanist tradition.

739
00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:49.640
He had great faith in the positive effects of good government as a means of

740
00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:54.050
harmonizing conflicting interests and that's what he's trying essentially to

741
00:41:54.051 --> 00:41:54.884
achieve.

742
00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:57.291
Well.

743
00:41:57.291 --> 00:42:02.291
So Thomas Smith wasn't alone and he had considerable influence upon likeminded

744
00:42:02.901 --> 00:42:07.901
statesman under Edward the sixth and still more in the early years of Elizabeth.

745
00:42:08.631 --> 00:42:11.480
The first he sat himself in Elizabeth's council,

746
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:15.350
he was responsible for drafting some of the early legislation of her

747
00:42:15.351 --> 00:42:16.160
parliaments.

748
00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:19.070
He was a very close friend of her chief advisor,

749
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.330
so William sessile

750
00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:27.220
and it led this kind of attitude among Smith and others to a kind of dual

751
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:33.460
strategy on the part of government which has gradually emerging in the mid 16th

752
00:42:33.741 --> 00:42:34.370
century.

753
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:36.770
On the one hand they want to stabilize things,

754
00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.630
they want to dampen things down,

755
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:42.350
they want to remit the fraying fabric of the Commonwealth.

756
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:44.000
On the other hand,

757
00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:48.950
they were very aware of the need to pursue where possible orderly economic

758
00:42:48.951 --> 00:42:49.784
growth

759
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:56.170
and this is used in a number of statutes which are listed in the last part of

760
00:42:56.271 --> 00:42:58.370
your handout and which I'll just briefly mention,

761
00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.630
which were intended to be steps towards these ends.

762
00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:08.260
In 1551 the coinage was revalued and reissued in an attempt to curb the worst

763
00:43:11.931 --> 00:43:13.580
excesses of inflation.

764
00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:19.540
In 1552 legislation was passed against abuses in marketing again with a view to

765
00:43:21.650 --> 00:43:23.930
the problems occasioned by the price rise.

766
00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:29.030
In the 1550s the royal courts were made more open to hear the grievances of the

767
00:43:29.031 --> 00:43:29.864
peasantry,

768
00:43:30.350 --> 00:43:34.160
some of whom had not previously been able to plead in royal courts.

769
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:37.880
In 1563 we're now under the reign of Elizabeth.

770
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:43.180
The statute of artifices was past the longest single act of parliament passed in

771
00:43:43.431 --> 00:43:45.560
England before the 20th century,

772
00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:49.760
which went into great detail in attempts to regulate relationships between

773
00:43:49.761 --> 00:43:54.410
employers and employees to lay down rules to introduce,

774
00:43:54.411 --> 00:43:55.244
for example,

775
00:43:55.460 --> 00:44:00.460
annual assessments of wages so that wages could be adjusted in line with prices.

776
00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:07.690
In 1563 legislation was passed to restrict not all forms of enclosure,

777
00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:10.160
but those forms of enclosure,

778
00:44:10.161 --> 00:44:11.570
which were thought to be harmful.

779
00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:14.690
If enclosure was beneficial,

780
00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:15.680
it would be permitted.

781
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.870
And in addition,

782
00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:21.440
they introduced on the model of experiments which had been attempted in a number

783
00:44:21.441 --> 00:44:22.310
of towns,

784
00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.890
forms of relief for the impotent poor,

785
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.380
a constructive system of poor relief,

786
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:35.550
which was to operate at the level of the parish involving the raising of money

787
00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:39.030
from local taxation of those who could afford it,

788
00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:43.050
the poor rate and the dispersal of that money to the impotent pool.

789
00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:45.533
Finally,

790
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:50.540
efforts were made to encourage economically enterprising people who brought

791
00:44:50.941 --> 00:44:52.470
projects to the government,

792
00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:55.050
establishment of new trade routes,

793
00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:57.450
the encouragement of shipping and fishing,

794
00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.380
the establishment of new manufacturing industries,

795
00:45:01.381 --> 00:45:04.830
which might be granted a royal patrons giving them a monopoly until they were

796
00:45:04.831 --> 00:45:05.530
established.

797
00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:07.020
So the origins and the patent system,

798
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:09.750
the encouragement of immigration,

799
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.170
of skilled Protestant refugees from abroad,

800
00:45:13.171 --> 00:45:17.220
especially from the Netherlands where the religious wars were raging.

801
00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.340
So one mustn't exaggerate the impact of all of this.

802
00:45:23.341 --> 00:45:24.840
This is a 16th century.

803
00:45:24.841 --> 00:45:26.850
Their powers of enforcement,

804
00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:27.893
we're limited,

805
00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:33.170
but efforts were being made very visible efforts to do something about the

806
00:45:33.901 --> 00:45:34.734
situation.

807
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:39.920
And that marked a significant step forward in the conception of the

808
00:45:40.351 --> 00:45:42.930
responsibilities of the tutors state,

809
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:48.620
a broadening of its role and increasing presence in attempting to shape to

810
00:45:51.601 --> 00:45:55.680
channel the economic and social developments of the time to develop policy,

811
00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.980
to deal with the problems that they produced.

812
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:04.050
And that helped shape the environment of change as people gradually moved from

813
00:46:04.051 --> 00:46:08.880
the first shocks of response to these changing features of the economic and

814
00:46:08.881 --> 00:46:13.881
social environment and began to enter a period of transition in the late 16th

815
00:46:14.821 --> 00:46:17.910
century towards a more thoroughly commercial economy,

816
00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:20.310
which is something I'll touch on later.

817
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.951
But for now,

818
00:46:22.951 --> 00:46:24.300
we need to turn back again.

819
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:27.990
Having looked at what was happening in the mid 16th century outside the

820
00:46:27.991 --> 00:46:32.991
religious sphere to the issues of the reformation and the settlement,

821
00:46:33.450 --> 00:46:38.450
which was attempted with the succession in 1558 of Elizabeth,

822
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:40.740
and we'll take that up on Tuesday.
