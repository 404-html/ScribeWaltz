1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:01.681
Right?

2
00:00:01.681 --> 00:00:01.921
Well,

3
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:02.091
the,

4
00:00:02.091 --> 00:00:04.060
the glorious revolution of 60,

5
00:00:04.061 --> 00:00:05.570
98 so-called,

6
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:06.600
um,

7
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.430
which I described last time began as a relatively bloodless coup,

8
00:00:11.431 --> 00:00:16.431
but it did go on to usher in some pretty massive changes in the structure of

9
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:20.460
government and also in Britain standing in the world.

10
00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.420
Um,

11
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.100
in the 20 years after the revolution,

12
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.520
Britain began to emerge as one of Europe's great powers.

13
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.750
And we look at that in the final full lecture,

14
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.170
uh,

15
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.190
after the break.

16
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.940
But part of understanding that change requires us to understand how Britain was

17
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:44.400
able to sustain that kind of role after 60 and 88.

18
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.060
And that brings us back to the economy,

19
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.930
especially in the late 17th and dirty 18th centuries.

20
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.080
So you have your lovingly handcrafted handout,

21
00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.590
he sort of artists and hand out,

22
00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.700
uh,

23
00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.241
and,

24
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:00.601
uh,

25
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:03.690
that contains the basic facts and they'll take you through it.

26
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.620
Um,

27
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.290
I wasn't noticed whenever I announced there's going to be electron economic

28
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:12.291
history that seems to have the same effect as the great plague of 1666 on our

29
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:13.524
numbers,

30
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.011
but,

31
00:01:14.011 --> 00:01:14.670
uh,

32
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.000
it,

33
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.833
it matters.

34
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.063
Okay.

35
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.851
Right.

36
00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:18.001
Well,

37
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:19.140
a few weeks ago,

38
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.010
um,

39
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.010
I left the narrative of economic and social change at the point in the mid 17th

40
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:31.011
century when population and prices began to stabilize after over a century of

41
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:32.064
growth.

42
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.330
Um,

43
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.051
but as I said,

44
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:38.520
then the dynamic of change that had been unleashed in the latest 16th and dirty

45
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:40.950
17th centuries didn't stop.

46
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.881
Rather,

47
00:01:41.881 --> 00:01:46.881
it continued in a changing and increasingly favorable climate.

48
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.290
And central to that new context was the relative stability of population and

49
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:58.290
prices in 1641,

50
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.900
as you'll see on table one of your handout,

51
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.230
the population was just over 5 million and it remained at approximately that

52
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.800
level for many decades to come.

53
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.491
In fact,

54
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:16.491
in some parts of the late 17th century population growth rates for particular

55
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.130
decades where in fact negative in 1,701 and the population was still just over 5

56
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.740
million and it was only about five and a half million by the mid 18th century.

57
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.640
Renewed growth didn't start until the late 18th century.

58
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:31.130
Well,

59
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.780
the reasons for this relative stability,

60
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.973
um,

61
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.300
seem fairly clear in the light of research by demographic historians.

62
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.770
Um,

63
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.770
as table two indicates fertility as measured by the gross rate of reproduction

64
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.880
reached it's Nadiia in the third quarter of the 17th century.

65
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.940
And thereafter from about the sixties and seventies,

66
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.200
it began to recover a little but very,

67
00:02:59.201 --> 00:03:00.070
very slowly.

68
00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.700
And it didn't reach it 16th century levels again until after 1760.

69
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.520
Any potential that there might have been for renewed growth was choked off by

70
00:03:14.981 --> 00:03:16.330
two further factors.

71
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.980
First of all,

72
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.130
the late 17th century saw a decline in life expectation at birth.

73
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.630
It was as low as 33 on average by the end of the 17th century.

74
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.160
It's a paradox that mortality was so bad in a period which actually saw the

75
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:39.910
final disappearance of plague from Britain.

76
00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.940
The outbreak in London in 1665 to six was the last great outbreak,

77
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.110
but the absence of that kind of crisis mortality didn't prevent generally high

78
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:54.760
levels of what the demographers referred to as background mortality from

79
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:56.110
infectious diseases.

80
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.950
One of the Mary Dobson has shown that high levels of mortality were particularly

81
00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:08.281
associated with urban centers with low lying areas,

82
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.000
with poor water supplies,

83
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.860
with the growing industrial areas of the kingdom and with the areas along

84
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:16.870
significant trade routes.

85
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.510
And her suggestion is that these facts are the outcome of in the first place,

86
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:27.511
dense concentrations of population in the cities and also those areas which shed

87
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:34.471
that density in the countryside and which were linked by communications,

88
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:39.970
which made the transmission of infectious diseases that much easier and more

89
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:44.560
closely interconnected society was one in which disease transmission could take

90
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:46.360
place more effectively.

91
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.800
So mortality was pretty bad in the late 17th century.

92
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.090
And secondly,

93
00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.090
a further factor was migration.

94
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.450
That was partly overseas migration.

95
00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.050
Uh,

96
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.090
between 1650 and 60,

97
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:02.050
99,

98
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.380
almost a quarter of a million migrants left England for overseas destinations,

99
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.850
mostly to the Americas,

100
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.160
mostly going either to the West indies or to the southern colonies of mainland

101
00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:17.770
America as indentured servants.

102
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.670
And the second part of the migration factor was internal migration,

103
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.270
internal movement of people to the rather unhealthy urban centers and industrial

104
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:33.364
centers.

105
00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.120
The high death rates in those places did much to wipe out the surplus births of

106
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:45.451
healthier areas as people moved into less healthy urban or industrial centers.

107
00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.760
So population stability for almost a century.

108
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.040
The Century after 1650 also saw a new era in price trends and they're

109
00:05:58.041 --> 00:06:01.670
represented on section three of your handout.

110
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.680
As you'll see from that,

111
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:08.000
the index shows that the prices of wheat and barley,

112
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.500
the principal bread corns,

113
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.740
we're actually falling from the 1650s through to about the 16th eighties and

114
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:20.051
then after a few bad harvests in the 60 nineties they fluctuated at about 20%

115
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.280
below the level they had been in the mid 17th century.

116
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.501
In contrast,

117
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:29.990
the prices of meats remained fairly stable,

118
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.400
even rose modestly.

119
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.360
The impact of this falling prices for bread,

120
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:35.691
corn,

121
00:06:35.691 --> 00:06:40.010
stable prices for meat on the standards of the common people was quite

122
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:40.844
considerable.

123
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.730
The actual wage rates that people were being paid didn't change a great deal in

124
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:48.020
the late 17th century,

125
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.160
but people,

126
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.210
real wages,

127
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:55.360
the purchasing power of their wages increased quite substantially for the first

128
00:06:55.821 --> 00:06:58.310
time in over a century.

129
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.050
So the evidence suggested by the 1680s real wages,

130
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:08.051
the purchasing power of wages were up by about 50% over the levels of the 16th

131
00:07:08.781 --> 00:07:09.614
thirties

132
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.890
for people who could find regular work,

133
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.050
the costs of feeding their families were falling and that released some

134
00:07:18.051 --> 00:07:22.790
purchasing power for goods over and above those that they needed for basic

135
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.720
subsistence.

136
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.800
So then population stabilization,

137
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.270
declining prices of basic agricultural products,

138
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.010
growing real wages for craftsman and wage laborers.

139
00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.220
And to understand the outcome of these trends,

140
00:07:40.221 --> 00:07:44.120
we have to remember that all of this has happening in what was already a more

141
00:07:44.121 --> 00:07:49.121
commercialized economy in which the livelihoods of most people were increasingly

142
00:07:49.401 --> 00:07:54.401
dependent on the markets for their products and their labor in a more integrated

143
00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:56.923
economy.

144
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.060
And the outcome of all of this was a further development in the processes of

145
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:03.350
economic growth,

146
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.600
which had been set in motion earlier.

147
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:12.070
One can sum it all up as being a process of increased regional economic

148
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:13.460
specialization,

149
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:18.170
intensified national economic integration,

150
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.950
and also increasing participation in a nascent world economy.

151
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:27.950
That sounds very grand,

152
00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:32.510
but we can follow through with the processes step by step as to how all of this

153
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.560
fit together

154
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:37.880
in agriculture.

155
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:42.290
The key to change was basically the fact that although markets for different

156
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:45.290
products had stabilized somewhat and reoriented,

157
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:49.640
they didn't actually decline the population stabilized,

158
00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:50.540
but it didn't decline.

159
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:55.540
There was still a large market for agricultural produce and that placed general

160
00:08:56.581 --> 00:09:01.581
pressure on commercial farmers to try to keep up their market share by reducing

161
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:07.641
their unit costs and competing with other farmers to produce more and more

162
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:10.860
effectively at prices,

163
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:13.650
which would enable their profit margins to remain reasonable.

164
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.080
And that meant a renewed emphasis on agricultural improvement.

165
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.701
Basically,

166
00:09:20.701 --> 00:09:25.530
one can say that the late 17th century saw a more general spread of many of the

167
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:27.660
innovations in agricultural techniques,

168
00:09:27.661 --> 00:09:31.830
which I described coming in in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

169
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:36.090
It's been said by one agricultural historian that many of the novel techniques

170
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.510
of a century earlier had become general practice,

171
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.960
general best practice by the early 18th century.

172
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:50.150
All of that involved and was part in parcel of a general regional reorientation

173
00:09:50.851 --> 00:09:51.960
in land use.

174
00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:52.620
Uh,

175
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:56.700
increasingly the east and the southeast of the country,

176
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.880
we're predominantly Arabelle that was the best price area for cereals.

177
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:02.910
Um,

178
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.590
it had major markets in London and the towns of the southeast and also markets

179
00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:09.120
in nearby continental Europe.

180
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:11.310
But elsewhere in the kingdom,

181
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:16.050
livestock husbandry became more prevalent in the north and in the west.

182
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.270
They'd always had a bias towards livestock.

183
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.310
It became more marked.

184
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:21.480
Um,

185
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.440
one mustn't exaggerate all this into complete regional homogeneity,

186
00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:29.490
but there's a definite trend towards specialization of that kind within

187
00:10:29.491 --> 00:10:31.980
particular agricultural countries.

188
00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:38.320
And that made easier the diffusion and adoption of innovations by example.

189
00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:41.190
People saw what their neighbors were doing.

190
00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.410
There's an excellent accountable of this by,

191
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:43.860
uh,

192
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.750
one of the writers of the late 17th century,

193
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:46.620
John Aubrey,

194
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.410
who describes what was happening in his home,

195
00:10:49.411 --> 00:10:54.360
county of wheelchair down in the southwest to the southwest of Oxford and in

196
00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:57.720
wheelchair or be describes how various innovations were brought in.

197
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.830
He names names,

198
00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.990
who was the first to do this or to do that.

199
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.460
And he describes how their neighbors copied them when they saw the particular

200
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:08.190
innovations were successful and profitable.

201
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.471
Overall,

202
00:11:10.471 --> 00:11:13.290
the whole process greatly raised agricultural output.

203
00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.850
It's been estimated that the cereal's yield in eastern and southeastern England

204
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:22.851
was up by about 40% between 1650 and 1750 and in dry environment.

205
00:11:25.441 --> 00:11:30.441
Then of rising agricultural productivity induced by a more competitive

206
00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:32.760
commercial climate.

207
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:36.181
Well,

208
00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:41.181
that agricultural specialization facilitated and wasn't in turn encouraged by

209
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:48.300
the continued growth of the urban population and the continued growth of the

210
00:11:48.301 --> 00:11:52.710
population in the non agricultural rural areas,

211
00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:57.520
the rural areas where many people were employed in various kinds of industry

212
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:04.350
and in turn growing agricultural productivity released labor for nonagricultural

213
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.200
occupations and enhanced the purchasing power of those who live by wages in such

214
00:12:10.511 --> 00:12:11.344
occupations.

215
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:18.630
One of the most striking features of the late 17th and 18th centuries is that

216
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:23.700
although population as a whole stabilized the population of the towns and the

217
00:12:25.001 --> 00:12:29.290
population of the rural industrial areas continued to grow.

218
00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.830
Both absolutely and relatively.

219
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:38.670
There was a regional redistribution of population table for a shows,

220
00:12:39.641 --> 00:12:43.210
the figures which have been calculated for this by EA Wrigley.

221
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.900
As you'll see if you look at for a rural agricultural population declined from

222
00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:54.751
just over 60% in the sixties and seventies to about 46% by the 1750s those

223
00:12:57.881 --> 00:13:02.881
living in towns of more than 5,000 rows from just over 13% to about 21% of the

224
00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:09.421
national population and those living in rural ag non agricultural areas rose for

225
00:13:10.001 --> 00:13:14.290
about 26 to about 33% over the same period.

226
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:21.810
Now a good deal of that urban growth was of course as you would expect

227
00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:25.510
occasioned by London as usual.

228
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:31.680
By 1700 London had a population of 575,000 and was the biggest city in Europe.

229
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:40.800
By 1750 its population had reached 675,000 so London continued to grow in

230
00:13:43.361 --> 00:13:44.560
absolute terms,

231
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.720
but in fact its share of the national population had somewhat stabilized at

232
00:13:49.721 --> 00:13:50.740
about 11%

233
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:56.710
what seems to have been happening that was that a great deal of the urban growth

234
00:13:56.711 --> 00:14:00.610
of this period was going on in other towns as well.

235
00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.980
So for example,

236
00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.280
in 1600 England had had 20 towns with a population of more than 5,000

237
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.480
by 1670 it had 26 by 1700 it had 32

238
00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:23.730
provincial cities have more than 5,000 inhabitants were making up an increasing

239
00:14:24.641 --> 00:14:29.641
proportion of the national population by 1700 probably something like five and a

240
00:14:29.711 --> 00:14:30.640
half percent.

241
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.510
By 1750 it was closer to 10%

242
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:42.210
all of this amounted to a kind of re articulation going on within the hierarchy

243
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.080
of towns and cities.

244
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.700
Obviously London remained at the top on challengingly,

245
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.480
but some historic regional centers was stabilizing or growing only very slowly.

246
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:56.330
The Old City of York,

247
00:14:56.331 --> 00:15:00.830
for example with remained stable at about 12,000 population through most of this

248
00:15:00.831 --> 00:15:01.664
period.

249
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.410
The real growth was going on in different kinds of towns.

250
00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:09.020
It was going on above all imports,

251
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.140
especially the port of the West.

252
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.470
If you look at table four B Bristol,

253
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.750
the principal port of the west of England grows from about 20,000 population in

254
00:15:20.751 --> 00:15:25.751
1670 to 50,000 by 1750 Liverpool which was emerging from having been a small

255
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:29.930
market town in the early 17th century,

256
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:35.140
grew from about 5,000 people in 1672 about 22,000 in 1750

257
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.360
the other kinds of towns which were growing disproportionately seemed to have

258
00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:42.950
been industrial centers.

259
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.670
Newcastle in the northeast based on the coal trade,

260
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:51.320
grew from 12,000 to 29,000 in the period covered by our table.

261
00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.680
Leeds center of the woods did manufacturers in the cloth industry from 6,000 to

262
00:15:56.811 --> 00:16:01.811
16,000 Birmingham Center of metalworking from 6,000 to 24,000

263
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:09.223
<v 1>yeah.</v>

264
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:14.970
<v 0>This shift was especially pronounced at the turn of the 18th century.</v>

265
00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:19.890
It's been shown that in the early decades of the 18th century,

266
00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:25.490
whereas his what had been described as 10 historic centers,

267
00:16:25.771 --> 00:16:27.510
old cathedral cities and so forth,

268
00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:32.780
grew in population by only 18% a sample of eight ports shows 58% growth and a

269
00:16:34.501 --> 00:16:36.720
sample of new manufacturing towns.

270
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.480
159% growth.

271
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.850
So the urban system was becoming more polycentric.

272
00:16:44.851 --> 00:16:48.000
It had more major centers than it had done.

273
00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.510
And as would be apparent from what I've already said,

274
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:54.660
the dynamic of growth was in commerce,

275
00:16:55.140 --> 00:17:00.140
in trade and in industry taking off in the late 17th century and accelerating in

276
00:17:02.641 --> 00:17:04.200
the early 18th century.

277
00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:05.333
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

278
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:11.450
<v 0>So let's turn to what was going on there to commerce about what you've already</v>

279
00:17:11.451 --> 00:17:11.990
read.

280
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.823
The little,

281
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:15.180
<v 1>okay.</v>

282
00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.540
<v 0>In the 1960s as a result of the work of Ralph Davis,</v>

283
00:17:18.541 --> 00:17:23.250
who was the first economic historian to really map the trends in trade in this

284
00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:24.084
period,

285
00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.570
people began to talk of the late 17th century as a period of commercial

286
00:17:27.571 --> 00:17:28.404
revolution,

287
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.690
which is a description which,

288
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.250
which has some,

289
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:32.491
uh,

290
00:17:32.491 --> 00:17:33.360
justice to it.

291
00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:39.590
The focus in Davis's work was on the major growth of extra European trade,

292
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.950
especially with the Americas and with the east.

293
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.090
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

294
00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:46.570
<v 0>Now,</v>

295
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:47.800
in considering this,

296
00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.740
it's important always to remember that the well established trades with European

297
00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:56.130
countries continued and indeed in many ways they grew.

298
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:02.000
But the overall pattern of overseas trade was undoubtedly shifting as

299
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:07.740
initiatives which had been pioneered by enterprising people in the early 17th

300
00:18:07.741 --> 00:18:09.420
century began to pay off,

301
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.930
became consolidated and extended,

302
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:19.470
and there are four major aspects of this change which are illustrated in

303
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:20.304
different ways.

304
00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:25.410
On the second side of your handout and these fingers dealing with overseas

305
00:18:25.411 --> 00:18:26.244
trade,

306
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:32.630
the first can be illustrated if we look at London's domestic exports in section

307
00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.000
a of that table.

308
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:42.060
As it shows in 1640 on the eve of the civil war,

309
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:45.390
London's exports were still dominated by woolen cloth.

310
00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:49.350
Some 92% of exports were woolen cloth.

311
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:55.190
By the latest 1660s though that was down to 74% and by 1700 it was down to 72%

312
00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:02.640
now that change took place not because woolen exports were actually declining,

313
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.080
but because of the rise of other kinds of domestic exports,

314
00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.740
greater exports of food stuffs and of raw materials,

315
00:19:13.770 --> 00:19:15.270
agricultural products,

316
00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.060
fish lead tin,

317
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:22.740
Cole animal hides that had together all of that together.

318
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.870
It made up only 5% of London's exports.

319
00:19:24.871 --> 00:19:29.871
In 1640 it was over 12% by 1700 and then the export from London of other

320
00:19:32.941 --> 00:19:34.410
domestic manufacturers,

321
00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:40.010
2.6% of London's exports in 1640 just over 15% by 1700 so the reorientation in

322
00:19:43.561 --> 00:19:46.410
the export trade in domestic products.

323
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.953
Secondly,

324
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:51.420
if we look at London's imports,

325
00:19:51.421 --> 00:19:54.390
which is section B of the table,

326
00:19:55.830 --> 00:20:00.830
that brings out the continued growth in the value of imports from established

327
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.090
European trading partners,

328
00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:11.540
wines from southern Europe as you'll see growing dramatically in the value of

329
00:20:12.241 --> 00:20:17.241
these imports between the 1630s and the 60 nineties silks,

330
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:18.570
again,

331
00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.740
often from France or southern Europe rising quite significantly.

332
00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:26.400
Iron and steel imports mostly from Scandinavia,

333
00:20:26.401 --> 00:20:27.690
from Sweden in particular,

334
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:32.930
rising dramatically from 16,000 to 118,000 pounds value.

335
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:39.470
So considerable growth in the imports from these European trading partners,

336
00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:45.770
but that was dwarfed by the importer to are coming in from the East and the

337
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.333
Americas.

338
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.450
Those imports,

339
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.680
we're increasingly becoming predominant in London's import trade,

340
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:59.250
so we have continued growth in such commodities as pepper and tobacco,

341
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.560
but massive growth in the import of Calico's.

342
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:10.590
That's cheap cotton cloth from India and sugar from the West indies almost.

343
00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:12.141
Well,

344
00:21:12.141 --> 00:21:16.690
a five fold increase in the value of the sugar imported from the West indies in

345
00:21:16.691 --> 00:21:18.100
the later 17th century.

346
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:21.783
Thirdly,

347
00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.230
a great deal of these new imported goods.

348
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.610
We're not commute,

349
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.040
we're not consumed domestically,

350
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:34.690
but we're re export it to European markets.

351
00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.040
So for example,

352
00:21:36.041 --> 00:21:41.041
two thirds of the tobacco that was landed in England was reexported to European

353
00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:42.551
markets,

354
00:21:42.551 --> 00:21:43.870
mostly in northern Europe.

355
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:48.190
A third of the sugar that was landed was re-exported to Europe.

356
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:53.290
Nine tenths of the pepper that came in from the east was reexported.

357
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:59.160
You can look at the rising value of those re-exports in table five c we have the

358
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:03.340
value of domestic exports,

359
00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:07.840
the value of imports and the value of re-exports and look how it grows.

360
00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.290
In the course of the late 17th and early 18th centuries,

361
00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.770
what was happening then was a flood of tobacco sugar Calico.

362
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:25.030
Other products coming in from distant overseas origins,

363
00:22:25.570 --> 00:22:30.070
which was then reexported bringing income to the English merchants who

364
00:22:30.071 --> 00:22:31.450
reexported it to Europe.

365
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.280
One of the interesting things about all of these products is that they would,

366
00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:37.210
cheap hogs,

367
00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:39.300
head of tobacco might be expensive in itself,

368
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:44.020
and by the time it was broken down into small parcels or sold by the pipe,

369
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.970
it had a mass market.

370
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.833
It was cheap.

371
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:47.591
Similarly,

372
00:22:47.591 --> 00:22:50.370
sugar sugar might be in the form of a great Sugarloaf,

373
00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:52.420
but by the time something had been chipped off,

374
00:22:52.421 --> 00:22:55.870
it wrapped up and sold in small quantities.

375
00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:56.950
It had a mass market.

376
00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:58.690
Calico cloth was very cheap,

377
00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:01.930
the kind of tip and colorful Indian cotton cloth,

378
00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:03.520
which was still familiar with,

379
00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:06.640
which could be bought by servants,

380
00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:09.670
a mass market for these goods.

381
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.901
And in fact,

382
00:23:10.901 --> 00:23:13.330
the figures that we have here don't tell us the whole story.

383
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.570
It's well known that there was a great deal of smuggling and evading the

384
00:23:16.571 --> 00:23:17.320
customs.

385
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.210
The fingers are based on the customer's records.

386
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:23.590
The reality may have been even greater change than the figures actually

387
00:23:23.591 --> 00:23:24.424
represent,

388
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:26.560
right?

389
00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.160
Well,

390
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:32.160
these new trades were based upon and involved elaborating more complex and

391
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.360
multilateral trading patterns.

392
00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:40.090
The fourth feature of the change in trade,

393
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.300
these are often described as the triangular trades.

394
00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:44.890
So for example,

395
00:23:44.891 --> 00:23:49.891
you would get vessels leaving the western ports of Britain for the fisheries and

396
00:23:50.301 --> 00:23:52.280
the North Atlantic around Newfoundland,

397
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:57.230
from which they would bring the dried card to southern Europe where it was in

398
00:23:57.231 --> 00:23:58.160
great demand,

399
00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:01.730
and then they would bring southern European products back to Britain.

400
00:24:01.820 --> 00:24:06.820
A triangle or ships would leave London usually heading for the east indies.

401
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:13.260
They would trade around east indies between the Indian mainland and what's now

402
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.480
Indonesia and then bring products back to Britain.

403
00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.520
The most famous of these triangles,

404
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:19.911
of course,

405
00:24:19.911 --> 00:24:21.800
there's the so called Atlantic triangle,

406
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.410
the export of manufactured products,

407
00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.380
weaponry and liquor to west Africa,

408
00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:32.900
the buying there of slaves to be taken across to the Caribbean and the southern

409
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.460
mainland colonies,

410
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:36.650
the notorious Atlantic triangle

411
00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:43.400
that was of course a ghastly trade with terrible mortality of both the slaves

412
00:24:43.401 --> 00:24:48.230
and indeed the English crews on the middle passage.

413
00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:53.270
But it was vital to the development of the Atlantic economy and contemporary

414
00:24:53.271 --> 00:24:55.730
simply seem to have accepted it as such.

415
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:59.570
Little comment initially on what it involved.

416
00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:02.000
A few voices raised in protest,

417
00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:04.730
so are in itself of course,

418
00:25:04.731 --> 00:25:05.930
was nothing new.

419
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:11.390
What was new was the scale and system systemize systematization of the trade as

420
00:25:11.391 --> 00:25:14.660
it developed in the late 17th and early 18th centuries,

421
00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.470
and if it offered any ray of hope in all of this,

422
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.200
it was simply that as people became more familiar with its realities,

423
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.980
voices began to be raised against it,

424
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.593
but not yet.

425
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.760
This transformation of trade was well established by the 16th eighties and then

426
00:25:36.271 --> 00:25:41.271
it stabilized and continued to grow steadily right through to the mid 18th

427
00:25:41.791 --> 00:25:46.791
century and indeed beyond and all of it was vigorously defended by legislation.

428
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.350
The navigation acts,

429
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:53.880
which made every effort to keep these trades in English hands.

430
00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.310
Certain goods could only be exported to the colonies in English ships.

431
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:04.640
Certain goods could only be landed in England before being reexported to other

432
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.600
destinations.

433
00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:11.780
An effort to keep this new burgeoning trade in the hands of English merchants

434
00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:16.440
and in particular to squeeze out the greatest competitors,

435
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.423
the Dutch.

436
00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:21.330
Okay,

437
00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:25.200
well this expansion of overseas trade created income,

438
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:30.350
obviously it created employment in shipping in the commercial infrastructure of

439
00:26:31.921 --> 00:26:33.240
the growing port cities.

440
00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.870
It was directly linked in that way to urban growth

441
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:39.450
at above all of London.

442
00:26:39.451 --> 00:26:40.284
Of course,

443
00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:44.370
three quarters of English overseas trade still went through half the merchant

444
00:26:44.371 --> 00:26:45.900
fleet was based in London.

445
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:50.580
London was a dominant center for shipbuilding and repairing all the ancillary

446
00:26:50.581 --> 00:26:52.230
crafts of the shipping industry.

447
00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:56.910
It was a center for sugar refining and tobacco processing and many other

448
00:26:56.911 --> 00:26:59.940
manufacturers linked to trade silk for example,

449
00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:04.980
but increasingly the so called outputs the other ports,

450
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:06.810
we're getting a bigger share.

451
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:12.440
London's relative dominance especially in the Atlantic and re-export trades was

452
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:17.631
being whittled down somewhat by 1700 about a third of tobacco imports by value

453
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:24.830
and about a fifth of sugar imports by value came in not through London but

454
00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:30.171
through out ports like Bristol and Liverpool and after the union between England

455
00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.153
and Scotland,

456
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:33.390
the city of Glasgow,

457
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.490
which became the major British center of the tobacco trade as the 18th century

458
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.473
advanced.

459
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:42.280
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

460
00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:47.280
<v 0>The health of trade was also of immense significance to the development of other</v>

461
00:27:47.891 --> 00:27:48.724
industries,

462
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.670
both directly and indirectly.

463
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:58.500
Of course the trade in woolen textiles which remains so important had always

464
00:27:58.541 --> 00:28:01.030
been heavily influenced by overseas markets.

465
00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:03.160
For high quality wool and cloth.

466
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:04.780
That continued to be the case,

467
00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:10.920
but the new trades also established new markets for both traditional and new

468
00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:13.923
goods.

469
00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:18.100
Prominent amongst these markets sort of course the Americas and the growing

470
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.240
colonies there.

471
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:25.470
In 1686 a survey of London's exports that year shows that London was already

472
00:28:26.861 --> 00:28:31.861
exporting 598 different commodities to North America in 329 ships.

473
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.960
If you want to know they were going to Barbados,

474
00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.183
to Jamaica,

475
00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:40.690
to the Chesapeake colonies,

476
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:41.703
to New England.

477
00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:47.370
The total value was prodigious and it involved trade in textiles,

478
00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.460
in clothing,

479
00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:49.840
in metal wares,

480
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:53.320
in miscellaneous manufacturers which were not produced in the colonies

481
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.220
themselves.

482
00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:55.060
For example,

483
00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:58.630
in 1686 they export it to the colonies.

484
00:28:58.631 --> 00:29:00.280
3000 wine glasses.

485
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.340
They exported 6,000 saddles.

486
00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:09.320
These new markets encouraged bulk manufacturer.

487
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.380
They encourage the production of standardized goods,

488
00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:17.410
which could be audit and could be produced by workers who were required to

489
00:29:17.631 --> 00:29:21.710
produce a certain standardized article in the putting out industries.

490
00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:29.180
So bulk manufacturer of standardized goods was steadily growing.

491
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.370
Another feature of industrial change,

492
00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:38.690
so developing markets for English products where of powerful significance,

493
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.980
but much of the output of manufacturing industries were still consumed at home.

494
00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:48.910
As I've already indicated.

495
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:54.040
Cheaper food raised real incomes for ordinary people,

496
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.750
gave them a margin above their basic subsistence needs.

497
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.100
At least at some point in their life cycle.

498
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:06.120
They had more spending power and that money was often spent on simple,

499
00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:08.860
cheap manufactured goods,

500
00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:10.091
Calico,

501
00:30:10.091 --> 00:30:11.140
cloth linen,

502
00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.990
domestic utensils and so forth.

503
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:16.240
Moreover,

504
00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.840
a lot of the additional income which was being generated in trade and

505
00:30:19.841 --> 00:30:24.670
manufacturers themselves income which went to the mercantile and commercial

506
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:25.510
classes,

507
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:30.340
the middle sort of people enable those people to afford a greater variety of

508
00:30:30.341 --> 00:30:34.420
goods which are often described as the decencies of life,

509
00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:35.800
not luxuries,

510
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.540
not necessities,

511
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:39.490
but the decencies of life.

512
00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:44.440
Often domestic goods of one kind or another or better clothing

513
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:47.440
taken together.

514
00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:52.980
The new overseas markets and the growing domestic markets encouraged the

515
00:30:54.221 --> 00:30:55.690
development of a larger,

516
00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.070
a stronger and a more flexible industrial base.

517
00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.860
Tech textiles,

518
00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:03.693
for example,

519
00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:08.530
woolen cloth manufacturer continued as a major industry.

520
00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:12.640
There was a continued diversification of its products,

521
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.310
partly for particular overseas markets.

522
00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.310
The cloth weaving villages of the West country,

523
00:31:18.311 --> 00:31:19.144
for example,

524
00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:24.390
produced most of the trade blankets which went to supply the fur traders in

525
00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:26.470
North America.

526
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.660
The wonderful Hudson Bay blankets,

527
00:31:28.661 --> 00:31:30.430
which you can still buy in Canada.

528
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:31.540
Uh,

529
00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:33.400
they're still made in the west of England.

530
00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:35.260
These colorful trade blankets,

531
00:31:35.261 --> 00:31:39.760
which you see in portraits of native Americans in the late 18th and early 19th

532
00:31:39.761 --> 00:31:44.761
centuries were already been produced specifically for that market in West

533
00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:46.180
Yorkshire,

534
00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.370
in the area around Leeds and Bradford.

535
00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:53.200
There was a great growth in another dimension of the woolen cloth industry,

536
00:31:53.201 --> 00:31:55.390
the production of Worcester cloth.

537
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.180
It was aimed at the cheaper end of the market,

538
00:31:58.181 --> 00:32:02.680
mostly domestic in Lancashire around Manchester.

539
00:32:02.681 --> 00:32:05.110
They were further significant new developments.

540
00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:10.240
Manchester lying just to the east of Liverpool in that area.

541
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.560
The linen manufacturing industry became concentrated in the late 17th century,

542
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:18.010
producing not only linen for domestic needs,

543
00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:23.220
but also producing sail cloth for the growing merchant fleet and canvas.

544
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:30.150
The Manchester area gradually shifted over from linen to the development of

545
00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:32.170
cotton manufacturing.

546
00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:37.590
They were imitating the imported cotton cloth from India trying to produce it at

547
00:32:38.141 --> 00:32:41.870
home by 1700 a million pounds,

548
00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:45.530
a year's worth of raw cotton was being important.

549
00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.940
Much of advice Liverpool to supply that growing industry.

550
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:53.510
The cotton at this stage tended to come from the Mediterranean rather than North

551
00:32:53.511 --> 00:32:58.511
America by the 1740 2 million pounds a year worth of raw cotton for Manchester's

552
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.433
looms.

553
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:06.010
The finished cotton cloth had a big market at home and it was also exported to

554
00:33:06.111 --> 00:33:08.090
West Africa and to the Americas,

555
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:13.660
so by 1750 the Manchester area when a survey was done had almost 5,000 looms

556
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:17.263
working,

557
00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:18.140
producing cotton.

558
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.930
That was an important precursor of things that were to come in the cotton

559
00:33:23.931 --> 00:33:25.310
industry of Lancashire,

560
00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.630
but as yet many of the really significant developments were outside tech styles.

561
00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:34.670
The pottery industry was taking off in the West Midlands in Staffordshire to the

562
00:33:34.671 --> 00:33:36.170
north of Birmingham.

563
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:38.061
First of all,

564
00:33:38.061 --> 00:33:43.061
it concentrated on the production of course earthenware and on so called

565
00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:44.873
Delftware,

566
00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:49.220
which was in imitation of the Delft pottery produced in the Netherlands.

567
00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:53.540
Production of that kind of pottery doubled in the late 17th century.

568
00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.940
Then they moved on to stoneware,

569
00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:01.690
particularly after the 1680s and as the potteries expanded employment in this

570
00:34:03.351 --> 00:34:04.184
industry.

571
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:05.023
Trebled.

572
00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:10.160
This was the age would store the foundation just a decade or two later of such

573
00:34:10.161 --> 00:34:15.140
firms that are still familiar as Wedgewood and Royal Doulton in that area of the

574
00:34:15.141 --> 00:34:15.974
potteries,

575
00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:19.070
the West Midlands metal wares.

576
00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:22.970
We're also taking off the city of Sheffield in South Yorkshire,

577
00:34:22.971 --> 00:34:26.900
had long been involved in the production of edge tools,

578
00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.090
but they began to diversify.

579
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:34.330
They began to produce scissors and files and metal buttons and razors and forks.

580
00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.180
Forks were a novelty prior to this period.

581
00:34:38.181 --> 00:34:41.600
People ate their meat by stabbing it with a pointed knife and putting it in

582
00:34:41.601 --> 00:34:42.290
their mouths.

583
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:43.370
Folks were coming in.

584
00:34:43.371 --> 00:34:45.770
Sheffield was manufacturing them for this new market.

585
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.300
They were amongst the decencies of life in the West Midlands.

586
00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:52.340
There was comparable growth around Birmingham,

587
00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:57.850
especially from the 60 nineties Birmingham had long made nails and tools and

588
00:34:59.601 --> 00:35:02.090
weaponry and saddlers ironmongery,

589
00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:07.160
but they began to make fancy buckles and buttons and pots and pans and kettles

590
00:35:07.161 --> 00:35:09.170
and what they described as toys.

591
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.820
Toys was steal jewelry,

592
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.780
often made with WIA twisted in elaborate ways.

593
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:20.710
They began specializing also in the production of boxes which imitated Japanese

594
00:35:22.551 --> 00:35:23.384
imports.

595
00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:28.390
It was known as Japan in the production of lacquered boxes in imitation of these

596
00:35:29.241 --> 00:35:33.170
popular products which had been introduced by the trade with the east.

597
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.490
In this version,

598
00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:38.520
they would affordable by people of the middle link sought not simply by the

599
00:35:38.521 --> 00:35:39.354
elite.

600
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.720
They also had big markets in guns,

601
00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.340
many of which would export it to North America and to Africa and they supplied

602
00:35:47.341 --> 00:35:52.341
the planters of the American colonies with casp nails with holes with sugar cane

603
00:35:53.491 --> 00:35:54.211
knives,

604
00:35:54.211 --> 00:35:58.800
with chains for their oxen to pull heavy weights and so forth.

605
00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:05.420
And so one could go on for other less dramatic developments in regional

606
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.530
industrial specialization and growth.

607
00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:10.381
And finally,

608
00:36:10.381 --> 00:36:13.830
all of this required of course raw materials.

609
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:17.760
Some of those raw materials were being imported.

610
00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.810
Another stimulus to trade the cotton from the Mediterranean,

611
00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:23.430
the steel from Sweden,

612
00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.460
some specialized high quality wools,

613
00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:28.800
which we used in the woolen manufacturers.

614
00:36:28.801 --> 00:36:29.640
They came from Spain,

615
00:36:29.641 --> 00:36:30.474
some of them,

616
00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:34.530
but a great deal of the raw materials used were being produced at home.

617
00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:40.160
The period saw a major expansion in the iron and steel industries from the

618
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:44.430
sixties and seventies tin mining down in the southwest in Cornwall took off

619
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.961
copper mining,

620
00:36:45.961 --> 00:36:50.490
expanded lead mining in Darbyshire in the Midlands.

621
00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:51.540
Yeah.

622
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:56.540
And in north Wales also increased very significantly and there was a massive

623
00:36:57.931 --> 00:36:59.490
growth in the coal industry.

624
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:01.770
Coal being the ubiquitous fuel,

625
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:03.750
not only for domestic fires,

626
00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.830
but for any industrial process which required heat.

627
00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:10.440
They still couldn't use it for smelting iron,

628
00:37:10.441 --> 00:37:14.100
but they used it in many other industrial processes which simply required a

629
00:37:14.101 --> 00:37:14.934
source of heat.

630
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.210
So coal production in Newcastle in the northeast,

631
00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:24.020
which had already been a prodigious half a million tons in 1650 was 1.3 million

632
00:37:25.141 --> 00:37:30.141
by 1700 and over 2 million by 1750 and there were significant expansions of coal

633
00:37:31.441 --> 00:37:36.441
production in other areas to areas where it hadn't been previously economical to

634
00:37:36.601 --> 00:37:37.620
produce in transport.

635
00:37:37.621 --> 00:37:42.621
Coal now got involved because demand had increased the coal industry,

636
00:37:43.291 --> 00:37:43.591
bread,

637
00:37:43.591 --> 00:37:44.580
other innovations,

638
00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:49.880
steam engines were invented at the end of the 17th century to drain coal mines.

639
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:51.510
That was their original purpose,

640
00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:53.400
wooden wagon ways,

641
00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:58.460
railways built of wood along which wagons would run to transport coal more

642
00:37:58.531 --> 00:37:59.430
cheaply and easily.

643
00:37:59.431 --> 00:38:04.431
Wagons pulled by horses were introduced from the 1660s and were commonplace in

644
00:38:04.951 --> 00:38:07.800
the coal mining areas by the early 18th century.

645
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:12.000
One proud Colonna said that one of his wagon ways,

646
00:38:12.001 --> 00:38:16.410
which he'd built for several miles to get his Coulter to market was as

647
00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:17.280
prodigious,

648
00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:17.460
uh,

649
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.000
an engineering feat as the via Appia near Rome.

650
00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:22.373
And he was right,

651
00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:26.910
some of these industrial undertakings where the biggest silver civil engineering

652
00:38:26.911 --> 00:38:27.451
projects,

653
00:38:27.451 --> 00:38:30.600
which had been undertaken in Britain since the Romans had left.

654
00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:36.130
Eventually of course you put together the steam engines,

655
00:38:36.131 --> 00:38:36.521
the drain,

656
00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:38.860
the mine mines with the railways,

657
00:38:38.861 --> 00:38:40.900
the wagon ways that carried the coal.

658
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:43.120
And you have locomotives,

659
00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:44.320
George Stevenson.

660
00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:51.130
So in the areas of growth of this kind,

661
00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:56.320
especially as you live noticed areas in the north and in the Midlands and in

662
00:38:57.321 --> 00:38:58.640
parts of the West country.

663
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000
The picture is one of what's been described as industrial agglomeration,

664
00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:10.420
a greater density of involvement in particular areas and that kind of

665
00:39:11.001 --> 00:39:16.001
agglomeration as more and more communities are involved in these activities had

666
00:39:16.251 --> 00:39:17.120
many effects.

667
00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:19.640
It could reduce transportation costs,

668
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.250
it could encourage spinoff developments,

669
00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.730
it could encourage the spread of innovations,

670
00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:30.380
the transmission of skills amongst the local population well used to its

671
00:39:30.381 --> 00:39:31.940
involvement in these industries,

672
00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:37.480
the formation of partnerships to raise capital flows of information regarding

673
00:39:37.731 --> 00:39:41.180
markets and innovative products and processes.

674
00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:47.840
It resulted eventually in the creation of highly specialized local economies,

675
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:51.620
distinctive occupational regions,

676
00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.010
the coal mining areas of the northeast,

677
00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.600
the cloth weaving areas of the West country,

678
00:39:56.780 --> 00:40:00.320
the metal where areas of Birmingham and so forth.

679
00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:05.980
These were essentially the origins of the distinctive regional identities of

680
00:40:07.431 --> 00:40:12.431
industrial Britain as it was to be the roots of some of this activity.

681
00:40:13.311 --> 00:40:13.701
Of course,

682
00:40:13.701 --> 00:40:14.960
lane deepen the past,

683
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.940
especially the cloth industry,

684
00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:22.720
but the period between 1660 and the mid 18th century saw the full emergence of

685
00:40:24.771 --> 00:40:29.390
all of this activity as part of a new regional economic structure.

686
00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:33.260
<v 1>Okay.</v>

687
00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:33.950
<v 0>Now of course,</v>

688
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:38.950
every one of those zones was centered upon a major town or towns.

689
00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.800
Another part of the story of urban growth and the interconnections between them

690
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:51.320
were facilitated by the role of towns as central places in the circulating

691
00:40:51.321 --> 00:40:53.150
systems of commerce.

692
00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:59.800
The late 17th and very early 18th centuries saw a second great wave of

693
00:41:00.231 --> 00:41:05.231
intensification in internal trade comparable to but exceeding that which had

694
00:41:06.471 --> 00:41:11.471
taken place in the late 16th century trade in both agricultural and industrial

695
00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.213
products.

696
00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
It was a great age of improvement in communications as well as in agriculture

697
00:41:19.671 --> 00:41:20.600
and manufacturers.

698
00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:23.000
Without improvement in communications,

699
00:41:23.001 --> 00:41:26.030
this kind of regional specialization wouldn't have been possible.

700
00:41:26.031 --> 00:41:27.830
You had to be able to move the goods around.

701
00:41:28.100 --> 00:41:28.933
Effectively.

702
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:32.150
The coastal trade grew enormously.

703
00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:33.800
It's been that the,

704
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:39.100
the long coastline of Britain became like one great river with coastal traffic

705
00:41:40.491 --> 00:41:41.750
flowing to and fro

706
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:48.260
efforts were made also to improve the navigation of the great river systems,

707
00:41:48.261 --> 00:41:48.861
the Thames,

708
00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:49.550
the seven,

709
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:50.990
the Trent and so forth.

710
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:56.690
There were over 40 acts of parliament for river navigation improvement schemes

711
00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:01.720
passed between 60 and 60 and 1700 efforts were also made to improve the roads

712
00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:08.580
turn pack trusts were devised as a way of improving road quality by charging a

713
00:42:08.751 --> 00:42:09.500
toll,

714
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:14.000
the money from which would be used to maintain a higher quality highway.

715
00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:19.460
All of the major routes in the county of Gloucestershire just around Bristol,

716
00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
we're turned pact between 60 90 and 1740 to take just one regional example,

717
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:31.240
every major route there had been turnpike and proliferating turn piking was

718
00:42:32.271 --> 00:42:37.271
taking place all over the kingdom radiating out in particular from London.

719
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.150
Along those improved roads were improved,

720
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:46.210
regular carrier services delivering goods to and fro throughout the kingdom.

721
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000
So in a sense it was an age of intensified traffic on all these arteries of

722
00:42:52.641 --> 00:42:55.970
communication by river around the coast,

723
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:58.160
along the turnpike roads.

724
00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:06.490
And that inevitably produced an intensifying relationship of exchange between

725
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:10.280
urban and rural society,

726
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:12.830
between different rural regions.

727
00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:18.940
The influence of all of this activity percolating right down to the level of the

728
00:43:19.461 --> 00:43:20.390
individual village.

729
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:26.950
One indicator of that to close is the proliferation of village shops in this

730
00:43:28.011 --> 00:43:28.461
period.

731
00:43:28.461 --> 00:43:32.180
It's a period which sees a proliferation of little shops in villages.

732
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:34.303
For example,

733
00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:39.310
in a far from far from prominent place up here in the leg district and the

734
00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.013
northwest,

735
00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.070
the town of Kirby Lonsdale.

736
00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:49.180
There was a man called Abraham Dent who kept a shop at the turn of the 18th

737
00:43:49.611 --> 00:43:52.130
century is inventory survives.

738
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:56.450
It lists all the goods that he stocked and the suppliers to whom he owed money.

739
00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:57.643
Very useful.

740
00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:02.600
Abraham Dent stock goods from 51 different origins,

741
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:05.420
some of them way overseas yet his tobacco,

742
00:44:05.421 --> 00:44:08.900
he had his sugar and so forth and many English manufactured products.

743
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:14.210
He had bought goods from 190 different suppliers scattered all over the country

744
00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.560
and they'd reached him in his obscure town in the lake district.

745
00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:24.580
Such local tradesmen as Abraham Dent showed how far England's local economies

746
00:44:25.641 --> 00:44:29.930
had moved away from the era era of relative self sufficiency,

747
00:44:29.931 --> 00:44:34.931
which I described at the beginning of this lecture course and the existence of

748
00:44:35.461 --> 00:44:40.461
shops like den symbolize in a sense the completion of a massive process of

749
00:44:41.311 --> 00:44:44.730
commercial integration and transition.

750
00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:51.000
John Brewer puts it very well when he says the shopkeeper linked the market town

751
00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:56.130
and the local community to a network of markets that now stretched beyond the

752
00:44:56.131 --> 00:44:58.650
nation's boundaries across oceans,

753
00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:02.400
across continents and that's correct.

754
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:05.130
They link together the farmers,

755
00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:06.720
the craft's people,

756
00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:07.740
the merchants,

757
00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:08.603
the semen,

758
00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:09.870
the hunters,

759
00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:15.260
the plantation slaves or linked together in an increasingly closely articulated

760
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:21.650
whole a market economy and nascent world economy.

761
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:26.550
Some people describe all this as archaic globalization.

762
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:31.170
Some of the earliest stages of that familiar process.

763
00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:36.590
It's a commercial civilization in which Britain increasingly played a core role.

764
00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:38.993
It was still,

765
00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:42.420
as ea Wrigley has put it an organic economy.

766
00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:45.660
It's still dependent pretty much on muscle power,

767
00:45:45.661 --> 00:45:50.661
human and animal muscles or wind and water to pirates machinery and so forth.

768
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:57.110
It was not yet what he describes as the mineral based energy economy of the

769
00:45:58.261 --> 00:46:00.240
industrial revolution era.

770
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.090
But if it was still an organic economy,

771
00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:08.120
it was a very advanced organic economy and already in many ways beginning to

772
00:46:09.781 --> 00:46:14.781
anticipate the transformations which would come in the later 18th century with

773
00:46:14.821 --> 00:46:18.990
the introduction of steam power and mechanization.

774
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.863
So we'll leave it there.

775
00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.000
Well,

776
00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.470
have a good break and we'll reassemble to get the end of the story as far as the

777
00:46:28.471 --> 00:46:32.430
state is concerned in the week after thanksgiving.
