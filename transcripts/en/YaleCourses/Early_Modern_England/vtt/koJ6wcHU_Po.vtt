1
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:01.950
Right.

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.130
Well better get started because there's quite a lot of ground to cover today as

3
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:06.300
you'll see from the handouts.

4
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.123
Um,

5
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.121
okay.

6
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:13.500
Well we all know that Henry the eighth had six queens,

7
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.100
you know,

8
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.641
divorced,

9
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:15.150
beheaded,

10
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.983
died,

11
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.740
divorced,

12
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.550
beheaded,

13
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.383
survived.

14
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.470
Um,

15
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.920
and that makes good television and bad television too.

16
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.350
And all of those,

17
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:30.351
all of those queens are marked on your handouts in the appropriate place in bold

18
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.030
Q one to Q six.

19
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.440
Uh,

20
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.440
but the real reason that his reign was so important in English history is of

21
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:43.560
course that he initiated the English reformation,

22
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.940
a momentous change with very far reaching consequences.

23
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.960
And Henry's interesting marital career was essentially part of that larger

24
00:00:55.231 --> 00:01:00.231
process set in train by the wheel of a powerful king.

25
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.223
Well,

26
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.790
for that reason,

27
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.970
the English reformation was once famously described as being essentially an act

28
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.593
of state,

29
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.040
its essence being the transfer of legal authority over the church in England

30
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.040
from a distant papacy to a very present English crown.

31
00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.780
The Universal Catholic Church in England became the Anglican Church of England.

32
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.020
So an act of state and an active state.

33
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.820
It certainly was.

34
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.130
It was initiated by the crown and directed from above and carried through by

35
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:49.170
successive acts of parliament,

36
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.310
and yet it was also of course so much more than that because these acts of state

37
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.830
also inaugurated fundamental changes in the religious culture of the nation.

38
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.810
Looking at the whole,

39
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.820
it's certainly possible to distinguish us,

40
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:06.241
Christopher.

41
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:10.800
Hey does a series of legislative reformations.

42
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.760
On the one hand,

43
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.190
Andrew distinguished that from on the other hand what he terms the Protestant

44
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.173
reformation,

45
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.570
which was a much more gradual and much more diffuse process of religious change

46
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.780
extending over generations and yet the two dimensions of the reformation,

47
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.090
the legislative and the Protestant inevitably went together.

48
00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.090
What was once seen as being a very purposeful process of change.

49
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.050
Carefully directed,

50
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.350
swiftly accomplished now tends to be seen as a much more hesitant and uncertain

51
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:53.034
business,

52
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.430
but to call the whole thing as Christopher,

53
00:02:56.431 --> 00:03:01.431
hey does a series of blundering steps is perhaps to go a wee bit too far

54
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.640
because there certainly was purposeful action and the reformation process became

55
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:14.521
much more deliberative over time as the issue is gradually became clearer and as

56
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:20.170
the religious alignments to which it gave her eyes gradually crystallized

57
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.530
Christopher Hayes a counterfeit or provides us with an excellent overview the

58
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:31.531
details of which take the narrative up to 1,603 but what I want to do in the

59
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:37.891
lecture today is to emphasize the contributions of each phase of development in

60
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:46.201
the crucial generation from the late 1520s through to 1558 the various stages

61
00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:52.000
which contributed to an emerging religious division.

62
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.030
And I want to try to bring up the logic of those phases of development.

63
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.990
All of this can be very confusing in the details,

64
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.180
but there is a certain logic to it.

65
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.150
And that means in the first instance,

66
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.960
grasping how successive political situations gave rise to particular

67
00:04:13.811 --> 00:04:14.650
developments,

68
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:20.260
which had consequences for religious change one way or the other.

69
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.810
And then later on in section discussion,

70
00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:27.490
we'll explore further the larger question of the extent to which these changes

71
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:32.491
were welcome or unwelcome for the people at large and a very gradual process of

72
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:34.660
their acceptance.

73
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.920
So let's look at the first phase,

74
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.280
which ran roughly from 1527 to 1531 which we can call,

75
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.310
you know,

76
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.720
the gathering crisis.

77
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.261
Well,

78
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:54.250
if there was a phase of blundering about as Christopher Haigh puts it,

79
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.900
then it came at the beginning.

80
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.810
And it was occasion of course by the fact that the king and his advisors were

81
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:04.990
facing a completely unprecedented situation.

82
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.270
In 1527 Henry needed a male heir.

83
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.253
As you know,

84
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.910
the future of the Tudor Dynasty and of the political stability,

85
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:17.380
which had had reestablished,

86
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.270
might hang on that fact of an undisputed succession.

87
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.840
Henry was 36 his wife Catherine was in her early forties no child was now

88
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.093
likely.

89
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.283
Now,

90
00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.453
as you know,

91
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.660
Catherine had originally come to England as the bride of Henry's older brother

92
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:38.320
Arthur,

93
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.320
who had shortly died and she had subsequently married Henry Brooding on this.

94
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.760
Henry by 1527 became preoccupied with a biblical texts.

95
00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.800
Leviticus 2021 which translates as if a man shall his brother's wife.

96
00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.650
It is an unclean thing.

97
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.320
He has uncovered his brother's nakedness and they shall be childless.

98
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.710
And at the same time,

99
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:11.810
on a somewhat less principled notes,

100
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.441
Henry's,

101
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:16.490
I had been caught by a young woman of the court and Berlin,

102
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.480
whom he saw as a potential new queen.

103
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.320
She was in her early twenties the Vaishyas ambitious and astute.

104
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.170
And she was not willing to be the king's mistress.

105
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.270
She intended to be queen.

106
00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.360
So Henry needed to get his existing marriage dissolved.

107
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.430
He needed it to be declared void from the beginning by the pope and to take a

108
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:44.210
new queen.

109
00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.950
And it should have been very easy.

110
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.301
Since pope's,

111
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:51.140
we're usually willing to cooperate with the needs of kings in such matters.

112
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.680
But it was rendered difficult by two factors.

113
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.663
First of all,

114
00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.060
Catherine was a very strong personality.

115
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.280
A sense of honor was outraged by the idea that her marriage should be dissolved

116
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.143
in this way.

117
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.010
And in 1527 as matters began to reach your head,

118
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:11.630
her nephew,

119
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.980
the emperor Charles,

120
00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:15.350
the fifth of the Holy Roman Empire of Germany,

121
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.360
gained control of the pope,

122
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.020
Clement the seventh in the course of his Italian wars.

123
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.070
Now all Henry really needed was a delegation of authority from Rome to settle

124
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:28.904
the matter.

125
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.240
And in 1628 it looked like he might get it.

126
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.400
In that year,

127
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.780
a paypal ambassador,

128
00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:36.890
cardinal compared geo,

129
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.400
was sent to England and he and Cardinal Thomas Woolsey.

130
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:43.970
We're empowered to establish the facts regarding Henry's marriage,

131
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.250
but in hearings that they inaugurated in 1529,

132
00:07:49.251 --> 00:07:54.251
queen Catherine vigorously defended the validity of her marriage.

133
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.380
She denied that there had been any sexual conservation to Prince Arthur Henry's

134
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.223
elder brother.

135
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.310
She embarrassed the king by publicly declaring that he knew she had been a

136
00:08:04.311 --> 00:08:05.360
virgin when they married.

137
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.100
She defended her,

138
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:08.590
her,

139
00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:08.790
uh,

140
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.160
her honor and her marriage.

141
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.730
And then in July,

142
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.340
1529 new victories,

143
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:20.120
victories of the emperor in Italy meant the pope was even more firmly under his

144
00:08:20.121 --> 00:08:24.710
control and the pope revoked the case back to Rome.

145
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:32.080
So the first phase of the developing crisis was efforts to put pressure on the

146
00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:37.160
papacy by threatening the privileges of the church in England in order to get

147
00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.480
the pope to cooperate.

148
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.630
In September,

149
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.880
1529 Cardinal Woolsey who had clearly failed,

150
00:08:43.881 --> 00:08:48.881
Henry was threatened with illegal charge of primary Neary,

151
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:53.330
which was an offense established by statutes in the 14th century regarding the

152
00:08:53.331 --> 00:08:56.610
jurisdiction of church and state within England,

153
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.710
he had allegedly illegally exercised his powers as the pope's legate in England.

154
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.070
And a couple of months later,

155
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.990
parliament was called and the members of parliament were encouraged by royal

156
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:12.570
counselors to lay complaints,

157
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.150
not only against Cardinal Woolsey,

158
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:20.630
but also against other alleged abuses in church affairs.

159
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.640
So at this stage,

160
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.440
Henry is blustering.

161
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:31.340
He was deliberately stoking up the latent resentment of clerical privileges

162
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.090
amongst members of parliament.

163
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.930
But as yet there was no intention to go further indeed having set things going

164
00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:41.424
in this manner,

165
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.920
fired his warning shots as it were.

166
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:49.590
The king sent parliament into recess between December,

167
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.300
1529 and January,

168
00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:52.133
1531

169
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:54.270
and in the meantime,

170
00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:59.840
he assembled a think tank of academics and clergy to prepare his legal case for

171
00:10:01.921 --> 00:10:02.754
a divorce.

172
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.220
And he began consulting learn opinion amongst lawyers and theologians from

173
00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:10.710
Europe's various major universities.

174
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.800
But none of this had the desired effect.

175
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:19.590
And in 1530,

176
00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:24.920
the pope cited Henry to appear before him in Rome and forbade him to remarry

177
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.020
until he did so.

178
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:33.420
The king was both frustrated and furious

179
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:40.580
and he found reasons to fail to comply with the pope's requirements in the

180
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:44.430
materials which were being assembled by his academic research team.

181
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.180
Uh,

182
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.000
these survive and then known as the collector Yana.

183
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.660
And they included some crucial arguments.

184
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:57.590
One was the argument that historically the church in England had exercised

185
00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.480
independent provincial rights.

186
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.720
That's to say it had the right to autonomy in the settlement of certain internal

187
00:11:06.421 --> 00:11:09.180
affairs without reference to Rome.

188
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:15.690
The second crucial argument which they put forward was that within England,

189
00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.200
the king enjoyed imperial power,

190
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:22.200
not only over the state,

191
00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:27.740
but over the church in matters which were not of a strictly spiritual nature.

192
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:35.630
So Henry still hoping for a change in the European political situation,

193
00:11:35.731 --> 00:11:37.770
which would lead to paypal cooperation.

194
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.400
Use these ideas to put a bit more pressure on the church.

195
00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:47.690
In 1530 his lawyers indicted the entire clergy in England for primary Neary

196
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.980
illegally acquiescing in the exercise of Papal Authority.

197
00:11:55.510 --> 00:12:00.070
The convocation of the Church meeting at Canterbury resisted,

198
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:05.670
and Henry demanded that they recognize his supreme headship of the church and

199
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:11.140
they eventually did so they recognized his authority,

200
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:16.470
but only so far as the law of God allows a saving clause.

201
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:23.490
And they gave the king a grant of 120,000 pounds from the church to try to

202
00:12:23.921 --> 00:12:24.880
sweeten his mood.

203
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.233
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

204
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:28.483
<v 0>So where are we?</v>

205
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:33.610
In 1531 the king and the church have fallen out badly over Henry's need for a

206
00:12:34.851 --> 00:12:36.080
dissolution of his marriage.

207
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.890
The central issue has been clarified.

208
00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:45.280
The central issue has become that of legal jurisdiction of the papacy over the

209
00:12:45.681 --> 00:12:50.660
English church and therefore its ability to frustrate as divorce since the

210
00:12:50.661 --> 00:12:52.610
church had authority over marriage.

211
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:59.290
But there was no question of any doc trinal challenge to the Roman Catholic

212
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.620
Church.

213
00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.880
No challenge in matters of faith or matters of worship.

214
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:07.670
This is a legal issue at this point,

215
00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.870
which brings us to phase two,

216
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:13.790
the royal supremacy

217
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.130
as 1531 advanced.

218
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:25.160
There was no indication that the pope was going to give way and the political

219
00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:28.860
impasse precipitated the second phase of development,

220
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.410
the royal supremacy,

221
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:37.340
and it was masterminded by Thomas Cromwell between 1532 and 1535 now brief word

222
00:13:40.621 --> 00:13:41.271
on Thomas Crum.

223
00:13:41.271 --> 00:13:41.940
Well,

224
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:43.680
he was a man of very humble origins,

225
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.940
the son of a London plus worker and tavern keeper.

226
00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:49.660
He had had a,

227
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.270
an obscure early career.

228
00:13:51.271 --> 00:13:53.820
He'd probably served as a soldier in Germany.

229
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.480
He'd worked as a merchant and eventually he went into the law in a six in the

230
00:13:59.701 --> 00:14:04.701
1520s he gradually emerged as a very skillful man of business in the household

231
00:14:05.731 --> 00:14:06.840
of Cardinal Woolsey,

232
00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.650
much trusted by Woolsey for his astuteness and competence.

233
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.160
And in 1530 when Woolsey fell,

234
00:14:14.161 --> 00:14:18.420
such was Cromwells reputation that he was taken into the king's service and by

235
00:14:18.421 --> 00:14:21.450
1530 was made a member of the council

236
00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:28.340
and it was Cromwell who saw the way out of the legal impasse through a carefully

237
00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.740
planned program of legislation.

238
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.560
Can you exactly what he was doing?

239
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.320
A memoranda in his own hand survive,

240
00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.080
which show the stages of his planet.

241
00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:45.800
And in 1532 to 34 his strategy of making Henry's divorce possible and then

242
00:14:47.551 --> 00:14:52.551
legitimizing these changes was executed stage by stage through the careful

243
00:14:53.721 --> 00:14:58.040
presentation of the king's desires to parliament and management of parliament to

244
00:14:58.041 --> 00:14:59.120
get them past,

245
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.270
first of all,

246
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.500
they put still more pressure on the church to break any resistance within

247
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:07.543
England.

248
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:12.920
Parliament was brought to pass the act in restraint of an aids and aids were

249
00:15:12.921 --> 00:15:14.360
payments to Rome,

250
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:16.640
which were made when bishops will appointed.

251
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.560
This canceled them,

252
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:23.540
but the act was held in suspension as a threat to paypal finance.

253
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:25.543
Secondly,

254
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:29.990
the House of Commons put forward what was called it's supplication against the

255
00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:30.824
ordinary's,

256
00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:35.920
a petition against the exercise of ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the church

257
00:15:36.141 --> 00:15:40.160
courts in England and the abuses which allegedly took place.

258
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.170
This was an attack which provoked the convocation of the church,

259
00:15:45.171 --> 00:15:48.920
its own assembly to reject the accusations.

260
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:54.340
Henry then rounded angrily on them and demanded their full submission and it

261
00:15:55.341 --> 00:15:56.810
May,

262
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:57.650
1532 they caved in,

263
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:03.250
the convocation submitted and abandoned its claim to legal jurisdictional

264
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:05.630
independence

265
00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.230
the way it was now clear in England,

266
00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.290
but there was still no response from Rome

267
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:15.590
and then fake land to hand.

268
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:21.370
In August 60 1532 the Archbishop of Canterbury,

269
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:23.653
Archbishop Warren died,

270
00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:29.360
Henry and Cromwells managed to secure the appointment and the confirmation from

271
00:16:29.361 --> 00:16:34.190
Rome of Thomas Cranmer as the new Archbishop of Canterbury.

272
00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:39.620
A Cranmer was a Cambridge academic who had taken a great interest in the early

273
00:16:39.621 --> 00:16:41.890
development of Protestantism in the 1520s.

274
00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:47.500
Henry and Cranwell knew him as one of the Kings think tank and they knew that he

275
00:16:47.871 --> 00:16:51.020
was willing to do Henry's bidding over the divorce.

276
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:56.210
With that confidence and Archbishop of Canterbury who would do the kings,

277
00:16:56.211 --> 00:17:01.211
will and Berlin at last gave in to Henry's imports unity's.

278
00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.960
By December,

279
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.020
1532,

280
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.830
she was known to be pregnant and in January,

281
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:12.170
1533 they were secretly married.

282
00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.100
The king was willing to go ahead and do that because he was convinced that his

283
00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:18.590
first marriage would be declared to have been void,

284
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.340
but now with an pregnant,

285
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.380
things had to move fast.

286
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:27.200
In April,

287
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.400
1533 parliament was brought to pass the act in restraint of appeals.

288
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:31.971
UH,

289
00:17:31.971 --> 00:17:33.440
crucial statute.

290
00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:37.040
This declared that England was an imperial monarchy.

291
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.210
No foreign jurisdiction was valid within its boundaries.

292
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:46.630
No appeals against a judicial decision made in England could be taken outside

293
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:48.883
the kingdom.

294
00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:51.483
And accordingly.

295
00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.940
In May,

296
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.500
1533 Cranmer assembled the court,

297
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:56.783
a node.

298
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.880
Henry's marriage to Katherine of Aragon at in June,

299
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.000
1533 an already secretly married to the king,

300
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:11.030
was crowned as queen already six months pregnant with the future Queen Elizabeth

301
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:15.960
the first who was born on the 7th of September,

302
00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:18.360
and in the same month,

303
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.400
September,

304
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.490
1533 the pope responded by excommunicating,

305
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:26.640
the king casting him out of the church,

306
00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:32.570
but he held the excommunication in suspension in case Henry would begin to

307
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:34.494
behave,

308
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.370
but Henry didn't behave.

309
00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.480
That wasn't his way.

310
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:45.870
In 1534 the parliament passed the succession act declaring the validity of the

311
00:18:45.871 --> 00:18:50.250
annulment of Henry's marriage and his remarriage and fixing the succession to

312
00:18:50.251 --> 00:18:51.810
the crown in the new line.

313
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:52.621
Oh,

314
00:18:52.621 --> 00:18:56.640
that's what required from all major office holders to respect the act of

315
00:18:56.641 --> 00:19:01.641
succession and act for submission of the clergy was passed to legally enshrine

316
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:04.170
the church,

317
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:05.310
the clergy submission,

318
00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.880
and finally the act of supremacy,

319
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:14.450
which declared Henry the eighth to be the supreme head of the Church of England.

320
00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:23.420
In some then the necessity of securing the Tudor Dynasty had led to England

321
00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:27.990
entering into a state of schism,

322
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.353
schism.

323
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.770
They had rejected the jurisdictional authority of Rome.

324
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.180
They had asserted the royal supremacy over the church.

325
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:44.520
And in 1534 to five this was backed up with a flurry of executions of

326
00:19:44.521 --> 00:19:49.521
individuals who dad to defend the Aragon marriage and the authority of the pope

327
00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.390
and those who were executed included John Fisher,

328
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.640
the reforming bishop of Rochester,

329
00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.900
who could not tolerate this.

330
00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.210
And most famously,

331
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.283
Thomas Moore,

332
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.120
the former Lord Chancellor,

333
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:08.270
former good servant of the king who also could not stomach this and died for it.

334
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.350
So we now enter a third phase,

335
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:17.720
the Henry Schein reformation.

336
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.490
On the face of it,

337
00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.710
the royal supremacy over the church had nothing,

338
00:20:24.711 --> 00:20:26.780
whatever to do with religious reformation.

339
00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.920
It was a rejection for reasons of state of the supposedly usurped legal

340
00:20:33.021 --> 00:20:35.360
jurisdictional powers of the Bishop of Rome.

341
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.480
But it had nothing to do with Protestantism.

342
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:43.690
And it was not intended to inaugurate reform in matters of faith or worship.

343
00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:46.400
But of course it did.

344
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:52.900
It took place in a context of the reformation in Europe.

345
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.260
It aligned England against Rome,

346
00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:01.900
if not necessarily with the Protestant princes of Germany or the Protestant

347
00:21:01.901 --> 00:21:03.130
cantons of Switzerland.

348
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:09.750
It gave an initial foothold to that minority who favored some measure of

349
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:15.960
religious reform and there were already people around the king who were prepared

350
00:21:16.361 --> 00:21:19.030
to use that opportunity purposefully.

351
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.810
They'll necessarily with extreme caution.

352
00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:25.101
Thomas Crum,

353
00:21:25.101 --> 00:21:27.430
well certainly favored reform.

354
00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.610
Queen Anne favored reform.

355
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.300
She received Protestant books which were secretly brought to her by London

356
00:21:34.301 --> 00:21:36.250
merchants and read them with interest.

357
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.720
Thomas Cranmer favored reform as he had done for some years.

358
00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:42.970
On the other hand,

359
00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:48.070
most of the bishops and most of the new nobility were willing to go only so far

360
00:21:48.071 --> 00:21:48.760
with Henry.

361
00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:53.760
They would accept the royal supremacy for the good of the kingdom,

362
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.870
for the good of the succession,

363
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.960
but they hope that it will all end ultimately in a reconciliation with Rome.

364
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.990
So they would go along for the time being.

365
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.560
The key figure in all of this of course,

366
00:22:08.561 --> 00:22:13.540
was Henry them himself and once he had the royals supremacy,

367
00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:17.170
Henry found that he rather liked it.

368
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:24.150
He was happy to adopt a position of a moderate reformer of abuses and over time

369
00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:28.960
he increasingly came to believe in his own propaganda.

370
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:31.780
He saw himself as a Solomon,

371
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:37.890
as a just Cya who had promulgated God's law and purge the land of abuses and

372
00:22:39.161 --> 00:22:39.994
idolatry

373
00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:46.720
and at the same time the king was notoriously susceptible to influence and if

374
00:22:46.721 --> 00:22:48.550
those who held his trust,

375
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.390
we're able to steer things in the direction that they favored,

376
00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.320
then the king might back them.

377
00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.050
If they were cautious,

378
00:22:58.051 --> 00:23:02.530
though they were always well advised to proceed with extreme caution in order to

379
00:23:02.531 --> 00:23:04.540
retain the king's confidence.

380
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:11.070
He was willing to be influenced but he could react fiercely if he thought he was

381
00:23:12.281 --> 00:23:13.114
being abused.

382
00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:15.041
Well,

383
00:23:15.041 --> 00:23:20.041
in the mid to late 1530s Thomas Cromwell and Thomas Cranmer certainly had the

384
00:23:20.351 --> 00:23:21.190
king's trust.

385
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:26.370
They had served him very well as Archbishop of Canterbury and grandmas case or

386
00:23:26.681 --> 00:23:30.130
in Cromwells case as vice Gerand in spirituals,

387
00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:34.270
the office of administering the church on behalf of the king and they did a

388
00:23:34.271 --> 00:23:38.450
great deal to mold developments in 1536 day issue,

389
00:23:38.451 --> 00:23:43.451
10 articles of faith and a set of injunctions for the practice of worship and

390
00:23:43.511 --> 00:23:48.511
the church which moved very cautiously in a reformist direction.

391
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:54.790
In 1536 Thomas Cromwell organized a visitation and inspection of the

392
00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:55.754
monasteries,

393
00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:01.420
which was deliberately intended to find the abuses and which led later in 1536

394
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:07.450
to the dissolution of all religious houses worth less than 200 pounds a year.

395
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.010
The smaller monasteries,

396
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.420
if it's not presented as an attack on monasticism in principle,

397
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:16.910
but as an attack upon abuses.

398
00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:22.660
It was a severe shock and it was one of the issues which provoked in 1536

399
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.330
rebellion in the north of England.

400
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.311
That rebellion,

401
00:24:28.311 --> 00:24:29.960
which we'll deal with on another occasion,

402
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:34.990
was suppressed in 1537 and in the aftermath of that suppression,

403
00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:41.650
the larger monasteries were gradually cajoled and encouraged and bullied into

404
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:45.740
surrendering freely their possessions.

405
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:47.180
To the crown.

406
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:52.760
By 1540 every monastery or nunnery in the kingdom had gone.

407
00:24:56.110 --> 00:25:01.110
In 1537 Cromwellian Cranmer engineered the issue of the bishops book,

408
00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:02.560
a set of homilies,

409
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.400
which again moved cautiously towards Protestant definitions of faith.

410
00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:11.890
In 1538 the great shrines,

411
00:25:11.891 --> 00:25:16.120
the great centers of pilgrimage at Canterbury in Durham and elsewhere were

412
00:25:16.121 --> 00:25:16.954
dissolved.

413
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.600
Their riches seized by the crown,

414
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.050
broken up on the grounds that they had been idolatrous,

415
00:25:25.051 --> 00:25:26.050
Lee abused.

416
00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:31.450
And in 1538 the Bible was issued in English,

417
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.930
the Great Bible translation into English,

418
00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:39.940
which was actually based upon the translations of the Bible by William Tyndale

419
00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:41.620
and Myles Coverdale,

420
00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:46.960
both of whom were Protestants that was not officially admitted,

421
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:48.250
but it was a fact.

422
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.320
These were the only translations ready to hand,

423
00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.510
and they needed to produce the Bible quickly.

424
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.640
The Great Bible then was issued,

425
00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.140
and on the frontest piece,

426
00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:01.200
the magnificent frontest piece of the Bible Shows Henry sitting in majesty

427
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.800
handing down the word of God to his grateful people.

428
00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:12.850
It was not much doubt that by 1539 things had gone a lot farther than anyone

429
00:26:12.851 --> 00:26:17.851
anticipated and that elements of reformed doctrine where being gradually

430
00:26:17.891 --> 00:26:19.720
smuggled into Henry's church,

431
00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.840
but in that year,

432
00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:24.730
the king called a halt.

433
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.660
The situation had changed again.

434
00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:31.523
<v 1>Okay.</v>

435
00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:36.650
<v 0>Another of the events of 1536 to go back a few years was the fall of Anne Boleyn</v>

436
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.050
after her marriage to the king and the promising start,

437
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:45.030
the birth of Princess Elizabeth.

438
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:50.420
No male heir had been born and had suffered a series of miscarriages.

439
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.740
She was in a state of acute nervous anxiety,

440
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.000
understandably.

441
00:26:57.930 --> 00:26:58.501
Eventually,

442
00:26:58.501 --> 00:26:59.610
she was suspected.

443
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:04.470
Word was brought to the king planting suspicions that she had committed adultery

444
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.270
in her desperation to have a child.

445
00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.580
Other accusations were brought against her.

446
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.540
The queen was arrested and executed.

447
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:14.880
Shortly thereafter,

448
00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:17.700
Henry married Jane Seymour,

449
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.350
another lady of the court.

450
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.880
The death shortly after that of Queen Catherine meant that the marriage to Jane

451
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.830
Seymour was now of undoubted legitimacy.

452
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:34.530
Both of Henry's earlier queens were dead,

453
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.731
and in 50,

454
00:27:35.731 --> 00:27:36.060
30,

455
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.110
1537,

456
00:27:37.111 --> 00:27:42.111
she gave birth at last to a male heir Prince Edward Cath.

457
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.920
Jane herself,

458
00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:44.400
uh,

459
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.420
died in child bed.

460
00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:49.800
So the king had his son

461
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:57.660
that could have cleared the way for reconciliation with Rome and is more

462
00:27:57.661 --> 00:28:00.780
conservative counselors hoped that it would do so quickly.

463
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.120
But here again,

464
00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:05.730
Henry's personality proved vital.

465
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:07.831
By now.

466
00:28:07.831 --> 00:28:12.540
Henry sincerely believed in his role as supreme head of the Church of England.

467
00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.040
The question at issue was how he would exercise his power.

468
00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:24.260
His conservative counselors persuaded him of the dangers of the growth of

469
00:28:24.751 --> 00:28:26.880
radical Protestantism in the country.

470
00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:31.530
They pointed out the Anabaptists had been discovered in London that there were

471
00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.900
so called Sacramento,

472
00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:33.840
Syrians at large.

473
00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.250
These were people who followed.

474
00:28:35.251 --> 00:28:38.910
The Swiss reformation is teaching on the nature of holy communion.

475
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:41.400
In 1539,

476
00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:46.490
Henry was persuaded to endorse the act of six articles which returned England to

477
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:50.880
unambiguous Catholic doctrinal orthodoxy in matters of faith.

478
00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:57.130
And in 1540 Thomas Cromwell having been accused by his enemies of secretly

479
00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:02.870
encouraging heresy was arrested and swiftly executed is real crime was in fact

480
00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:09.420
the fiasco of having arranged the king's fourth marriage,

481
00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:13.320
his marriage to the German Princess Anne of Cleves,

482
00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:17.220
which brought Henry into alignment with the Lutheran princes of Germany.

483
00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:18.360
Uh,

484
00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:23.130
Henry deceived by a flattering portrait was horrified when Anne of cleves

485
00:29:23.131 --> 00:29:25.380
arrived who described her as a Flemish mare.

486
00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.150
He refused to consummate the marriage and it was swiftly dissolved.

487
00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:34.290
This was a lucky break for Anne of cleves who retired to a states in eastern

488
00:29:34.291 --> 00:29:35.560
England where she happening,

489
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:36.990
lived out the rest of her life.

490
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.940
So she came out of this quite well.

491
00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.860
All things considered,

492
00:29:41.170 --> 00:29:43.510
Thomas Cromwell lost his head.

493
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.151
Now,

494
00:29:47.151 --> 00:29:51.830
this phase of events is often portrayed as a return to full Catholic orthodoxy

495
00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:56.720
accompanied by a reinvigoration of traditional worship in the parishes.

496
00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:57.831
But I think again,

497
00:29:57.831 --> 00:29:58.880
that goes too far.

498
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:05.930
What was ruling in the late years of Henry was not full Catholic orthodoxy.

499
00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:11.410
It was really Henry's own peculiarly Edo syncratic conscience and desires in

500
00:30:13.581 --> 00:30:14.480
matters of religion.

501
00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:21.160
Henry would certainly burn the occasional radice radical Protestant if one was

502
00:30:22.011 --> 00:30:22.844
caught,

503
00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:28.060
but he also executed the occasional Catholic for opposing the royal supremacy.

504
00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:29.841
On one occasion,

505
00:30:29.841 --> 00:30:34.430
he made a demonstration by having several of each executed on the same day.

506
00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:36.500
You can say what you like about Henry,

507
00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:37.580
not a nice man,

508
00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:38.870
a persecutor,

509
00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:40.580
but he was an equal opportunity.

510
00:30:40.581 --> 00:30:45.581
Persecutor Henry was listening to some of the conservative voices in the

511
00:30:47.271 --> 00:30:48.104
council,

512
00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:49.850
especially,

513
00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:50.010
uh,

514
00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:54.530
bishop gardener of Winchester and the conservative faction,

515
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:59.830
which circulated around Thomas Howard the Earl of Norfolk.

516
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:06.020
He came under their influence quite heavily and 1540 when Norfolk brought to his

517
00:31:06.021 --> 00:31:06.531
attention,

518
00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:07.364
his young niece,

519
00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:08.330
Catherine Howard,

520
00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:11.570
who became Henry's new bride,

521
00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.250
his fifth wife,

522
00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:18.790
pushed into his bed at the age of 18 by her uncle in the hope of assuring

523
00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.200
greater influence for his faction.

524
00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:23.360
Nevertheless,

525
00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:27.050
although Henry was increasingly under the influence of conservative figures,

526
00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:32.260
he never lost his trust in Thomas Cranmer and indeed he shielded Cranmer from

527
00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:37.940
enemies who would have loved to bring about his fall.

528
00:31:40.710 --> 00:31:45.710
And after the discovery of Catherine Howard's actual adultery and 1542 and her

529
00:31:47.101 --> 00:31:47.934
execution,

530
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:53.550
the king was much less influenced by his more conservative advisors.

531
00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:57.340
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

532
00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:02.340
<v 0>certainly the gradual drift of the 1530s in the direction of some kind of neo</v>

533
00:32:05.261 --> 00:32:08.350
Lutheran reform of doctrine had halted,

534
00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:14.500
but England's religion under Henry and his later years was not full orthodoxy.

535
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:17.200
Parish religion was not as it had been.

536
00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:20.710
The culture of the saints and the shrines and the relics had been greatly

537
00:32:20.711 --> 00:32:21.544
reduced.

538
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.740
The cult of purgatory was gone.

539
00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:25.810
The monasteries were gone.

540
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:28.780
I'd on the more positive side,

541
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:32.500
a new vernacular religious culture using the English Bible,

542
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.920
an English service books had come into being

543
00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:38.880
and if really,

544
00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:44.620
truly doctrinally Protestant people were still very much a minority.

545
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.560
They were a growing minority and to some extent a powerful minority.

546
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:55.850
They included some very powerful people whose potential influence was out of all

547
00:32:55.851 --> 00:32:57.200
proportion to their numbers.

548
00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:02.920
Cranmer was still the archbishop and he favored and helped reformers in the

549
00:33:03.711 --> 00:33:05.600
universities and in the church.

550
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:11.260
In 1543 Henry's last Queen Queen Catherine Parr was who was as much his nurse as

551
00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:14.513
his queen,

552
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:19.880
came into a position of authority and she again showed great sympathy towards

553
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:24.970
reform the so called Seymour Circle at court.

554
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:28.970
Those gathered around Edward and Thomas Cmo,

555
00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:31.010
the brothers of Henry's dead,

556
00:33:31.011 --> 00:33:32.720
Queen Jane Seymour,

557
00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:37.780
and the uncles of young Prince Edward also favored Protestantism and above all,

558
00:33:39.561 --> 00:33:41.930
perhaps in their direct influence,

559
00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:46.670
the tutors who were appointed to the young Prince Edward and to his sister,

560
00:33:46.671 --> 00:33:49.700
Princess Elizabeth appointed by Archbishop Cranmer.

561
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.400
We're all closet Protestants.

562
00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:59.090
So all of this was the legacy of the Henry [inaudible] reformation.

563
00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.750
It had not been a truly Protestant reformation,

564
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:07.820
but I think it marked a far more significant break with tradition than is

565
00:34:07.821 --> 00:34:09.650
sometimes recognized.

566
00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:11.573
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

567
00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:13.561
<v 0>Okay.</v>

568
00:34:13.561 --> 00:34:15.810
Let's move on now to a fourth phase.

569
00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.900
The Edwardian reformation,

570
00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:25.870
Henry the eighth of last guide in January,

571
00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:30.870
1547 age only 56 though he'd been in a state of some decrepitude for years and

572
00:34:32.711 --> 00:34:36.400
the new King King Edward was only nine and a half years old.

573
00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:40.750
And that of course is another of those contingencies that helped to shape the

574
00:34:40.751 --> 00:34:41.950
history of the reformation.

575
00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:43.481
Edwards,

576
00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:48.481
Uncle Edward Seymour led a group of reformed minded man and taking control at

577
00:34:49.481 --> 00:34:50.620
the center of power.

578
00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:55.830
Seymour was appointed protector of the young Prince and Duke of Somerset,

579
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.810
now as a Duke of Somerset and protect a CMO and his friends.

580
00:35:01.811 --> 00:35:05.290
Prime interest was advancing their own power and influence,

581
00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:10.060
but there's little doubt that he was also off sincere Protestant views.

582
00:35:11.410 --> 00:35:12.430
And in that context,

583
00:35:12.431 --> 00:35:16.510
archbishop Cranmer was able to exercise far more influenced and he had since

584
00:35:16.511 --> 00:35:17.530
1539

585
00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:20.170
the changes in religion,

586
00:35:20.171 --> 00:35:22.360
which were brought about in the next two and a half years,

587
00:35:22.361 --> 00:35:27.361
suggest a very high degree of commitment of these men at the center.

588
00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:33.270
They may not have known in 1547 just how far they were going to go,

589
00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:37.260
but they certainly intended to go further than Henry the eighth hat and they

590
00:35:37.261 --> 00:35:39.870
acted swiftly once they had the power.

591
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
In 1547 parliament was persuaded to repeal the heresy laws and the six articles,

592
00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:49.140
no more burning of Protestants.

593
00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:55.040
They issued reformist injunctions for the removal of images and the obliteration

594
00:35:55.441 --> 00:35:59.070
of religious paintings by white washing them in the churches.

595
00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.460
That's where in those paintings I described to you in Saint Agatha's,

596
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:07.260
ESB were whitewashed only to be discovered again 400 years later.

597
00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.200
A book of homilies was issued.

598
00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:15.210
Official sermons of broadly Lutheran sympathy in their doctrine,

599
00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:20.010
religious guilt and confraternities were suppressed and their goods were

600
00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:21.990
confiscated by the crown.

601
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:26.820
In 1548 communion was allowed in both kinds.

602
00:36:26.821 --> 00:36:31.080
That is both bread and wine were administered to the Laity in the Protestant

603
00:36:31.081 --> 00:36:31.914
style,

604
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:37.550
and in 1549 Cranmer issued a prayer book and an act of uniformity to insist upon

605
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.463
its use,

606
00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.880
which was at least half Protestant in doctrine.

607
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:53.220
That prayer book brought a brief rebellion in the west of England,

608
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.560
the so called prayer book rebellion,

609
00:36:55.561 --> 00:37:00.180
which centered in the counties of the southwest and led briefly to the siege of

610
00:37:00.181 --> 00:37:05.181
Exeter before a royal army arrived to disperse the rebels and to follow their

611
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:09.090
dispersal with the savage repression of this resistance.

612
00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:14.450
Something like 4,000 rebels were either killed or executed immediately after the

613
00:37:15.751 --> 00:37:16.584
rebellion.

614
00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:23.540
As a result though Somerset's dominance in the council was shaken and he was

615
00:37:24.001 --> 00:37:26.850
replaced as a central figure by John Dudley,

616
00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:28.350
the Duke of Northumberland.

617
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:30.810
That change at the center,

618
00:37:30.811 --> 00:37:31.231
however,

619
00:37:31.231 --> 00:37:33.690
did not lead to any change in religious policy.

620
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:34.560
In fact,

621
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:39.560
Dudley backed additional innovations in order to keep the support of Archbishop

622
00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:44.190
Cranmer and indeed the favor of the young king himself.

623
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.930
Edward,

624
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:46.860
by this time,

625
00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:52.070
had emerged as a youth of pronouncedly evangelical Protestant beliefs and

626
00:37:54.331 --> 00:37:57.300
inclinations verging indeed on bigotry.

627
00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:01.700
He was often described as the young Josiah Biblical figure,

628
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:06.300
the young king who would bring true reform and cleansing of the church.

629
00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:08.960
<v 2>Okay.</v>

630
00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:09.681
<v 0>In particular,</v>

631
00:38:09.681 --> 00:38:11.150
in 1552,

632
00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:11.781
uh,

633
00:38:11.781 --> 00:38:14.780
further prayer book was issued a revised prayer book.

634
00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:18.710
This one decisively and openly Protestant.

635
00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:20.650
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

636
00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:25.570
<v 0>And it was backed in 1553 by an emphatically Protestant statement of faith.</v>

637
00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.280
The 42 articles.

638
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.801
Okay,

639
00:38:30.801 --> 00:38:31.730
let's take stock.

640
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:37.030
The Church of England under Henry the eighth was a peculiarity,

641
00:38:37.031 --> 00:38:42.031
personal blend of doctrinal orthodoxy with elements of reform in worship and

642
00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:43.594
practice.

643
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.950
But a true Protestant minority had emerged,

644
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:52.960
especially in London and the southeast and among certain powerful members of the

645
00:38:52.961 --> 00:38:57.961
social elite and under the boy King Edward the sixth and is to read regents.

646
00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:04.150
True Protestant reform moved ahead rapidly over six years.

647
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:10.140
By 1553 the church of England was clearly Protestant in doctrine and in forms of

648
00:39:10.781 --> 00:39:14.320
worship centered on the English Bible and on the prayer book,

649
00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:19.840
and the nation had become deeply divided in matters of faith.

650
00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:23.353
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

651
00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:27.290
<v 0>and that leads us to the fifth phase of this process,</v>

652
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:29.870
the Marion reaction,

653
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:39.230
Edward the sixth the boy king died of pulmonary tuberculosis only a month after

654
00:39:41.611 --> 00:39:46.611
the issue of the Protestant 42 articles of religion and the wheel turned again.

655
00:39:51.490 --> 00:39:52.190
<v 2>Okay.</v>

656
00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:54.680
<v 0>Desperate to avoid loss of power.</v>

657
00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:00.460
The Duke of Northumberland proclaimed as Queen Lady Jane Gray,

658
00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:06.610
the nearest Protestant successor who could be named except Princess Elizabeth,

659
00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:11.480
who was left out because she was still stigmatized as illegitimate.

660
00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.460
Henry the eighth his daughter,

661
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:17.623
Mary,

662
00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:20.840
who at this time was living in seclusion in east Anglia,

663
00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.750
was not willing to accept this.

664
00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:27.740
As a daughter of King Henry and of Catherine of Aragon,

665
00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:31.430
she raised support amongst the gentry of East Anglia,

666
00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.180
formed an army and began to move towards London.

667
00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:38.240
The Duke of Northumberland lost his nerve.

668
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:39.591
He disbanded,

669
00:40:39.591 --> 00:40:40.424
his troops,

670
00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:43.490
capitulated and gave himself up.

671
00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:50.050
So after the turmoil of the previous 25 years,

672
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:55.530
Mary had become queen after all the thing Henry had sought,

673
00:40:55.531 --> 00:40:57.710
so hard to avoid had happened.

674
00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:00.130
<v 2>Okay.</v>

675
00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:04.960
<v 0>How far Mary's success in being able to raise troops and finding widespread</v>

676
00:41:04.961 --> 00:41:07.930
support for her succession to the crown,

677
00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:08.710
uh,

678
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:13.540
how far it was a result of the fact of her tutor blood and that she clearly was

679
00:41:13.541 --> 00:41:18.541
the direct heir or how far it depended upon the appeal of the fact that she was

680
00:41:19.421 --> 00:41:23.170
known to be deeply loyal to the old religion.

681
00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:25.000
That's an open question,

682
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.090
but a deeply loyal Catholic.

683
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.070
She certainly was.

684
00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:35.340
Her young life had been blighted by the disillusion of her mother's marriage and

685
00:41:36.201 --> 00:41:40.910
the kings subsequent actions she clung as part of our very identity.

686
00:41:40.911 --> 00:41:45.911
You could say to the old religion and her subsequent policies bear the stamp of

687
00:41:47.601 --> 00:41:48.434
that,

688
00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:54.070
and they also reveal just how divided the nation had become by the stage.

689
00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:02.170
Late in 1553 soon after her excession parliament was persuaded to Repeal Edwards

690
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.600
Act of uniformity,

691
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:09.560
which had enforced uniform Protestant worship in the nation.

692
00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.060
Interestingly though,

693
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:16.300
80 members of parliament were brave enough to oppose that action.

694
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.970
Early in 1554,

695
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:21.740
Mary married,

696
00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:24.380
she married Prince Philip of Spain,

697
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.640
the future King Philip.

698
00:42:25.641 --> 00:42:29.450
The second and that marriage was accepted by parliament,

699
00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:34.480
though with great reluctance and only after the suppression of a brief flurry of

700
00:42:36.291 --> 00:42:40.700
rebellion in Kent where it's a Thomas Wyatt led a small army to try to seize

701
00:42:40.701 --> 00:42:43.550
London and prevent the Spanish Spanish marriage.

702
00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:46.010
The citizens of London shut the gates against him.

703
00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:48.320
He was defeated and executed.

704
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:51.223
Then

705
00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:57.370
in the fall of 1554 full papal jurisdiction was restored in England.

706
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:01.640
Cardinal Reginald Paul,

707
00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:06.740
Great English churchmen who'd been living in exile in Italy arrived to absolve

708
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:11.270
the realm from its schism and was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury.

709
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:13.070
But interestingly,

710
00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:14.450
he was only,

711
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:14.820
uh,

712
00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:15.110
the,

713
00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:20.110
the absolution of England from schism was only accepted after the pope had

714
00:43:21.741 --> 00:43:26.741
agreed that monastery land would remain with those who had been granted it or

715
00:43:27.351 --> 00:43:32.351
who had purchased it under Henry the eighth that would not be restored to the

716
00:43:32.361 --> 00:43:33.194
church.

717
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.511
England.

718
00:43:35.511 --> 00:43:37.130
Dan was part of the Catholic fold.

719
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.820
Again,

720
00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.020
though on terms,

721
00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:44.900
many Protestant ministers in the church were deprived of their livings and many

722
00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:46.670
of them went into exile abroad.

723
00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:49.820
Universities of Oxford and Cambridge were also purged.

724
00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:55.120
Some 60 members of Cambridge colleges and some 80 members of Oxford colleges

725
00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.260
went into exile abroad.

726
00:43:57.530 --> 00:44:02.530
Something like 800 ministers or laymen and their families of pronouncedly

727
00:44:02.631 --> 00:44:07.631
Protestant belief also went into exile from December,

728
00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:08.840
1554,

729
00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:13.840
those who remained in England faced the penalties of a revival of the Heresy

730
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:15.530
Act,

731
00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:16.940
punishing heresy with death.

732
00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.970
And the burnings began

733
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:25.310
between 50 and 55 and 15.

734
00:44:25.311 --> 00:44:26.144
58,

735
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.090
over 300 people were burned at the stake.

736
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:35.960
Some of them were amongst the most notable figures of the Henry Schein and

737
00:44:36.001 --> 00:44:38.370
Edwardian church bishops,

738
00:44:38.371 --> 00:44:43.371
Latimer and Ridley to leading Protestants were burned at Oxford in 1555 Latimer.

739
00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:47.730
They were burned facing each other,

740
00:44:48.090 --> 00:44:48.630
uh,

741
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:50.460
in the marketplace at Oxford.

742
00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:51.120
Uh,

743
00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:56.120
Latimer famously calling out to Ridley as the flames came up,

744
00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.700
be brave master Ridley play the man.

745
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:06.350
Archbishop Cranmer was also burned at Oxford in 1556 he had temporarily recanted

746
00:45:07.501 --> 00:45:10.260
his Protestantism from his fear of death,

747
00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:14.280
but then went back on his recantation,

748
00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:20.570
declared openly his commitment to the new religion and is burned in 1556 holding

749
00:45:21.931 --> 00:45:23.400
out into the flames.

750
00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:27.180
The hand with which he had signed his recantation.

751
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.340
This hand hath offended.

752
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:30.533
He said

753
00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.810
most of the people who are burned,

754
00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:34.111
however,

755
00:45:34.111 --> 00:45:35.430
we're not the great leaders of the church,

756
00:45:35.431 --> 00:45:36.420
but humble people,

757
00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.360
most of them from London and the southeast.

758
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.193
In fact,

759
00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:43.140
almost half the burnings took place in London,

760
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:44.190
in the city of culture,

761
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:46.110
and in Canterbury.

762
00:45:47.100 --> 00:45:50.790
The southeast was the focus of Protestant strength.

763
00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:53.010
They were usually lay people.

764
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:54.810
Only a 10th of them were clergymen.

765
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:56.460
They were often young.

766
00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:02.360
Most of them were under 30 and a very high proportion of those executed where

767
00:46:02.941 --> 00:46:04.980
around 20 years old.

768
00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:10.730
These were people who had never really known the old religion until had grown up

769
00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:15.990
in the new and proved prepared to die for it.

770
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:17.701
Well,

771
00:46:17.701 --> 00:46:22.410
the effects of this holocaust of Protestant resistance are debatable.

772
00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.290
Certainly Mary,

773
00:46:25.530 --> 00:46:30.530
her bishops and her advisors had simply never expected the resistance to be so

774
00:46:31.501 --> 00:46:33.990
widespread or so prolonged.

775
00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:40.260
But the fact that Mary persisted in her policy to the end really does her,

776
00:46:40.261 --> 00:46:41.094
no honor.

777
00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:44.280
If she had no reason to love her father's memory,

778
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.571
it's clear,

779
00:46:45.571 --> 00:46:50.571
at least that she shared his implacability with those who opposed her.

780
00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:52.590
And by doing so,

781
00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:57.780
the persecution helped to cement England's religious divisions and associated

782
00:46:57.781 --> 00:47:02.310
the old religion with a level of persecution that was wholly unprecedented.

783
00:47:02.970 --> 00:47:06.480
They'd never been religious persecution of this intensity.

784
00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.310
And indeed it was intense,

785
00:47:08.311 --> 00:47:09.660
not only by English standards,

786
00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:13.350
but by the standards of continental Europe at the time.

787
00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:16.171
Well,

788
00:47:16.171 --> 00:47:19.800
what might have happened given more time,

789
00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:22.290
we'll never know

790
00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:27.210
because Mary died in November,

791
00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:28.680
1558 aged only 42

792
00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:35.530
Christopher Hayes suggest us have a number of other recent historians that

793
00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:40.510
Harrain appears to be an aberration.

794
00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:45.960
Only in hindsight he thinks she might have succeeded had she began been given

795
00:47:46.481 --> 00:47:47.314
time,

796
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.800
Protestant resistance would have lessened the old religion,

797
00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:54.520
would have become reestablished fully a normalized,

798
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.150
and perhaps that may well be the case,

799
00:47:59.650 --> 00:48:04.300
but there's also a sense in which one could say her reign was regarded by at

800
00:48:04.301 --> 00:48:08.080
least some as a temporary interlude even before her death.

801
00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:14.970
Mary was 37 when she came to the throne 38 when she married a Spanish prince who

802
00:48:18.941 --> 00:48:21.310
was usually absent from her abroad,

803
00:48:21.311 --> 00:48:23.200
seeing to the affairs office,

804
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:24.640
other possessions.

805
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:27.640
She was childless dis data.

806
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:30.760
A couple of Phantom pregnancies which gave her hope.

807
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:36.150
She had little prospect of bearing and air despite her desperate hopes both for

808
00:48:38.201 --> 00:48:42.430
herself and for her faith for Mary.

809
00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:47.650
All this was undoubtedly a personal tragedy and it's been suggested that she

810
00:48:47.651 --> 00:48:52.390
died in a state of profound depression in her last months.

811
00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:58.330
Both those who supported her and those who opposed her,

812
00:48:59.020 --> 00:48:59.853
knew

813
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:06.180
that in the background was another claim to the throne Princess Elizabeth,

814
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:11.350
and that her accessioned to the throne would almost certainly bring about

815
00:49:11.351 --> 00:49:13.690
another alteration in religion.

816
00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:14.763
To some degree,

817
00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:17.800
it could be anticipated well in advance.

818
00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:23.080
What they didn't know though what at this time after the twists and turns of the

819
00:49:23.081 --> 00:49:28.081
generation between 1527 and 1558 it would last and it would last partly because

820
00:49:30.551 --> 00:49:33.100
of the nature of the religious settlement,

821
00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:38.280
which Elizabeth introduced partly because of the way in which she was able to

822
00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:43.650
defend it and partly for another very simple contingent reason.

823
00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:50.260
When Elizabeth was proclaimed queen on the death of her sister on November the

824
00:49:50.261 --> 00:49:55.261
17th 1558 she was only 25 years old and she lived to be 70

825
00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:00.430
and more of that next week.
