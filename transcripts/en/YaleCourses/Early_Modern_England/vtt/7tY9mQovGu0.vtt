1
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.161
Okay.

2
00:00:02.161 --> 00:00:02.281
Well,

3
00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:06.030
last time I was presenting a kind of panorama of economic expansion,

4
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:07.290
um,

5
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.080
on the whole very upbeat story.

6
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.250
Um,

7
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.230
it helps to explain how the long population growth of the late 16th and early

8
00:00:16.231 --> 00:00:17.280
17th centuries,

9
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.761
uh,

10
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:19.530
was able to be sustained.

11
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.470
And yet as the final table on last times handout showed,

12
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.330
there's also reason to doubt whether the expansion was sufficient or whether the

13
00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:35.331
new wealth that was being created was well enough distributed in society to

14
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:37.500
avoid some real problems,

15
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.850
especially real wages continue to fall.

16
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.320
And there were complaints of a growing problem of poverty and vagrancy.

17
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.590
So there are paradoxes in the situation.

18
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.350
And to get the economic expansion into perspective,

19
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.540
we have to look a little more closely at how it actually impacted on people from

20
00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.340
different social groups.

21
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.171
Inevitably,

22
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:03.300
that involves a certain amount of generalization,

23
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:06.990
but I'll also try to give you examples of people from different groups,

24
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:09.720
which will help to give it something of a human face.

25
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.640
So let's start by looking as usual at the top and at what was happening to the

26
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:18.091
landlords,

27
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:18.690
the Gentry,

28
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.523
the nobility.

29
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.830
It's really one of the striking features of English society in this period that

30
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.160
many of the nobility and gentry identified themselves very closely with economic

31
00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:32.640
innovations.

32
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.800
They're imperative was to maintain and if possible,

33
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:40.350
expand their estate incomes.

34
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.370
And in doing so they became very deeply involved in the commercial restructuring

35
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:47.700
of the country's economy.

36
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.510
That's rather unusual for a traditional ruling class on the whole such people

37
00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.780
tend to rely more upon their social privileges than upon trying to improve their

38
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:00.900
competitiveness.

39
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.690
But certainly the gentry and the aristocracy or many of them did make real

40
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:08.250
efforts of that kind.

41
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.050
Uh,

42
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.540
and you get basically an acceleration of the trends which had already become

43
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:15.030
visible in the mid 16th century.

44
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.690
A lot more careful management of their estates in order to produce more from

45
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:25.851
their home farms for the market and in order to get a greater rental income that

46
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:30.330
often involved extending the use of leasehold tenure,

47
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:31.561
tenure of land,

48
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:36.561
just like a modern lease and wiping away the old rather inflexible customary 10

49
00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:41.160
years so that they had a more flexible management of their rental income.

50
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.090
There was also something I touched on last time,

51
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.740
a good deal of reorganizing their estates into enclosed farms for which they

52
00:02:49.741 --> 00:02:51.060
could get better rents.

53
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:52.830
And in general,

54
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.100
every effort being made to edge rents upwards when opportunity arose.

55
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.100
And in general,

56
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.560
the landlord class did pretty well.

57
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.930
Of course a lot depended upon the fortunes of particular individuals and their

58
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:10.180
personal quirks and characteristics.

59
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.601
Uh,

60
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:10.901
to take,

61
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:11.351
for example,

62
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:15.490
the Vernie family who had substantial estates in Buckingham Shirt just to the

63
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:16.600
northwest of London.

64
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.740
Um,

65
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.910
so Redmond Vernie who lived in the late 16th and dirty 17th centuries,

66
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.690
um,

67
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.530
was a man who was principally interested in forging a political career at court.

68
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.720
That was very expensive.

69
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.140
He had to sink a lot of his income into fortifying his position at the center.

70
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:35.351
And as a result,

71
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:37.600
he incurred pretty considerable debts.

72
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.890
Um,

73
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.420
he succeeded quite well.

74
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.871
Uh,

75
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:42.100
he became King Charles,

76
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:43.450
the first standard bearer.

77
00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.871
In fact,

78
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:47.230
he died in one of the earliest battles of the English civil war,

79
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:48.700
bearing the king's standard,

80
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.200
but his son.

81
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.510
So Ralph was a rather different nature.

82
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.010
You actually took a different side in the industry of a war and when the war was

83
00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:57.281
over,

84
00:03:57.281 --> 00:04:02.281
he devoted himself assiduously to restoring and improving the rather depleted

85
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:05.470
inheritance he received from his father

86
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.030
involved in all the kinds of measures of estate state management that I've

87
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.620
briefly mentioned.

88
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.551
Indeed,

89
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:14.510
Sir Ralph was so keen to um,

90
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.270
rebuild the family's fortunes,

91
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.960
um,

92
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:18.310
that when his first wife died,

93
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.780
he remained celibate.

94
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:20.770
He didn't remarry.

95
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.260
He didn't want any more children.

96
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.700
He didn't want the risk of the estate having to be divided amongst more

97
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.330
children.

98
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.330
Since he already had a number who had survived infancy.

99
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.180
So different personalities,

100
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.800
different outcomes,

101
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:38.170
but all part of the same process.

102
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:39.790
In general,

103
00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.900
the income of the gentry and the nobility was expanding

104
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.430
and much of it was spent not only upon extending and improving their estates,

105
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.130
but upon various kinds of conspicuous consumption.

106
00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.480
It's a great age for the rebuilding of the manor houses of the gentry.

107
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:04.240
Many of the lovely country houses which still survive,

108
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:08.770
were built in this period or rebuilt as well as some of the great prodigy houses

109
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:09.311
of the age,

110
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:12.310
the Great Mansions Burley House near Stanford,

111
00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:15.400
which is up here in east Anglia or um,

112
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.740
cut the hall in Northampton chips and other very good example that's over here.

113
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.980
The splendid mansion from this period which survives.

114
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.300
They went in for more elaborate furnishing and lifestyles.

115
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.921
And in addition,

116
00:05:29.921 --> 00:05:33.010
this was a period when many of the gentry and the ability,

117
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:35.800
the wealthier ones began to spend part of the year in London.

118
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.460
It sees the develop the beginnings of the development of what became known as

119
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:40.510
the London season,

120
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.110
the habit of spending the winter in town and being absent from their estates,

121
00:05:46.991 --> 00:05:49.480
which are run by stewards for long periods of the year.

122
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.940
This resulted in something of a,

123
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.070
an urbanization of gentry culture,

124
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.180
something which has been recently well studied by,

125
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.960
by Julia Merit in a book on the emerging west end of London,

126
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.340
the elite aristocratic enclaves around the royal palaces.

127
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:10.790
To give you an idea of the kind of proportion of these people who might be in

128
00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:15.791
town in 1632 king Charles the first in the circumstances of a harvest emergency

129
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:23.681
order the gentry to return to their states to keep order and to see to the needs

130
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.920
of local people.

131
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.450
He had to find 250 members of the nobility and Gentry who were resident in

132
00:06:29.451 --> 00:06:32.780
London didn't go home when they were ordered to do so.

133
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.360
Given that the great gentry and ability numbered perhaps 2000 families,

134
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:42.200
that's a very significant proportion of them who were resident in London and

135
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:44.540
we'll find for failing to go home.

136
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.750
Well if this was a good time on the whole for landlords,

137
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.300
if they used the opportunities sensibly,

138
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.290
if we turn to their tenant tree to the Yeoman and husband,

139
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:59.000
when one finds a more checkered picture,

140
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.980
opportunities to improve incomes were also common amongst the more substantial

141
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:07.244
farmers.

142
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.750
Those who had a big farm with a substantial surplus to market,

143
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.260
we're actually very well placed to benefit from rising prices and for the growth

144
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:20.210
of the market for their products,

145
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.510
be it food stuff or agricultural raw materials.

146
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.500
Many of these Yeoman were extremely commercially astute and very good example as

147
00:07:29.931 --> 00:07:34.870
a man called Robert loader is his name whose farm accounts survive from the

148
00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:35.780
1610s.

149
00:07:35.781 --> 00:07:39.650
He lived just to the west of London in the county of [inaudible].

150
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.000
Uh,

151
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.890
Robert loader calculated every year exactly how much money he was making from

152
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:46.850
different crops.

153
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:52.190
He took decisions about how to vary his cropping pattern in accordance with

154
00:07:52.191 --> 00:07:53.240
price trends,

155
00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:55.460
especially in the prices which you could get in London,

156
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:56.810
uh,

157
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.380
and so forth.

158
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:02.380
He even went so far at one point to as to actually calculate the value of the

159
00:08:02.481 --> 00:08:05.460
Dung that his pigeons deposited it,

160
00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:06.440
his pigeon loft.

161
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:10.730
He figured it out what it was worth to him if he used it as a fertilizer in his

162
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:11.564
gardens.

163
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:13.400
This is,

164
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:15.920
this is commercial rationality of a high order.

165
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:17.331
He also,

166
00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:22.310
he also calculated how much money his horse has made for him over and above what

167
00:08:22.311 --> 00:08:23.180
he had to feed them.

168
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.380
He then proceeded to do the same calculation for servants.

169
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.823
Um,

170
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.370
well,

171
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:33.370
Robert loader had nothing to learn about economic rationality and his basic

172
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:38.960
attitudes and not untypical of this kind of substantial yeoman farmer.

173
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.520
Many such people were willing to expand their operations if they got the

174
00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:44.211
opportunity.

175
00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:46.340
If land came available on the local land market,

176
00:08:46.341 --> 00:08:47.330
they would snap it up.

177
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.700
They were able to pay higher rents.

178
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.260
They were an excellent competitive position and as a result you get a general

179
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:55.470
shift in Loland dinged,

180
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:59.820
done towards the building up of larger farms in the county of Essex,

181
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:00.570
for example,

182
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:01.890
here to the east of London.

183
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.780
It's very commercially oriented.

184
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.060
By the early 17th century,

185
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:11.061
9% approximately of the tenants held 61% of the land built up in these large

186
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.000
yeoman holdings.

187
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.290
And there's abundant evidence of the prosperity of the yeomanry.

188
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.670
It was a great age for them.

189
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:26.070
This period has been described by historians of housing as the age of the great

190
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.210
rebuilding.

191
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.310
And by that they mean not only the houses of the Gentry,

192
00:09:29.311 --> 00:09:30.450
which I've already mentioned,

193
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:35.810
but the houses of the yeomanry is a period when many of the farmhouses inherited

194
00:09:36.151 --> 00:09:39.570
from the late medieval period were being remodeled.

195
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.011
It was very common.

196
00:09:41.011 --> 00:09:41.880
For example,

197
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.840
they tended in the late medieval period to be what was known as a whole house.

198
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.610
Um,

199
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:47.791
uh,

200
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:51.750
which was basically one large room with some partitions and the fireplace,

201
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:56.070
which would the smoke from which would just be admitted to a hole in the roof.

202
00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.030
Um,

203
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:01.920
this is a period when you see people building great central chimney stacks so

204
00:10:01.921 --> 00:10:04.380
that they could have fireplaces and get rid of the smoke,

205
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.660
making the whole of the interior more comfortable.

206
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.990
They tended to divide off the top of the house and to make separate private

207
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:16.590
chambers above and frequently they would add staircases of course,

208
00:10:16.591 --> 00:10:17.430
to get up there.

209
00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.580
They might extend their homes in all kinds of ways.

210
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.380
Many of these houses,

211
00:10:22.381 --> 00:10:26.010
the great yeoman houses of this period survive to this day.

212
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:31.860
When you look at the inventories of these people which were taken when they

213
00:10:31.861 --> 00:10:32.490
died,

214
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.930
they also reveal a marked increase in the value of their household goods and in

215
00:10:36.931 --> 00:10:40.080
the elaboration of the types of goods that people possessed.

216
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.180
William Harrison,

217
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.660
a clergyman who described all of this happening in the later years of

218
00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:50.580
Elizabeth's reign said that despite the fact that higher rents were being paid,

219
00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:54.000
many of the villages in his area,

220
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.160
the yeoman farmers are the ones he was thinking of.

221
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.211
We're able,

222
00:10:57.211 --> 00:11:02.211
he said yet to find the means to obtain and achieve such furniture as here to

223
00:11:03.481 --> 00:11:05.400
for has been unpassable.

224
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:11.180
And he went on to specify what that involved joined furniture made by join us

225
00:11:11.221 --> 00:11:13.980
proper joined chairs rather than stools.

226
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.180
Nice tables,

227
00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:20.210
bedsteads soft furnishings as a proliferation in inventories of cushions.

228
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.100
And if carpet cloths,

229
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.520
carpets where these would oriental carpets being imported by the Levant Company,

230
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.150
they were put on tables.

231
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.620
You didn't put a carpet on the floor.

232
00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:32.790
It's far too valuable for that.

233
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:34.860
You put it on the table to decorate the table.

234
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:35.850
Uh,

235
00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:36.683
some,

236
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.280
uh,

237
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.520
representations of interior scenes in this period show that the carpet across

238
00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:46.170
the table and you find them also having more elaborate table and more elaborate

239
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.400
kitchen where all sorts of odd products turning up in their inventories.

240
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:51.660
Apple toasters,

241
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.553
for example,

242
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.920
an apple toaster,

243
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.390
something crate and barrel perhaps should try to imitate and to hold in the fire

244
00:11:58.391 --> 00:11:59.224
with an apple in it.

245
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.153
And so on.

246
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.720
All kinds of things.

247
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:06.250
It's been described by one historian of material culture as a new household

248
00:12:06.251 --> 00:12:08.110
culture with much greater comfort,

249
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.830
much greater convenience being enjoyed by these people.

250
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.770
They could also put their money into other things,

251
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.100
bigger dowries for their daughters so they could marry well.

252
00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.260
A study of Kent shows the,

253
00:12:20.261 --> 00:12:21.640
in the reign of Elizabeth,

254
00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:27.010
the dowries being paid by Yeoman with their daughters rose six fold in the

255
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:28.210
course of her reign.

256
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.650
And they could also spend the money to have their sons apprenticed into trade,

257
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.910
into professions,

258
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.930
sent to school in some cases even to the universities.

259
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.390
Something that returned to and another occasion,

260
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:42.371
well,

261
00:12:42.371 --> 00:12:47.371
the yeomanry with a big fish of village society,

262
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:51.700
things were a little more difficult for the little minnows.

263
00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.470
The smaller guys,

264
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.140
the family farming Husbandman,

265
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.370
some of them did fine.

266
00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:58.930
If they live near a city,

267
00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:00.910
they might have good marketing opportunities.

268
00:13:00.911 --> 00:13:05.170
They could specialize in producing fruit or market gardening or dairying and

269
00:13:05.171 --> 00:13:06.130
could do pretty well.

270
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.920
You also get a lot of husband when diversifying their activities into part time

271
00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.370
industrial activity,

272
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:13.121
uh,

273
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:15.970
over in the West Midlands in the metalworking districts.

274
00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:17.350
The inventories of,

275
00:13:17.351 --> 00:13:17.920
um,

276
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.850
size makers,

277
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:19.430
for example,

278
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:20.680
can be quite interesting,

279
00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.430
um,

280
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:24.970
indicating that these people were engaged in farming,

281
00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.820
but also in producing sides.

282
00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.180
Blades on the side,

283
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.590
they had forges.

284
00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.323
Um,

285
00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:35.320
generally they would work at that in the slack periods of the agricultural year.

286
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.170
But for many of these small guys,

287
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.780
the period was fraught with risk.

288
00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:45.610
The crucial issue was whether they could sustain their small farming economy

289
00:13:45.611 --> 00:13:47.260
under changing conditions.

290
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.040
These were the people who would have most difficulty meeting higher rents.

291
00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:52.751
They might have,

292
00:13:52.751 --> 00:13:53.050
uh,

293
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.060
a poor competitive position.

294
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.511
Uh,

295
00:13:55.511 --> 00:14:00.511
one agricultural writer described them as weak and unstopped husbandman.

296
00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.130
They lacked capital,

297
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.260
they produce smaller crops,

298
00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:06.490
they made smaller profits,

299
00:14:06.491 --> 00:14:07.780
they had fewer livestock.

300
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:13.350
They couldn't really seriously contemplate indulging in expensive or risky

301
00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:15.340
innovations.

302
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.920
And they were also very vulnerable to temporary crises like those produced by

303
00:14:20.921 --> 00:14:22.090
bad harvests,

304
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.300
which could wipe out their surplus and forced them into debt.

305
00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:31.530
Some of these people became vulnerable and we're driven to the wall and their

306
00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:35.440
land was taken up by more ambitious neighbors.

307
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:36.430
And in general,

308
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.830
there's a diminution in the numbers of these small farmers.

309
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.420
As the big farms are growing,

310
00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:45.510
many of the small ones are disappearing whittling away of small tenancies,

311
00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:51.380
which in turn made it rather difficult for the young to get onto the land to

312
00:14:51.381 --> 00:14:52.610
establish a foothold.

313
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:59.530
More of the young people from rural families after their period as servants in

314
00:15:00.201 --> 00:15:04.190
the households of larger farmers were more likely to spend their lives as

315
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:07.340
agricultural wage laborers then getting land of their own.

316
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:14.150
So the fortunes of different groups in rural society varied.

317
00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:16.490
They're broadly fairly clear.

318
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:20.540
One can generalize with some confidence in the towns.

319
00:15:20.541 --> 00:15:22.640
The picture's a little less clear.

320
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:27.530
Clearly there was a lot of commercial development and business opportunity,

321
00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:31.340
but this was a period when business was fraught with risk.

322
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:35.240
Finding the capital to set up could be difficult.

323
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.960
Keeping businesses going could be difficult in a period when cash flow could be

324
00:15:41.481 --> 00:15:42.530
hard to manage.

325
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.970
People had to keep a good balance between their debts and credits that could be

326
00:15:46.971 --> 00:15:47.810
very difficult.

327
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:53.110
Accumulation of wealth was often very slow and even the successful could be

328
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.480
wiped out by temporary economic crises.

329
00:15:56.481 --> 00:15:57.291
By fraud,

330
00:15:57.291 --> 00:15:58.370
by fire.

331
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.310
There's no fire insurance by shipwreck does,

332
00:16:01.311 --> 00:16:04.520
no marine insurance and so forth.

333
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:11.500
It was to try to counter some of these insecurities that some of the principle

334
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.200
merchants of England cities preferred if possible,

335
00:16:15.201 --> 00:16:18.140
to be members of chartered trading companies.

336
00:16:18.830 --> 00:16:22.280
Those companies which had a monopoly of particular branches of trade,

337
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:27.290
the ones I mentioned last time and which lay down rules for the conduct of the

338
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:28.910
trade rules,

339
00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:33.860
which were generally aimed at securing stable profits for all the members of the

340
00:16:33.861 --> 00:16:38.861
company and to restrict the numbers of people who were involved in particular

341
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.453
trades.

342
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:47.170
It's true that no trading monopoly could protect a merchant from shipwreck or

343
00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:50.240
piracy or the collapse of demand,

344
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:52.520
but nonetheless,

345
00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:57.140
one can generalize to some degree about the way in which they fed.

346
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.890
For some who were members of established companies,

347
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.150
things could go pretty well.

348
00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:03.200
Take for example,

349
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:04.760
the Levant Company,

350
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:08.150
the Van Company traded to the Mediterranean,

351
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.240
especially the eastern Mediterranean in 1570 it was founded by the early 17th

352
00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:20.150
century to become a member of the van company meant laying down two to 300

353
00:17:20.151 --> 00:17:21.980
pounds as membership fee.

354
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.520
Quite a substantial sum of money by the early 17th century.

355
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.353
Also,

356
00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:31.540
this company has been described as I'm quoting a highly ramified network of

357
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.460
interconnecting family relationships.

358
00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:39.050
The members of which are often related to one another and controlling a great

359
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.790
share of the trade.

360
00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:46.600
One contemporary described them as born rich and adding wealth to wealth by

361
00:17:46.761 --> 00:17:50.100
trading in a beaten road to wealth.

362
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:56.180
In 1627 there were only 24 men who controlled 54% of the Levant trade.

363
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:04.190
So members of the great companies having established the trade could restrict it

364
00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:09.831
in various ways in order to ensure some stability in their trading lives.

365
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.730
It has members of that company who will later to go on to found east India

366
00:18:14.731 --> 00:18:15.564
company.

367
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:18.103
<v 1>Well,</v>

368
00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:19.540
<v 0>in addition though,</v>

369
00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.730
there were certain additional opportunities.

370
00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:25.000
Another way to prosper if you had the nerve,

371
00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:26.170
and we'll take the risks.

372
00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:31.570
What's to get involved in pioneering altogether new trades at the most

373
00:18:31.571 --> 00:18:36.571
significant of those where the American traits with the earliest establishment

374
00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:38.620
of colonies in America,

375
00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.380
the initial opportunities,

376
00:18:41.381 --> 00:18:45.520
we're not obviously good and many members of established trading companies were

377
00:18:45.521 --> 00:18:50.521
reluctant to invest that left the path open for those who are prepared to take

378
00:18:51.941 --> 00:18:53.140
the risks of involvement.

379
00:18:53.141 --> 00:18:56.920
And very often those have got involved in the American trades where man of

380
00:18:56.921 --> 00:18:58.840
lesser standing in the merchant community,

381
00:18:58.841 --> 00:18:59.710
smaller merchants,

382
00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:00.910
even shopkeepers,

383
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:01.930
ship's captains,

384
00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:04.150
people like that who are willing to get involved.

385
00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:05.253
New Men,

386
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.333
you could say

387
00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:10.320
<v 1>they built up</v>

388
00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:11.823
<v 0>as you know,</v>

389
00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:15.150
a very substantial trade in the course of the early 17th century did.

390
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.960
Just to give you an example of one of these people.

391
00:19:16.961 --> 00:19:18.430
The man called Maurice Thompson.

392
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.780
Mrs. Thompson was the youngest son of a gentry family.

393
00:19:22.810 --> 00:19:24.610
He got a little bit of capital from his family,

394
00:19:24.611 --> 00:19:25.600
but not much more.

395
00:19:25.601 --> 00:19:27.220
He didn't inherit the family estate.

396
00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.340
You came from Hartfordshire just sort of north of London.

397
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.300
How He came to go to Virginia is uncertain,

398
00:19:34.301 --> 00:19:38.770
but he was there by the time he was in his mid teens and he got involved on the

399
00:19:38.771 --> 00:19:41.290
ground floor with the development of the tobacco trade.

400
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:42.390
Uh,

401
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:44.380
pretty soon he owned land.

402
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:45.910
He owned a ship.

403
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.560
He became involved in the trade in tobacco and in the supply of goods needed by

404
00:19:50.561 --> 00:19:51.241
the colonists.

405
00:19:51.241 --> 00:19:52.830
She expanded his operations.

406
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:54.190
He married well.

407
00:19:54.191 --> 00:19:57.850
He became a significant figure amongst the leaders of the Virginia colony as

408
00:19:57.851 --> 00:19:58.684
quite a young man.

409
00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.980
By the time he was in his early thirties,

410
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:02.110
he was back in London,

411
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:03.250
uh,

412
00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:04.470
managing much of the,

413
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.260
a good part of the Virginia trade from his base there.

414
00:20:08.261 --> 00:20:12.520
And indeed he went on to expand his operations to become involved in the Indian

415
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:17.520
Ocean and in other ventures if you're interested in that kind of person and that

416
00:20:17.741 --> 00:20:18.670
kind of development.

417
00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.300
Um,

418
00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.410
Robert Brenna's book,

419
00:20:20.411 --> 00:20:21.700
merchants and revolution.

420
00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:26.940
The first section is a splendid depiction of these shifts and developments in

421
00:20:28.511 --> 00:20:31.060
the last years of Elizabeth and under the early stewards

422
00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.630
at lower levels in the urban hierarchy,

423
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:41.220
the capital that people needed to set up in business was gradually growing.

424
00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.970
That made it a little more difficult to establish yourself as an independent

425
00:20:44.971 --> 00:20:45.804
master.

426
00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:51.050
And a great many people had to be content with serving as skilled craftsmen,

427
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.450
working for others,

428
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.930
whereas previously they might have hoped to become independent masters,

429
00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.230
even skilled employees,

430
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:04.320
we're often forced to work longer and more intensively if the work was available

431
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.690
in order to sustain their living standards.

432
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.670
To give you a specific example of this,

433
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:14.080
I've got some figures here relating to building craftsman from the town of how

434
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:15.430
on the east coast.

435
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:20.110
Donald Woodward in a very imaginative piece of research,

436
00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:22.810
worked out the price of food stuffs,

437
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:28.150
found the wages being paid to craftsman of different kinds,

438
00:21:28.151 --> 00:21:31.870
and then figured out how many days you would need to work to feed husband,

439
00:21:31.871 --> 00:21:32.201
wife,

440
00:21:32.201 --> 00:21:33.130
and three children.

441
00:21:33.131 --> 00:21:34.480
So here are some of his fingers.

442
00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.870
The best paid man in the fifties and sixties could have fed their families with

443
00:21:37.871 --> 00:21:42.871
153 days work by the 1630s with rising prices and wages are not rising so fast.

444
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.690
229 days.

445
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:52.140
The worst paid 192 days in the fifties and sixties 306 by the 1630s so this was

446
00:21:55.631 --> 00:21:59.050
the experience of some of the craftsmen of the towns.

447
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:01.360
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

448
00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:05.950
<v 0>In short then urban manufacturers and the urban manufacturing system was</v>

449
00:22:05.951 --> 00:22:06.970
becoming less small,

450
00:22:06.971 --> 00:22:11.350
master based and rather than more capitalistic Lee structured with a larger

451
00:22:11.351 --> 00:22:15.340
proportion of urban craftsman having to cope with the difficulties and

452
00:22:15.341 --> 00:22:18.550
uncertainties of their dependence upon wage labor.

453
00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:21.083
<v 1>Okay.</v>

454
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:21.520
<v 0>Well,</v>

455
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:22.353
much of the true,

456
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:27.540
much of the same was true of the industries of the countryside in Somerset

457
00:22:27.881 --> 00:22:29.380
church in the West country.

458
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:34.510
Had the cloth industry was the major industry in the 1620s one contemporary

459
00:22:34.511 --> 00:22:39.040
described the multitudes of poor cottages which where to be found in the cloth

460
00:22:39.041 --> 00:22:41.190
weaving areas and he continued.

461
00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.360
They are stuffed with poor people which get most of their living by spinning by

462
00:22:46.871 --> 00:22:51.871
carding and such employments about wool and cloth and they gained a living most

463
00:22:53.141 --> 00:22:53.621
of the time,

464
00:22:53.621 --> 00:22:56.110
but he added that when trade was dead.

465
00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:58.270
They know not how to live

466
00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:07.850
in town and country like then what contemporary is described as the laboring

467
00:23:08.061 --> 00:23:08.894
poor

468
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.990
was emerging as a larger,

469
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:17.660
more wage dependent population emerged probably half the population by the mid

470
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:20.810
17th century to judge by surviving tax listings,

471
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:27.890
agricultural intensification and the diversification of industry and urban

472
00:23:27.991 --> 00:23:28.800
growth.

473
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.890
All meant that there was more work for such people,

474
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.330
but the work was often seasonal.

475
00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:38.070
It was often insecure.

476
00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:42.840
There was a lot of under employment difficulty finding five days work a week and

477
00:23:42.841 --> 00:23:43.674
so forth,

478
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:49.670
and there was the constant pressure of greater numbers of people on the labor

479
00:23:49.671 --> 00:23:54.671
market and it was this really that issued in what's sometimes described as a

480
00:23:55.161 --> 00:24:00.050
problem of structural poverty of large number of people whose way of life,

481
00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:05.080
who's very way of life on a day to day basis meant periodic hardship was almost

482
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.903
inevitable.

483
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:09.373
Some of the time.

484
00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:14.900
People who faced a situation in which the rate of pay for the Labor was such as

485
00:24:14.901 --> 00:24:18.680
to mean a declining capacity to meet the needs of their households

486
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:23.930
and that produced a distinct lifecycle amongst the laboring poor.

487
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.390
They could manage pretty well until they had to say to children are so they

488
00:24:29.391 --> 00:24:32.720
might even have a little bit of disposable income to spend on manufactured

489
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:33.554
goods,

490
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:39.100
but once they had too many mouths to feed or if the chief breadwinners felt sick

491
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:42.650
or injured or if there was a trading depression,

492
00:24:42.651 --> 00:24:47.651
they could be plunged immediately into real hardship and in old age,

493
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.550
if they reached old age,

494
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:54.080
they almost inevitably would be dependent upon charity.

495
00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.260
Many of these people survived by what's been described as an economy of

496
00:25:00.261 --> 00:25:01.010
makeshifts.

497
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.250
It's a phrase of all when Huffington's and economy of make shifts,

498
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.200
you get by as best you can,

499
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:11.180
doing what you can cottaging where they could using the Commons if they were

500
00:25:11.181 --> 00:25:12.014
available,

501
00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.090
gleaning the fields after the harvest.

502
00:25:14.091 --> 00:25:18.440
The poor were allowed to glean for grains of corn in the fields after harvest

503
00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.190
and finding various kinds of assistance from their family,

504
00:25:22.191 --> 00:25:27.170
from their neighbors moving around when there seemed to be better opportunities

505
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:29.030
to piece together a living.

506
00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:34.220
And for that reason they tended to become concentrated in certain areas where

507
00:25:34.221 --> 00:25:35.990
there's opportunities existed.

508
00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:40.070
It was a rather unsettled life for many of them.

509
00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.130
I'll give you a couple of examples of these people.

510
00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.060
Um,

511
00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:45.140
Margaret Noseley,

512
00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.660
she came from Nantwich in Cheshire.

513
00:25:47.661 --> 00:25:52.661
There's a name she's visible in the wreck chords between 1613 and 1629 she was

514
00:25:54.771 --> 00:25:55.820
married to a laborer.

515
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.720
We know that she had 10 children between 16,

516
00:25:59.721 --> 00:26:04.370
13 and 1629 five of her children died in infancy.

517
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.770
Something of her working life survives in various records.

518
00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:15.040
She worked as an alewife making and selling Ale.

519
00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:20.240
She worked as an agricultural laborer during the appropriate seasons.

520
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.310
She did some stocking knitting.

521
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:26.090
She acted as a cleaner for the minister of the parish.

522
00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.140
Um,

523
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.380
she's thought to have practiced some forms of medical skills.

524
00:26:30.381 --> 00:26:33.260
She had some skills in aspects of midwifery.

525
00:26:33.261 --> 00:26:38.261
Apparently she was alleged also from time to time to have solicited men for

526
00:26:38.601 --> 00:26:39.434
money.

527
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:44.740
So that's an economy of make shifts indeed or another.

528
00:26:44.881 --> 00:26:45.601
Such person,

529
00:26:45.601 --> 00:26:46.710
Henry Savory.

530
00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:48.600
He's visible in the records between 16,

531
00:26:48.601 --> 00:26:50.460
29 and 1636,

532
00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.631
he came from sto,

533
00:26:51.631 --> 00:26:54.690
barred off in the county of Suffolk.

534
00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.470
We know a little about Henry and 1629,

535
00:26:58.471 --> 00:26:59.130
he was,

536
00:26:59.130 --> 00:26:59.430
uh,

537
00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:00.390
he was a servant.

538
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.130
He left service and instead of engaging himself to a new master,

539
00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:06.420
decided to go to London.

540
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:08.610
Once he got to London,

541
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.920
he found it difficult to find regular work.

542
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.560
So he signed on for a voyage on a ship.

543
00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:14.820
Uh,

544
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.140
but he wasn't a very good sailor.

545
00:27:16.141 --> 00:27:19.350
By the time the ship had got out into the Thames estuary,

546
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:23.700
he was suffering from chronic seasickness and his legs were swelling up.

547
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:24.930
So finding him,

548
00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:25.591
no use to him.

549
00:27:25.591 --> 00:27:30.270
The ship master put into shore and just landed him and discharged him.

550
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:32.940
He went back to London.

551
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:39.420
Then he was taken by the constables as a vagrant and sent home to stove,

552
00:27:39.421 --> 00:27:43.040
barred off in 1635 he decided to try it,

553
00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.340
his fortunes again.

554
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:49.230
He left stow barred off after haymaking where he'd earned a total of seven

555
00:27:49.231 --> 00:27:49.741
shillings.

556
00:27:49.741 --> 00:27:51.420
He had seven shillings in his purse.

557
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:53.910
He went to the county of Suffolk,

558
00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:54.180
uh,

559
00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.500
further into the county of Suffolk and worked in various farms there for three

560
00:27:58.501 --> 00:28:03.090
months and then he went off to London again once again.

561
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.650
He found it difficult to find regular work,

562
00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:07.980
so he began working up and down the country as he described it.

563
00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:13.100
He got as far north as New York and then made his way back again back in London.

564
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.570
He found himself once again,

565
00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:20.810
arrested as a vagrant and sent home to Norfolk and there we lose track of Henry

566
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.951
Savory.

567
00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:24.870
He vanishes from the records.

568
00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:30.810
That's exactly the kind of person moving around,

569
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:32.490
trying to earn a living where he could,

570
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.790
who might've been the sort of person who would have signed on with a ship master

571
00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:40.791
in London to become an indentured servant in the new colonies in Virginia and

572
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:42.633
Maryland.

573
00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:46.740
And indeed many people who found their way to London but couldn't find a place

574
00:28:46.741 --> 00:28:48.540
there did just that.

575
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:49.350
Uh,

576
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:54.350
in London there was an institution charged with the oversight of the vagrant

577
00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:56.003
poor.

578
00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:56.580
Uh,

579
00:28:56.580 --> 00:29:01.580
the bridewell and the governors of the bridewell actually dispatched over 1100

580
00:29:02.611 --> 00:29:06.010
people to Virginia and the West indies between 16,

581
00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:08.340
18 and 1658.

582
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:09.701
At first,

583
00:29:09.701 --> 00:29:10.441
they were mostly men,

584
00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:11.640
about 90% men,

585
00:29:11.641 --> 00:29:13.020
but by the 1630s,

586
00:29:13.021 --> 00:29:15.630
about a third of them are close to a third world women.

587
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:22.970
Two thirds of these people who were sent had been taken by the officers on the

588
00:29:23.131 --> 00:29:24.660
streets of London.

589
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.490
Some of them were accused of crime.

590
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.370
They might've been accused of being picked pockets or thieves,

591
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.460
but most of them was simply out on the streets.

592
00:29:32.461 --> 00:29:37.461
They were described as out after curfew or night walkers that was just loitering

593
00:29:38.071 --> 00:29:39.750
suspiciously on the streets at night.

594
00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:40.680
Um,

595
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.130
some of them were former servants who had no place and we're on the streets.

596
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:46.300
Uh,

597
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.690
and they were sent by the bridewell to the new colonies.

598
00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:50.470
Uh,

599
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:54.580
one of those who was sent gave his occupation as balancing it,

600
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:59.620
which makes me wonder if that's the origins of country music.

601
00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:01.163
Um,

602
00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.193
I'm serious.

603
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:02.680
Um,

604
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.151
in the,

605
00:30:03.151 --> 00:30:03.984
uh,

606
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:09.270
in the early 20th century songs connected by folklorists in the Appalachians,

607
00:30:09.971 --> 00:30:13.750
many of those songs can actually be traced back to print balance,

608
00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:17.830
which are known to have been sung on the streets of London in the late 16th and

609
00:30:17.831 --> 00:30:19.060
dirty 17th centuries.

610
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:20.210
They did,

611
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:24.370
they passed into the oral culture of the Appalachian area.

612
00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:26.530
Well,

613
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:30.790
one can go on about these people is a wonderful recent book by Paul Griffiths

614
00:30:30.791 --> 00:30:31.990
called Las London's,

615
00:30:31.991 --> 00:30:34.510
which looks closely at them through the records of the Brightwell.

616
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.730
The Brightwell kept excellent records.

617
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:41.790
They even kept physical descriptions of some of the people they dealt with so

618
00:30:42.101 --> 00:30:44.770
that they could identify them if they turned up again.

619
00:30:44.771 --> 00:30:46.810
And so we have descriptions of,

620
00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:46.980
you know,

621
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:47.180
their,

622
00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:48.280
their stature,

623
00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:54.070
slender wells set thick set one was described as great,

624
00:30:54.071 --> 00:30:54.904
gutted

625
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:57.580
their complexion,

626
00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:57.761
you know,

627
00:30:57.761 --> 00:30:59.080
sallow high colored,

628
00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:00.423
bright,

629
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:01.563
sad,

630
00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:03.190
a sad complexion,

631
00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:06.250
described the hair color flaxen,

632
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.640
dark brown betwixt Orban and flaxen.

633
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:11.530
All these descriptions are entered in the books,

634
00:31:11.531 --> 00:31:12.364
their clothing,

635
00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.820
a woman found on the streets wearing a red petticoat and the white upper bought

636
00:31:16.821 --> 00:31:17.654
us

637
00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:22.720
so poor but colorfully dressed some of course,

638
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:22.930
uh,

639
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:24.760
we're beggars who weren't near naked.

640
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.370
You get descriptions also of their medical condition,

641
00:31:27.371 --> 00:31:27.670
you know,

642
00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:29.170
pockmarked in his face,

643
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:33.790
a small scar upon his forehead burned in the hand.

644
00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:38.200
That means someone had been found guilty of a crime and branded for future

645
00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:43.410
identification and sometimes they were suffering from disease palsy.

646
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.510
Scurvy skulled headed it.

647
00:31:48.511 --> 00:31:49.450
That was very common.

648
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.161
It meant a,

649
00:31:50.161 --> 00:31:52.060
a kind of scalp condition.

650
00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:53.643
Uh,

651
00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:54.580
one man,

652
00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:57.220
one of a boy actually described as his toes,

653
00:31:57.221 --> 00:31:58.600
almost rotted off.

654
00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.020
Others were mentally ill,

655
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:03.303
crack brained,

656
00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:04.750
silly,

657
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:05.583
simple.

658
00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.120
That's how they're described.

659
00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.110
Uh,

660
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:12.460
one description that arrested me when reading this was a northern man by his

661
00:32:12.461 --> 00:32:13.294
speech.

662
00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:15.850
Hi colored beard,

663
00:32:15.851 --> 00:32:20.440
close cut mingled with white hair in a manner crazed.

664
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:27.820
And then you get those people on the streets of London who had no known

665
00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:28.803
identity,

666
00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:29.581
uh,

667
00:32:29.581 --> 00:32:29.890
you,

668
00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:31.330
they turn up in the past wreck chords.

669
00:32:31.331 --> 00:32:33.160
The parish of sent Bollard Bartholome user,

670
00:32:33.161 --> 00:32:33.994
for example,

671
00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:39.190
gave assistance to a beggar who turned up at the church who had no name.

672
00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:39.800
Uh,

673
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.190
they put him down in their account books as money given to Bothell them.

674
00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.440
You need both of them.

675
00:32:45.441 --> 00:32:46.274
You need,

676
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:50.240
because he came to Saint Bartholomew's church and you find the children who were

677
00:32:50.241 --> 00:32:51.320
left on the streets.

678
00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.130
Um,

679
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:55.760
often when they were taken in by parish authorities,

680
00:32:55.761 --> 00:32:56.780
they would give them a name.

681
00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:02.080
Michael Found Joan found basket baby found in a basket porch wall.

682
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:10.850
She was found in the porch of the Church of Saint Andrew by the wall.

683
00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:15.380
So they baptized her porch wall and so on.

684
00:33:15.381 --> 00:33:20.381
Could go on Joan mad or those who are sometimes buried in the parish is found

685
00:33:20.661 --> 00:33:21.560
dead on the streets.

686
00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:22.160
John,

687
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.830
no name Jane.

688
00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:25.813
Nobody.

689
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:36.640
So England's increasing income was very unevenly distributed.

690
00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:40.100
It was an expanding economy,

691
00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:44.090
but one with an expanding problem of structural poverty.

692
00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:48.650
It was a commercializing society in which there were great opportunities,

693
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:52.640
but many of those who had nothing to sell but their labor.

694
00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:57.700
We're in a poor competitive position and in an exceedingly risky environment.

695
00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:02.450
Of course some aspects of those insecurity where perennial,

696
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:07.730
but at times they could become particularly acute and the Times that stand out

697
00:34:07.731 --> 00:34:11.000
are the 1590s which was a time when the harvest failed.

698
00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.590
Four years in a row,

699
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.630
foot prices rocketed.

700
00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:19.400
The weaknesses in the economy were revealed and there was widespread misery.

701
00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:20.330
Indeed,

702
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:20.910
in the years,

703
00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:25.910
1596 to 50 98 there was actual famine in the most vulnerable areas.

704
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:31.210
Parts of the far north northwest in particular and parts of the far west is

705
00:34:31.611 --> 00:34:34.400
evidence of actual death from starvation.

706
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:39.970
The 1620s was another decade when they were bad harvests combined in this case

707
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:43.310
with an industrial depression,

708
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:48.230
war in Europe or dislocated at the markets for some of the goods that England

709
00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.480
export it leading to industrial depression.

710
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:55.750
There was widespread unemployment and poverty in many of the weaving areas and

711
00:34:56.451 --> 00:34:57.284
again,

712
00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:02.290
some sinister evidence of actual famine in some of the most exposed areas.

713
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.520
These were the hardest years,

714
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:09.290
really acute crisis of that kind of course were exceptional,

715
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:13.670
but they reveal the weaknesses within society as a whole.

716
00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.150
So how to conceptualize all of this.

717
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:21.140
Very often historians talk about these decades,

718
00:35:21.141 --> 00:35:26.141
these generations at the turn of the 16th and early 17th centuries as witnessing

719
00:35:26.421 --> 00:35:31.421
a process of social polarization and the some obvious truth in that there's a

720
00:35:32.511 --> 00:35:37.511
real divergence going on in living standards and in life chances in a more

721
00:35:37.741 --> 00:35:40.050
competitive commercialized economy,

722
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:44.820
but it's also in some ways more comp complex than simply the notion of

723
00:35:44.821 --> 00:35:46.050
polarization.

724
00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:47.611
In many ways,

725
00:35:47.611 --> 00:35:52.440
the social structure was re articulating into a sort of three part form.

726
00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:58.230
There were greater opportunities on the one hand to acquire and to consolidate

727
00:35:58.231 --> 00:35:59.064
wealth.

728
00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.900
There was a greater population of laboring poor on the other hand,

729
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.280
both of which we've looked at,

730
00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.300
but there was also the elaboration of what contemporaries were beginning to

731
00:36:09.301 --> 00:36:14.010
describe as the middle sort of people between the gentry and the poor.

732
00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:17.760
Successful manufacturers and tradesmen,

733
00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:19.500
substantial yeoman farmers,

734
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:24.660
increasing numbers of people involved in professions like the law and medicine

735
00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.740
and the offering of services of other kinds,

736
00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:28.351
surveyors,

737
00:36:28.351 --> 00:36:32.190
Clark's land agents and so far so forth.

738
00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:36.210
So it all depends on how one looks at it.

739
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:39.450
You can focus your attention upon the real polarization.

740
00:36:40.530 --> 00:36:45.090
You can also take account of these middling groups who are doing quite well.

741
00:36:45.091 --> 00:36:47.670
But whichever way one looks at it,

742
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:52.910
it's clear that the old medieval conception of a society simply describable in

743
00:36:53.221 --> 00:36:58.221
terms of three estates had gradually decomposed under the pressure of economic

744
00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:00.900
and social change.

745
00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:06.620
And Society was gradually recomposing itself adopting a new shape under the

746
00:37:07.951 --> 00:37:11.040
pressure of various economic fields of force.

747
00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:18.070
And that transition involved not only shifts in the structure of society,

748
00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:23.070
but also shifts in people's attitudes and values.

749
00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:30.020
By the early 17th century decades of cumulative economic and social change meant

750
00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:35.690
that economic relationships and forms of behavior which had previously appeared

751
00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.190
new and rather threatening.

752
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.920
We're becoming more normalized,

753
00:37:40.921 --> 00:37:42.240
more taken for granted,

754
00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.180
and some traditional values,

755
00:37:45.181 --> 00:37:48.000
we're losing some of their older moral force.

756
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:50.370
And you can see that in various ways,

757
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:55.170
but a good example is to look very briefly at the problem of enclosure.

758
00:37:55.171 --> 00:38:00.171
The classic issue of Great Symbolic Significance in agrarian society.

759
00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:03.330
As you know,

760
00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:07.680
in the mid 16th century and closure had been demonized as something which was

761
00:38:07.681 --> 00:38:09.900
damaging to the wellbeing of the Plowman,

762
00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:12.510
to the strength of the nation,

763
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:17.990
destructive of households and of the Commonwealth and throughout the latest 16th

764
00:38:18.331 --> 00:38:19.650
and early 17th centuries,

765
00:38:19.651 --> 00:38:24.651
actual enclosure schemes were very often opposed by coalitions of tenants and

766
00:38:25.471 --> 00:38:30.090
commoners who tried to defend their customary ways against the initiatives of

767
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:31.860
landlords and others.

768
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.380
And we look at that again when I look at popular protest.

769
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:40.390
But meanwhile the debate over enclosure was gradually shifting.

770
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:46.230
You get that shift reflected in parliament in 1,601 there was a debate on the

771
00:38:46.481 --> 00:38:48.700
enclosure laws and whether or not to repeal them.

772
00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.740
Sir Robert Sessile,

773
00:38:51.070 --> 00:38:52.450
son of William sessile,

774
00:38:52.451 --> 00:38:53.800
Elizabeth's chief minister,

775
00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.890
speaking on behalf of the Privy Council,

776
00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:57.790
said,

777
00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.240
I think that whosoever does not maintain the plow,

778
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:02.411
destroy earth,

779
00:39:02.411 --> 00:39:05.320
this kingdom very much the traditional attitude towards enclosure,

780
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:07.420
he was opposed by Sir Walter Raleigh.

781
00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:07.840
Yes,

782
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.980
these Walter Raleigh,

783
00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:10.420
um,

784
00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:13.210
who said he agreed that,

785
00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:14.103
um,

786
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.063
uh,

787
00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:17.230
there was a situation,

788
00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.520
uh,

789
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.730
which must be faced regarding agricultural change,

790
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.330
but he argued that there were lots of countries in Europe which could produce

791
00:39:25.331 --> 00:39:30.331
corn cheaper than England could and therefore it should be important rather than

792
00:39:31.151 --> 00:39:34.030
insisting upon maintaining land under the plow.

793
00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:39.430
He argued that every man should use this land to its best advantage and she'd be

794
00:39:39.431 --> 00:39:40.660
at liberty to do so.

795
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:42.160
Leave every man free,

796
00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:42.940
he said,

797
00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.830
to pursue his economic interest.

798
00:39:44.831 --> 00:39:47.680
So we have the voice of economic individualism,

799
00:39:47.681 --> 00:39:48.610
opposing sessile

800
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:54.220
debates like that in parliament reveal a graduate process of transition in

801
00:39:54.221 --> 00:39:55.060
attitudes,

802
00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:59.230
tensions and shifts between older and newer attitudes.

803
00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:04.480
And that tension was revolved in various resolved in various ways,

804
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:07.450
sometimes by authoritative adjudication,

805
00:40:07.451 --> 00:40:10.060
by government decisions in parliament or the Privy Council,

806
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:13.300
often by sheer expediency,

807
00:40:13.301 --> 00:40:18.301
by people gradually adjusting themselves voluntarily or reluctantly to the

808
00:40:19.091 --> 00:40:21.820
demands of a changing world.

809
00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.890
In the case of enclosure,

810
00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:28.920
gradually most of the gentry and many leading tenant farmers came to accept its

811
00:40:29.171 --> 00:40:31.720
desirability and the laws against it.

812
00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:36.900
When in fact repealed in 1624 leaving people free to use their land as they saw

813
00:40:37.541 --> 00:40:40.450
best as Raleigh had argued.

814
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:42.911
Well,

815
00:40:42.911 --> 00:40:47.911
the attempts to stabilize and channel change by the use of the law gave way

816
00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:53.370
gradually to attempt simply to alleviate the worst manifestations of change

817
00:40:55.180 --> 00:41:00.180
where it had led to major social distress and the greatest monument to efforts

818
00:41:00.851 --> 00:41:03.760
of that kind where the poor laws,

819
00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:10.200
the crisis years of the nine nineties led to the overhaul and consolidation and

820
00:41:10.631 --> 00:41:15.631
extension by parliament of earlier measures which had been taken in poor relief

821
00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:22.440
resulting in great consolidated statutes of 1598 and 1,601 under those statutes,

822
00:41:25.450 --> 00:41:30.450
a full national system of poor relief was created based upon compulsory local

823
00:41:32.051 --> 00:41:37.051
taxation at the level of the parish administered by officers to be appointed in

824
00:41:37.851 --> 00:41:38.930
every parish

825
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:41.510
under the laws,

826
00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.300
vagrants were to be punished and restrained.

827
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:47.570
Those who are deemed the impotent poor,

828
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:48.201
the agent,

829
00:41:48.201 --> 00:41:48.650
the sick,

830
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:49.483
the orphaned.

831
00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:54.520
We're to be relieved by being paid weekly pensions in their parishes and finally

832
00:41:55.431 --> 00:41:56.630
the laboring poor.

833
00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.550
Those who could get by most of the time,

834
00:41:58.551 --> 00:42:00.650
but native needed occasional relief.

835
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:05.690
We're to be periodically relieved by the parish to enable their families to get

836
00:42:05.691 --> 00:42:10.691
through hard times and where possible work was to be created for them.

837
00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:17.380
So what you have in the poor laws is a mixture of charity and discipline.

838
00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:19.791
In some ways,

839
00:42:19.791 --> 00:42:24.791
the system was quite well devised to deal with the periodic lifecycle crises of

840
00:42:25.371 --> 00:42:26.600
the laboring population.

841
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:27.591
They'll rarely,

842
00:42:27.591 --> 00:42:28.424
generously,

843
00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:34.840
it was a system which in many ways demonstrated England's relative wealth.

844
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:37.820
There was a tax base there to pay for it,

845
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.160
but it was one of course which also demonstrated how unequally distributed that

846
00:42:43.161 --> 00:42:45.530
wealth was in one parish.

847
00:42:45.531 --> 00:42:46.011
For example,

848
00:42:46.011 --> 00:42:50.240
the parish of Corsten in Norfolk where the laws were put into operation very

849
00:42:50.241 --> 00:42:51.074
early.

850
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:56.680
There was 68 people in the parish out of 167 households who were able to pay the

851
00:42:58.221 --> 00:43:00.260
poor rates to support the system.

852
00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:02.870
At the other end of the scale,

853
00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:06.890
there were 20 households who received weekly pensions,

854
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:10.310
so 68 are paying 20 or receiving pensions,

855
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:11.780
all the ones in between,

856
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:14.300
or neither pain nor in receipt of relief.

857
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:15.590
Though in bad times,

858
00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:19.010
some of those families might receive occasional help.

859
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:27.250
So the poor laws in a way are both a response to and enshrine some of the

860
00:43:30.051 --> 00:43:33.950
changes which are taken place in society at the local level.

861
00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:41.650
I've surveyed then a process of redistribution of wealth in a changing economic

862
00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.400
environment.

863
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:48.410
Economic development had enabled the population of England to grow faster for

864
00:43:48.411 --> 00:43:52.970
longer than was usually the case in other European countries at this time,

865
00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.840
but the benefits of economic growth we're poorly distributed and that showed

866
00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:09.400
population at last began to stabilize in the third decade of the 17th century

867
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.920
and that began to slow down this long term process of change.

868
00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.740
The reasons for that stabilization,

869
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:22.010
we're partly shifts in mortality.

870
00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:27.140
The evidence is that life expectation of birth was deteriorating in the early

871
00:44:27.141 --> 00:44:28.040
17th century,

872
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:33.930
but it was a strained even more by shifts which were taking place in fertility.

873
00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:38.580
Quite significant shifts in the early 17th century.

874
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:42.630
The rates of fertility that can be calculated from the parish registers of

875
00:44:42.631 --> 00:44:47.631
parishes show that marital fertility was falling quite sharply.

876
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:51.960
That was produced in part by rising agent marriage.

877
00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:54.780
People were marrying later and having fewer children,

878
00:44:55.830 --> 00:45:00.830
but it was also produced by a larger proportion of the population never marrying

879
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.333
at all.

880
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:08.550
It was startling when historical demographers discovered that of the people who

881
00:45:08.551 --> 00:45:13.551
were coming up to marriage marriageable age from the 1620s through to the 1650s

882
00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:16.650
people who'd been born around,

883
00:45:16.651 --> 00:45:17.340
um,

884
00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:20.010
1600 to 1610 or thereabouts,

885
00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:25.080
as many as 20% or sometimes even more,

886
00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:29.070
never married to quite extraordinary figure,

887
00:45:29.430 --> 00:45:33.450
a very large proportion of the population remaining unmarried.

888
00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:38.930
What we seem to have here is evidence of a situation in which for those who were

889
00:45:40.141 --> 00:45:43.560
doing least well in the circumstances of the time,

890
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:49.190
life was too insecure or living standards were too marginal for them to be able

891
00:45:50.221 --> 00:45:53.730
to marry and establish independent households of their own.

892
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.380
As a result,

893
00:45:55.380 --> 00:46:00.120
fertility declined population gradually stabilized

894
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:03.420
as population stabilized,

895
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.160
so did prices.

896
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:12.020
The great underlying dynamic of change from the second quarter of the 16th

897
00:46:13.591 --> 00:46:18.591
century through to the mid 17th century was over.

898
00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.230
But that long dynamic of population growth,

899
00:46:22.231 --> 00:46:27.231
inflation and its many consequences in economy and society had unleashed

900
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:30.060
economic changes,

901
00:46:30.061 --> 00:46:31.500
which would not be reversed.

902
00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:36.890
And they had significantly reconfigured the structure of society and the

903
00:46:37.711 --> 00:46:39.390
relationship between its members.

904
00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:41.821
So with that,

905
00:46:41.821 --> 00:46:46.821
I've tried to briefly set the scene for you and now we can go on to look at a

906
00:46:48.571 --> 00:46:53.571
number of other aspects of society and culture starting next week with the

907
00:46:53.941 --> 00:46:58.941
issues of witchcraft and popular literacy and crime.
