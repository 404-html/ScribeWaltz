1
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:01.921
Right.

2
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:02.011
Well,

3
00:00:02.011 --> 00:00:05.550
I want to turn to date to some of the political developments of the early 17th

4
00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:06.300
century.

5
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.133
Um,

6
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.570
in reading about and discussing the Tudor monarchy,

7
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.340
we've looked at the development of a political system,

8
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:16.800
which was in many ways highly centralized,

9
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.340
but at the same time increasingly participatory and consultative.

10
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.320
In certain matters of state,

11
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.420
the royal will was supreme and the prerogative power of the monarch was

12
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:31.254
paramount.

13
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.560
And yet as Marcus Lansky says,

14
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.620
the constitutional position was that monarchical power was limited by the

15
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:41.910
evolution of its practice.

16
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.890
The progress of power of the prince could not override the liberties of the

17
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:48.630
subject enshrined in law.

18
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.640
And the Monica was also expected to have an eye to the views and the interests

19
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.290
of the broader political nation.

20
00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.920
Those who govern the localities and who acted in a sense as brokers between the

21
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:04.620
royal administration and the nation at large.

22
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.430
Well to that important extent,

23
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.030
the effectiveness of government and the maintenance of political stability

24
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.560
depended on the relationships between the crown and the political nation

25
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.430
as we move into the 17th century.

26
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.350
The essential point of grasp perhaps is that these relationships were never

27
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.184
fixed.

28
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.890
They can turn it contained,

29
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.420
certain gray areas.

30
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.430
There were certain tensions,

31
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.780
certain ambiguities,

32
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.900
and there was nothing new about that.

33
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.500
From time to time they'd surfaced under Elizabeth and they'd been on the whole

34
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.950
handled and resolved.

35
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.290
In the final analysis,

36
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.960
the interests of the crown and the political nation,

37
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.200
we're expected to run together and there was also a strong emphasis in the

38
00:01:54.391 --> 00:01:59.391
political culture of the time on trying to achieve harmony and consensus.

39
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.030
Open conflict was regarded as a sign of failure in the political process

40
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.500
and yet despite all of that,

41
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.140
in the mid 17th century,

42
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.630
that system collapsed.

43
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.480
In 1642 civil war broke out between the crown and the parliament.

44
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.170
In 1649 King Charles the first was put on trial by a High Court of justice

45
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.650
formed from parliament and executed and the republic was declared,

46
00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.700
which lasted for over a decade

47
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.651
now.

48
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:42.651
These were political events of quite extraordinary radicalism for the 17th

49
00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:44.064
century,

50
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.170
kings had been deposed and replaced in the past.

51
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.720
Kings had been killed in battle.

52
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.140
Kings had sometimes been murdered by rival claimants but never before had a

53
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.430
reigning monarch,

54
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.790
been formally put on trial and called to account and then executed as Oliver

55
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.890
Cromwell.

56
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.380
One of the movers of that act put it,

57
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.610
we cut off the king's head with the crown on it.

58
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.670
We cut off the king's head with the crown on it by which he meant that they had

59
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:24.520
tried and executed not just a man,

60
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.470
but an institution,

61
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.630
the institution of Monarchy.

62
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.610
Well such a momentous events perhaps imply very profound causes and as a result,

63
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.760
the political history of the early 17th century has traditionally been reviewed,

64
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.590
been viewed as in many respects a high road to civil war.

65
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.260
That's a phrase which is often used

66
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.370
in looking at the development of the situation.

67
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.700
Traditionally the the so called Wig variant of the story tells a tale of an

68
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:07.111
assertive parliament increasingly anxious to defend its privileges and worried

69
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.240
about the liberties of the subject coming into conflict with monarchs who were

70
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:17.620
trying to extend the sphere of royal prerogative par.

71
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.323
And as a result,

72
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.230
parliament fought back by demanding greater influence on policy.

73
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:26.860
That's the essentials of the traditional story.

74
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.500
There's a Marxist variant on that too,

75
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.740
which argues that behind these political developments behind the assertiveness

76
00:04:34.781 --> 00:04:39.781
of parliament was a growth in the social and economic power of the gentry and of

77
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:43.000
the urban elites of the country.

78
00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.020
People who had done well out of economic change and we're seeking a greater

79
00:04:47.021 --> 00:04:52.021
place in the sun expressing their aspirations in a developing rhetoric of the

80
00:04:52.391 --> 00:04:53.740
liberties of the subject.

81
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.150
In the 1970s and 1980s however,

82
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.210
a more conservative so called revisionist school of historians rejected these

83
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.800
interpretations of the high road to civil war and began arguing that they were

84
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:13.060
essentially the product of hindsight in the view of this school,

85
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.450
there was no deep rooted malaise in the English body politic.

86
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.470
No great clash of fundamental constitutional principles,

87
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.360
no high road to civil war.

88
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.321
Rather,

89
00:05:26.321 --> 00:05:27.640
as they tell the story,

90
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.030
the catastrophe of the 1640s was the result of short term misjudgments and

91
00:05:34.331 --> 00:05:36.940
unforeseen contingent circumstances.

92
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.400
Almost a tragic accident.

93
00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.720
The one which came to have very profound consequences.

94
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.640
Well,

95
00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.910
there's no need to rehearse all the details of these debates at length.

96
00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.320
If they interest you.

97
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.300
Then the introduction to custom Hughes's book conflict in early steward England

98
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:59.270
is an excellent overview of the way the historiography has developed,

99
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.390
but these debates continue and they continue in a sense because the English

100
00:06:05.391 --> 00:06:10.391
civil wars are still being fought on paper because the 17th century was a

101
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:15.500
defining moment in British political history.

102
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.171
Nevertheless,

103
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:21.650
at the moment we seem to be in a phase of what's sometimes described as post

104
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:26.180
revisionism in which historians of the period are increasingly willing to

105
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:28.670
recognize the merits of different arguments.

106
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.441
First of all,

107
00:06:30.441 --> 00:06:35.441
that the traditional interpretation was perhaps a little too teleological and

108
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.160
that the role of short term contingency was neglected in that story,

109
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.290
but on the other hand,

110
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.190
recognizing that in its more extreme manifestations,

111
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:51.191
revisionism is almost willfully short sighted as an interpretation above all,

112
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.440
it fails to take account of the larger context of political life in the nation

113
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.660
and of the changing social and cultural context within which politics took

114
00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:03.494
place.

115
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.971
As a result.

116
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:09.500
It's been said by some critics that the revisionist approach tends to explain

117
00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:11.990
why the English civil war shouldn't have happened,

118
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.881
but they did.

119
00:07:13.881 --> 00:07:14.714
It happen.

120
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.370
They can't explain why people felt so passionately that they were willing to

121
00:07:21.471 --> 00:07:23.720
draw a sword against their fellow countrymen.

122
00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:31.120
So we mustn't assume a particular preordained direction of events.

123
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.880
We mustn't imply an inevitability about the process.

124
00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:40.280
We have to be alive to the importance in politics of contingent circumstances

125
00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.610
and the interventions of specific individuals,

126
00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.470
but at the same time we have to remain aware of the fact that short term

127
00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:53.471
conflict can have a cumulative effect and politics was not conducted in a social

128
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.710
or ideological vacuum.

129
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.111
Well,

130
00:08:02.111 --> 00:08:06.180
to stand back from that for a moment and bring the story through from the acs

131
00:08:06.181 --> 00:08:07.540
session of James,

132
00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:12.541
the first one thing one can say with certainty and that's that in 1,603 when

133
00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:17.050
King James came down from Scotland and was crowned King of England,

134
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.530
no one anticipated the trouble that was to come.

135
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.813
On the contrary,

136
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.620
the mood of the political nation in 1,603 was by and large one of celebration.

137
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.090
They had an adult,

138
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:32.080
adult Monique and experience king who ruled well in Scotland.

139
00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.960
He was a from Protestant and he had two sons.

140
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:36.790
Everything looked great

141
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.420
given the nature of the political system,

142
00:08:40.421 --> 00:08:44.590
the tone of James's rain dependent very much upon the personality of the Monique

143
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.630
and James on the whole.

144
00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:51.520
What's capable of negotiating the ambiguities of the constitutional situation

145
00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:52.630
pretty well?

146
00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.740
There was certainly some in his relationships with parliament when it was cold.

147
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.990
The English parliament,

148
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:06.140
very aware of James's unfamiliarity with its system was jealous of its

149
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:07.254
privileges,

150
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:11.910
anxious that the new Monique should be brought to understand them correctly as

151
00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:12.744
it sold them.

152
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.040
It was rather critical of the king's use of his prerogative power to raise

153
00:09:17.041 --> 00:09:22.041
customs revenues by so called impositions on trade and at the same time it was

154
00:09:23.521 --> 00:09:28.521
deeply suspicious of any financial innovation which might make the crown more

155
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:30.540
independent of parliament.

156
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.520
In 1610 for example,

157
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:36.180
parliament rejected plans for what was called the great contract,

158
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:41.750
which would have granted to the king irregular annual taxation income in return

159
00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:46.980
for abolishing certain antiquated and archaic futile revenues.

160
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:48.023
It failed.

161
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:53.210
They were too anxious to maintain control of the purse for it to go through

162
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.820
on the king's part.

163
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.690
James had a very high conception of his royal prerogative.

164
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:05.040
He regarded the privileges of parliament has having been granted by his

165
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:08.580
ancestors in the past for particular purposes,

166
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:13.620
rather than being fundamental features of a mythical ancient constitution.

167
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:15.660
As some members of parliament believed,

168
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:21.710
he was certainly not used to having such an independent minded body as the

169
00:10:22.141 --> 00:10:23.040
English parliament.

170
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.540
Scotland had a parliament,

171
00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.820
but it was very much under the control of the king.

172
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.800
He was prone to times to lecturing the members of parliament when he believed

173
00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:33.810
them to have encroached upon his sovereignty.

174
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:34.651
But of course,

175
00:10:34.651 --> 00:10:36.960
Elizabeth had done that in her time.

176
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.270
James was also ready to use his power to dissolve parliament when he became

177
00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.680
exasperated with it.

178
00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:47.370
And certainly he didn't call it very often.

179
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:49.830
But nevertheless,

180
00:10:50.130 --> 00:10:53.460
if James had any pretensions to absolute power,

181
00:10:53.461 --> 00:10:55.080
they were strictly theoretical.

182
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:55.890
Uh,

183
00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:00.890
he is once recorded as having told these Spanish ambassador in a conversation

184
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.670
that he marveled,

185
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.200
that his ancestors had created such a body as the English parliament,

186
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:13.220
but he had founded in being when he came to the throne and he was obliged to put

187
00:11:13.231 --> 00:11:14.940
up with what he couldn't get rid of.

188
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:20.160
And so he did like the shrewd and Kenny Monique that he was

189
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:23.490
more broadly,

190
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:27.180
if there were those amongst the political nation who were a little disappointed

191
00:11:27.181 --> 00:11:29.580
with King James after the early years,

192
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.140
once the honeymoon was over,

193
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:36.620
who came to dislike the sometimes rather sleazy tone of his court who disliked

194
00:11:37.621 --> 00:11:42.621
his fondness for favorites or his notorious financial extravagance.

195
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.911
Nonetheless,

196
00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:49.050
there's no reason to believe that the consensual political system was under any

197
00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:52.530
unusual strain during James as rain,

198
00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.500
but if that was the case,

199
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.850
it didn't survive.

200
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.190
The 1620s

201
00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:06.160
1620s turned out to be a decade of mounting crisis and acute political

202
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.920
polarization.

203
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:14.410
A polarization which was vividly reflected in the relations between crown and

204
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:15.244
parliament

205
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.240
and this situation arose from a combination of factors,

206
00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:21.790
partly involve foreign policy difficulties.

207
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.560
It partly involves religion.

208
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:28.570
It partly involved in engagement in war and taxation,

209
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.450
perceived threats to the common law,

210
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.400
and it all came to a focus on the person of one man,

211
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.230
George Villiers,

212
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.910
the Duke of Buckingham,

213
00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:43.360
not Buckingham,

214
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:45.700
was a handsome young man,

215
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:51.210
rather charismatic by all accounts who had come to court and attracted James the

216
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:52.930
first attention.

217
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:57.760
In the late 1610s becoming favorite of the king.

218
00:12:57.761 --> 00:13:02.230
He had been rapidly advanced two titles and to Fortune

219
00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:07.030
well had he just been James's toy boy,

220
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.280
this would not have mattered very much.

221
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.790
The total was bucking him,

222
00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:16.791
was anxious to exercise power by the early 1620s he not only held high office,

223
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.340
but he was also using his position to become increasingly dominant in the

224
00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:26.050
control of royal patronage.

225
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.440
With all that that meant moreover,

226
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:34.680
his ascendancy well established in the later years of King James survived the

227
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:40.351
old king's death bucking him also dazzled Prince Charles and retained his

228
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:44.350
position as royal favorite.

229
00:13:44.351 --> 00:13:49.351
When Charles came to the throne in 1625 by 60 and 28 he appears to have had

230
00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:55.471
virtually a monopoly over influence on policy together with that,

231
00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.900
his manifest in competence rendered him odious in the eyes of the political

232
00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:05.344
nation.

233
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:06.941
So Redwood Cook,

234
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:11.941
the Lord Chief Justice Describe Buckingham as the grievance of grievances.

235
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.480
He was beginning to be seen in the eyes of some of the political nation as the

236
00:14:16.481 --> 00:14:18.790
quintessential bad counselor.

237
00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:26.310
So Buckingham came to provide something of a focus for deteriorating relations

238
00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:29.350
between the crown and the political nation.

239
00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:34.650
But the broad context for that deterioration was provided by other events,

240
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.490
notably events in Europe,

241
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.090
the outbreak and 1618 of the 30 years' war,

242
00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.050
the expulsion from his lands of James,

243
00:14:44.051 --> 00:14:45.160
the first son in law,

244
00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:47.440
the Protestant elector of the palatinate,

245
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:53.150
and the triumphant advance in the 1620s of the Catholic forces of the Habsburg

246
00:14:53.211 --> 00:14:56.900
monarchs of Austria and Spain events,

247
00:14:56.901 --> 00:15:01.901
which were very anxiously followed by many English gentleman as as we've seen,

248
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:09.770
it was essentially the question of England's potential involvement or actual

249
00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:12.590
involvement in this European crisis,

250
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:17.890
which led to the summoning of so many parliaments in the 1620s and it was the

251
00:15:18.261 --> 00:15:20.660
conduct of affairs under Buckingham,

252
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.560
which led members of parliament increasingly to try to exert greater influence

253
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.250
over matters,

254
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.450
which were strictly speaking matters for the royal prerogative.

255
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.390
And that was a situation which began the slide into confrontation.

256
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.430
To sum it all up briefly,

257
00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:49.450
there were five parliaments between 1621 and 1629 three of them were dissolved

258
00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.930
acrimoniously after quarrels between the king and parliament.

259
00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.220
On three occasions,

260
00:15:58.221 --> 00:16:01.040
the king acrimoniously dissolve parliament and sent them home.

261
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.970
The cause of all this was parliaments attempts to exert influence on policy in

262
00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.320
provocative matters of state as the king saw them.

263
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:17.650
Matters of foreign policy matters concerning the marriage of Prince Charles

264
00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:24.410
matters concerning the choice of royal and ministers to conduct policy and

265
00:16:24.411 --> 00:16:26.120
matters concerning religion.

266
00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.680
This developing atmosphere of conflict was made worse when after 60 and 26 king

267
00:16:33.411 --> 00:16:38.411
Charles resorted to measures of questionable the galaxy in order to sustain his

268
00:16:38.631 --> 00:16:40.970
policies and such.

269
00:16:40.971 --> 00:16:45.971
Conflict was fought out in parliament after parliament through assertions of

270
00:16:46.251 --> 00:16:49.460
parliamentary privilege and constitutional principle,

271
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:54.350
which were met by the use of the royal prerogative to dissolve parliament and

272
00:16:54.351 --> 00:16:57.200
silence critics of royal policy.

273
00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.780
That's the essence of it all,

274
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:04.970
but let's run through some of these sort of edited highlights of what happened

275
00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.890
in these parliaments.

276
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.610
The essence of it all is on your handout.

277
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:17.350
In 1621 parliament was called to grant money for some form of action to support

278
00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:20.600
the Protestant elector Palatine,

279
00:17:20.601 --> 00:17:21.121
King James,

280
00:17:21.121 --> 00:17:23.660
his son in law parliament,

281
00:17:23.661 --> 00:17:27.980
voted a modest subsidy to support armies for the Platter Nate,

282
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:33.280
but also petitioned James to declare war on Spain and to abandon the plans which

283
00:17:35.181 --> 00:17:40.181
he had formed to marry Prince Charles to a Spanish princess and to assure assure

284
00:17:41.061 --> 00:17:42.080
a protestant marriage.

285
00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.943
Instead,

286
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.010
King James was furious.

287
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:51.730
His plan for a marriage with Spain was part of a larger scheme to try to end the

288
00:17:52.891 --> 00:17:54.660
polarization within Europe.

289
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:58.710
It was part of his scheme for secure good relations with Spain,

290
00:17:58.711 --> 00:18:02.550
which might help forward and negotiated settlement and their withdrawal of

291
00:18:02.551 --> 00:18:07.551
Spanish troops and he forbade the Commons to meddle in this grand design.

292
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.800
The Commons responded by declaring that the king was interfering with,

293
00:18:13.801 --> 00:18:17.760
I'm quoting the ancient liberty of parliament for freedom of speech.

294
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.150
The same being our ancient and undoubted right,

295
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.420
and an inheritance received from our ancestors.

296
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:30.180
James replied to their liberty or free speech was derived from the grace and

297
00:18:30.181 --> 00:18:35.181
permission of our ancestors and us and should not be abused by the parliament.

298
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:36.900
In matters of state.

299
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.333
There was uproar.

300
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.490
The House of Commons composed of protest,

301
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:45.090
the so called protestation saying that their privileges,

302
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:48.930
what the ancient and undoubted birthright and inheritance of the subjects of

303
00:18:48.931 --> 00:18:53.931
England games responded by dissolving parliament and he personally ripped the

304
00:18:55.021 --> 00:18:57.990
Prato station from the Journal of the House of Commons.

305
00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:00.690
Well,

306
00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:04.620
James did not go to war with Spain as parliament desired,

307
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:07.860
and he persisted with his plans for Spanish marriage.

308
00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:13.580
In 1623 Prince Charles accompanied by Buckingham went to Spain in order to woo

309
00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.950
the Spanish princess Di and Fanta.

310
00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.940
This occasioned massive anxiety in England,

311
00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.810
followed by widespread public rejoicing.

312
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.690
When the marriage negotiations eventually fell through

313
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.040
humiliated by their failure,

314
00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:37.820
Charles and Buckingham now began to exert their influence to back the idea of

315
00:19:38.431 --> 00:19:39.270
war with Spain.

316
00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.680
In 1624 parliament was called again.

317
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.050
It voted money to the crown,

318
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:51.320
but withheld the finance bill until war was reluctantly declared by King James

319
00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:00.200
and England entered the war in alliance with France and alliance,

320
00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:04.620
which involved the marriage of Prince Charles to the French Princess Henrietta

321
00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.450
Maria sister of the King of France,

322
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:11.190
a Catholic who arrived in England with a Catholic entourage,

323
00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.770
including priests and confessors.

324
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.850
In 1625 Charles came to the throne.

325
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:26.330
He was now age 25 parliament met at the beginning of the rain as was customary

326
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.240
and voted money for the continuation of the war,

327
00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:36.170
but it failed to grant the king the usual grant of customs revenue for life.

328
00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:42.000
This was because parliament was unhappy about recent customs in positions which

329
00:20:42.001 --> 00:20:43.740
didn't have parliamentary sanction.

330
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.680
In September of that year,

331
00:20:46.681 --> 00:20:51.681
September of 1625 the Duke of Buckingham led an English naval expedition to

332
00:20:52.361 --> 00:20:54.310
attack the Spanish port of Cadiz,

333
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.760
attempting to emulate the great feat of Francis Drake when he had attack kudus

334
00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:03.790
and a 50 and eighties but Buckingham was not Francis Drake.

335
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:09.060
His expedition was an utter failure demonstrating gross military in competence

336
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.130
on the part of the Duke.

337
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:14.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

338
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:15.760
<v 0>Following that humiliation.</v>

339
00:21:15.761 --> 00:21:19.660
In 1626 parliament met again to provide money for the war.

340
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.950
It proved willing to vote supply to the ground crown,

341
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.490
but it demanded that it's grievances should be rectified.

342
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:30.520
Before the finance bill was finally passed

343
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:37.050
and the grievances were above all a torrent of hostility towards Buckingham and

344
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:42.370
other new counselors influencing the king,

345
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:46.240
notably the Armenian bishops who have been brought into the privy council.

346
00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:52.980
The Commons proceeded to try to draw up articles of impeachment against bucking

347
00:21:53.171 --> 00:21:55.000
him for his incompetence.

348
00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.960
Charles attempted to hold them by illegally imprisoning several members of the

349
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:02.410
House of Commons,

350
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:03.640
and when that failed,

351
00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:08.650
he again dissolved parliament in order to save the Duke from impeachment

352
00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:09.670
proceedings.

353
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.220
No money was granted

354
00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.270
in need of money to finance the war.

355
00:22:17.271 --> 00:22:22.271
Charles and Buckingham now decided to levy a massive forced loan.

356
00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.130
They simply levied what was officially alone,

357
00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:26.270
in fact,

358
00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:30.590
an illegal tax on the tax paying section of the political nation,

359
00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.090
claiming the king's right to do this by prerogative power in conditions of

360
00:22:35.091 --> 00:22:36.620
national emergency.

361
00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:42.910
Over 70 members of the gentry refused to pay and we're imprisoned by the kings.

362
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:45.800
Special Commandment.

363
00:22:45.801 --> 00:22:46.310
Again,

364
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:51.310
a use of prerogative power in prison without trial to make matters worse,

365
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:57.980
bucking him now secured a declaration of war not only against Spain,

366
00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.960
but against France also,

367
00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:04.940
and squandered the force loan money by leading another disastrous naval

368
00:23:04.941 --> 00:23:05.774
expedition.

369
00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:10.750
This time to aid French Protestants who were rebelling against Louis the 13th of

370
00:23:10.751 --> 00:23:15.470
France in the city of La Rochelle on the coast of south west France,

371
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:18.560
another military disaster.

372
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:26.430
This deteriorating situation finally came to a head in 1628 to nine parliament

373
00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:31.531
was called again again to raise money and it met in an ominous mood.

374
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.191
So Benjamin,

375
00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:35.500
Roger at one of the members declared,

376
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.960
this is the crisis of parliaments.

377
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:39.760
We feel no by this,

378
00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:42.580
whether parliaments shall live or die.

379
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.510
The House of Commons started by promising,

380
00:23:47.511 --> 00:23:49.520
devote the king of large sum of money,

381
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.030
but again insisted that their grievances should be heard.

382
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.610
Before the finance bill was finalized,

383
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.710
again,

384
00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:02.240
there was a torrent of complaint concerning grievances arising from the forced

385
00:24:02.241 --> 00:24:05.090
loan and the conduct of the war under Buckingham.

386
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.681
And finally,

387
00:24:06.681 --> 00:24:11.300
all of this was encapsulated in the so called petition of right,

388
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:12.950
the petition of right,

389
00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.840
which was presented to the king requesting that he confirmed the liberties of

390
00:24:17.841 --> 00:24:22.370
the subject threatened by the recent conduct off his government.

391
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:23.540
Specifically,

392
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:27.440
there should be no taxation without parliamentary consent.

393
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:31.730
There should be no arbitrary arrest of subjects.

394
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:37.430
There should be no billeting of troops upon subjects without their consent.

395
00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:41.960
There should be no government of the localities by Marshall Law,

396
00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:46.310
which is something which had occurred in the areas of the kingdom where troops

397
00:24:46.311 --> 00:24:49.010
were billeted prior to Buckingham's expedition

398
00:24:51.290 --> 00:24:53.270
in order to get the necessary money.

399
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:59.140
Charles reluctantly agreed to the petition of right though insisting that in

400
00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:00.861
doing so,

401
00:25:00.861 --> 00:25:03.740
he was not surrendering any of his prerogative powers.

402
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:07.610
That was in June,

403
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:12.610
1628 parliament then adjourned and went into recess and before it met again,

404
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:18.080
the Duke of Buckingham was assassinated in August,

405
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.080
1628 by one of his former officers and event,

406
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:28.180
which was greeted by almost universal public rejoicing throughout England.

407
00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:35.360
One of the few exceptions to that rejoicing being King Charles himself,

408
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:40.930
who was profoundly grieved by the loss of his friend and deeply bitter about the

409
00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:47.741
way Buckingham's murder had been greeted with virtual dancing in the streets

410
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.520
throughout the kingdom.

411
00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.350
In January,

412
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:59.350
1629 parliament reconvened and attempted to press it's advantage there was a

413
00:26:01.641 --> 00:26:06.641
vigorous attack upon the recently promoted Armenian bishops in the church who

414
00:26:07.131 --> 00:26:09.860
were accused of introducing Polish innovations.

415
00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.600
As we heard last time,

416
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:18.070
there was the use of the petition of right to attack the illegality of Charles's

417
00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:20.090
collection of customs,

418
00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:23.900
which he had continued to collect despite the fact that parliament had not

419
00:26:23.901 --> 00:26:26.600
confirmed it's grant of customs revenue.

420
00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:32.660
Charles decided to halt parliament's sitting in this situation,

421
00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.340
but when the speaker of the House of Commons was told to announce the

422
00:26:37.341 --> 00:26:40.070
dissolution of parliament to the Commons,

423
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.920
he was held down in his chair by several the members.

424
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.130
They refused to allow him to announce the dissolution.

425
00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:52.730
The door of the House of Commons was shut against the Kings Messenger and barred

426
00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:58.640
until the Commons led by Sir John Elliot put forward three resolutions to the

427
00:26:59.101 --> 00:26:59.934
house.

428
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:01.890
First of all,

429
00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.980
the resolution that anyone furthering Potpourri or are many aneurysm was to be

430
00:27:07.681 --> 00:27:10.680
considered a capital enemy to this kingdom.

431
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.193
Secondly,

432
00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:18.800
that whoever advised the king to collect customs revenue without parliamentary

433
00:27:19.681 --> 00:27:23.970
consent would also be considered a capital enemy to the kingdom.

434
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:25.703
Thirdly,

435
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:30.270
that anyone paying these duties was an enemy to the liberties of England.

436
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:36.800
These three resolutions were passed by acclamation in the House of Commons and

437
00:27:36.841 --> 00:27:40.140
Charles responded by dissolving parliament.

438
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:44.760
It didn't meet again for 11 years.

439
00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:52.680
Now it's been suggested in recent years that we shouldn't really make too much

440
00:27:52.681 --> 00:27:53.514
of all of this,

441
00:27:55.230 --> 00:28:00.230
that the conflict that scarred political life in the 1620s was sporadic rather

442
00:28:00.661 --> 00:28:01.710
than continuous,

443
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:06.810
that it was a product of particular circumstances in the conduct of the wars in

444
00:28:06.811 --> 00:28:10.650
particular rather than a reflection of growing ideological division,

445
00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.030
that consensual values still held their power,

446
00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:20.970
that the leaders of parliament did not constitute an organized and coherent

447
00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:22.920
opposition to the crowd.

448
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.990
These arguments need to be taken seriously,

449
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.390
but for myself,

450
00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:33.240
I can say I don't really find them convincing.

451
00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:39.120
Certainly the conflict did arise from the contingent circumstances surrounding

452
00:28:39.121 --> 00:28:43.530
particular meetings of parliament and certainly the members of the political

453
00:28:43.531 --> 00:28:48.000
nation would have preferred a consensual relationship with the royal government

454
00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.990
that they repeatedly showed their willingness to grant the taxes necessary for

455
00:28:51.991 --> 00:28:54.180
the war on certain conditions.

456
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:56.700
They would have liked to establish a new consensus,

457
00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:03.290
but the 1620s had also witnessed the enmeshing of a variety of sources of

458
00:29:03.781 --> 00:29:06.240
discontent with Charles has government.

459
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:12.350
The political nation was becoming seriously divided over a number of fundamental

460
00:29:12.391 --> 00:29:17.391
issues which recur repeatedly and an ideological Fisher was emerging over

461
00:29:19.321 --> 00:29:24.321
certain key questions such as the extent to which the king's prerogative powers

462
00:29:26.521 --> 00:29:29.190
were or were not limited by law.

463
00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:32.880
The scope of parliaments,

464
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:37.910
legitimate role in advising the crown and representing the views of the

465
00:29:38.311 --> 00:29:39.144
political nation.

466
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.680
The question of whether the principle of taxation by consent would be maintained

467
00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:47.343
or not.

468
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:53.220
The question of whether the ecclesiastical policy being pursued by the crown

469
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:58.920
with the appointment of Armenian bishops was or was not undermining English

470
00:29:58.991 --> 00:29:59.830
Protestantism.

471
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:01.421
Now,

472
00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:06.421
all of those issues which do recur add up to a pretty heady mixture.

473
00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.420
It's a formidable cocktail of anxieties.

474
00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:13.060
And as you know,

475
00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:15.490
these anxieties were widely shared,

476
00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:19.180
well outside the confines of the houses of parliament,

477
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:24.370
widely shared by a broad and growing political public,

478
00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:28.420
which was informed by novel means of political news reporting,

479
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:33.910
which emphasized not consensus but danger and conflict.

480
00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:40.740
The emergence of a broad public opinion which expected parliament to act to

481
00:30:41.891 --> 00:30:46.750
remedy it's concerns with shorty something which was part and parcel of the

482
00:30:46.751 --> 00:30:50.470
deterioration of relationships between the crown and the political nation at

483
00:30:50.471 --> 00:30:51.304
large.

484
00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:56.530
And the fact that not all of those who learned of what was happening at the

485
00:30:56.531 --> 00:30:57.364
center,

486
00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:00.400
we're necessarily sympathetic to parliament,

487
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:04.630
deepened the emerging political division in the country.

488
00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:13.080
No one who took a serious interest in political affairs at this time could

489
00:31:13.451 --> 00:31:18.451
really fail to be aware that there was something of a functional breakdown in

490
00:31:18.461 --> 00:31:23.461
the consensual political system by the latest 1620s and of course they had to

491
00:31:24.641 --> 00:31:28.000
explain to themselves what was going on.

492
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:30.790
Um,

493
00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:35.790
two influential interpretations of that by Peter Lake and Jonathan Scott have

494
00:31:37.091 --> 00:31:42.091
argued that people explain the situation to themselves with reference to what

495
00:31:42.971 --> 00:31:47.971
have been described as too similar but mutually exclusive conspiracy theories

496
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:55.270
to those who sympathized with parliament and particular to the leaders at the

497
00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:55.271
House of Commons,

498
00:31:55.271 --> 00:31:55.640
Lexa,

499
00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.370
John Elliot or John Pym.

500
00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:03.270
The erosion of consensus was attributable to what they described as a pope ish

501
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
plot amongst evil counselors of the crown who are hostile to English

502
00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:13.150
Protestantism and to the liberties of the subject.

503
00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:18.570
And two were favor favorable to absolutism or arbitrary power in both church and

504
00:32:21.551 --> 00:32:22.384
state.

505
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:27.610
They associated together popery and arbitrary power,

506
00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:33.700
which was to prove a dominant theme in 17th century English,

507
00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.410
oppositional politics.

508
00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:40.560
That Association of affairs in Church and state popery and arbitrary power was

509
00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:42.560
already being made.

510
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.470
That was one conspiracy theory.

511
00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.880
On the other hand amongst people who recoiled from what they had begun to see as

512
00:32:52.371 --> 00:32:53.840
parliaments accesses

513
00:32:55.430 --> 00:33:00.430
especially the scenes in 1629 the fault lay not with crypto papers to round the

514
00:33:02.001 --> 00:33:02.780
king,

515
00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:06.260
but with what they described as popular spirits,

516
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.120
popular spirits,

517
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:09.110
populists,

518
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:14.590
radicals who failed to respect the proper legitimate rights of the crown and who

519
00:33:15.711 --> 00:33:20.711
were making constitutional encroachments upon them and who's attempts to achieve

520
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:27.041
greater popularity in government were linked to a preference for popularity in

521
00:33:28.101 --> 00:33:29.450
religion also,

522
00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:32.480
which is to say they saw them as Crypto,

523
00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.800
Presbyterians,

524
00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:35.263
puritans,

525
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:37.160
popular spirits.

526
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:43.670
That was the view of those who swung increasingly to the king's side in these

527
00:33:43.671 --> 00:33:44.504
corals.

528
00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:51.390
But with the dissolution of Parliament in 1629 the forum for the public

529
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:56.740
expression of the first of these sets of anxieties had been removed.

530
00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:59.240
Parliament was no longer there,

531
00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:05.200
and the conduct of government lay with people like archbishop laud or Thomas

532
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:05.900
Wentworth,

533
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.090
the Earl of Strafford who shared.

534
00:34:08.150 --> 00:34:13.150
The second view went with in particular was a man who had been vehemently

535
00:34:13.791 --> 00:34:17.240
opposed as a member of parliament to the Duke of Buckingham,

536
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:22.540
but who recoiled in 1629 from what he took to be the excesses of parliament,

537
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.910
threatening the breakdown of order.

538
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:33.400
Lord and Wentworth proved strong allies of the king who himself of course took

539
00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:38.860
the view that popular spirits were at work and was determined not to call

540
00:34:39.201 --> 00:34:44.201
another parliament in which they could express their voice if he could possibly

541
00:34:44.301 --> 00:34:45.134
avoid it.

542
00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:53.180
So with the dissolution of 1629 to Charles and his advisors,

543
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.560
the 1630 is represented something of a fresh start

544
00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.280
piece was made first of all,

545
00:35:01.281 --> 00:35:06.281
with France in 1629 and then with Spain in 1630 in Europe,

546
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.160
the situation was becoming less threatening.

547
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:15.790
In 1629 the Protestant King of Sweden intervened in Germany and then in 1620

548
00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:20.030
1635 France on the cardinal,

549
00:35:20.031 --> 00:35:25.031
rich Leah intervened and together that greatly lessen the threat of Habsburg

550
00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:29.210
domination and a triumphant counter-reformation

551
00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:31.573
at home.

552
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Charles was determined to close down the consultative and participate we

553
00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:40.440
dimensions of the political process.

554
00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:44.370
He believed that it had led only to obstruction,

555
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:46.980
disruption and conflict,

556
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:49.380
and he would have no more of it if possible,

557
00:35:50.670 --> 00:35:55.230
but he was also determined to rule well according to his own lights.

558
00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:58.980
In 1631 following the harvest crisis,

559
00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:03.990
he is sued a book of orders which tightened up the administration of local

560
00:36:03.991 --> 00:36:08.991
government with particular attention to the efficient enforcement of the poor

561
00:36:09.301 --> 00:36:12.030
laws and a great deal was achieved in that respect.

562
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:17.700
Steps were also taken by the royal government to remedy some of the deficiencies

563
00:36:17.701 --> 00:36:20.520
which had emerged in the course of Buckingham's.

564
00:36:20.521 --> 00:36:25.521
Unsuccessful military campaigns in the 1620s steps were taken to reform the

565
00:36:26.101 --> 00:36:31.101
militia to institute the training to a higher level of military preparedness of

566
00:36:32.491 --> 00:36:34.530
part of the militia and steps.

567
00:36:34.531 --> 00:36:38.250
We're also instituted to rebuild and strengthen the navy.

568
00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:44.780
All of these things were very much to the king's credit and yet in other

569
00:36:44.971 --> 00:36:49.971
respects he can be said to have confirmed some of the worst fears of his

570
00:36:52.441 --> 00:36:54.420
opponents in 1629

571
00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:56.843
as you know,

572
00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:01.880
Arminianism continued to be ruthlessly promoted in the church and the archbishop

573
00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:04.750
laud who became Archbishop of Canterbury.

574
00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:09.830
Of course in 1633 in the absence of parliamentary grants of taxation,

575
00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:16.970
the king also resorted to a variety of financial expedience which would have

576
00:37:18.031 --> 00:37:19.680
questionable legality.

577
00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:21.870
There were many of these.

578
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:22.831
One for example,

579
00:37:22.831 --> 00:37:25.230
was so called district of Knighthood.

580
00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.633
By this,

581
00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.640
the king revived an ancient feudal law under which landholders have a certain

582
00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:34.560
level of wealth.

583
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:39.120
We're fined if they didn't present themselves before the king to be made nights.

584
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:44.040
He was digging up a medieval precedent in order to squeeze money out of certain

585
00:37:44.041 --> 00:37:45.690
members of the landed.

586
00:37:45.691 --> 00:37:47.520
Gentry was deeply resented.

587
00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.300
New Customs in positions were introduced.

588
00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.880
Of course without parliamentary sanction.

589
00:37:55.050 --> 00:38:00.050
Efforts were made to search for and revive any royal rights over land,

590
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:07.100
which could be sources of income by obliging landholders to meet compositions

591
00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:11.820
with the king in order to have royal rights relaxed again,

592
00:38:11.821 --> 00:38:16.020
digging into the medieval past for precedents which could be exploited fiscally

593
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:18.390
above all,

594
00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:23.900
the king levied from 1634 the tax ship money just to explain ship money was

595
00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:32.470
attacks which could be levied on coastal counties and on ports in lieu of their

596
00:38:34.231 --> 00:38:37.000
provision of ships for the Royal Navy.

597
00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:38.530
In time of need.

598
00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:42.010
It was well established.

599
00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:46.900
It had been used by Elizabeth in the war against Spain without any complaint.

600
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:49.960
Charles Harvard took things further.

601
00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:52.420
He charged ship money on the ports,

602
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.250
initially extended it to coastal counties in time of peace.

603
00:38:57.430 --> 00:39:02.430
And then in 1635 extended it to the entire country.

604
00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:05.050
Thereafter,

605
00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:10.080
ship money was levied every year it had become an annual unparliamentary tax.

606
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:19.230
The legality of ship money was challenged in 1637 by a number of gentlemen who

607
00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:26.830
refuse to pay led by John Hamden after Houma,

608
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:31.920
our suburb is named and ship money was only narrowly validated in the court

609
00:39:32.681 --> 00:39:33.161
judgement,

610
00:39:33.161 --> 00:39:37.390
which resulted in the ship money case where the judges found for the king,

611
00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:42.870
but only by a majority of seven to five only narrowly did they recognize the

612
00:39:43.751 --> 00:39:45.670
legality of this tax.

613
00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.940
Five of the principal justices thought it was illegal.

614
00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:51.730
Well,

615
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:53.980
to revisionist historians,

616
00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:59.580
the 1630s can be seen as a period of relatively successful royal government.

617
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:07.900
Marcus Lansky has remarked that there was no ground swell of opposition to

618
00:40:07.901 --> 00:40:12.901
Charles's government in the 1630s and indeed there was little public protest.

619
00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:20.770
For the simple reason that there was no longer a forum for that protest to be

620
00:40:20.771 --> 00:40:23.650
expressed since parliament was not meeting.

621
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:29.170
But if the 1630s where a period of apparent stability,

622
00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:35.370
I'd suggest that it was the stability of resignation or the stability of anxious

623
00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:41.490
waiting on events rather than active consent to these measures by the royal

624
00:40:42.521 --> 00:40:45.580
government down in the counties.

625
00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:50.470
Local rulers usually obeyed royal commands when they received them,

626
00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:52.780
it was their duty to do so,

627
00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.770
but they could also entertain their private thoughts.

628
00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:01.870
They could discuss them cautiously and anxiously with their neighbors.

629
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.990
They could record them privately in their diaries.

630
00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:10.500
They could watch what happened in things like the ship money case in 1633 so

631
00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:13.690
Robert Hardy entered in his diary,

632
00:41:13.691 --> 00:41:18.691
his prayers for a new parliament as well as his prayers for Protestant success

633
00:41:19.571 --> 00:41:24.571
in Europe and for the religious exiles in New England in the county of Suffolk.

634
00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:31.480
John Ross is revealed by his diary to have been deeply worried,

635
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:35.270
deeply reluctant to think badly of the king,

636
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:39.800
sometimes defending the king's actions against more critical neighbors.

637
00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:45.740
But by the end of the 1630s he too had become convinced that there existed

638
00:41:45.741 --> 00:41:46.574
around the king,

639
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:51.670
what he described as a malignant party who hate reformation and would bring in

640
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:54.583
tyranny

641
00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.740
amongst many of the political nation.

642
00:41:57.741 --> 00:42:02.420
Then Charles ruler was breeding a profound anxiety,

643
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.730
a profound alienation,

644
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:10.390
deep suspicion regarding what his ultimate intentions might be.

645
00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:17.620
The extent of that alienation would only be fully revealed when parliament met

646
00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:23.080
again in 1640 when the king was at last obliged to call another parliament,

647
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:31.180
but that he did so at all was the consequence of his own folly,

648
00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:37.180
the folly of Charles and Archbishop Lord in 1637 when they decided to impose

649
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:41.750
upon the Presbyterian Church of Scotland,

650
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:47.410
both an extension of Episcopal government and an English style prayer book,

651
00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:52.550
it was an act of utter folly.

652
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.730
The product of their dogmatism,

653
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:57.260
that arrogance,

654
00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:02.710
their insistence upon uniformity and the blow back was catastrophic.

655
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:07.370
When the Archbishop of St Andrews attempted to read from the new prayer book and

656
00:43:07.371 --> 00:43:11.750
St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh and Edinburgh housewife through her stool at him

657
00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:14.120
to the Scots.

658
00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:17.000
Such innovations in their church,

659
00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:20.660
a separate church from the Church of England seem to be,

660
00:43:20.661 --> 00:43:21.890
as they described them,

661
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:23.670
pope ish,

662
00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:24.761
atheist,

663
00:43:24.761 --> 00:43:25.594
tickle,

664
00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:26.443
and English.

665
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.390
Which of the three was worst?

666
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:30.620
I leave to your judgement.

667
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:36.650
They met together in 1638 to form a national covenant to resist these

668
00:43:36.651 --> 00:43:37.490
innovations.

669
00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:41.150
And in the face of the king's refusal to back down,

670
00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:42.350
they rebelled.

671
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:48.410
And by doing so began to cause the whole house of cards to fall.

672
00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:52.370
And I'll take the story up from there next week.
