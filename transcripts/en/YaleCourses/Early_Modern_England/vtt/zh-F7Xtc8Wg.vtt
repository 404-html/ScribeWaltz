1
00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.460
Okay.

2
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.460
Well today we return to the main political and Louisiana astrical narrative

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.560
leading up to the hour.

4
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.520
Do you mind leading up to the outbreak of the civil wars in the mid 17th

5
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:17.664
century?

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.863
Um,

7
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.290
we left our discussion of the Elizabethan Church,

8
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:22.950
uh,

9
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.950
two weeks ago with the situation of relative calm at the end of Elizabeth's

10
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:29.550
reign.

11
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.510
If you remember,

12
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.780
the domestic threat posed by the Catholic minority was diminishing.

13
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.770
Puritan attempts to change the structure of the church through action in

14
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:42.780
parliament had been defeated.

15
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.650
And to large extent that relative stability can be said to have persisted into

16
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:51.960
the first two decades of the 17th century.

17
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.320
That is into the reign of James the first who came to the throne in 1,603 and

18
00:00:57.451 --> 00:00:59.370
died in 1625.

19
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.823
And indeed,

20
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.210
the continuity's between the end of Elizabeth's reign and the reign of James

21
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.260
have led some historians to speak of what they call it,

22
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.771
Jack Up,

23
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:15.771
Ethan consensus in the church during this generation Jacobean plus Elizabethan,

24
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.511
Jakob,

25
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:19.344
Ethan.

26
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.880
The characteristics of that consensus can be perhaps illustrated with reference

27
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:31.101
to an event at the very start of James's rain in 1,603 as he made his way south

28
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:35.640
from Edinburgh to be crowned in London,

29
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.860
he was presented with what's become known as the millennium military petition,

30
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.500
getting that name from the fact that it was allegedly subscribed by a thousand

31
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.620
ministers of the Church of England and it revealed a body of opinion within the

32
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:57.681
church petitioning James in the hope that he would countenance further reform,

33
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.130
further reform in doctrine in the ceremonies of the church and in the quality of

34
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:05.484
the clergy

35
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.450
that led James to call the Hampton Court conference in 1,604 which was a

36
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:16.890
conference of leading churchman in which all strands of opinion we're

37
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:19.560
represented in the course of the conference.

38
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:24.561
James was very forthright in insisting that he would not countenance any change

39
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.680
in the episcopal government of the Church of England.

40
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.050
Twice in the course of the debates,

41
00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:33.720
he intervene famously with the phrase no bishop,

42
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.823
no king.

43
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.020
He'd had quite enough of the semi independent Presbyterian Church of Scotland.

44
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.350
So discussion of church government in that sense was not on the agenda.

45
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.701
Still.

46
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:52.701
It wasn't a confrontation between James and the puritan wing of the Church of

47
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.113
England.

48
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.870
He was very comfortable with the godly issues that were raised.

49
00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.980
He was very keen on steps to improve the learning and quality of the clergy.

50
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.510
He agreed that there should be a new English translation of the Bible.

51
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.720
The one eventually published in 1611 known in Britain as the authorized version,

52
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:15.130
or here is the King James Bible.

53
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.680
And everyone was very impressed with the kings doctrinal knowledge.

54
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.040
He'd had a very thorough theological education in Scotland.

55
00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.140
There was no question,

56
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:26.980
in other words,

57
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.650
that James was a godly prince.

58
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.110
He was England Solomon as they flatteringly termed him.

59
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.050
So the Hampton Court conference revealed the existence of continuing

60
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:41.920
differences,

61
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.330
differences of opinion about aspects of the Church of England structure.

62
00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.780
But there was a great deal of common ground and the conference broke up pretty

63
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.833
amicably.

64
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.270
Let's look at that common ground a little closely,

65
00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:58.600
a little more closely.

66
00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.980
Um,

67
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.813
first of all,

68
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.570
there was by the early 17th century and essential consensus over doctrine since

69
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:12.400
the late 50 [inaudible] he's most theologically theologians in the universities

70
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.820
had been interpreting the ambiguities of the Elizabethan settlement in an

71
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:20.560
essentially Calvinist way.

72
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.810
They tended to accept the doctrine of predestination,

73
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.060
the view that God had predestined those who would be amongst the elect and those

74
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:34.510
who would be reprobate or damned at the last judgment.

75
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.220
They also had a widely shared model of the ideal godly Protestant devotional

76
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.880
life based on biblicism attendance at sermons,

77
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.650
uh,

78
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.650
the practice of household devotions and a strict godly conversation as they

79
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:55.060
called it.

80
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.100
That is strict personal behavior,

81
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.680
strict moral behavior in daily life.

82
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.080
All of this was supported by a growing vernacular religious literature,

83
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.950
which tended to support this approach to religious life.

84
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.680
They also shared a common view of the need to entrench Protestant doctrine and

85
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:22.210
reformed behavior in the population at large.

86
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.400
Only a minority might be saved according to Calvinist doctrine,

87
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.610
but no one knew for sure who they were.

88
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.751
Therefore,

89
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:34.690
the church must address the whole population.

90
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.950
It must serve the whole population and it should minister to them.

91
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.781
That's interesting.

92
00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:41.301
For example,

93
00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:46.060
that when the 1611 translation was being prepared by a committee of divine's,

94
00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.850
when they'd settled on a translation of a passage,

95
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.470
they used to read it aloud to see if it would be effective when read aloud to

96
00:05:53.471 --> 00:05:54.700
illiterate congregations.

97
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.240
It we're very conscious of the need to be able to communicate in that kind of

98
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:00.074
way.

99
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:01.640
Well,

100
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.473
to that end,

101
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.010
a great deal of stress was placed on the provision of a godly pastorate of

102
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:07.844
teaching,

103
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.620
preaching ministers,

104
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.230
and as we saw when looking at education,

105
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.370
a great deal was in fact achieved in that respect.

106
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.410
By the early 16 hundreds there was also an unmistakable Protestant identity

107
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.800
despite internal differences of opinion.

108
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:33.230
Most people were conscious of their common membership of a Protestant

109
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.790
confessional family.

110
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.290
Within Europe.

111
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.040
There are feelings of religious hostility were directed outwards towards the

112
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:44.840
threat of what they usually described,

113
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:45.920
not as Catholicism,

114
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:47.360
but as Potpourri.

115
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.530
Potpourri was the supposed antithesis of reformed religion characterized as a

116
00:06:55.431 --> 00:07:00.140
church which was based not on the pure unvarnished word of scripture,

117
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.870
but on human errors,

118
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.260
corrupted by false doctrine and superstitious practices and increasingly seen as

119
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.333
alien.

120
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:13.370
Okay,

121
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.250
well there's a good deal to be said for this notion of a,

122
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.300
a booth and consensus in the generation which span the last years of Elizabeth

123
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.680
and the reign of James.

124
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.170
But if the church was indeed at relative peace,

125
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:33.080
it was enjoying a period of stability that was in many ways fragile.

126
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:39.160
One mustn't overdo the element of consensus and by the 1620s there was

127
00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:44.621
increasing evidence of that consensus being subject to destabilizing forces.

128
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.280
And there were two of them in particular to emphasize.

129
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:50.600
First of all,

130
00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.170
there was the process of what one can call puritan reformation down in the

131
00:07:56.301 --> 00:07:57.134
parishes.

132
00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.360
And secondly,

133
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.740
there was the Armenian reaction at the center.

134
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.200
And I look at each of these in turn.

135
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:08.710
Well,

136
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:09.920
starting with the puritans,

137
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:12.261
the puritans,

138
00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:16.910
as we've already seen where those that contemporaries thought of as in the

139
00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:17.930
phrase of the time,

140
00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:20.780
the hotter sot of Protestants,

141
00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:26.470
those who were most committed to furthering the reformation and by furthering

142
00:08:26.961 --> 00:08:27.741
the reformation,

143
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:32.741
they meant not simply conformity to a Protestant religious settlement.

144
00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:38.620
They also had the ambition of galvanizing the religious life of the whole

145
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.733
nation.

146
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.120
As one of them put it,

147
00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:44.720
they sought a reduction of all things disordered,

148
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:50.230
be it in religion or in social morality or reduction of it to the model of God's

149
00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:54.860
requirements as revealed in scripture as they saw it.

150
00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:57.181
These,

151
00:08:57.181 --> 00:09:02.181
but of course people are fervent faith and a stringent personal religious life.

152
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.680
It's best revealed in the way they monitored their own lives in the spiritual

153
00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:12.681
diaries that they often kept straining by examination of their own behavior to

154
00:09:14.131 --> 00:09:17.490
achieve the sanctification of personal life,

155
00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:22.740
which would give them assurance of their election assurance that they were

156
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:23.700
amongst the elect,

157
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.550
those who would be saved and assurance,

158
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:29.070
which often simply didn't come to many of them,

159
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:32.640
but they kept struggling and that struggle bread,

160
00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:37.641
a kind of spiritual anxiety which perhaps underlay they're often vigorous

161
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:39.503
activism.

162
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.050
They sought reassurance often in action.

163
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:49.850
These were not just formal members of the church living their lives within a

164
00:09:50.371 --> 00:09:54.120
general framework of Christian belief and practice.

165
00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:59.300
They were seriously religious people and their religion shape their whole lives.

166
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.910
The trouble was that it not only shaped their lives,

167
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.350
but not infrequently impacted also on the lives of others

168
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.500
amongst the clergy.

169
00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.180
Those of puritanical inclination were amongst the most conscientious and the

170
00:10:18.181 --> 00:10:22.050
most active in the task of evangelizing the people,

171
00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:26.700
whatever their private preferences as to forms of church government.

172
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.940
Most of them had long ago abandoned any serious attempt to transform the church

173
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.360
by political action.

174
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.920
They'd withdrawn from that.

175
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.630
After the 1580s.

176
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:37.853
Instead,

177
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.900
they conformed more or less to the requirements of the church for the sake of

178
00:10:42.901 --> 00:10:46.830
the larger task of spreading the word evangelizing.

179
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:53.400
Protestantism seemed to them to demand popular enlightenment.

180
00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:59.210
It demanded a dispelling of what they viewed as the darkness of Popek ignorance

181
00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and superstition and Godly ministers entered upon that task with very high

182
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:07.440
expectations.

183
00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.600
When one reads their works,

184
00:11:09.601 --> 00:11:14.601
they often speak initially of the mass of the population as hungry sheep unfed.

185
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:17.860
Uh,

186
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.050
they described them as,

187
00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:22.440
as fields of corn ripe for the harvest,

188
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.250
or they're,

189
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:28.250
they're babes crying for the milk of good doctrine and what could stand against

190
00:11:29.161 --> 00:11:30.690
the word if it was brought to them.

191
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.111
Unfortunately,

192
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:36.510
for that optimistic position,

193
00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:41.970
they often found that their own parishioners tended to disappoint their high

194
00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:44.370
hopes of evangelical success.

195
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.640
A parish ministry day by day,

196
00:11:47.641 --> 00:11:48.510
week by week,

197
00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:53.540
year by year could often be a deeply disillusioning experience.

198
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:55.941
Richard Green,

199
00:11:55.941 --> 00:12:00.610
him who was one of the most famous of the early puritan preachers,

200
00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.550
he was the minister of Dry Drayton near Cambridge,

201
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.600
a man much sought after for advice by other puritans.

202
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:08.591
Richard Green,

203
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:13.591
him finally resigned his living a dry Drake and after 20 years of effort effort,

204
00:12:14.861 --> 00:12:18.130
which had him not only preaching on Sundays and on weekdays,

205
00:12:18.131 --> 00:12:23.131
but even going out and standing by the fields as his parishioners went out to

206
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:23.711
uh,

207
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:27.490
work on their farms to talk to them about matters of religion and so forth.

208
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.820
After 20 years of this effort he gave up because of what he called the

209
00:12:33.431 --> 00:12:37.600
untractable illness and unteachable newness of that people

210
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:44.340
and the gradually grew up in the early decades of the 17th century alongside the

211
00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:47.350
literature of sermons and devotional works,

212
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:52.830
what one can perhaps describe as a literature of Godly disillusionment in which

213
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:58.780
people reflected upon their lack of success in the evangelizing movement

214
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.400
and such literature very often contained a very somber assessment of the state

215
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:07.570
of popular religion in England.

216
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:12.250
And I'll give you some quotations from the kind of things they tended to say.

217
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.470
They were deeply concerned about the fact that the people were ignorant of

218
00:13:17.471 --> 00:13:22.471
doctrine on instructed in what they saw as saving doc trinal knowledge.

219
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:26.170
To give some examples from these works.

220
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:31.350
The poor people do not understand so much as the Lord's prayer if any question

221
00:13:32.441 --> 00:13:34.510
be put to them as concerning religion,

222
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.120
they grow as mute as fish.

223
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.620
Men can talk understandingly about ways of the world,

224
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.420
but they can scarcely speak a word of sense about matters of salvation.

225
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:52.470
Our sermons are but a breath from us and a sound to them because they didn't

226
00:13:54.161 --> 00:13:55.960
understand the half of it.

227
00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:59.650
These are all quotations from works of this kind.

228
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.440
They said that the religion of the people remained one of formality and blind

229
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.190
devotion.

230
00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:07.270
That's a common phrase.

231
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:10.030
Formality and blind devotion,

232
00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:14.230
reliance upon a ritualistic repetition of one's prayers,

233
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:18.550
turning up at church services more as a gathering of neighbors.

234
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.770
Then as a congregation of the faithful,

235
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:26.580
more concerned with who they saw church then with what they heard and confident

236
00:14:27.161 --> 00:14:28.000
that this was enough,

237
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:29.710
that this was a good life,

238
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.200
which in the eyes of the godly ministers,

239
00:14:32.201 --> 00:14:33.430
of course it wasn't.

240
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:36.040
The people were superstitious.

241
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.630
They still adhere to practices which they were too ignorant to recognize as

242
00:14:40.631 --> 00:14:43.720
being hangovers from the dark age of popery.

243
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.970
They practiced magic.

244
00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:51.270
They visited cunning folk and they were profane are people who did not

245
00:14:52.521 --> 00:14:57.521
appreciate the need to sanctify their lives according to the word of God and who

246
00:14:58.881 --> 00:15:02.870
maintained forms of customary behavior offensive to God.

247
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:06.080
They swore they drank to excess.

248
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:11.620
They indulged in what one minister described as light viewed and lascivious

249
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.033
dancing.

250
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:19.180
They broke the sabbath either by working in their farms and workshops or by

251
00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:23.720
their leisure activities hanging out in the Ale House as soon as they got out of

252
00:15:23.721 --> 00:15:24.554
church

253
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.470
as one preacher put it,

254
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:33.610
every parish has a profane and ignorant multitude who are born with a pope in

255
00:15:34.491 --> 00:15:35.324
their belly,

256
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:39.050
by which he meant they were directed by their fleshly appetites,

257
00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.970
born with a popup in their belly and are not yet redeemed from that gross

258
00:15:43.971 --> 00:15:44.804
supervision,

259
00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.750
a superstition and vain conversation,

260
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:51.740
which they have received by tradition from their fathers.

261
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:53.630
In short,

262
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:58.630
they were prisoners of popular custom rather than followers of the precept of

263
00:15:59.031 --> 00:15:59.864
scripture,

264
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.910
but there was a remedy for all of this and these condemnatory jeremiads tended

265
00:16:09.171 --> 00:16:12.890
to be followed rapidly by calls for the pursuit of reformation of these

266
00:16:12.891 --> 00:16:15.560
disorders by a dual policy,

267
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:20.890
a policy of word and sword ministers and secular magistrates,

268
00:16:22.401 --> 00:16:25.940
whether they be parish officers or justices of the peace,

269
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:30.260
the leaders of towns or parliamentary members,

270
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:32.450
they should all act together.

271
00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.800
The word of the minister would reform the inside of the people.

272
00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:42.340
The Sword of the magistrate would conform the outside word and sword.

273
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:46.840
What's that?

274
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.900
Recommendations didn't fall on deaf ears and we're godly ministers and

275
00:16:50.901 --> 00:16:55.220
likeminded local officers and magistrates supported one another as they

276
00:16:55.221 --> 00:17:00.221
sometimes did this kind of answer to the cultural failings of the reformation.

277
00:17:01.191 --> 00:17:06.191
It's failings to adequately communicate with the people down in the parishes led

278
00:17:07.701 --> 00:17:12.701
to what's been characterized as widespread cultural conflict in the early 17th

279
00:17:12.951 --> 00:17:15.230
century right down at the level of the locality,

280
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.770
many forms of customer he popular culture in the parishes were attacked.

281
00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:23.450
Feasts and festivities,

282
00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.340
Sunday dancing's and so forth.

283
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:29.990
We're often put down partly because they were held on the Sabbath Day,

284
00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:34.400
partly because they tempted people to profane behavior,

285
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:39.080
notably drunkenness and the incitement of lust.

286
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:44.720
One study by Ronald Hutton in the rise and fall of merry England shows how

287
00:17:44.721 --> 00:17:48.740
gradually these traditional feasts and festivals disappeared all over

288
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:52.260
southeastern England and we're gradually retreating into the north and west

289
00:17:52.261 --> 00:17:55.170
where they continued to survive.

290
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:03.260
There was also widespread attack at local level upon such things as the numerous

291
00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:06.840
alehouses which the people frequented,

292
00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:11.730
many of them were suppressed and at such a common everyday sins as profane

293
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:12.653
swearing,

294
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.471
for example,

295
00:18:13.471 --> 00:18:14.670
swearing by God.

296
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.890
In the course of conversation.

297
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.130
The arrest book for the town of Dorchester,

298
00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:25.131
which was dominated by a puritan group from the 1610s onwards is quite

299
00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:26.881
interesting.

300
00:18:26.881 --> 00:18:27.960
On market days,

301
00:18:27.961 --> 00:18:32.961
it reveals numerous cases of people arrested on market day for swearing in the

302
00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:37.950
marketplace or for getting drunk in the taverns around the market.

303
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.140
That was a field day for reformation.

304
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:42.653
As a result,

305
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:48.390
some communities became well known as models of Godly discipline.

306
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.240
Often they were small towns,

307
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.910
places like Banbury in Oxfordshire,

308
00:18:53.911 --> 00:18:58.911
which was known for what was described approvingly as its precise course of

309
00:18:59.311 --> 00:19:00.060
government.

310
00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:05.060
It's imposition locally off stricter standards of reformation or Dorchester

311
00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.510
endorser,

312
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:11.510
which I've already mentioned under its patriarch John White or indeed Stratford

313
00:19:11.791 --> 00:19:13.200
on Avon in Warrick shirt,

314
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:18.470
where the local puritan group triumphed after a sharp tussle with their

315
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:19.740
opponents.

316
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.120
The opponents in fact,

317
00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:25.860
including a number of friends and associates of the retired playwright William

318
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.693
Shakespeare.

319
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.320
Other communities remained uneasily divided.

320
00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:36.840
They were prone to occasional eruptions of conflict brought on by reforming

321
00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.740
initiatives,

322
00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.260
local attempts to tighten up on standards of church attendance to put down ale

323
00:19:42.261 --> 00:19:44.340
houses or whatever the case.

324
00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.450
And there might be no lasting victory just to continue in tussle between the two

325
00:19:48.451 --> 00:19:49.284
sides.

326
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.731
Still,

327
00:19:50.731 --> 00:19:53.490
others remained relatively untouched

328
00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:01.380
and number of historians have looked at all of this and tried to interpret its

329
00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:04.200
broader implications.

330
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:04.950
Uh,

331
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:05.730
David under,

332
00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:06.181
for example,

333
00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:08.550
in the study of what was going on in the west of England,

334
00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:14.390
has speculated about the possible association between different local social and

335
00:20:14.581 --> 00:20:19.581
economic structures and different degrees of proneness or susceptibility to the

336
00:20:20.131 --> 00:20:20.611
outbreak.

337
00:20:20.611 --> 00:20:22.530
Of this kind of religious conflict.

338
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:27.960
He asks why some places seem to have been able to exclude such conflict,

339
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.780
whereas others were deeply divided and riven by it.

340
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:35.790
Why did the puritan word take root so much better in some places and in others?

341
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:37.410
Uh,

342
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:38.610
in the east of England,

343
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:43.730
especially the counties of East Anglia where the puritans very much called the

344
00:20:43.861 --> 00:20:47.100
tune by the second quarter of the 17th,

345
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:48.760
a number of scholars,

346
00:20:48.761 --> 00:20:49.594
William Hunt,

347
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.780
myself and others have suggested that religious impulses for reformation and

348
00:20:56.081 --> 00:21:01.081
greater discipline was super imposed in these areas upon other forms of social

349
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:07.260
tension that the puritan ministers tended to when they're converts principally

350
00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:10.030
amongst what were known as the better sort of parishioners,

351
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:12.970
the more prosperous leaders of the parish,

352
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.120
the more literate people and that local struggles were aimed primarily at

353
00:21:19.271 --> 00:21:23.020
disciplining the poor and the young of the communities.

354
00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.130
In other words,

355
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:29.340
that religious anxieties and social anxieties reinforced one another,

356
00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:34.330
one mutating into the other still.

357
00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:38.800
Others have insisted that the whole thing was purely or a religious matter,

358
00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:44.340
that if there was a corrugation or a segmenting of local populations according

359
00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:49.300
to one or another religious persuasion,

360
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.990
it was simply a matter of the introduction of particular religious messages and

361
00:21:55.271 --> 00:21:58.780
the intensity with which those beliefs were held in particular places.

362
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:04.990
So there are different takes on the unevenness of Puritan success,

363
00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:08.890
but what one can say in general is that it was very uneven.

364
00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:10.983
Nevertheless,

365
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:16.350
all agree that such conflict existed in many parishes and many towns and it was

366
00:22:17.051 --> 00:22:22.051
all part and parcel of the local history of the reformation in its most advanced

367
00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:23.794
form.

368
00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:30.060
Obviously it depended first and foremost upon the communication of the demand

369
00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:36.880
for a more stringent reformation into the localities.

370
00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:41.110
Those places which were least troubled by all this,

371
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.830
with those where these demands were never heard.

372
00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:50.370
There was never a minister of Puritan persuasion or a town council of Puritan

373
00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:54.290
persuasion there to instigate such ref,

374
00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:59.320
ref or Maitri programs for whatever reason they found no local constituency of

375
00:23:00.131 --> 00:23:00.964
supporters.

376
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:06.930
But the outcome where conflict did break out tended to depend crucially on

377
00:23:07.991 --> 00:23:12.991
whether the godly or those who resisted them had most control in local decision

378
00:23:14.081 --> 00:23:14.501
making,

379
00:23:14.501 --> 00:23:15.334
power,

380
00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.270
town councils,

381
00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:17.950
parish vestries and so forth,

382
00:23:17.951 --> 00:23:18.970
and who controlled them.

383
00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:24.420
We're often crucial to the success or failure of these resumes re movements.

384
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:31.900
It's all part of the way that the longterm outcome of the reformation and the

385
00:23:31.901 --> 00:23:36.700
long term development of the nature of English Protestantism was being settled

386
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:41.730
and fought out in dispersed diffuse actions taking place all over the kingdom

387
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:47.330
though rather than more common in some parts of the kingdom than in others.

388
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.960
And gradually by the 1620s it gave rather different complexions to the church of

389
00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:56.990
England in different localities.

390
00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.620
East Anglia was predominantly puritan.

391
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.760
One survey of the ministers of the,

392
00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:05.720
of the three counties of East Anglia for example,

393
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.800
reveals that by the 1632 thirds of them could be described as puritan in

394
00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:11.643
inclination.

395
00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.940
This was a great area of Puritan strength.

396
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:19.250
There were other counties also which shed that the north and the West tended to

397
00:24:19.251 --> 00:24:21.440
see much less puritan activity.

398
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.140
Other counties were much divided.

399
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:26.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

400
00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.930
<v 0>And in the course of it all,</v>

401
00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:33.320
the term puritan acquired a new layer of meaning

402
00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:36.900
within the Jacobean church.

403
00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.130
Puritans could not easily be distinguished by their theology.

404
00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.660
They couldn't easily just be distinguished by their ethical teachings.

405
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.730
Both of them were essentially mainstream,

406
00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:53.300
but what did distinguish them was their intensity and their activism.

407
00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.180
They were defined in a sense by a godly activism,

408
00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:05.720
which when it was unleashed in a particular local context tended to maximize

409
00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:10.290
stress over religious issues.

410
00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.030
That's where they got defined in such context.

411
00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.730
No one chose to call himself a puritan.

412
00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:19.590
It was a term of abuse.

413
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:24.710
They were labeled as puritans by their opponents in such conflictual contexts.

414
00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:27.980
As Patrick Collinson,

415
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:30.960
one of the greatest historians of puritanism has put it.

416
00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.790
Puritanism was not a thing definable in itself.

417
00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:40.260
It was one half of a stressful relationship,

418
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:43.920
one half of a stressful relationship.

419
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:49.550
The relationship that arose in some parishes through the impact on local society

420
00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.660
of the fervent pursuit of reformation.

421
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.040
Okay.

422
00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:05.040
Let's turn now to the other destabilizing stabilizing group D Armenians.

423
00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:08.020
And before we go any further with this,

424
00:26:08.021 --> 00:26:10.600
let me stress Armenians a R,

425
00:26:10.601 --> 00:26:15.601
m I n not Armenia's every year when we have the examination.

426
00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:22.090
Sinister groups of Armenians turn up d stabilizing the church of England.

427
00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:23.600
Uh,

428
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:24.010
there were,

429
00:26:24.010 --> 00:26:28.540
there was indeed an Armenian community in Northwestern Europe at this time.

430
00:26:28.541 --> 00:26:31.060
They were vitally important in the trade networks,

431
00:26:31.061 --> 00:26:32.440
which linked Northwestern Europe,

432
00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:32.990
uh,

433
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.910
to the east.

434
00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:35.531
And uh,

435
00:26:35.531 --> 00:26:36.364
they were there,

436
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:37.510
but they had nothing,

437
00:26:37.511 --> 00:26:41.650
whatever to do with the troubles of the Church of England.

438
00:26:41.651 --> 00:26:43.270
So our minions,

439
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:49.790
the Armenians were another minority who occasioned a good deal of conflict in

440
00:26:51.061 --> 00:26:52.350
the early steward church.

441
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:57.330
But this time they can be defined more easily in terms of theology.

442
00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.920
Theologically,

443
00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:04.190
they comprise the minority of English churchmen who rejected Calvinism.

444
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:10.880
They rejected the Calvinist doctrine of predestination rather than believing

445
00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:14.250
that only the elect were predestined to salvation.

446
00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:19.550
They believed more traditionally in the universality of God's grace and in the

447
00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:25.440
freewill of all mankind to choose salvation.

448
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.040
So the theologically distinct,

449
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.380
they had their antecedents in the late 16th century amongst those theologians

450
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:39.030
who did not interpret the 39 articles in a Calvinist manner,

451
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.640
but remained closely to ma,

452
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:44.910
closer to more traditional teaching and indeed to Lutheran teaching in their

453
00:27:44.911 --> 00:27:45.744
views

454
00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:49.020
in the early 17th century,

455
00:27:49.021 --> 00:27:54.021
they came to be labeled Armenians after a Dutch theologian who took this

456
00:27:54.301 --> 00:27:56.140
position Arminius of Laden.

457
00:27:57.210 --> 00:28:01.530
His criticism of Calvin was deemed so important at the time that it was the

458
00:28:01.531 --> 00:28:04.230
subject of a major conference of the reformed churches.

459
00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.640
The synod of Dort,

460
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.880
which met in 1618 at which are many assists teachings were denounced,

461
00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:17.840
but Arminianism also existed amongst a minority of English Churchman and it had

462
00:28:19.681 --> 00:28:21.990
certain distinctive features in England.

463
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:23.670
In the Netherlands,

464
00:28:23.671 --> 00:28:27.480
Arminius was operating within the context of the Dutch Reform Church with its

465
00:28:27.481 --> 00:28:28.770
congregational structure.

466
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:34.470
English Armenians existed in the context of a church where the traditional

467
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:39.590
episcopal system of church government and highly traditional form of prayer book

468
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.833
ceremonial

469
00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:49.350
the English Armenians tended to link their belief in the doctrine of free grace

470
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.860
to other beliefs connected to the structure of the Church of England.

471
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.350
They believed in episcopacy,

472
00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.610
not simply as a form of church government amongst many others,

473
00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:04.440
but as a divinely sanctioned form of church government.

474
00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:10.230
They were very keen on the structure of hierarchical authority in the church.

475
00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:16.070
They were also very keen on the sacraments as a means of grace as a way of

476
00:29:16.891 --> 00:29:17.760
coming to God.

477
00:29:18.930 --> 00:29:19.763
For example,

478
00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:25.130
they restored the significance of the altar rather than of the communion table

479
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:31.640
and the significance of the communion service as something more than just a

480
00:29:31.741 --> 00:29:34.650
commemoration of Christ's sacrifice,

481
00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.740
they tended to play down preaching,

482
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:38.611
preaching,

483
00:29:38.611 --> 00:29:43.611
so dear to the heart of puritans as the means of communication are many tended

484
00:29:43.811 --> 00:29:48.811
to play down preaching and to place more emphasis as an element in worship.

485
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.260
Upon ritual,

486
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.170
upon the performance of the sacraments.

487
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.220
They spoke of the beauty of holiness.

488
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.940
They thought that participation,

489
00:30:00.941 --> 00:30:05.941
reverend participation in services and rituals of great beauty had a spiritual

490
00:30:06.491 --> 00:30:07.324
function.

491
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.730
They also had a very high notion of the dignity of the priesthood.

492
00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:18.160
They were very clerical list in that sense and their most prominent spokesman

493
00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.470
where leading clerics,

494
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:22.750
people like Lancelot Andrews,

495
00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:24.160
the Bishop of Winchester,

496
00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:25.870
Bishop Richard Neal,

497
00:30:25.871 --> 00:30:30.100
the bishop of Durham and above all William Lord,

498
00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:32.230
all of his names are on your handout.

499
00:30:32.770 --> 00:30:33.610
William Lord,

500
00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:38.820
who started as an Oxford academic was master of Saint John's College Oxford and

501
00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:44.110
later moved on to be dean of Gloucester cathedral and then to other hire

502
00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:45.430
officers in the church.

503
00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.750
As our describe,

504
00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:53.940
the Armenians were a minority even amongst the bishops of the Church under James

505
00:30:54.251 --> 00:30:59.251
the first that became clear at the very end of James's rain in 1624 when Richard

506
00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:04.270
Montague and Armenian who was the dean of St Paul's Cathedral in London,

507
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:09.750
published his non Calvinist interpretation of the Church of England's 39

508
00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:11.110
articles of religion.

509
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.940
This publication by Montague was widely attacked.

510
00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:17.080
Indeed,

511
00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:21.790
he was reproved and his interpretation was rejected by the Archbishop of

512
00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:24.520
Canterbury himself who was trying to Lee a Calvinist

513
00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.170
to most members of the church at this point in time.

514
00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:34.470
The beliefs and the practices of worship which were favored by the Armenians

515
00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.940
looked very suspicious.

516
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:39.750
They look like backsliding.

517
00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:44.680
They looked like backsliding towards Rome and indeed,

518
00:31:44.890 --> 00:31:47.800
although the Armenians were undoubtedly Protestants,

519
00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:53.340
they were very much closer to traditional Catholic teaching in many respects,

520
00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:00.220
including the fact that they regarded the Catholic church itself as being a true

521
00:32:00.221 --> 00:32:05.221
church or be it a corrupted one rather than seeing it as in fact the work of

522
00:32:06.161 --> 00:32:06.994
antichrist,

523
00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:10.420
which was the conventional extreme Protestant interpretation.

524
00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:14.410
Well,

525
00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:19.410
all of this might have just remained a matter for theological debate at the

526
00:32:19.901 --> 00:32:24.901
academic level if it hadn't been for two facts.

527
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:26.590
First of all,

528
00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:32.040
some of the Armenians were of a singularly combative and authoritarian frame of

529
00:32:32.921 --> 00:32:33.754
mind.

530
00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:39.840
They were equal in their determination to impose their will to any of the most

531
00:32:40.401 --> 00:32:43.970
fervent puritans whom on the whole day detested.

532
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:46.370
And secondly,

533
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:51.850
in the 1620s the Armenians succeeded in winning over to their side,

534
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.730
the young Prince Charles the future.

535
00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:57.290
Charles the first,

536
00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:02.770
he was persuaded by people of Armenian convictions that their brand of religion

537
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:08.000
was more suited to a monarchy.

538
00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.433
He liked it.

539
00:33:12.010 --> 00:33:12.200
What?

540
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:17.200
In 1625 Charles came to the throne on the death of James the first and as head

541
00:33:20.121 --> 00:33:20.631
of the church.

542
00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:25.631
He rapidly seize the opportunity to advance Armenians in the church and to

543
00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.430
exclude Calvinists,

544
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:31.580
and it all happened remarkably quickly.

545
00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.260
In 1626 the Duke of Buckingham,

546
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.191
Charles,

547
00:33:37.191 --> 00:33:42.191
his favorite and mentor was appointed Chancellor of the University of Cambridge

548
00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:47.560
where he used his power as chancellor to forbid the teaching of predestination.

549
00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:54.280
In 1627 William Lord and Richard Neal were appointed to the Royal Privy Council.

550
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:58.280
Very unusual move.

551
00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.740
It had been ref for even the highest clerics to be admitted to the center of

552
00:34:03.741 --> 00:34:05.480
power in that kind of way.

553
00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:10.840
But Charles did it in 1628 Charles as supreme head of the church,

554
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:16.750
insisted that an Armenian interpretation of the 39 articles of religion,

555
00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:21.680
the same interpretation which had been denounced when put forward only four

556
00:34:21.681 --> 00:34:22.514
years earlier,

557
00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.610
was the only valid interpretation.

558
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.220
In the same year,

559
00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.820
William Lord was promoted to be Bishop of London.

560
00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.550
That was a crucial office,

561
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:39.170
not only presiding over the metropolis of course,

562
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:44.270
but it was also an office which gave the bishop the power to control the

563
00:34:44.271 --> 00:34:46.160
licensing of all books,

564
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.650
which were printed and published in London.

565
00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:54.700
And Lord use that power of control of the press to further his own views and to

566
00:34:55.371 --> 00:35:00.371
silence his critics by refusing licenses for the publication of their works.

567
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:07.810
In 1630 Lord was appointed Chancellor of the University of Oxford with

568
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:12.140
predictable results as regards to theological teaching at Oxford.

569
00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:18.400
In 1632 Richard Neal was appointed archbishop of York governing the northern

570
00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:20.090
province of the church.

571
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.230
And finally in 1633 on the death of his predecessor,

572
00:35:24.231 --> 00:35:28.640
George Abbott Lord was appointed Archbishop of Canterbury.

573
00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:33.560
So in only eight years,

574
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:39.270
the Armenians with Charles's help had captured the church of England.

575
00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:42.570
They held all the most important positions.

576
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:50.520
If Puritan activism in the parishes had done a good deal to disturb the

577
00:35:50.521 --> 00:35:55.521
localities and to create tensions over religion down in the provinces,

578
00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:01.980
the Armenian victory in the church utterly shattered.

579
00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:07.220
The Jakob Ethan consensus within which puritan evangelists in the localities had

580
00:36:07.981 --> 00:36:09.150
been able to shelter.

581
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:16.190
William Lord simply detested puritans more than that's he detested Calvinists

582
00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.100
and he defined all Calvinists as puritans.

583
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:28.910
He drove them together out of their shared hot hostility to what to them seem to

584
00:36:31.081 --> 00:36:33.630
be innovations in the church.

585
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.220
Alien innovations,

586
00:36:35.221 --> 00:36:40.221
which was suspiciously poppish looking a program of change in the church which

587
00:36:41.701 --> 00:36:42.990
filled them with dread.

588
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:48.860
All of this served from both sides to politicize religion at the national level

589
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:54.420
in a way that really hadn't been known since the 15th Eighties

590
00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:02.050
in 1626 lord had preached a sermon to parliament when it met alleging the

591
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:10.761
existence of a puritan and Presbyterian conspiracy to undermine the church of

592
00:37:11.671 --> 00:37:16.560
England from within and he denounced all those who didn't share his own views as

593
00:37:16.561 --> 00:37:18.750
being puritan subversives.

594
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:25.250
In 1628 many members of parliament when it met again reciprocated by condemning

595
00:37:26.881 --> 00:37:31.881
Lord and the Armenian innovations which had been introduced in the meantime and

596
00:37:32.881 --> 00:37:37.881
they began indulging in their own name calling one member of the House of

597
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:38.370
Commons,

598
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:39.203
Frances rouse,

599
00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:44.300
declared an Armenian is bucked a spawn of a papist in the House of Lords.

600
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:50.510
The Earl of Bedford Puritan Aristocrat described Armenians as the quote him,

601
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:56.300
the little thief put in at the window of the church to unlock the door the

602
00:37:57.181 --> 00:38:02.181
little thief put in at the window of the church to unlock the door to unlock the

603
00:38:02.431 --> 00:38:03.300
door to whom

604
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.170
to popery of course,

605
00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:13.760
and it's European champions who successes in the 1620s in the 30 years war,

606
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:20.990
which had been raging in Europe since 1618 just exacerbated the sense of

607
00:38:22.501 --> 00:38:22.891
English,

608
00:38:22.891 --> 00:38:27.891
Protestants of being embattled against powerful enemies and exposed to a

609
00:38:29.401 --> 00:38:32.550
resurgent counter-reformation Catholicism.

610
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.220
The war was going on in Germany,

611
00:38:36.221 --> 00:38:39.790
was in fact immensely complex in its origins outside observers.

612
00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:44.820
It looked like an essentially religious struggle and in a 1620s the armies of

613
00:38:44.891 --> 00:38:49.891
Spain fighting against the Netherlands and the armies of the Austrian emperor a

614
00:38:50.921 --> 00:38:51.401
Catholic.

615
00:38:51.401 --> 00:38:52.234
Of course,

616
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:56.860
we're winning and seem to be driving back Protestantism in Germany.

617
00:38:56.861 --> 00:38:57.910
All this fuel,

618
00:38:57.911 --> 00:39:01.900
the paranoia of those who observed at all from outside.

619
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:03.880
Well,

620
00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:08.110
the rise of feeling of that kind of should have warned Charles the first.

621
00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:12.940
It would almost certainly have warned his shrewd and Kenny father,

622
00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:14.260
King James.

623
00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:20.230
But Charles appears to have been indifferent to the polarization of opinion.

624
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:25.620
He lacked his father's political good sense and he allowed William Lord to press

625
00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:27.123
ahead

626
00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:33.040
between 60 and 1630 and 1632 when he was bishop of London.

627
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:36.430
Lord was extremely active in East Anglia,

628
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:41.880
part of which fell under the bishopric of London in rooting out puritans in

629
00:39:42.101 --> 00:39:46.870
calling them before him to be examined on their beliefs in suspending them.

630
00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:47.860
Indeed,

631
00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.470
in ejecting them from the church,

632
00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:54.460
many of them joined the migration to New England,

633
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:58.930
sometimes taking key members of their congregations with them.

634
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:01.450
The minister of tiling an Esic,

635
00:40:01.451 --> 00:40:02.410
for example of parish.

636
00:40:02.411 --> 00:40:04.240
Little parish down in central Essex,

637
00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:08.500
left when brow beat after being browbeaten by,

638
00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:11.200
by Lord and deprived of his living and talk with him.

639
00:40:11.201 --> 00:40:13.630
13 members of his community,

640
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.340
they founded Rocksbury,

641
00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:20.580
Massachusetts in 1633 once he had become Archbishop of Canterbury,

642
00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:28.530
Lord ordered that communion tables should be removed from their position close

643
00:40:28.781 --> 00:40:32.500
to the center of the chancellor and they should be placed at the east end of the

644
00:40:32.501 --> 00:40:34.150
church like altars,

645
00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:39.900
suitably dressed in a appropriate cloths and railed in to create a holy space at

646
00:40:42.761 --> 00:40:44.920
the east end of the chance.

647
00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:47.590
This was anathema to puritans,

648
00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:52.770
but he required it and he used his metropolitan bit visitation as archbishop to

649
00:40:53.771 --> 00:40:58.540
demand conformity to this new ritualism in every church.

650
00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.800
Church wardens who refuse to obey,

651
00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:03.250
we're hold before him and sometimes punished.

652
00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:09.360
In 1633 he also issued what was known as the book of Sports,

653
00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:14.890
a declaration in the king's name that traditional sports,

654
00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:19.920
festivities and leisure activities would be permitted upon Sundays and every

655
00:41:21.431 --> 00:41:25.630
minister was ordered to read it out in his church.

656
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:29.680
This again was anathema to puritan ministers.

657
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:34.920
Many refused to do it and they were punished and deprived of their livings

658
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:37.370
altogether.

659
00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:42.370
Throughout the Armenian controlled church and new and stricter definition of the

660
00:41:42.831 --> 00:41:47.831
nature of Anglican conformity was being rigorously enforced by Lord and he had a

661
00:41:48.561 --> 00:41:52.880
very sharp way indeed of dealing with dissidents.

662
00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.100
Three of the most famous dissidents who smuggled in Antioch Aminian books from

663
00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.330
the Netherlands to escape.

664
00:41:59.331 --> 00:42:04.331
Lord Censorship of the press were arrested in 1637 38 and severely punished by

665
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:08.863
Lord,

666
00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.450
acting from the Court of star chamber,

667
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:13.160
of which he was a leading member.

668
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:14.270
They were pilloried.

669
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:16.310
They had their ears slit off,

670
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:17.413
for example,

671
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:20.930
and the result of all this,

672
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:22.933
well,

673
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
one result was a far more rapid growth of the puritan colonies in New England

674
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:31.820
than would otherwise have been the case.

675
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:37.750
Thousands of the most dedicated of the puritan clergy and groups of their leg

676
00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.253
followers.

677
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:41.960
Finally despaired of England,

678
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:47.410
despaired of the hope of reformation in this context and left to create a godly

679
00:42:48.711 --> 00:42:52.160
Commonwealth of their own in the new world

680
00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.250
and within England.

681
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:57.381
Well,

682
00:42:57.381 --> 00:43:01.760
it's possible that in some perhaps many parishes,

683
00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.800
some aspects of Lords,

684
00:43:03.801 --> 00:43:06.830
Armenian policies were perhaps not unwelcome.

685
00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:13.300
One could say that it was a way of putting an end to the parochial controversy

686
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:18.710
and reasserting order and discipline in the church.

687
00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:23.830
Some may well have welcomed that it offered a doctrine of salvation,

688
00:43:24.291 --> 00:43:29.291
which was somewhat easier and more generous than Calvin is predestination,

689
00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:34.160
perhaps closer to the needs and understandings of simple folk

690
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:40.780
and perhaps the brand of religious practice focused on the prayer book and the

691
00:43:40.941 --> 00:43:41.774
sacraments,

692
00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:47.200
which was something which might be more inclusive at the level of the parish,

693
00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:51.770
less individually demanding on the population.

694
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:56.150
Perhaps all these positive features have been suggested.

695
00:43:56.151 --> 00:44:01.151
It an interesting book by Judith be on attitudes towards the prayer book in this

696
00:44:01.461 --> 00:44:02.294
period,

697
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:08.470
but in many parishes it was also the case that the policies of William Lord and

698
00:44:08.721 --> 00:44:11.810
the Armenians themselves brought conflict.

699
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:16.250
There was widespread alarm at their ceremonial innovations.

700
00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:21.470
There was widespread suspicion of their ultimate intentions.

701
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:27.130
There was widespread resentment and frustration amongst the godly folk who

702
00:44:27.201 --> 00:44:31.470
remained in English parishes that the reformation had been stopped,

703
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:37.100
that perhaps it was being reversed before it had even been half one

704
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:42.990
that's in itself was a new course for discontent,

705
00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:45.300
a new cause for controversy,

706
00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:49.560
a new cause for what had been called street wars of religion,

707
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:54.810
a source of increased bitterness in such controversies,

708
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:59.970
a bitterness which spilled over into political life,

709
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:05.310
sharpening and intensifying other sources of conflict,

710
00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:10.700
which we're coming to light between the royal government and members of the

711
00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:11.910
political nation,

712
00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.500
and it's to those other sources of conflict that I'll turn next time.
