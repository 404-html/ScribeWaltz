1
00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:01.711
Okay.

2
00:00:01.711 --> 00:00:02.041
Well,

3
00:00:02.041 --> 00:00:03.900
today we're just winding down.

4
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.043
Um,

5
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.143
first of all,

6
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.900
a few concluding reflections to wrap up the course.

7
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.430
Well,

8
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.430
we've now trace the development of a society of a political culture.

9
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.810
Uh,

10
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.190
and indeed in many ways,

11
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.970
uh,

12
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.210
a whole national culture over more than 200 years,

13
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:27.691
200,

14
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:29.670
250 years.

15
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.720
Um,

16
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.400
I promise when we started off in lecture one that would be looking at some great

17
00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.510
personalities,

18
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.560
some great events,

19
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.480
and some great processes.

20
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.490
And I hope that that promise has been met.

21
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.061
Uh,

22
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:47.220
we've had the great personalities,

23
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.130
warts and all with or without heads.

24
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.990
We've also traced a changing political culture,

25
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.820
the development of the institutions of representative government,

26
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.060
the eventual taming of personal monarchy,

27
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.540
the development of concepts of the rule of law,

28
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.180
of political participation,

29
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.670
of notions of liberty under the law.

30
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.850
We've also looked at the emergence,

31
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.120
the early stages of the emergence of a fully capitalist market economy,

32
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.420
and indeed its connections to a nascent world economy.

33
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.170
And we've looked at the transition from a late medieval society of orders to

34
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:35.070
watch can reasonably be described as a nascent class society.

35
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.180
We've looked at a transformation in religious culture,

36
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.500
the eventual acceptance of attentative,

37
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.663
pluralism,

38
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
toleration in matters of belief and of course we've looked at enormous changes

39
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:54.840
in levels of education in popular literacy and the print culture that served

40
00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:59.841
these and so on and throughout all of this in many ways we've looked at the

41
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:05.781
hammering out of the conflicts to which all of these processes gave rise and

42
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:11.880
eventually the finding of ways to deal with those conflicts peaceably.

43
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.520
Well these are things of some significance they up most obviously to the extent

44
00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:26.040
that some of the events and processes that we've been examining this period have

45
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:30.450
left a legacy in the modern world in terms of institutions,

46
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.520
in terms of values,

47
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.610
in terms of ideas and that's not just true of England or Britain,

48
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.120
but also have a larger world that at one time or another was subject to petition

49
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:48.090
fluence it firsthand or secondhand to that extent.

50
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.220
Many of these things are widely shared legacy and worth knowing something about

51
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.980
they are in the words of one tutor chronicler in his definition of history,

52
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.630
their tales useful to be known.

53
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

54
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.060
<v 0>And all that is one form of what Peter last lit in his famous phrase described</v>

55
00:03:11.841 --> 00:03:14.210
as understanding ourselves in time,

56
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.250
but when he used that phrase,

57
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.870
he also meant something larger.

58
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.570
You meant reflecting on the actual nature of the historical process.

59
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.131
Now,

60
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:32.131
of course one can do that for any period of history for any country.

61
00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.250
They're all equally valuable as human experience though the stories and the

62
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:40.300
meanings very,

63
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.600
we've looked at one particular case,

64
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.730
but it also serves to illustrate some general points about the historical

65
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:51.040
process and I'll raise them briefly.

66
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.730
First of all,

67
00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.563
of course,

68
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.760
history is process.

69
00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.520
We're looking at societies which are in constant motion.

70
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.300
Change is the heart of the matter.

71
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.550
People change societies and their institutions change,

72
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:14.271
their values,

73
00:04:14.271 --> 00:04:15.050
change,

74
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.940
their identities change.

75
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.530
An outline course of this kind of helps to reveal that and early modern England

76
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.490
certainly illustrates that general truth.

77
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.871
It was a time,

78
00:04:29.871 --> 00:04:34.871
obviously enough of the breaking of worlds and of the making of worlds of the

79
00:04:35.661 --> 00:04:40.661
erosion of old certainties and identities and structures and the creation of new

80
00:04:42.201 --> 00:04:43.034
ones.

81
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.300
Secondly,

82
00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.900
historical change of this kind is messy.

83
00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.630
It's complex and messy and in many ways ambiguous

84
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.950
history is never scripted in advance.

85
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.420
Historians who have an ideological cast of mind might like to pretend that it is

86
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.720
and to describe historical processes out as though they have a certain

87
00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.750
inevitability leading to preconceived ends of one kind or another,

88
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.940
but they deceive themselves.

89
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.360
Nothing in history is preordained.

90
00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.180
Some change may be the successful outcome of deliberately planned action,

91
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.590
but a great deal is the result of improvised responses to immediate

92
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.440
contingencies and in both cases there are always the unforeseen consequences.

93
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.020
The history of early modern England illustrates this well enough.

94
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.350
Think of the Henry Finn Reformation or think of the regicide and what followed

95
00:05:55.101 --> 00:06:00.101
it or think of the long working out of the outcome of the revolution of 60 and

96
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:02.204
88

97
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:08.750
so it's not scripted in advance and it's not synchronized either.

98
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.910
Change of different kinds of proceeds at different paces.

99
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.830
We've looked at political change,

100
00:06:15.831 --> 00:06:16.670
economic change,

101
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:17.630
social change,

102
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:19.010
cultural change.

103
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.970
We've seen the urgency with which political change can often take place,

104
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:30.340
but then there are also those processes which are of a very gradual,

105
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.710
very slow and cumulative nature worked out over generations and uneven in their

106
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:40.190
long term impact.

107
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.530
Think of the uneven spread of literacy,

108
00:06:42.531 --> 00:06:43.370
for example,

109
00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:48.460
the processes of economic change that I've looked at as a result at any one

110
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:50.060
point in time,

111
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.240
any society is a kind of mixture of forms because change is uneven because it's

112
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:57.524
partial,

113
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.780
so the process is messy,

114
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:04.810
but nonetheless in all of this,

115
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.490
one can find patterns.

116
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.130
One can trace connections.

117
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.180
If it wasn't so one would not be able to offer interpretations of the process of

118
00:07:15.971 --> 00:07:16.804
change.

119
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:21.850
One wouldn't be able to offer arguments about the nature of causation.

120
00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:23.560
And again,

121
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.560
looking at a particular society over a long period of time helps one to

122
00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:31.510
appreciate this aspect of the study of history.

123
00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.880
It reveals the interconnections.

124
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.830
It reveals the way things work their way through over time,

125
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.710
but no single interpretation ever encompasses it all.

126
00:07:43.711 --> 00:07:44.544
Of course,

127
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.390
no single interpretation ever holds all the answers.

128
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.480
How can one simply answer a question like,

129
00:07:51.481 --> 00:07:56.481
when did England become Protestant and what did that mean?

130
00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:57.983
Anyway,

131
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:04.170
that's why of course we constantly need to revise our views of it all.

132
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.090
In the light of new evidence,

133
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:11.130
in the light of new imaginative insights on the part of historians,

134
00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.100
we can never hold a recover the past.

135
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:15.533
It's gone.

136
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.700
It's drowned in time,

137
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:24.110
but we can enter a dialogue with the evidence that it has left and by doing that

138
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:31.400
remake the past again and again in the present according to our changing

139
00:08:32.491 --> 00:08:36.270
preoccupations and are changing understandings,

140
00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:41.730
finding new dimensions of what was going on previously,

141
00:08:41.731 --> 00:08:44.700
neglected finding new meanings.

142
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.890
You want understandings,

143
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.240
and this is very evident in the ongoing debates over all the major issues of

144
00:08:54.121 --> 00:08:59.121
this particular period and the way that new issues are constantly emerging.

145
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:02.483
Well,

146
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.580
it's because of that complexity that I've tried to present an account of change

147
00:09:08.011 --> 00:09:13.011
in this period that is complex and many faceted that includes many dimensions,

148
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:15.601
the political,

149
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:16.291
the economic,

150
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:17.124
the social,

151
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:17.963
the cultural,

152
00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:22.170
each of them making its own contribution to an overall process.

153
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:26.730
Each of them helping to make the overall process comprehensible

154
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.520
and it's because of the ambiguities in all of this that I've tried to adopt a

155
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:34.170
variety of perspectives,

156
00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:38.310
looking at things from the Catholic point of view and from the Protestant point

157
00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:38.760
of view,

158
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.480
from an arc,

159
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:44.480
the monarchical from the populist history as viewed from the top or from the

160
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:50.571
bottom or from the middle history wearing Rich's history dressed in a gown,

161
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.980
and there's a point to all of this.

162
00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:01.170
The point is simply that history contains many stories,

163
00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.560
all of which deserve to be told.

164
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.360
It contains in the evidence that leaves to us many voices,

165
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.510
all of which deserve to be heard.

166
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.570
No one owns the past.

167
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.730
It's common land.

168
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.080
There's no velvet rope denying access.

169
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.390
It's not a gated community.

170
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.690
The Dad in the evidence,

171
00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:28.560
they lead to us.

172
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.880
We'll talk to anyone.

173
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.070
They're very nice that way.

174
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:41.090
I've also tried repeatedly to give a sense of the context within which people

175
00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:41.670
lived,

176
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.940
made their decisions and choices and acted.

177
00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:46.381
And again,

178
00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:49.260
there's a very simple historical philosophy behind that,

179
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.780
which is sneakily stated in the old adage that people make their own history,

180
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.380
but they don't make it just as they choose.

181
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.980
They make it within contexts and under conditions that are not of their own

182
00:11:04.981 --> 00:11:05.814
choosing,

183
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.860
some of which are inherited,

184
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.200
some of which are newly encountered,

185
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.000
some of which can be anticipated,

186
00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.070
some of which take them by surprise,

187
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.560
but by their actions and responses and choices,

188
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.290
they can change their world.

189
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
They're always within certain constraints and to understand that process and the

190
00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:31.284
outcomes,

191
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:36.350
we need to understand the context within which people acted in their own time,

192
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.280
in their own ways,

193
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:40.890
according to their own lights.

194
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.770
One of the most important of such context is of course the structures of power

195
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.300
in any society

196
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.570
in determining action,

197
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:53.560
in initiating change.

198
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:56.260
Some people carried more weight,

199
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.180
some had more clout.

200
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:00.790
We've seen examples,

201
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:03.250
enough of that in early modern England,

202
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.320
in the political sphere,

203
00:12:04.321 --> 00:12:06.580
in the economic sphere and elsewhere,

204
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.160
but we've seen examples too of the fact that power can be resisted.

205
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:14.590
It can be confronted,

206
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.890
it can even be put under restraint.

207
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.890
People make their own history,

208
00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:26.790
they can alter the contexts sometimes quite significantly reshaping the world

209
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.130
that is encountered by the next generation.

210
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:35.820
And that in a sense has been the core of the narrative element of this course.

211
00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:38.883
So to conclude,

212
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:39.960
things change.

213
00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:41.500
Change is messy,

214
00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.810
it's ambiguous and it's meaning.

215
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:46.600
There are many interconnected stories.

216
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:48.430
History has many voices.

217
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:50.440
People make their own history,

218
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.030
but not just as they please.

219
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:55.690
And if some have more power than others to call the shots.

220
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.270
They don't have to have it all their own way,

221
00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.583
nor did they

222
00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:06.390
reflecting on the process as a whole gives a history of any period and any

223
00:13:07.901 --> 00:13:09.280
country it's meaning.

224
00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:15.040
It's many meanings and that's why it's worth bothering.

225
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.650
In studying history,

226
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:21.370
we constantly reconstruct the past in the present,

227
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.480
disciplined as we do it by respect for the evidence which it leaves to us,

228
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:34.560
but drawn in to examine and to reexamine that evidence by the problems which we

229
00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:39.610
ourselves feel the need to understand.

230
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:46.590
Each of us has drawn almost instinctively to those aspects of the past which

231
00:13:47.231 --> 00:13:50.770
continue to resonate to us individually,

232
00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:56.070
across the centuries because they speak to us for reasons we sometimes might not

233
00:13:56.531 --> 00:13:57.520
fully understand.

234
00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.920
They speak to our preoccupations,

235
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.400
they speak to our dilemmas and you're trying to understand them.

236
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.970
We can not only understand ourselves better in time,

237
00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.390
but also see possibilities for the future.

238
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.420
Historical events can often be dismaying,

239
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:24.910
but historical study is ultimately encouraging.

240
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.850
It's concerned with change,

241
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:29.650
with possibility,

242
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.690
with adaptation,

243
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.790
with finding ways.

244
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:40.370
It's concerned with human experience and achievement of every kind.

245
00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.170
Sustaining a sense of that ancestry

246
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:50.760
is important in what sometimes seems and increasingly frivolous and d

247
00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:57.101
historicized western culture with an extremely shallow awareness of its own past

248
00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.670
that can result in a kind of disorientation.

249
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.970
History in contrast,

250
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.550
tries to understand,

251
00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:13.660
do you understand what we have been to raise questions and suggestions and

252
00:15:14.691 --> 00:15:18.950
implications for what we might be capable of becoming,

253
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.280
and that's why history,

254
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.040
all history matters.

255
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.430
It really does matter.

256
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:32.833
Okay,

257
00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.960
well that's my little sermon and now we're going to have a short award ceremony.

258
00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.173
<v 1>Okay.</v>

259
00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.190
<v 0>For which I must prepare myself.</v>

260
00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:54.483
<v 1>Right.</v>

261
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.640
<v 0>I hereby Declare Myself Supreme Head of the history department.</v>

262
00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:06.123
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

263
00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:08.320
<v 0>Hence forward.</v>

264
00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:09.710
Oh,

265
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:14.710
knew my interpretations will be taught and hence forward or books published by

266
00:16:15.261 --> 00:16:18.380
members of the department will contain a groveling dedication to me.

267
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:20.903
Um,

268
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.060
but uh,

269
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:23.620
even,

270
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:23.820
uh,

271
00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:27.290
the most horrid tyrant cannot rule alone.

272
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.240
You need an aristocracy

273
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.870
and aristocracies as you know,

274
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.310
need to be rewarded.

275
00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.080
And so we have an award ceremony to reward our teaching fellows,

276
00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.850
the russet coated captains of this course who,

277
00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:44.360
uh,

278
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.820
who know what they teach and love what they know.

279
00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:48.021
Okay.

280
00:16:48.021 --> 00:16:53.021
Now I have some nominations for these awards here prepared for me by Thomas

281
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.463
Cromwell

282
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:58.520
right now.

283
00:16:58.540 --> 00:16:59.210
Festival.

284
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:00.080
What do we have here?

285
00:17:00.081 --> 00:17:00.914
Yes.

286
00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:01.903
Okay.

287
00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:03.680
We have the,

288
00:17:03.681 --> 00:17:04.160
uh,

289
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.790
the Henry the eighth award for devotion to family values.

290
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:10.310
<v 1>Okay.</v>

291
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.350
<v 0>And for being a top redhead,</v>

292
00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.270
<v 1>go ahead and survive.</v>

293
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:31.063
<v 0>Okay.</v>

294
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.420
And now we have the Elizabeth,

295
00:17:32.421 --> 00:17:37.421
the first award for not making windows into students souls and for keeping

296
00:17:38.431 --> 00:17:39.830
advisers in that place.

297
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.420
And looking ahead to the stewards succession,

298
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:52.290
which I've done my best to avoid,

299
00:17:52.291 --> 00:17:53.790
but unfortunately it's going to happen.

300
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.020
So my suits to say is,

301
00:17:55.021 --> 00:17:57.360
tell me we have the,

302
00:17:57.361 --> 00:17:58.194
uh,

303
00:17:58.530 --> 00:17:59.341
the King Charles,

304
00:17:59.341 --> 00:18:00.001
the second award,

305
00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:00.960
the last real king,

306
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.180
the King Charles,

307
00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:05.220
the second award for being tall,

308
00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:05.671
dark,

309
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:06.570
and partly French,

310
00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:14.630
and for staying cool and carrying on Justin.

311
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:16.183
<v 1>Bye.</v>

312
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.390
<v 0>Okay,</v>

313
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:23.530
so that's it.

314
00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:31.450
Do remember to let me know if you intend to come to the center for British art

315
00:18:31.451 --> 00:18:33.400
tomorrow morning for the last visit there.

316
00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:34.690
Uh,

317
00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:35.201
and,

318
00:18:35.201 --> 00:18:35.620
uh,

319
00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:40.240
now we'll turn to a housekeeping matters and they'll tell me a little bit about

320
00:18:40.241 --> 00:18:41.620
the nature of the exam.
