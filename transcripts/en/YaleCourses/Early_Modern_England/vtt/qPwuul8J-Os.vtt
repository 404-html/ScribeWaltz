1
00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.320
Uh,
the,
the great political philosopher Thomas Hobbs,
um,

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.430
who if you haven't read,

3
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:12.690
you will be learning something about in the section reading this week,
uh,

4
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.130
Thomas Hobbes formulated his theory of the state and his ideas on political

5
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:21.030
obligation in the context of the civil wars,

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.120
which tore apart all three of the constituent kingdoms of Britain in the 1640s.

7
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.230
Um,
and when it was all over,

8
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.040
Hobbs who had returned from exile in 1650s wrote a history of the conflict,

9
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.170
uh,
which he called behemoth published in 1662.

10
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.510
The titles up here and he began it with this wonderful sentence,

11
00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.910
the first sentence of behemoth.
If in time,

12
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.470
as in place there were degrees of high and low,

13
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.370
I verily believe that the highest of times would be that which passed between

14
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:07.290
1640 and 1660.

15
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.650
And what hubs meant by that striking sentence was that the events of those two

16
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:18.651
decades unleashed consequences of an enormously far reaching nature in politics,

17
00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:25.860
of course in religion and also in the realm of ideas.

18
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.740
Things would never be quite the same again.

19
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.060
But if that's how it looked to Hobbs at the end of the whole process in the

20
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:40.200
beginning in 1637,
none of that could really be foreseen.

21
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.140
In 1637,
Charles,

22
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:48.141
the first experiment in personal rule was going well and he had just succeeded

23
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.370
in winning legal backing or be it narrowly for the continued collection of ship

24
00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:59.430
money.
Uh,
an annual non parliamentary tax.

25
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.670
But Charles has relative success dependent upon two things.
First of all,

26
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.240
he needed to avoid unnecessary expense,

27
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.260
especially the kind of expenditure necessitated by war.

28
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.300
Part of the reason for success in 1630s was that he had kept the kingdom at

29
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:20.910
peace.
Secondly,

30
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.820
he needed to avoid calling a parliament.

31
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.400
He needed to avoid a parliament,

32
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:31.401
which would be a forum for deeply alienated elements of the political nation who

33
00:02:32.491 --> 00:02:36.240
loathed his fiscal expedience on the one hand.

34
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.430
And on the other hand,
his Armenian policy in the church,

35
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.230
he needed time for such opposition to die down,
if it would.

36
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.840
And in 1638 to 40,
all of this collapsed.

37
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.950
As I mentioned at the end of the last lecture in 1637 Charles and Archbishop

38
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.160
William Lord overreached themselves by attempting to impose uniformity on

39
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:06.940
religion throughout not only England,

40
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.120
but also Charles has other kingdom of Scotland.

41
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.630
They attempted to impose episcopacy and an Anglican style prayer book upon the

42
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:22.291
Church of Scotland in 1638 the Scots led by many of the leading the ability and

43
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:29.260
backed by the general assembly of the Church of Scotland,
formed in Edinburgh,

44
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.090
a national covenant taken by all the leaders of the movement and many others to

45
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:36.640
resist innovations in religion,

46
00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.520
and they proceeded to raise an army.

47
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.370
In 1639 Charles proved incapable of finding the resources to put an effective

48
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.000
army in the field to stop the Scottish rebellion,

49
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.620
and the Covenant has effectively overran the whole of southern Scotland.

50
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.750
It was completely in their control in desperate need of funds.

51
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.200
The king was forced to call a parliament,

52
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.910
and in 1640 the Ritz went out for what came to be known as the short parliament.

53
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.700
The elections which were held in that year were unusually fraught customarily in

54
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:23.680
most counties or urban constituencies.

55
00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.920
Election contests were relatively rare.

56
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.840
Usually people somehow by consensus managed to decide who would represent them

57
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.960
in parliament.
In the elections for the short parliament,

58
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.350
research has shown that in fact there were contests in no fewer than a quarter

59
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.780
of the constituencies,

60
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.800
a very high number for this period contest between candidates who were regarded

61
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.380
by the electorate as on the one hand courtiers and candidates who were regarded

62
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.680
as having country values.

63
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.950
That is to say staunch traditional Protestants,

64
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.930
adherence to the rule of law,

65
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.120
supporters for parliaments continued place in the political process.

66
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.360
When the short parliament met late in April,

67
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.360
1640 it immediately took up the old tactic from the 1620s of agreeing that they

68
00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:20.710
would vote the king money,

69
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.060
but only if their grievances were first remedied.

70
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.351
And indeed,

71
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:30.010
the very first speech made in the short parliament in the House of Commons

72
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.370
declared that the Scottish rebels were less of a threat to the kingdom than the

73
00:05:36.371 --> 00:05:40.810
threat which was posed by the king's government to the liberties of the subject.

74
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.580
Charles responded by dissolving parliament after roughly three weeks,

75
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.040
hence its name,
the short parliament.

76
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.680
Charles then attempted to prepare to invade Scotland with the very inadequate

77
00:05:57.681 --> 00:06:01.880
resources at his disposal.
Troops were raised.

78
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.940
They proceeded north and it's great disorders.

79
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:07.040
They would have low quality and poorly trained

80
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:13.540
and they were rapidly defeated by a preemptive strike on the part of the Scots

81
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.900
who crossed the border,

82
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.360
drove back the royal troops and occupied the whole of the north east of England,

83
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.660
including the crucial strategic center of Newcastle Center of the coal trade,

84
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:29.510
which supplied the fuel on which London dependent.

85
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.400
So the whole of the northeast of England was under Scottish occupation.

86
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:40.450
They then settled down waiting for negotiations and taxing the counties which

87
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:45.320
they'd occupied in order to maintain their occupation.

88
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.970
I should just mention the sudden success of the Scots should have been

89
00:06:49.971 --> 00:06:54.080
predictable.
Many Scots had served as mercenaries in the armies,

90
00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.070
particularly of Sweden and of the Netherlands in the 30 years war.

91
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.840
They were very good experience soldiers.
They'd come home to defend the covenant.

92
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:07.200
They were led by David Leslie and general with a great deal of experience who

93
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.140
distinguished himself in Swedish service.

94
00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.160
England had nothing comparable militarily,

95
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.990
well humiliated and desperate.

96
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:23.270
Charles called and other parliament.
This one to meet in November,

97
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.260
1640 and the whole country was galvanized by this second election.

98
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:30.080
There were even more election contests.

99
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:34.490
It's thought that about a third of constituencies were contested in the

100
00:07:34.491 --> 00:07:37.010
elections for the long parliament.
Indeed,

101
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:39.530
it's been suggested that nationwide,

102
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.740
perhaps between a quarter and a third of all adult males voted in the election

103
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:46.640
for the long parliament.

104
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.540
The members elected arrived in Westminster bringing with them petitions from

105
00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:57.740
their counties,
cataloging their grievances against Charles has government.

106
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.160
There was a tremendous unity of purpose amongst them.

107
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:06.850
They knew that this time the king could not afford to dissolve parliament if it

108
00:08:08.091 --> 00:08:12.740
opposed him.
When parliament met,

109
00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.380
the initiative was immediately seized by John Pym,

110
00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.220
who rapidly emerged as leader in the House of Commons.

111
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:27.640
He was a veteran of the battles in parliament in the 1620s and knew exactly what

112
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:30.020
he was doing in an early speech.

113
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.320
He alleged the existence of a plot to introduce popery and arbitrary government

114
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.160
emanating from some of the king's counselors.

115
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:47.080
Early in in the meeting of parliament in its first session in November,

116
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.120
1640 this allegation developed into direct attacks upon the king's needing

117
00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:53.024
counselors,

118
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.360
archbishop laud and Thomas Wentworth heard of Strafford.

119
00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.870
Both of them were imprisoned on the orders of parliament and Strafford found

120
00:09:03.151 --> 00:09:06.150
himself the object of impeachment proceedings.

121
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.360
Then in December,

122
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.900
1640 parliament received graciously from the city of London,

123
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:18.050
a petition known as the root and branch petition against the episcopacy of the

124
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:21.660
church and calling for further reformation in the church.

125
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:25.380
It was accompanied by large demonstrations of London citizens,

126
00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:29.040
orderly demonstrations accompanying the petition to the parliament,

127
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.030
but it showed how well London was organized in opposition.

128
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:35.933
<v 1>Okay.</v>

129
00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.760
<v 0>In February,
1641 after a brief recess,</v>

130
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:45.510
the triennial act was passed and the king was reluctantly forced to agree to it.

131
00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:50.440
The Triennial Act laid down that in future parliaments must be elected every

132
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.060
three years
and a few months later.

133
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.590
In May,

134
00:09:56.590 --> 00:10:01.590
1641 the king further agreed that the present parliament could not be dissolved

135
00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:04.570
without it's own consent.

136
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:13.270
The spring of 1641 also saw Strafford impeachment proceedings in the House of

137
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:13.880
Lords,

138
00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:18.880
which gradually turned into a trial of the entire regime of the 1630s in

139
00:10:20.331 --> 00:10:20.841
particular,

140
00:10:20.841 --> 00:10:25.841
the exercise by the king of forms of arbitrary power with Strafford backing.

141
00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.320
According to the allegations,
and in May,

142
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.910
1641 Strafford was the object of an act of attainder.

143
00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:40.280
The king was reluctantly forced to sign his death warrant and he was executed.

144
00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:47.770
Then in the summer of 1641 came a batch of reforming statutes,

145
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.640
the prerogative courts,

146
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:55.150
which had enforced the royal will in the 1630 especially the court of Star

147
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:55.850
Chamber,

148
00:10:55.850 --> 00:11:00.850
which had dealt with dissidents what abolished ship money was declared illegal.

149
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:06.650
The other financial experience which had been used by Charles and the 16th

150
00:11:06.651 --> 00:11:11.240
thirties we're also declared illegal and to all of this,

151
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.720
the king reluctantly gave his ascent

152
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:21.500
by the high summer of 1641 then it looked as if parliament had one.

153
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.090
Charles's innovations had been reversed.
Strafford.

154
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:30.350
His strong man was dead.
Lord was in the Tower of London.

155
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.370
Parliament had secured for itself a regular place in government.

156
00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:36.500
Through the triennial act.

157
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.170
It appeared to have been a bloodless or almost bloodless constitutional

158
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.063
revolution.

159
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:46.663
<v 1>Okay.</v>

160
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.500
<v 0>But of course the game was not yet over.</v>

161
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:55.480
Parliament went into recess in the summer of 1641 and Charles took the

162
00:11:55.481 --> 00:11:57.700
opportunity to travel to Scotland.

163
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.480
There he agreed a settlement regarding the Church of Scotland by withdrawing his

164
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.970
earlier demands and this secured the withdrawal of the Scottish army from the

165
00:12:09.521 --> 00:12:14.050
north of England
in early November,

166
00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:18.520
1641 when parliament met again.
A second major event occurred.

167
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:23.230
News arrived in London of rebellion in Ireland,

168
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.920
a Catholic and nationalist rebellion involving allegedly massacres of English

169
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:35.410
and Scottish settlers in Northern Ireland.
Now,

170
00:12:35.411 --> 00:12:39.850
I should take a moment to explain briefly the Irish situation.

171
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:46.450
In the aftermath of the rebellion against Elizabeth by the Earl of Tyrone.

172
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:48.160
In the late 59 nineties

173
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.660
land had been confiscated from the chief tons of northeastern Ireland,

174
00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.900
the area known as Ulster and that land had been planted with Protestants

175
00:13:01.711 --> 00:13:03.910
settlements,
mostly peopled by,

176
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:07.210
by settlers who came across from Scotland,

177
00:13:07.211 --> 00:13:09.370
such southern Scotland and from England.

178
00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.320
Their relations with the Irish population were fraught from the beginning

179
00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:20.820
by 1641 some of the Irish chieftains in Ulster resentful of their loss of land

180
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.060
and have power in that area.

181
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.050
Planned to imitate the Scots by rebelling,

182
00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:34.600
seizing control of the Irish government and then negotiating a better settlement

183
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:40.690
once the rebellion began,
however,
they proved unable to control it.

184
00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:46.510
Some of their followers began killings of settlers and seizures of their land.

185
00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:53.260
Meanwhile,
the so called old English aristocracy of other parts of Ireland,

186
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:55.420
most of whom were Roman Catholics.

187
00:13:55.421 --> 00:14:00.100
They were descended from medieval Norman conquerors of Irish land known as the

188
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:03.400
old English.
They joined in the rebellion,

189
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.730
principally motivated by the fact that as Roman Catholics,

190
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.740
they were fearful of a puritan dominated parliament in London and what it might

191
00:14:11.741 --> 00:14:12.574
mean for them.

192
00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.010
With the joining together of these two sources of discontent in Ireland,

193
00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.980
the rebellion became both a religious,

194
00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:26.190
a Roman Catholic and a nationalist rebellion fueled by bitter resentments

195
00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:32.461
against the plantations in the north marked by massacres and evictions of

196
00:14:32.891 --> 00:14:37.540
settlements.
It's estimated the fingers keep changing as more research is done,

197
00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:42.490
but perhaps 4,000 Protestant settlers were killed and some thousands more

198
00:14:42.491 --> 00:14:47.260
probably died of cold and hunger during the winter of 1641 to two

199
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:54.060
so island had exploded and news of these events sometimes wildly exaggerated bad

200
00:14:55.851 --> 00:14:58.850
enough as it was what confirmed,

201
00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:03.910
it seemed to members of parliament the fears that there was indeed a Polish plot

202
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:05.823
afoot,

203
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.940
but it also raised the crucial question of what was to be done in the face of

204
00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:15.860
this new rebellion.
Could the king be granted an army to suppress it?

205
00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:20.750
Could he be trusted with an army?
Would he not use it first against parliament?

206
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.700
On November the 23rd 1641 John Pym decided to press ahead.

207
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.740
He introduced into the House of Commons,
the so called grand remonstrance.

208
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.210
It was a long document,

209
00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:39.410
a comprehensive indictment of Charles's misrule.

210
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.560
Ever since he had come to the throne in 1625 all of these points set out in

211
00:15:45.621 --> 00:15:50.621
order to justify the demand that henceforward parliament should have the power

212
00:15:50.631 --> 00:15:52.610
to choose the king's counselors,

213
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:58.760
thereby having control over whatever forces might be granted to the king and

214
00:15:58.761 --> 00:16:03.320
that an assembly of divines should meet to determine the future structure of the

215
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.310
Church of England to satisfy the puritans zealots amongst pim supporters.

216
00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:14.020
This radical action finally split what had been hither to a fairly unified

217
00:16:14.901 --> 00:16:16.520
opposition to Charles.

218
00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:22.900
This seemed to confirm the theory that there were indeed popular spirits seeking

219
00:16:23.601 --> 00:16:27.410
to undermine the monarchy and the ancient constitution.

220
00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:30.320
So both of those conspiracy theories,

221
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:35.570
which I mentioned last time seem to have been confirmed by events.

222
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:41.710
There were also some members of parliament who much as they opposed Lourdes

223
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.730
innovations in the church did not want a puritan assault upon the episcopal

224
00:16:46.731 --> 00:16:50.930
structure of the Church of England.
That was going too far in their view.

225
00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:56.750
The whole issue raised by the ground remonstrance the many issues raised by it.

226
00:16:56.990 --> 00:17:01.820
We're passionately debated in a session which went on until two o'clock in the

227
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:06.821
morning when it was finally passed by the House of Commons by only 159 votes to

228
00:17:08.871 --> 00:17:13.370
148 and narrow victory for John Pym.

229
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:19.340
He had the grand remonstrance printed and distributed outside parliament into

230
00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:21.650
the country to win support.

231
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.600
So with the grand remonstrance,

232
00:17:26.601 --> 00:17:31.601
what had been a virtually United opposition to the king was dividing.

233
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:38.530
And it was the fact that that once United opposition split that made possible

234
00:17:38.871 --> 00:17:39.704
civil war,

235
00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:45.610
it made possible the kings rallying of a party to his course.

236
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:48.770
On the 23rd of December,

237
00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:53.810
he rejected the grand remonstrance and then on the 4th of January,

238
00:17:55.890 --> 00:18:00.210
1642 he attempted a coup by coming in person to parliament with troops to

239
00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:04.080
attempt to arrest the leaders of the House of Commons.

240
00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:09.420
The five leaders that he was looking for escaped had been forewarned of his

241
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:13.620
arrival.
They fled down river and took refuge in the city of London.

242
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:21.100
Faced with this situation,
Charles withdrew from his capital.

243
00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.450
Some members of parliament were also withdrawing quietly,

244
00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.330
leaving parliament and going back to their estates.

245
00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:33.810
Queen Henrietta Maria left and went to France to consult with her brother Louis

246
00:18:33.881 --> 00:18:38.881
the 13th and to raise money as possible to buy arms for a royal army.

247
00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:45.580
In June,
1642 oh sorry.
In March,

248
00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:50.580
1642 parliament passed an ordinance known as the militia ordinance.

249
00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.110
An ordinance was not an act of parliament.

250
00:18:56.111 --> 00:18:58.300
A full active parliament needed the king's signature.

251
00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:03.840
They had decided to pass ordinances with the force of law to legislate without

252
00:19:04.451 --> 00:19:09.451
the king and they pass the militia ordinance seizing the right to raise troops

253
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:15.040
and appoint military commanders.
So they too were preparing to raise forces.

254
00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.250
In June,

255
00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:22.780
1642 they offered to the king the so called 19 propositions.

256
00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:29.760
This included such terms as or privy counselors should in future be approved by

257
00:19:29.921 --> 00:19:34.570
parliament or major officers of s of state should be approved by parliament.

258
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:39.220
The militia order allowing parliament to raise troops and upon commanders should

259
00:19:39.221 --> 00:19:40.054
be accepted.

260
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:44.830
The king should consent to whatever reform in the Church of England.

261
00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.630
Parliament advised

262
00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:53.470
Charles replied to this ultimatum that if he was to accept this,

263
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:54.550
I'm quoting him,

264
00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:59.530
it would be the total subversion of the fundamental laws and excellent

265
00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:04.531
constitution of this kingdom for he continued parliament never was intended for

266
00:20:05.951 --> 00:20:10.951
any share in government or the choosing of them that governed

267
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.870
<v 1>okay.</v>

268
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.800
<v 0>Now,
of course the king was technically right,</v>

269
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:21.770
but things had passed beyond the question of what was or what was not.

270
00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:27.100
The excellent ancient constitution to which both sides continually appealed in

271
00:20:28.611 --> 00:20:29.720
different ways.

272
00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:35.020
Both sides of the dispute had now subverted the ancient constitution,

273
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:39.740
which they professed to revere and under the pressure of events,

274
00:20:39.741 --> 00:20:44.060
they had gradually entered completely unchartered waters,

275
00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:48.520
a situation which no had envisaged,

276
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:50.200
let alone planned.

277
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:52.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

278
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:56.530
<v 0>In July,
1642 parliament voted to raise an army.</v>

279
00:20:57.370 --> 00:20:59.170
In August,

280
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:04.170
1642 Charles having rejected parliaments terms raised his banner in the city of

281
00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:09.490
Nottingham and called on all true subjects to come to his support.

282
00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:10.541
In fact,

283
00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:15.220
by the time Charles raised the royal standard at Nottingham fighting had already

284
00:21:15.221 --> 00:21:19.480
broken out in the town of Manchester in the northwest,

285
00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.190
where the townspeople resisted the attempts by one of the king's supporters to

286
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:26.860
see as the town's magazine of arms.

287
00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:31.480
The first shots were fired that day.
England was at war,

288
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:36.640
at war with its own king and at war with itself.

289
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.353
<v 1>So</v>

290
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:49.100
<v 0>by the time civil war broke out in July,</v>

291
00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.810
August,

292
00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:55.600
1642 the combination of a determined effort to reverse Charles the first

293
00:21:55.610 --> 00:22:00.610
policies in church and state and the unforeseen circumstances provoked by the

294
00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:05.861
Irish rebellion had led parliament to make what might reasonably reasonably be

295
00:22:06.411 --> 00:22:09.710
called revolutionary political claims.

296
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:14.240
But how far would it go and where would it end?

297
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:18.320
Those questions were now to be settled by war,

298
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:23.950
and it was a war which itself unleashed a further dynamic of unforeseen

299
00:22:25.011 --> 00:22:28.610
circumstances,
unforeseen consequences.

300
00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:32.360
That continuing dynamic,

301
00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:37.840
perhaps derived ultimately from the complexity of the causes of the war and the

302
00:22:37.971 --> 00:22:41.990
various machines of motives which led people to fight.

303
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:48.020
And also from the remarkable dread breadth of voluntary participation in the

304
00:22:48.021 --> 00:22:48.854
war.

305
00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:53.810
The participation in the fighting was remarkably wide.
Socially,

306
00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:59.170
it's been estimated that perhaps a fifth of all adult men in the kingdom fought

307
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.470
in the civil war.
Now,

308
00:23:03.471 --> 00:23:08.450
historians have long argued the toss about the real causes of the war.

309
00:23:08.451 --> 00:23:11.210
It's one of the great debates of English historiography,

310
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:13.460
and usually when they do so,

311
00:23:13.970 --> 00:23:18.970
they try to emphasize a particular dominant variable in their own

312
00:23:19.311 --> 00:23:23.570
interpretation.
They frequently seek for a single prime mover,

313
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.840
the dominant cause.
Really,

314
00:23:26.841 --> 00:23:31.841
I think that that's a foolish exercise because the essential point,

315
00:23:32.151 --> 00:23:33.950
it seems to me about the civil wars,

316
00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:39.050
is that they were about subtly different things to different people who

317
00:23:39.051 --> 00:23:40.010
participated,

318
00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:45.460
and indeed all of the competing modern interpretations be they wig or Marxist or

319
00:23:47.241 --> 00:23:48.074
revisionist.

320
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:53.230
All of them can be prefigured in the views of some contemporaries themselves.

321
00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:59.780
Different people at the time thought the war was about different things to the

322
00:23:59.781 --> 00:24:00.614
Scots.

323
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:05.950
It was about religion and the t distinctive institutions of what was still an

324
00:24:06.231 --> 00:24:07.400
independent kingdom.

325
00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:12.110
Even if it had the same king as the Kingdom of England to the Irish,

326
00:24:12.111 --> 00:24:17.111
it was about land and about religion amongst the English.

327
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:21.770
Some royalist join the king simply out of loyalty.

328
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:27.260
He was the king,
some sort of themselves as defending the monarchs,

329
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:31.580
legitimate constitutional rights against popular spirits.

330
00:24:32.570 --> 00:24:37.400
Some saw themselves as defending the Church of England against a puritan plot to

331
00:24:37.401 --> 00:24:41.540
dismantle it.
Some Roman Catholics joined the king.

332
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.070
Many of them joined the king.
In fact,

333
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:48.730
out of fear of what a puritan victory might mean and in the hope that if they

334
00:24:49.221 --> 00:24:50.300
supported the king,

335
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:54.710
he might grant them future toleration in the exercise of their religion.

336
00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:01.850
Some gentlemen joined him because they feared social disorder.

337
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.050
They feared that a collapse of regular government would lead to a breakdown of

338
00:25:06.051 --> 00:25:10.970
social order,
a fear which was much played upon by royalist propaganda,

339
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:16.630
which stressed the plebeian nature of many of those who had shown support for

340
00:25:17.001 --> 00:25:20.480
the parliament.
The demonstrators in London,
for example,

341
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:26.320
parliamentarians were early labeled by royalist propagandists as roundheads

342
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:29.660
people with short haircuts,

343
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:35.120
which meant common people not wearing the flowing locks have a gentleman

344
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:38.660
on the other side.

345
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:44.080
Some parliamentarians saw themselves as defending the ancient constitution and

346
00:25:44.391 --> 00:25:47.900
the law against the king who could not be trusted

347
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.370
if they had encroached on the powers of Charles.
The first,

348
00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:55.490
it was not because they were attacking monarchy as such,

349
00:25:56.390 --> 00:26:00.920
the battle cry for the parliamentary area and armies was for the king and

350
00:26:00.921 --> 00:26:04.910
parliament.
Whereas the war cry of the rightest was simply for the king.

351
00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:08.810
But the parliamentarian slogan was King and parliament.

352
00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:14.780
Others saw themselves as defending English Protestantism against Polish

353
00:26:14.781 --> 00:26:15.614
innovation.

354
00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.210
Many banners of regimens raised in the parliaments support had religious symbols

355
00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:24.030
upon them,
some soil as the Ma,

356
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:29.110
the moment at last at which they could move beyond the traditional Anglican

357
00:26:29.541 --> 00:26:33.050
settlement and achieve a full of reformation in church and nation.

358
00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:39.760
Much intensive research has been done on side taking and it suggests that both

359
00:26:40.941 --> 00:26:45.941
socially and geographically were differences in the composition of the two

360
00:26:46.381 --> 00:26:50.070
sides.
But really they would just differences of degree.

361
00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:55.590
They were not absolutely clear divisions.
So for example,

362
00:26:56.670 --> 00:27:00.060
two thirds of the House of Lords were for the king,

363
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.250
but one third of the Lords fought for parliament,
the earls of Manchester,

364
00:27:05.251 --> 00:27:09.000
of Bedford.
Of Warrick of Northumberland and others fought for parliament.

365
00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:14.460
Most of the gentry actually managed to stay out of it altogether,

366
00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.670
but of the very large minority who did fight,

367
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:22.380
no significant difference can be found in terms of their relative social and

368
00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:26.340
economic position where the differences can be discerned.

369
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.750
They seem to have been differences of principle,
sometimes religious principle,

370
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.210
sometimes constitutional principle.

371
00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:38.690
So this was a war in which many of those who took part understood it as having a

372
00:27:39.151 --> 00:27:43.320
powerful ideological element of one kind or another.

373
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:49.950
And much of this was true also of the common people because they didn't

374
00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:54.660
participate simply as dutiful tenants or pressed men.

375
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:59.910
Of course,
some did,
but many voluntarily took part

376
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:02.700
predictably.

377
00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:08.030
The loyalties of the so called middle sort of people counted most the kinds of

378
00:28:08.431 --> 00:28:13.431
people who are leaders in their townships and parishes and they seem to have

379
00:28:13.711 --> 00:28:18.030
been moved by similar motivations to those of the gentry.

380
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.393
Amongst them.

381
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.500
We hear most in contemporary sources about a tendency to support parliament.

382
00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:28.470
Most of them seem indeed to have been on that side.

383
00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:34.080
We mustn't forget that these were people who also participated in local

384
00:28:34.081 --> 00:28:37.710
government,
or be it at a humble level.
Many of them,

385
00:28:37.711 --> 00:28:42.711
if they had free hold land or citizens of towns with a broad franchise had taken

386
00:28:43.441 --> 00:28:45.000
part in the elections.

387
00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.950
They were people who had signed the county and municipal petitions,

388
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:53.310
which had been brought to the long parliament in 1640

389
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:59.280
and amongst such people amongst the middle sought as contemporaries called them.

390
00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:01.470
Uh,
one Contemporary Observer,

391
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:06.500
Richard Baxter tells us there were many good Commonwealth's men as he described

392
00:29:07.021 --> 00:29:10.320
them,
concerned about law,
about taxation,

393
00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:13.410
about the liberties and survival of parliament.

394
00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:18.690
Though Baxter added that amongst them also were many who were sensible of these

395
00:29:18.691 --> 00:29:21.630
things.
I'm cutting him sensible of these things,

396
00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.040
but much more sensible of the interests of religion.
Again,

397
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.420
ideological issues percolating far down in society

398
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:36.510
as with the gentry.
Most of the middle sort of people did stay out of it,

399
00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.060
but if those who voluntarily participated,

400
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:42.190
a great many were for the parliament,

401
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:47.310
a mirror image of the aristocracy and the major towns and industrial areas where

402
00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:50.560
all parliamentarian in sympathy.

403
00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:57.010
So one could say if the royalists propaganda of the early years of the war

404
00:29:57.011 --> 00:29:59.500
tended to be aristocratic in tone,

405
00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:05.260
a good deal of the propaganda of parliament was aimed broadly in society and was

406
00:30:05.261 --> 00:30:07.570
somewhat populist in its tone.

407
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.940
So for many of the middle sought to this was there,
cause also,

408
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:18.490
but be that as it may,
they didn't call the tune.

409
00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:24.120
Both sides of the war were directed by gentlemen and in approaching the actual

410
00:30:24.761 --> 00:30:25.810
events of the war,

411
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:30.190
it helps to consider what their war aims were.

412
00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:36.130
The aims of the king and his advisors were simple.

413
00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:41.940
The king intended to win and then dictate terms to a defeated parliament.

414
00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.820
To that to end his basic strategy was to consolidate his control of territory in

415
00:30:48.311 --> 00:30:52.840
the north and west of England where his supporters were in the majority and then

416
00:30:52.841 --> 00:30:57.010
to advance upon London and take the city.
Early in the war,

417
00:30:57.011 --> 00:31:00.400
his principal base was established on Oxford in Oxford.

418
00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:02.800
I'm from Oxford.

419
00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:08.390
He intended to advance to take London simple enough.

420
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:13.950
He almost achieved it in 1642 when some of his troops arrived on the very

421
00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:19.600
outskirts of London and were turned back by armed apprentices from the city were

422
00:31:19.601 --> 00:31:24.250
advanced to meet them.
I turn them green.
The Reuters,
for whatever reason,

423
00:31:24.251 --> 00:31:28.240
chose not to attack.
They retreated and the city was saved.

424
00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:29.531
Turn them.

425
00:31:29.531 --> 00:31:34.531
Green incidentally is on the tube line as you go in from Heathrow airport to

426
00:31:34.571 --> 00:31:38.050
central London.
If you ever going in that way on a visit to London,

427
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.760
you'll go right through them.
Green,

428
00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.640
not all who fought for the king high of a shared these simple war aims.

429
00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:50.110
There were plenty amongst them who had actually opposed him in 1640 but who

430
00:31:50.111 --> 00:31:52.300
couldn't bring themselves to fight against him.

431
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.510
They would have preferred a negotiated settlement,

432
00:31:56.410 --> 00:32:00.670
but although Charles occasionally paused to engage in negotiations for tactical

433
00:32:00.671 --> 00:32:03.970
reasons,
it's unlikely that he ever did it.
Seriously.

434
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.080
The war aims of parliament were different.

435
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:13.570
Parliament neither sought nor expected,
an outright military victory.

436
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:18.130
The aim was to achieve as strategic superiority,

437
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.730
which would then force the king to come to terms.

438
00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:27.190
The idea was to hold the south and the east at the major cities where

439
00:32:27.191 --> 00:32:32.191
parliamentarian support was strongest to contest the north and the West in order

440
00:32:32.711 --> 00:32:37.711
to weaken the king and above all to prevent the king from taking London.

441
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.340
Parliamentary armies were organized in regional associations based on

442
00:32:43.341 --> 00:32:48.260
associations of counties who raised troops to operate only within their own

443
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:49.094
zone.

444
00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:53.840
In addition to which a field army was raised under the command of the Earl of

445
00:32:53.841 --> 00:32:54.674
Essex,

446
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:59.950
which had the principle duty of protecting London by shadowing royal forces in

447
00:33:00.621 --> 00:33:01.454
the Midlands.

448
00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:07.840
So the war consistent for the most part of a great deal of regional skirmishing

449
00:33:08.151 --> 00:33:13.151
in the provinces and local campaigning by one garrison against another all over

450
00:33:13.761 --> 00:33:18.761
the north and the West and the Midlands and then campaigns in which the major

451
00:33:19.941 --> 00:33:24.620
field army shadowed one another mostly in the South Midlands and in the

452
00:33:24.621 --> 00:33:29.621
approaches to London with occasional pitched battles when London was seriously

453
00:33:29.871 --> 00:33:30.704
threatened.

454
00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.093
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

455
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:39.400
<v 0>such was the basic situation in the first two years of the war from 1642 to 1644</v>

456
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:41.960
but as the war continued,

457
00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:47.030
the experience of a conflict of the conflict and the need to respond to the

458
00:33:47.031 --> 00:33:52.031
situations that had created began to release greater passions and to create new

459
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.080
war aims

460
00:33:57.030 --> 00:33:58.650
militarily and politically.

461
00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:04.160
The pattern was off summer military campaigns followed by winter politics when

462
00:34:06.571 --> 00:34:11.400
the armies were simply and camped in winter quarters and the result of the

463
00:34:11.401 --> 00:34:13.170
summer campaign affected the politics.

464
00:34:13.171 --> 00:34:16.590
The result of the winter politics affected the next summer campaign.

465
00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.760
That's how it went.

466
00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:22.440
In the summer of 1643 the king came very close to winning again.

467
00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:27.600
He consolidated his strength in the north and the west and seemed poised for a

468
00:34:27.601 --> 00:34:28.740
victorious strike.

469
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:35.030
Politically parliament saw the emergence that winter of three broad groupings.

470
00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:40.590
There was a peace group in parliament who thought it would be best to negotiate

471
00:34:40.591 --> 00:34:44.430
with the king now and get the best terms that could be obtained before

472
00:34:44.431 --> 00:34:49.410
everything was lost.
On the other hand,
there was a so called war group.

473
00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:54.780
They had become convinced that only and more aggressive military policy would

474
00:34:54.781 --> 00:34:59.781
succeed in bringing the king to terms and they'd have to defeat them militarily

475
00:34:59.791 --> 00:35:02.130
first before he would talk seriously.

476
00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.890
And between the two was a large middle group,

477
00:35:04.891 --> 00:35:08.070
which could be swayed either way by debates in parliament.

478
00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:15.240
Late in 1643 the war group with the backing of John Pym,

479
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
who at this time was actually dying of cancer and had died by the end of the

480
00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:21.760
year.

481
00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:26.560
The Wall Group decided that it was necessary to try to bring the Scots back in

482
00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:29.860
in order to break the royalists hold on the north of England.

483
00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:36.780
And in September they negotiated the solemn League and covenant with the

484
00:35:37.531 --> 00:35:38.790
Scottish covenanters.

485
00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.860
It was agreed that the Scots would aid parliament militarily,

486
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:49.730
but the price of their support was acceptance of reform of the Church of England

487
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:55.730
according to the word of God and the example of the best reformed churches.

488
00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:57.690
That was the wording and to treaty.

489
00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:03.230
The Scots understood that to mean Presbyterianism and assembly was set up at

490
00:36:03.991 --> 00:36:07.980
Westminster of English divine's more than a hundred ministers,

491
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:12.450
a number of lay commissioners and Scottish observers to discuss a future

492
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.530
religious settlement.

493
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:20.540
Almost simultaneously in the autumn of 1643 Charles agreed a cessation of

494
00:36:22.861 --> 00:36:24.450
hostilities in Ireland,

495
00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:30.870
the Irish rebel confederation held power there.

496
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:36.830
The cessation of hostilities by the remaining royalist garrisons was achieved in

497
00:36:37.021 --> 00:36:41.700
order to get aid for the king from the Irish rebel confederation.

498
00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.060
They would bring in reinforcements from the West.

499
00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:47.460
All of this,

500
00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:51.090
both the bringing in of the Scots and the bringing in of the Irish rebels of

501
00:36:51.091 --> 00:36:56.091
course inevitably heightened the already existing sense of the war as being in

502
00:36:58.261 --> 00:37:00.360
part a religious conflict.

503
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.430
1644 brought another shift.

504
00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:11.940
The entry of the Scots facilitated parliaments recovery in the north.

505
00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:17.570
The Scott swept south again recovered Newcastle and began besieging the city of

506
00:37:17.761 --> 00:37:21.990
York.
Charles detached his nephew,

507
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:25.170
Prince Rupert to relieve the threat to York,

508
00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:30.380
which was an army which proceeded north and expected an easy victory in

509
00:37:31.141 --> 00:37:34.680
relieving the city.
But he got quite a surprise.

510
00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.730
The Scots together with the army of the Eastern Association,

511
00:37:38.731 --> 00:37:42.660
which was based in Cambridge and had men from the eastern counties advanced

512
00:37:42.661 --> 00:37:47.100
north to join the Scotts and fought outside of your outside York.

513
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:51.870
The great battle of master and more at which the royalists under Prince Rupert

514
00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.240
were utterly defeated.

515
00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:01.220
The parliamentarian victory was in particularly due to the role of the cavalry

516
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:06.780
of the Eastern Association under the command of a figure who was rapidly

517
00:38:06.781 --> 00:38:08.790
emerging in the parliamentary forces.

518
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:12.360
Oliver Cromwell and brief word about Cromwell.

519
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:18.270
Cromwell was a squire of um,
high birth,

520
00:38:18.271 --> 00:38:23.271
but low means a younger son who had been MP for,

521
00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:25.200
um,

522
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:30.200
Cambridge in the long parliament and who had left parliament in order to raise

523
00:38:31.201 --> 00:38:34.740
forces for the Eastern Association at the outbreak of war.

524
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:40.140
It gradually risen from captain of a troop to Colonel Colonel of a cavalry

525
00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:41.014
regiment.

526
00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.880
He was a man who has been described as a man of agonies and exhortations,

527
00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:51.220
passionately religious,
something of a depressive.
He found himself in the war.

528
00:38:51.221 --> 00:38:55.330
He found the cause he'd been looking for and his troops were known for their

529
00:38:55.331 --> 00:38:58.000
training and their discipline.
It was,

530
00:38:58.001 --> 00:39:02.200
they're conducted Moston more in particular their capacity after a charge to

531
00:39:02.201 --> 00:39:04.780
rally reform and charge again,

532
00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:08.320
which had done a good deal to defeat the gallant,

533
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:11.200
but much less disciplined royalist cavalry.

534
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:17.650
The total victory which was achieved by the Scots and the Eastern Association at

535
00:39:17.651 --> 00:39:20.470
Moston more was a considerable shock,

536
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:24.040
the first complete parliamentarian victory,

537
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:30.360
but the momentum of that victory was squandered by the parliaments commanders in

538
00:39:30.641 --> 00:39:31.474
the south,

539
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:36.550
the decisiveness and the incompetence of the senior commanders of the South,

540
00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:37.900
the Earl of Essex,

541
00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:43.140
and the Earl of Manchester meant that the year ended once again in stalemate.

542
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:48.580
There was another indecisive holding battle to stop the king reaching London at

543
00:39:48.581 --> 00:39:52.930
Newberry while the Earl of Essex advanced down into the west of England,

544
00:39:52.931 --> 00:39:57.580
God himself cornered and had to surrender and have his troops ignominiously

545
00:39:57.581 --> 00:40:00.610
transported by c back to the southeast,

546
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:04.390
having surrendered their arms to royalist forces there.

547
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:12.160
The second battle of Newberry holding the king back again from reaching London,

548
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:17.200
brought to a head the growing tension over parliaments.
War aims,

549
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:22.860
Cranwell who'd and south with his cavalry to join that,
uh,

550
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:27.900
to join Manchester at Newberry pressed the Earl of Manchester to continue the

551
00:40:28.631 --> 00:40:32.740
battle to try to turn it into the dis,
a decisive victory.

552
00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.500
Manchester refused to do so.

553
00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:40.540
It was enough for him to stop the king from advancing further towards London.

554
00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:46.570
According to their recorded argument,
Manchester declared to chrome.

555
00:40:46.571 --> 00:40:51.160
Well,
if we beat the King 90 and nine times,

556
00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:53.020
yet he is king still.

557
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:59.200
And so we'll have his posterity be after him and we subjects still.

558
00:41:00.490 --> 00:41:02.710
But if the king beat us once,

559
00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:08.650
we will all be hanged and our posterity be made slaves.

560
00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:10.001
In other words,

561
00:41:10.001 --> 00:41:14.860
he didn't dare risk a decisive battle to which Crum well replied.

562
00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:19.660
Why then if this be so,
why did we take up arms?

563
00:41:19.661 --> 00:41:20.680
At first?

564
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.800
The recriminations continued bitterly in parliament during the winter,

565
00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:34.050
resulting early in 1645 in a victory for the party in the House of Commons.

566
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.090
First of all,
they'd decided to dissolve the existing parliamentarian field army,

567
00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:44.660
and to form what was described as a new model army,

568
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:49.940
which would be paid and controlled from Westminster and would incorporate the

569
00:41:49.941 --> 00:41:54.941
best elements of all previously existing parliamentarian forces and be free to

570
00:41:55.611 --> 00:41:58.940
operate wherever it was needed throughout the kingdom.

571
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:04.880
Secondly,
they passed a self-denying ordinance.

572
00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:10.180
The self-denying ordinance required the resignation of all commanders who were

573
00:42:11.961 --> 00:42:13.340
members of parliament.

574
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:18.950
It was a clever move to forced the resignation of the incompetent as democratic

575
00:42:18.951 --> 00:42:21.200
leaders of the parliaments troops.

576
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:25.940
But there was one exemption from the self-denying ordinance.

577
00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:28.130
Cranwell was exempted.

578
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:33.640
His native military genius by now had shown itself so clearly that he simply

579
00:42:33.651 --> 00:42:37.430
couldn't be spared.
He was appointed left 10 in general of the Horse,

580
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:39.800
not commander of the entire army.

581
00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.460
The Lord General was so Thomas Fairfax,

582
00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.280
the leader of the parliaments cause in Yorkshire.

583
00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:50.150
Cranwell was his left hand in general in command of the cavalry.

584
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:55.640
Meanwhile,
the war conditions,

585
00:42:55.641 --> 00:42:58.430
we're having an anticipated painted consequences elsewhere.

586
00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.510
London was a city in ferment.

587
00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:08.860
1640 had seen the collapse of censorship of the press and a proliferation of

588
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:14.480
pamphlets arguing different political and religious ideas.

589
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:19.100
Something in the region of an average of a thousand a year were being printed in

590
00:43:19.101 --> 00:43:24.101
London in the early 1640s the first newspapers were beginning to appear

591
00:43:24.441 --> 00:43:29.441
reporting on the events of the war 10 a week by 1644 they had also been a

592
00:43:31.341 --> 00:43:33.170
collapse of church discipline.

593
00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.700
Radical religious groups were emerging from underground and meeting openly.

594
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:43.340
New groups were forming in the debate over future religious settlement.

595
00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:49.240
The city was highly politicized and a wash with all kinds of heterodox ideas.

596
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:55.030
In 1646 a Presbyterian Minister Thomas Edwards was so shocked by the ideas that

597
00:43:56.901 --> 00:44:01.070
were circulating in London that he wrote his work gang greener,

598
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:06.800
which was a three volume catalog of the heterodox opinions circulating in the

599
00:44:06.801 --> 00:44:10.400
city.
Edwards was an Orthodox Calvinist,

600
00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:15.820
utterly horrified at what had broken forth and he was not alone.

601
00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:20.360
Many more conservatively minded members of parliament in matters of religion

602
00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:24.140
began to favor a Scottish style Presbyterian settlement,

603
00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:29.320
which would at least restore order and orthodoxy in matters of religion.

604
00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.220
And a group of parliamentarian,

605
00:44:32.221 --> 00:44:37.221
Presbyterians were able to push through acceptance of a directory of worship,

606
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:41.940
which would replace the Anglican prayer book and to vote in favor of a

607
00:44:41.941 --> 00:44:46.770
Presbyterian church structure to be imposed when the war was over.

608
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:52.110
Others.
However,
including all of the chrome,
well,

609
00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:57.500
we're not alarmed by what seemed to be a new age of the spirit in matters of

610
00:44:58.201 --> 00:44:59.034
religion.

611
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:03.660
They favored independency congregationalism in church government.

612
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:09.410
They were opposed to the imposition of any form of coercion in matters of

613
00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:11.274
conscience.

614
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:16.230
So in these debates going on in London and in parliament,

615
00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:20.160
religious liberty was emerging as an issue.

616
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:24.300
And for some people,
another aim of the conflict,

617
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:27.210
which had not been previously foreseen.

618
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:32.280
It was in 1644 the pamphlets advocating religious toleration.
Um,

619
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:37.520
we're quite widely printed and it saw the printing of John Milton's great area

620
00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:38.963
of forget occur.

621
00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:44.340
His wonderful statement in favor of freedom of speech and thought

622
00:45:46.290 --> 00:45:49.860
equally worrying to the more conservative members of parliament was a situation

623
00:45:49.861 --> 00:45:53.580
in the parliaments army
like the city.

624
00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:58.970
The army was a concentration of tens of thousands of people in a mass situation.

625
00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:04.650
A most unusual social situation.
The army was full of volunteers.

626
00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:09.960
They were disproportionately men of puritan inclination in religion.

627
00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:14.550
Many of them were for London or East Anglia or the godly are areas of the north

628
00:46:14.551 --> 00:46:17.640
and the Midlands.
By 1644,

629
00:46:17.641 --> 00:46:22.380
Oliver Cromwell was already well known to favor such godly men and to have a

630
00:46:22.381 --> 00:46:24.870
preference for promoting them on merit,

631
00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:30.300
a shocking idea to 17th century sensibilities.
Famously,

632
00:46:30.301 --> 00:46:34.260
he declared in one argument over the promotion of a junior officer.

633
00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:39.830
I had rather have a plain russet coated captain who loves what he fights for,

634
00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:45.330
who knows what he fights for and loves what he knows.

635
00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:49.830
Then what you call a gentleman who is nothing else

636
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.250
with the formation of the new model army.
In 1645,

637
00:46:56.310 --> 00:47:00.600
all of these elements were brought together and it took on a very distinctive

638
00:47:00.601 --> 00:47:04.530
character.
The new model,
especially amongst it's junior officers,

639
00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:09.770
was full of Cromwells russet copilot captains who knew what they fought for and

640
00:47:10.081 --> 00:47:14.970
loved what they knew promoted on merit.
It was a praying army,

641
00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:18.210
uh,
preaching army and Godly army.
Uh,
surprisingly well,

642
00:47:18.211 --> 00:47:21.090
disciplined army by the standards of the day.

643
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:27.230
And in 1645 that spirit both contributed to and it was enhanced by victory,

644
00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:33.040
just 17th century sensibilities.

645
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:38.250
The proof of God's favor and with victory came quite exceptional morale.

646
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:43.090
In June,

647
00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:48.090
1645 Fairfax and Cranwell brought to battle and decisively defeated Charles's

648
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.750
main battle army at nays be in the Central Midlands.

649
00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:57.310
They then rapidly moved West Corner,
the army of the Wa,

650
00:47:57.340 --> 00:48:00.310
the royalist army of the west at Lang Port in Somerset,

651
00:48:00.700 --> 00:48:03.040
and roundly defeated them.

652
00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:09.720
By late 1645 and early 1646 it had become largely a matter of the army bottling

653
00:48:11.291 --> 00:48:13.900
up what remained of the king's forces in Oxford,

654
00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:19.500
seizing and capturing the city of Bristol and then mopping up the last royalist

655
00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:24.310
opposition
by net.
May,

656
00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:29.230
1646 the king seeing that there was no possibility of military recovery left

657
00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:30.820
Oxford in disguise,

658
00:48:31.090 --> 00:48:35.830
traveled north and gave himself up to the Scots at Newark near Nottingham.

659
00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:38.860
He thought he'd get better terms from them.

660
00:48:39.490 --> 00:48:43.030
So against all initial expectations,

661
00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:48.160
parliament had won an outright victory.
Achieving that victory,

662
00:48:48.161 --> 00:48:48.551
however,

663
00:48:48.551 --> 00:48:53.551
had released forces which could not easily be contained or pushed back into the

664
00:48:55.511 --> 00:48:56.344
bottle.

665
00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:02.430
After one of the last skirmishes of 1646 the royalist commander,

666
00:49:02.831 --> 00:49:03.670
Sir Alan,

667
00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:08.290
absolutely surrendered his sword to his parliamentarian opponent,

668
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:13.780
then sat down on a drum and is said to have said to the parliamentarian

669
00:49:13.781 --> 00:49:17.890
officer's,
well,
boys,
you have done your work.

670
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:23.430
Now you may go and play unless perhaps he will fall out amongst yourselves.

671
00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:29.920
And that was a very prescient remark because the business of establishing the

672
00:49:29.921 --> 00:49:34.921
terms of settlement with the victory achieved gradually turned in the next year

673
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.980
into a struggle over what was the meaning of the parliaments cause.

674
00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:44.650
And we turn to that next time.
