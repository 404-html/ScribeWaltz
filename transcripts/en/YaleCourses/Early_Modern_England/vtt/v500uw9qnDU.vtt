00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.060
We're in 1646 and as I explained last time,

2
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:07.440
the development of the war,

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.160
especially between 1643 and 45 had unleashed forces which could not easily be

4
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:19.461
controlled and created aims and expectations which had not originally existed at

5
00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:22.770
the outbreak of war,

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.160
especially the controversy concerning the future organization of the Church and

7
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:33.240
the issue of liberty of conscience.

8
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:34.713
Um,

9
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.540
parliament was now severely divided between those who wanted to Presbyterian

10
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:42.600
church settlement and the so called independence,

11
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.280
who favored liberty of conscience was the defeat of the king.

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.080
These issues,

13
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.230
we're now prominent in establishing the terms of settlement and as they

14
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:55.500
attempted a settlement,

15
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.730
the fundamental differences of perception of the nature of the parliamentary

16
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:00.420
cause.

17
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.141
What it had been,

18
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:04.530
what it was now came very much to the fore

19
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.950
in 1646 to seven,

20
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.630
the so called Presbyterian group where the dominant group in parliament,

21
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.030
they held the initiative.

22
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.760
And in July,

23
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.500
1646 they put two King Charles,

24
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:21.180
who was now in the north of England,

25
00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.520
held by the Scots in Newcastle.

26
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.150
They put to him the Newcastle propositions.

27
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.040
Under those terms,

28
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.840
the kings should take the covenant.

29
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.430
There should be a United Presbyterian church for both England and Scotland.

30
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.210
Parliament was to control the military for 20 years,

31
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.450
which they thought was roughly the Kings expected lifetime and 58 of the king

32
00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:50.111
supporters were to be exempted from pardon on the grounds that they had

33
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:53.250
committed various atrocities in the course of the war.

34
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.750
Charles faced with these terms played for time.

35
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.480
He might've lost militarily,

36
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.130
but he knew that they still needed him for any settlement.

37
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.440
Remember what the out of Manchester had said back in 1644 if we beat the King 90

38
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.150
and nine times,

39
00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.980
he is king still.

40
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.990
Charles knew that

41
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.220
in February,

42
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.880
1647 the Scots army was paid off by the English parliament.

43
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.050
They handed over the king into English custody and they withdrew back to

44
00:02:28.051 --> 00:02:32.310
Scotland and the king was brought south and lodged in the country house in North

45
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.311
Hampton,

46
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:37.311
share northwest of London home be house where negotiations continued.

47
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.233
Meanwhile,

48
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.770
the new model army,

49
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.570
which was now for the most part billeted in eastern England near Cambridge,

50
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.110
the new model army was ordered either to disband or to re enlist for service in

51
00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:56.460
Ireland where the Irish confederacy was still in control.

52
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.030
This demand provoked an army,

53
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.420
many of whom were already worried by the prospect of a settlement which would be

54
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:12.301
intolerant in matters of religion and the consequences of that provocation where

55
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:13.984
momentous

56
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.700
in April and May,

57
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.500
1647 the cavalry regiments of the new model elected representatives,

58
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.750
they were called agitators.

59
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.580
They elected agitators and a council of the army was formed,

60
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.740
which consisted of the general officers,

61
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.190
the colonels of the regiments and the representatives of the various regiments.

62
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.040
Then on the 4th of June,

63
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.200
a junior officer corner,

64
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.270
Joyce went to home be house and sees the king and brought him to the army.

65
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.010
The famous story that when Joyce arrived at home,

66
00:03:54.011 --> 00:03:58.780
because the guard there ask him where his warrant was to remove the king and he

67
00:03:58.781 --> 00:04:00.160
drew his pistol and said,

68
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.180
here is my warrant.

69
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.050
Then on the 14th of June,

70
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.830
the army issued and printed a declaration.

71
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.600
They declared themselves to be no mirror mercenary army,

72
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.390
but an army enlisted to defend our own and the people's just rights and

73
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:20.224
liberties.

74
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.070
They demanded an act of oblivion to wipe away all acts which had been committed

75
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.640
during the war.

76
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.440
Pardon for all acts committed.

77
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.070
They demanded liberty for tender consciences as they put it in matters of

78
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:40.171
religion and the army leaders with the council began drawing up their own terms

79
00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.930
for negotiation with the king whom they now held.

80
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.220
Then in late July,

81
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.220
1647 demonstrations in London on behalf of Presbyterianism and against the

82
00:04:53.231 --> 00:04:58.231
armies actions led to the independent members of parliament fleeing the city.

83
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.900
They fled to the army and asked for its protection.

84
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:03.820
On the 6th of August,

85
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.880
the army marched south and occupied London,

86
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.770
restoring them to parliament from which some of their Presbyterian enemies fled.

87
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.990
Now then it was the turn of the army and the independence in parliament to

88
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:24.991
attempt a settlement with the king and they put to him terms which we're

89
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:26.411
entitled,

90
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:28.270
the heads of the proposals.

91
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.180
They were drawn up by Henry [inaudible],

92
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.890
a former lawyer who was the commissary general of the new model and John

93
00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:36.020
Lambert,

94
00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.510
one of the cavalry kernels,

95
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.510
and they will probably the most generous terms.

96
00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.130
While there was certainly the most generous terms ever offered two King Charles,

97
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.480
remarkably so.

98
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.343
In fact,

99
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.210
the army insisted that in future there would be a parliament elected every two

100
00:05:52.211 --> 00:05:56.770
years and that control of the militia would be with parliament,

101
00:05:56.771 --> 00:05:57.920
but only 10 years,

102
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.480
not 20 they exempted only five royalists from,

103
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:03.314
pardon?

104
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.920
They were even willing to permit the reestablishment of a church of England with

105
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:11.180
bishops and the old prayer book,

106
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.780
but it should have no coercive powers over those who preferred other forms of

107
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:17.900
worship.

108
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.340
So reestablished church of England,

109
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.550
but with liberty for 10 to consciences Charles His aid and the negotiations

110
00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:25.960
should say,

111
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.960
John Barclay urged the king to accept these proposals.

112
00:06:31.161 --> 00:06:31.581
He said,

113
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:35.480
never would a kingdom last be so easily recovered as on such terms.

114
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.930
But the king temporized a Barclay later recorded in his memoirs that in his

115
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:42.134
view,

116
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.850
the king would not agree because he didn't trust well and item.

117
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.590
The reason he didn't trust them was that they asked for nothing for themselves,

118
00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.630
but most likely the king was simply playing for time and secretly opening

119
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.750
negotiations at this time with the Scots who were increasingly alarmed now that

120
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:10.070
they'd withdrawn from England at what was happening in England and at the

121
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:13.070
prospect of independence in power.

122
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.633
Meanwhile,

123
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.810
while this was going on,

124
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.730
a further set of proposals began gestating amongst the agitators and the Army

125
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:24.530
Council and some of the officers,

126
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:29.510
and these were deeply influenced by the views of the London radical movement.

127
00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:30.344
The levelers,

128
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.420
uh,

129
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:35.660
the level is led by John Little Lilburn,

130
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.560
William Wallin,

131
00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:42.040
Richard Overton and John Wildman had emerged initially as pamphleteers on behalf

132
00:07:43.821 --> 00:07:45.320
of liberty of conscience,

133
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.640
but their experience at the hands of an intolerant,

134
00:07:49.641 --> 00:07:52.490
Presbyterian dominated parliament led them to,

135
00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:57.050
began questioning the whole basis of government authority and the manner in

136
00:07:57.051 --> 00:07:59.820
which the hands of power might be tied in,

137
00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:01.280
in a number of respects.

138
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.810
They claimed in their pamphlets to speak on behalf of what they called the

139
00:08:05.811 --> 00:08:08.000
middle and poorer sort of people,

140
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.590
the hob nails,

141
00:08:09.980 --> 00:08:11.090
the cloud shoes,

142
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.440
the private soldiers,

143
00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.620
the leather and wool and Aprils and all the laborious and industrious people of

144
00:08:17.721 --> 00:08:18.554
England.

145
00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:24.150
Very distinctly populist stance and they advanced the claim.

146
00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:29.650
I'm coating that all power is originally and essentially in the whole body of

147
00:08:30.351 --> 00:08:32.090
the people of this nation.

148
00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:35.420
Declaration of popular sovereignty.

149
00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:37.580
Accordingly,

150
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.030
they put forward proposals including a single chamber parliament.

151
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:42.560
They would abolish the House of Lords,

152
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.660
a redistribution of parliamentary seats in order to make them more equitable

153
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:53.540
elections to be held every two years with a much wider male suffrage,

154
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.070
quite how wide is debatable.

155
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:58.950
They probably held a variety of different views of different times.

156
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.080
Some appear to have been for full manhood,

157
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:01.914
suffrage,

158
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.720
others for a more limited suffrage,

159
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:05.370
but certainly a larger one.

160
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.150
The full disestablishment of the church,

161
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.420
thorough reform of the legal system,

162
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:17.400
the laws to be simplified and to be printed in English.

163
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.880
Well in October,

164
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.880
1647 much of this was drawn up in a set of proposals called the agreement of the

165
00:09:26.521 --> 00:09:31.521
people and the agreement of the people having been debated a amongst them and

166
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.720
printed was then put forward to the army council in a set of debates which took

167
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:42.930
place in Putney church and then known as the Putney debates.

168
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:50.520
We have the full transcript of the Putney debates and it's a quite remarkable

169
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.383
survival.

170
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:56.280
The secretary of the army counsel took the whole thing down in shorthand and

171
00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:01.310
this was rediscovered in the late 19th century and is now fully available in

172
00:10:01.471 --> 00:10:02.304
print.

173
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.290
In the Putney debates,

174
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:04.550
we've,

175
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:08.820
we find fully transcribed the statements not only of the leaders of the army

176
00:10:08.821 --> 00:10:09.600
council,

177
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.790
but also the Indi Independent,

178
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:12.420
um,

179
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:17.420
interjections expressing their aspirations of nameless soldiers who had been

180
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:20.670
elected on behalf of their regiments.

181
00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:23.250
The secretary of the army counsel didn't know their names,

182
00:10:23.251 --> 00:10:25.350
he put them down as buff coat.

183
00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:30.530
I a man wearing a thick buff colored leather coat of a cavalryman or in one case

184
00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:32.820
Bedfordshire man,

185
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.790
a man who either had a Bedfordshire accent perhaps,

186
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:38.730
or perhaps was wearing the sash of the Bedfordshire regimen.

187
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:44.430
Some of the statements made our most extraordinary ringing declarations.

188
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.230
General item,

189
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:51.500
who did most of the talking on behalf of the officers thought that all men

190
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.300
should enjoy liberty under the law,

191
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.730
but he took the view conventional for a man of his class that the votes should

192
00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:01.980
only belong to people of property.

193
00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.270
Those with a permanent and fixed interest in the kingdom.

194
00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.850
In contrast to that view,

195
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.240
Thomas rain borough,

196
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:15.470
an artillery officer replied the poorest he that is in England hath a life to

197
00:11:16.651 --> 00:11:18.570
live as the greatest he.

198
00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:19.730
Therefore,

199
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:20.563
sir,

200
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.820
I truly think that every man that is to live under a government ought first by

201
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:30.330
his own consent to put himself under that government

202
00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:36.630
item appealed to the importance of constitutional tradition in going forward

203
00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:37.464
with the settlement.

204
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:43.030
2% Spi urged considering the reasonableness of the thing rather than

205
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:45.300
constitutional precedent.

206
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.950
Well,

207
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:48.690
the Putney debates are well worth reading,

208
00:11:48.691 --> 00:11:53.691
and they provide an astonishing insight into the ideas which was circulating in

209
00:11:55.301 --> 00:12:00.250
London and the army ideas generated by the experience of the war,

210
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.620
by the sense of possibility,

211
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.680
which had been unleashed upon among people who had been brought to ask as

212
00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:13.390
several data ask in the Putney debates what half the soldier fought for.

213
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.160
That's a phrase that repeatedly comes to the fore in the course of the debates,

214
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:23.410
and they tell us a lot about the army leaders to the Lord General.

215
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.680
Thomas Fairfax was largely silent.

216
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:29.320
Fairfax was a professional soldier,

217
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:30.400
not a politician.

218
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.130
He was famously taciturn and he said little,

219
00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.660
he merely acted as chairman.

220
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.140
Henry [inaudible] did most of the debating.

221
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.320
He was clearheaded very highly intelligent,

222
00:12:41.321 --> 00:12:42.154
sharp.

223
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.700
He clearly became exasperated with what he saw as the Utopian schemes being put

224
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:50.170
forward by the soldiers.

225
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:50.771
Uh,

226
00:12:50.771 --> 00:12:51.551
at one point,

227
00:12:51.551 --> 00:12:52.750
he replied to the question,

228
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:54.520
what are the soldier fought for by saying,

229
00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.710
I will tell you what the seller has fought for.

230
00:12:57.220 --> 00:12:59.590
That one man's will shall not be law.

231
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.280
That was items perception of the conflict,

232
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:08.320
but he also declared himself willing to follow where God might lead.

233
00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.610
Cranwell was something of a mediating figure.

234
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.630
He said comparatively little was characteristic of his manner.

235
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:21.870
He tended often when major decisions were to be made to hesitate,

236
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:24.483
to wait,

237
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:29.790
to wait on a sign from God and then when he was sure of his course of action to

238
00:13:30.491 --> 00:13:32.140
take drastic action.

239
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:34.601
Well,

240
00:13:34.601 --> 00:13:37.930
we're the general officer's seriously the negotiating with the representatives

241
00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:42.931
of the regiments or whether they just humoring the troops to maintain order and

242
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:47.770
coherence and the army while pressing ahead with their own negotiations with the

243
00:13:47.771 --> 00:13:48.604
king.

244
00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.770
We'll never really know because ultimately it came to nothing.

245
00:13:53.771 --> 00:13:58.771
The debates broke up in conclusively and the reason they broke up was because of

246
00:13:58.901 --> 00:14:00.130
an action on the part of the king.

247
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:06.240
Charles was very much aware of the possibilities of exploiting potential

248
00:14:07.781 --> 00:14:10.720
divisions on the parliamentarian side.

249
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:16.210
He was also very fearful of the radicals and what might happen if they were to

250
00:14:16.211 --> 00:14:18.970
gain the ascendancy in the army council.

251
00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.190
On the 11th of November,

252
00:14:21.191 --> 00:14:22.900
he escaped from custody,

253
00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:27.730
went south and took refuge on the isle of wight off the south coast of England.

254
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:34.020
There he was held by the parliamentarian governor in honorable custody,

255
00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:39.630
but he was allowed to receive representatives and they included representatives

256
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.020
from Scotland

257
00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.920
on the 15th of November.

258
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.660
Faced with this situation,

259
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:52.560
Fairfax and Cranwell called the army to a rendezvous and discipline was

260
00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.300
reimposed chrom well road up and down the ranks,

261
00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.290
plucking copies of the agreement of the people from the hat,

262
00:14:59.291 --> 00:15:02.210
bands of some of the soldiers who'd come with copies of the agreement of the

263
00:15:02.211 --> 00:15:03.740
people in their hats.

264
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:09.220
One in trangent and soldier was some early court marshaled and shot.

265
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

266
00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:14.740
<v 0>In December,</v>

267
00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:19.740
1647 the king meanwhile concluded an agreement with Scott's representatives.

268
00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:26.040
It was called the engagement in the engagement he undertook to accept a

269
00:15:26.411 --> 00:15:31.411
Presbyterian church in return for military aid and he also began secretly

270
00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.910
negotiation negotiating with the Irish confederacy.

271
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.760
Shortly afterwards.

272
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:45.030
In the spring of 1648 there were concerted royalist uprisings in various parts

273
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:48.400
of the Kingdom in Wales,

274
00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.110
in south Wales,

275
00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:51.003
in Kent,

276
00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:51.790
in Essex,

277
00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:54.400
and in the north in Yorkshire.

278
00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:56.973
Meanwhile,

279
00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.080
Charles,

280
00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.500
his supporters in Scotland,

281
00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.520
the engages,

282
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:05.550
began assembling an army for the invasion of England to deliver the king.

283
00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:07.323
And with that,

284
00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:10.210
the second civil war began.

285
00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.960
So after so much hope of a settlement,

286
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:23.140
so much generosity in the terms which had been offered to Charles in the heads

287
00:16:23.141 --> 00:16:24.040
of the proposals,

288
00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.810
this renewal of the war hardened hearts of the army's leaders

289
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.470
on the 29th of April,

290
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.860
1648 they called the whole army to a general assembly at Windsor to the west of

291
00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:40.861
London for a prayer meeting before they divided into various bodies,

292
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.520
each of which was to take on the royalist threat in different areas of the

293
00:16:45.521 --> 00:16:46.354
kingdom.

294
00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.720
And the mood at Windsor was very different from that.

295
00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:50.583
At Putney.

296
00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.760
The mood was one of heightened religious anxiety,

297
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:59.850
anger and expectation amongst men who had not wanted or expected to fight again.

298
00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:08.010
They saw the renewal of the war as being both a judgment from God upon their

299
00:17:08.831 --> 00:17:12.430
previous actions and a test of their resolve.

300
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:19.020
And they resolved that Charles was a man against whom God has witnessed and

301
00:17:20.651 --> 00:17:25.651
quoting from the declaration which ended the meeting and therefore that it was

302
00:17:27.491 --> 00:17:29.320
our duty if ever.

303
00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:33.400
The Lord brought us back to peace to call Charles Stewart,

304
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.930
that man of blood to an account for that blood.

305
00:17:37.931 --> 00:17:40.210
He had the shed and the miss chief.

306
00:17:40.211 --> 00:17:45.211
He has done to his utmost against the Lord's cause and people in these poor

307
00:17:45.881 --> 00:17:46.714
nations.

308
00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:48.910
And in that mood,

309
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:53.420
the army departed Fairfax to the east chrome,

310
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:58.440
well first whales and then to the north where on the 17th to the 19th of July he

311
00:17:59.911 --> 00:18:04.911
met and utterly shattered a much larger Scottish royalist army.

312
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.200
At the battle of Preston,

313
00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:08.161
a heart fought,

314
00:18:08.161 --> 00:18:09.240
fought running battle,

315
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:13.320
which stretched for miles along the road from Preston to Manchester.

316
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:21.920
Cromwells saw that victory as divinely ordained in the dispatch he sent back.

317
00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.880
He could see nothing but the hand of God in it as he put it.

318
00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:33.290
God had spoken again as far as he was concerned and the army began returning

319
00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:38.450
slowly to London in a mood of Religious Exaltation Pausing in Yorkshire to mop

320
00:18:39.481 --> 00:18:44.481
up royalist resistance at Pontefract castle before proceeding south that the

321
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:46.610
brief seizure Pontefract Thomas rain grow.

322
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:47.170
Uh,

323
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:48.003
the leveler,

324
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:49.003
um,

325
00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:49.883
was killed.

326
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.560
But meanwhile parliament had reopen negotiations with the king.

327
00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.330
The king was king still.

328
00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:07.010
This proved too much for the officers in London on the 6th of December,

329
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:12.180
1648 Colonel Thomas Pride station troops at the entrance to the House of Commons

330
00:19:12.181 --> 00:19:14.730
and conducted what's known as prides purge.

331
00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.040
He refused to allow into parliament.

332
00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:20.460
Anyone who did not sympathy sympathize with the army's cause.

333
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:25.320
Parliament was reduced to only 150 members known as the rump

334
00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:28.080
while this was going on.

335
00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:31.170
Cranwell was mysteriously absent.

336
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:36.530
He returned to London only after prides purge had been completed exactly where

337
00:19:37.711 --> 00:19:38.011
he was.

338
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:38.844
Isn't certain,

339
00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:39.270
um,

340
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.000
it's possible that he'd gone home to Huntington ship.

341
00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.020
That's one idea.

342
00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:48.210
He seems to have been undergoing one of those periods of reflection before

343
00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:50.880
deciding on decisive action,

344
00:19:50.881 --> 00:19:52.830
which were very characteristic of him.

345
00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:54.780
But once he came back,

346
00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:58.230
he was prominent in driving things ahead.

347
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.640
On the 1st of January,

348
00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.480
1649 the rump,

349
00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:07.080
the remaining hundred and 50 members of parliaments set up a high court of

350
00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:08.940
justice to try the king.

351
00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.240
The House of Lords refuse to participate.

352
00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:17.790
The House of Commons therefore declared that its own decisions would have the

353
00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:21.420
force of law since the people are under God.

354
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.480
The original of all just power.

355
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.300
On the 20th of January,

356
00:20:27.301 --> 00:20:28.680
Charles the first was arraigned,

357
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.263
the charge,

358
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.493
I'm quoting,

359
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.020
declaring him to be a tyrant,

360
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:39.200
a traitor and murderer and a public and implacable enemy to the Commonwealth of

361
00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:41.483
England.

362
00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:47.440
The king with great dignity attended his trial in Westminster Hall,

363
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.160
but refused to recognize the authority of the court.

364
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.530
He was condemned on the 29th of January,

365
00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:01.860
only 59 of the more than 150 members of the court could be prevailed upon to

366
00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:05.590
actually sign the king's death warrant.

367
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.720
And then the following day the king was executed.

368
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:15.870
On a scaffold outside his banqueting hall in Whitehall Palace.

369
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.500
It's still there today.

370
00:21:17.501 --> 00:21:18.340
The banqueting hall,

371
00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:21.070
the only surviving building of Whitehall palace,

372
00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.520
if you visited the room that you enter on the first floor is the former

373
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.670
banqueting hall itself.

374
00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:36.210
The ceiling is decorated with a wonderful painting by Rubens of the apotheosis

375
00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:37.541
of King James.

376
00:21:37.541 --> 00:21:41.440
The first Charles's father is shown ascending into heaven.

377
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.280
It's a wonderful artistic statement of divine right monarchy.

378
00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.660
And ironically it was under that painting.

379
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:55.080
The child's walked to step out from the window onto the scaffold wearing two

380
00:21:56.321 --> 00:22:01.321
shirts because it was a cold January day in case he should shiver and people

381
00:22:02.411 --> 00:22:03.640
might think he was afraid.

382
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.740
He met his death with great dignity,

383
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:10.741
perhaps knowing that this was the best thing he could do for the monarchy to die

384
00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:12.934
well.

385
00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:14.043
And so he did,

386
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.640
and as his head was struck off,

387
00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:21.570
one witness says that from the crowd there came such a Groan as I never heard

388
00:22:22.151 --> 00:22:22.984
before.

389
00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:27.460
It's ironic for those of us who live in new haven,

390
00:22:27.461 --> 00:22:32.461
that in Broadway we have a high Anglo Catholic Episcopalian Church,

391
00:22:32.471 --> 00:22:36.400
which is one of those that recognizes the execution of King Charles.

392
00:22:36.401 --> 00:22:37.140
The first,

393
00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:37.660
uh,

394
00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.870
commemorates it as a,

395
00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:39.810
uh,

396
00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.130
a martyrdom for the episcopal church.

397
00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:46.990
And we have running from Broadway three streets named after three of the men who

398
00:22:46.991 --> 00:22:48.820
signed his death warrant golf,

399
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.620
Molly and Dixwell.

400
00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:55.150
So the fingerprints of these events are here.

401
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:57.820
What next?

402
00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.560
They had tried and they had failed to reach a settlement with the king.

403
00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:05.500
Could they achieve one without him?

404
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:08.260
Well,

405
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.380
it was attempted in March 16,

406
00:23:11.381 --> 00:23:16.381
49 parliament declared the monarchy and the House of Lords abolished in May 16,

407
00:23:18.551 --> 00:23:19.270
49,

408
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:24.270
England was declared a Commonwealth and Free State or rich,

409
00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:25.660
what to run in the name,

410
00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:26.650
not of the king,

411
00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.890
but of the keepers of the liberties of England.

412
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.640
A new great seal was made for the kingdom,

413
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.490
which bore a picture not of the king,

414
00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:41.590
but of the House of Commons in session surrounded around the edge with the

415
00:23:41.591 --> 00:23:44.860
legend in the first year of freedom,

416
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:47.120
by God's blessing restored.

417
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:49.911
Well,

418
00:23:49.911 --> 00:23:54.911
perhaps in time those lofty aspirations might have acquired some real substance,

419
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:57.290
but for the moment,

420
00:23:57.410 --> 00:24:02.390
the fact was that this was a regime run by a committed minority,

421
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:08.500
supported by a somewhat larger body who were willing to conform to its authority

422
00:24:08.601 --> 00:24:13.601
out of pragmatism or for the sake of order or out of mere political opportunism.

423
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:17.930
But despite its lofty claims,

424
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.710
the survival of the regime depended ultimately upon the army.

425
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:27.190
And the army of course had an agenda of its own above all defense of liberty,

426
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.760
of conscience for the godly and the pursuit of a rather vaguely defined godly

427
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.040
reformation in the kingdom.

428
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:45.320
These tensions where initially disguised by the fact that there was an immediate

429
00:24:45.321 --> 00:24:47.690
need to defend the new regime

430
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:54.370
in 1649 to 50 parliament undertook the reconquest of Ireland to prevent its use

431
00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
as a base by Charles the second now age 19 and in exile.

432
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.420
And that's reconquest was brutally initiated by Cromwell himself.

433
00:25:09.050 --> 00:25:12.710
Cranwell was now appointed Lord General since the Thomas Fairfax,

434
00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:16.730
after the execution of the king in which he had no part was not willing to go

435
00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:17.420
any further,

436
00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.253
and retired

437
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:24.410
Cornwell blended into Ireland with very little understanding of the complexities

438
00:25:24.411 --> 00:25:29.411
of the Irish situation and blinded by the 1641 propaganda stereotype of the

439
00:25:33.981 --> 00:25:38.981
barbarities committed by the Irish rebels at the fortress town of Draka attorney

440
00:25:40.121 --> 00:25:42.680
or Dublin in 1649,

441
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:43.300
uh,

442
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.910
a massacre of the defenders of doctor was committed.

443
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.540
This was justified by the laws of war.

444
00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.830
They had refused to surrender honorably and under the laws of war at the time,

445
00:25:54.831 --> 00:25:59.690
a city taken by assault with the losses that that involved would be one which

446
00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:01.910
would be permitted no quarter.

447
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:04.011
Nevertheless,

448
00:26:04.011 --> 00:26:09.011
it was an act probably partly fueled by religious bigotry and zeal chrome

449
00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:13.850
himself in the dispatch he sent back to England after [inaudible] appears

450
00:26:13.851 --> 00:26:16.670
troubled by what he had ordered.

451
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.970
It has a very defensive tone.

452
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:21.801
Nonetheless,

453
00:26:21.801 --> 00:26:25.520
it was done and it initiated a bloody pacification of Ireland,

454
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:30.521
which continued for two years and culminated in confiscations of land from Irish

455
00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:36.131
landowners and the founding of a Protestant descendancy in Ireland with the land

456
00:26:37.341 --> 00:26:41.570
being granted to adventurers who had given money for the reconquest and

457
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.433
soldiers.

458
00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.660
It didn't create the Protestant island day envisaged.

459
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:50.990
It created a deeply divided society dominated by British land owners and the

460
00:26:51.811 --> 00:26:54.150
roots of the subsequent animosity,

461
00:26:54.151 --> 00:26:58.440
which remains even in the current fragile peace.

462
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.313
Meanwhile,

463
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:06.650
in 1650 Charles the second landed in Scotland where he was crowned King

464
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:09.450
Cromwell,

465
00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:14.450
moved north to campaign there against Charles on the 3rd of September,

466
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.690
1650 he took on the army of the covenants at the battle of Dunbar,

467
00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:21.030
heavily outnumbered his troops,

468
00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:25.860
Hungary and many of them sick and nevertheless by a brilliant tactic of

469
00:27:25.861 --> 00:27:26.700
attacking the central,

470
00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.380
the Scottish line and splitting it.

471
00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:31.920
They won an unexpected victory.

472
00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.140
Again,

473
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.870
Cromwell exalted the Lord Hath done this.

474
00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.370
He said in his dispatch,

475
00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:44.250
a second Scottish invasion force was formed in the West and moved south.

476
00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.410
Conwell then chased it down.

477
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.080
The east moved across and met them at Wooster.

478
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.470
A year after Dunbar were again on the 3rd of September.

479
00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:53.790
Exactly a year later.

480
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.430
They were completely defeated.

481
00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:02.540
The Battle of Wooster was described by chromium as the crowning mercy Charles

482
00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:05.820
the second who had been with that army,

483
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
fled into exile again after the famous incident in which he hid in an oak tree

484
00:28:11.641 --> 00:28:12.570
at boss scuttle house.

485
00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:17.490
Wild parliamentarians soldiers search the grounds beneath for him story he liked

486
00:28:17.491 --> 00:28:20.010
to tell later after he'd been restored to the crown

487
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:26.070
by 1653 the Commonwealth of England,

488
00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:31.100
Scotland and Ireland created by these military actions and conquest constituted

489
00:28:32.191 --> 00:28:34.770
the first or British state.

490
00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:36.780
And meanwhile,

491
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:42.320
in 1652 to four of victorious naval war was fought against the Dutch.

492
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.830
Initially at the very foundation of the English Commonwealth.

493
00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:52.220
The idea had been put forward a forming a union with the Dutch republic that had

494
00:28:52.531 --> 00:28:55.230
been rejected and subsequent quarrels,

495
00:28:55.460 --> 00:29:00.460
Dutch sheltering of Charles and trade rivalry led to a brief naval war in which

496
00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.780
the Commonwealth was victorious.

497
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.110
So by 1653

498
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.980
the Commonwealth was militarily triumphant.

499
00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:16.400
It's forces now battle hardened and possessed of the extraordinary morale which

500
00:29:17.071 --> 00:29:21.000
had come from victory after victory or apparently invincible,

501
00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:27.540
but with the peace tensions resurfaced.

502
00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:33.240
This was not the popular regime which had been envisaged by the levelers.

503
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.270
It was not the godly regime which had been envisaged by Cromwells.

504
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:44.630
The rump had passed a toleration act in 1650 granting toleration and religious

505
00:29:46.241 --> 00:29:48.140
sects of all kinds proliferate does.

506
00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:48.993
You know,

507
00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.980
some steps had been taken to improve the financial position of the clergy and

508
00:29:53.981 --> 00:29:58.630
the church to get a better quality of clergy and some cosmetic reforms had been

509
00:29:58.631 --> 00:29:59.890
made to the law.

510
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.000
But apart from that,

511
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:03.880
the rump showed little reforming zeal.

512
00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:09.940
There was also a good deal of suspicion in the army that the members of the rump

513
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:13.090
planned to perpetuate themselves forever.

514
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:16.030
There was talk that when a seat fell vacant,

515
00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:20.320
they would hold what were called recruiter elections for a single constituency

516
00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:25.000
rather than holding a general election for the election of an entirely new

517
00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:25.953
parliament,

518
00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.340
the army didn't like that.

519
00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.890
Finally on the 20th of April,

520
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:36.520
1653 when it appeared that the ramp was about to go ahead with that scheme,

521
00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:41.920
Crum well who had been waiting patiently precipitately acted.

522
00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:47.220
He stood up in parliament called in troops and dissolved the rump famously

523
00:30:48.461 --> 00:30:53.170
declaring as he drove them out of their chamber be gone.

524
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:56.740
You have sat here too long for all the good you do.

525
00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:04.240
What followed in the next five years was a series of constitutional experiments

526
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:10.230
in which Cromwells who now helps supreme power attempted to divest himself of

527
00:31:11.321 --> 00:31:12.154
that power,

528
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:18.420
but at the same time retain the right to intervene when necessary to defend what

529
00:31:19.871 --> 00:31:22.810
he took to be the central cause,

530
00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:28.410
which to him meant above all liberty of conscience and rule by men of godly and

531
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:32.500
honest conversation as he put it.

532
00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:39.420
The trouble was the two few others in the nation shared his aspirations and as

533
00:31:40.091 --> 00:31:43.780
he later remarked to bolstered Whitlock one of his advisors.

534
00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.340
I am as much for government by consent as any man,

535
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.160
but where will I find that consent?

536
00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:58.260
His first attempt was to win consent by establishing a reforming government and

537
00:31:59.410 --> 00:32:04.410
a so called nominated parliament of 140 members was established to promote godly

538
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:06.731
reformed.

539
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:08.590
The members were simply nominated.

540
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:14.750
Chrome well described this as a door to usher in those things that God has

541
00:32:14.771 --> 00:32:15.604
promised.

542
00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.770
He was quite enthusiastic about the idea.

543
00:32:17.771 --> 00:32:19.510
It was the brainchild of one of his officers,

544
00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.190
Major General Thomas Harrison.

545
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:23.741
This parliament,

546
00:32:23.741 --> 00:32:24.840
the nominated parliaments,

547
00:32:24.841 --> 00:32:28.990
sometimes known as bare bones parliament after one of its members sat between

548
00:32:28.991 --> 00:32:31.420
July and December,

549
00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:36.420
1653 and it did indeed begin to consider radical reforms in the law and the

550
00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:39.250
abolition of compulsory tires in the church,

551
00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.830
but even in the parliament of Godly men,

552
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:47.690
such steps occasion too much anxiety for most of the members.

553
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.930
In December,

554
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:54.380
1643 while some of the more radical members were attending a prayer meeting,

555
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.800
more conservative members of the nominated parliament seize the moment are

556
00:32:58.801 --> 00:33:01.940
dissolved themselves and handed the power back to Cromwell.

557
00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:04.860
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

558
00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:05.693
<v 0>Next.</v>

559
00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:10.850
Between 1654 in 1647 57 they attempted government under constitution called the

560
00:33:12.781 --> 00:33:14.160
instrument of government.

561
00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.780
This was based on the heads of the proposals which had been put to the king.

562
00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:23.930
In 1647 Cranwell was head of state with the title of Lord Protector.

563
00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:28.410
Government was to be in the hands of the Lord.

564
00:33:28.411 --> 00:33:30.870
Protector advised by a council of state.

565
00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.630
Parliaments were to be elected every three years,

566
00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:38.960
and the Lord protector was denied the power to delay any legislation for more

567
00:33:39.481 --> 00:33:40.650
than 30 days.

568
00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:44.010
This provided a measure of stability,

569
00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:49.670
but when the first parliament met under the instrument of government in 1654

570
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:53.050
it,

571
00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:58.050
it immediately began to attack both the instrument itself and the religious

572
00:33:58.081 --> 00:33:58.651
toleration,

573
00:33:58.651 --> 00:34:00.540
which was so dear to Cromwell's heart.

574
00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:01.913
Consequently,

575
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:04.080
he dissolved it at the first opportunity.

576
00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:10.790
In 1655 the risk of Arrivalist uprising and the smaller attempted uprising in

577
00:34:11.371 --> 00:34:16.371
the West country led to the experiment of appointing regional military governors

578
00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.870
to govern the country.

579
00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:23.100
Major generals were appointed for a variety of English regions.

580
00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:27.990
They were to oversee government and to promote godly reformation.

581
00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:32.400
This measure was bitterly resented by the county gentry,

582
00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:37.850
and when parliament met again in 1656 they violently attacked it as sword

583
00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:39.533
government.

584
00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:42.780
Cranwell gave way.

585
00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:46.890
Then in February,

586
00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:51.890
1657 parliament presented him with what was called the humble petition and

587
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:53.303
advice,

588
00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:59.180
a call upon him to restore the ancient constitution and to accept the crown.

589
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:09.200
It took three months to think about it and then in May,

590
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.990
1657 rejected the offer of the crab.

591
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:14.550
He used the phrase,

592
00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:17.130
I will not build Jericho again.

593
00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.770
I will not build Jericho again.

594
00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:22.170
But he accepted all the rest,

595
00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:27.810
the protector with a council and try any El parliaments was continued,

596
00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.770
but the ancient constitution was largely to restored,

597
00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.600
including a so called other house,

598
00:35:33.601 --> 00:35:36.960
a kind of House of Lords of nominated members.

599
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:40.130
Well,

600
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:45.130
Cromwells rejection of the crown when it was actually offered to him is perhaps

601
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:47.520
a test of his personal integrity,

602
00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.820
but the truth was that as Lord Protector,

603
00:35:50.821 --> 00:35:52.350
he was king in orbit name.

604
00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:59.060
He was probably sincere in seeing himself as he described himself as a good

605
00:35:59.281 --> 00:36:04.281
constable set to keep the peace of the parish and above all to preserve God's

606
00:36:06.511 --> 00:36:08.460
cause of religious toleration.

607
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:11.070
Domestically,

608
00:36:11.071 --> 00:36:12.780
his rule was relatively mild.

609
00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.050
Roman Catholics were not persecuted.

610
00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.550
He was much preoccupied with healing and settling.

611
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:26.600
He employed many ex royalists if they would accept his government abroad.

612
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:27.840
He was successful.

613
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.950
The protector took part in a brief war against Spain,

614
00:36:31.951 --> 00:36:36.951
which involve the capture of Jamaica and also the distinction of the new model.

615
00:36:37.891 --> 00:36:40.950
Army defeating the Spanish army at the battle of Dunkirk,

616
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:47.660
but it was not government by consent and to many of the political nation well

617
00:36:49.531 --> 00:36:52.800
remained an unforgivable regicide

618
00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:57.450
to some of those who had been his former allies.

619
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:01.770
He appeared to be a hypocritical opportunist.

620
00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:04.073
John Lilburn,

621
00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:06.000
the former leveler set of crumb.

622
00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:06.630
Well,

623
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:11.630
he will weep how and call upon the Lord even while he does smite the under the

624
00:37:12.601 --> 00:37:13.434
first rib

625
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:17.160
to still more people in the country.

626
00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:18.990
He appeared to be the protector,

627
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.690
not have tend to conferences and English liberties,

628
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:26.790
but of wild religious secretaries and fanatics who threatened to turn the world

629
00:37:26.791 --> 00:37:31.791
upside down and bring confusion in society above all the Quakers who in their

630
00:37:31.831 --> 00:37:36.831
early more radical phase cause great alarm as they spread their message across

631
00:37:37.171 --> 00:37:38.004
the kingdom.

632
00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:43.800
And ultimately everyone knew that the entire regime still dependent above all

633
00:37:43.801 --> 00:37:46.890
upon the swords of the new model army and army,

634
00:37:46.891 --> 00:37:49.410
which was increasingly an army of professionals,

635
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:52.500
only Crum,

636
00:37:52.501 --> 00:37:55.410
well himself could hold it all together

637
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.120
by the curious blend of pragmatism and militancy,

638
00:38:00.121 --> 00:38:05.121
which characterized him and by of course the intense devotion which he inspired

639
00:38:06.301 --> 00:38:07.134
in his troops.

640
00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:12.660
And then on the 3rd of September,

641
00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:17.280
1658 aged exactly 59 he suddenly died.

642
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:20.611
Well,

643
00:38:20.611 --> 00:38:23.250
the rest of the story can be swiftly told.

644
00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:26.610
In 1659 following crumb wells death,

645
00:38:26.611 --> 00:38:27.570
it all collapsed.

646
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:33.590
He was succeeded as protector temporarily by his inadequate son Richard

647
00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:33.631
Parliament.

648
00:38:33.631 --> 00:38:35.770
Refuse to recognize Richard's authority.

649
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:38.680
In May,

650
00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.570
1659 under pressure from the generals,

651
00:38:40.571 --> 00:38:45.571
Richard resigned and the rump parliament was recalled in October,

652
00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:51.280
1659 General John Lambert dissatisfied with its proceedings dissolved the rump

653
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.173
again.

654
00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:55.090
There was the threat of chaos in the kingdom.

655
00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:58.000
In December,

656
00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
1659 General George Monk Commander in chief in Scotland decided to intervene.

657
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:06.940
He marched his troops south to restore authority.

658
00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:09.310
That meant first of all,

659
00:39:09.311 --> 00:39:14.311
after he arrived in London restoring the rump and then in February,

660
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:20.190
1660 readmitting admitting to parliament all survivors of the long parliament of

661
00:39:20.231 --> 00:39:23.140
1640 all of them who are still alive,

662
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:25.630
all those who had been expelled for various reasons,

663
00:39:25.690 --> 00:39:28.420
we're permitted to resume their seats

664
00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.270
by now.

665
00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:34.390
Almost everyone expected the restoration of the monarchy.

666
00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.060
In March,

667
00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:42.060
1660 the long parliament voted to dissolve itself at last and to hold free

668
00:39:42.461 --> 00:39:46.180
elections in April,

669
00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:51.180
1660 Charles the second appealed from exile in the Netherlands in an attempt to

670
00:39:51.221 --> 00:39:56.221
allay the anxieties of his former opponents and issue the declaration of Breeder

671
00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:58.780
in which he said that if restored,

672
00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.810
he would promise to respect the liberties of parliament.

673
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.090
He would rule by the law,

674
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:09.900
he would extend a free pardon to all former enemies and he would grant liberty

675
00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:11.650
of conscience.

676
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.310
This seem to allay all anxieties.

677
00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.590
In April,

678
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:22.590
1660 the so called convention parliament met complete with the House of Lords

679
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:27.730
and on the 8th of May Charles the second was recognized as king.

680
00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:31.150
A few weeks later on the 25th of May,

681
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:35.020
he was brought home on a battleship.

682
00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.550
The flagship of the navy,

683
00:40:37.090 --> 00:40:41.890
ironically named the nays be after the battle at which his father had lost the

684
00:40:41.891 --> 00:40:43.120
first civil war.

685
00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:45.910
It was swiftly renamed the royal sovereign,

686
00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:50.770
so the revolution was over.

687
00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.320
It had been defeated,

688
00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.920
or one could say it had defeated itself,

689
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:02.050
but it would never be forgotten and it left a legacy.

690
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:04.030
First of all,

691
00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:08.560
the restored monarchy under Charles the second lived under the shadow of the

692
00:41:08.561 --> 00:41:10.840
events of the 1640s

693
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.590
these could never be forgotten.

694
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:19.950
There were tacit understandings about the acceptable limits of royal authority

695
00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:23.800
and the stewards would do well to remember them.

696
00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:25.953
Secondly,

697
00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:31.120
the politicization of a much larger section of society,

698
00:41:31.570 --> 00:41:36.570
which had been part and parcel the dynamic I was a dramatic events of the 1640s

699
00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.530
and 1650s was not reversed.

700
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:40.483
It remained.

701
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:42.403
Thirdly,

702
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:47.560
the Church of England could never again and compost the sheer diversity of

703
00:41:47.751 --> 00:41:48.980
English Protestantism.

704
00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:51.350
The Church of England was restored,

705
00:41:51.590 --> 00:41:56.590
but religious dissent was an enduring fact throughout the kingdom.

706
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.511
And finally,

707
00:41:59.511 --> 00:42:00.800
there was a fourth legacy.

708
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:05.920
What professor Lawrence Stone described as an immensely rich reservoir of ideas

709
00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:11.300
that were to echo and echo down the ages,

710
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.950
those ideas,

711
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:14.030
political ideas,

712
00:42:14.031 --> 00:42:19.031
religious ideas generated by the events and the dilemmas of the 1640s and the

713
00:42:20.631 --> 00:42:23.000
1650s where in a sense,

714
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:27.920
what really made the English revolution the first of the Great European and

715
00:42:27.921 --> 00:42:29.630
Atlantic revolutions.

716
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:34.810
And of course he will be discussing those ideas in section as John Davenport put

717
00:42:35.091 --> 00:42:35.510
it,

718
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:39.800
observing all this from afar in 1647 at the height of it all,

719
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:45.520
the light which has now discovered in England will never be holy put out.

720
00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:51.700
Though I suspect that contrary opinions will prevail for a time he was right.

721
00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:56.780
Okay.

722
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:57.613
Oliver Cromwells head.

723
00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:59.803
We have time.

724
00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.050
I'm following the restoration.

725
00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:03.620
Uh,

726
00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:05.360
Cromwells body was exhumed.

727
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:06.921
He died of course,

728
00:43:06.921 --> 00:43:07.940
in 1658,

729
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.640
the body had been embalmed and he'd been buried in state.

730
00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:11.750
Um,

731
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:14.300
his body was exhumed along with that if Henry item,

732
00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:15.830
uh,

733
00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:17.170
and they were diverted,

734
00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:22.180
the bodies with Gibby did in public and Cromwells head was struck off.

735
00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:23.420
Um,

736
00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:28.190
it was put on a spike hi on the walls of Westminster Hall.

737
00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:29.900
Uh,

738
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:34.900
where it remained for over 20 years until in a gale in 1684,

739
00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.450
it disappeared.

740
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:40.460
Um,

741
00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:43.400
it's thought that it was probably blown down and one of the guards took it and

742
00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:44.443
sold it.

743
00:43:44.960 --> 00:43:45.770
Um,

744
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:50.770
it's resurfaced in the 18th century in the cabinet of Curiosities of,

745
00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:50.960
uh,

746
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.793
gentlemen.

747
00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:52.371
Uh,

748
00:43:52.371 --> 00:43:53.690
then it vanished again for awhile.

749
00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.260
It resurfaced again at the end of the 18th century when it was put on public

750
00:43:57.261 --> 00:43:59.840
exhibition and people paid to see it.

751
00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:01.070
Um,

752
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:05.660
then later on in the 19th century came into the possession of a scholarly

753
00:44:05.661 --> 00:44:08.450
antiquarian clergymen who looked after it,

754
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:09.260
um,

755
00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:09.720
uh,

756
00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.360
and passed it down in his family.

757
00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:15.230
Eventually in the early 20th century,

758
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:15.770
um,

759
00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:18.740
it was offered to his former college,

760
00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:20.120
Sydney Sussex College,

761
00:44:20.121 --> 00:44:20.954
Cambridge,

762
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:22.303
um,

763
00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:27.350
extensive forensic examination was done of the head to see if it was probably,

764
00:44:27.351 --> 00:44:28.190
if it was genuine.

765
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:29.090
Uh,

766
00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:30.710
well it was a head no doubt about that.

767
00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:36.330
They have is extensively forensically examined and an extensive report was

768
00:44:36.331 --> 00:44:37.150
prepared.

769
00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:37.983
Um,

770
00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:42.720
well they decided that the balance of probability was it wasn't deed Chromo os

771
00:44:42.721 --> 00:44:43.380
head.

772
00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.280
Um,

773
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:46.080
it has a spike through it for stock,

774
00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:47.940
which is one clue.

775
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:49.110
Um,

776
00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:49.561
it's,

777
00:44:49.561 --> 00:44:50.394
um,

778
00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:51.660
uh,

779
00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:52.080
it,

780
00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.190
it had been embalmed.

781
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:54.630
Um,

782
00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.160
there's still scraps of skin and hair.

783
00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:57.413
Um,

784
00:44:57.730 --> 00:44:58.370
the,

785
00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:02.250
there was other forensic evidence consistent with criminal's death mask.

786
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:07.200
A plaster mask had been taking his face after his death and that we've even

787
00:45:07.201 --> 00:45:10.800
pitting on the skull in places where his face was famously disfigured by

788
00:45:10.801 --> 00:45:12.120
prominent awards.

789
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:13.590
Uh,

790
00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.510
so they decided to probably was homeless had,

791
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:18.450
and it was eventually reburied in,

792
00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:19.230
um,

793
00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:22.500
almost 300 years after to be next zoomed in Sydney,

794
00:45:22.501 --> 00:45:23.221
Sussex College,

795
00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:25.350
Cambridge where it's still there.

796
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:30.510
Only the master of Sydney Sussex and the dean of the College Chapel knows

797
00:45:30.511 --> 00:45:31.344
exactly where,

798
00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:32.400
uh,

799
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.810
it's a closely guarded secret.

800
00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:34.883
Um,

801
00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:40.610
I knew someone who was elected master of Sydney Sussex a few years ago and did

802
00:45:40.801 --> 00:45:42.840
suggest that it would be nice to know,

803
00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:44.190
uh,

804
00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:44.570
but,

805
00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:45.110
uh,

806
00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:46.680
it was telling very politely to get lost.

807
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:49.140
So it's a closely guarded secret.

808
00:45:49.141 --> 00:45:49.974
It's still there.

809
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:51.083
Um,

810
00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:55.230
so if you go to Cambridge and visit Sydney Sussex College and go into the chapel

811
00:45:55.231 --> 00:45:56.850
area where it's probably varied,

812
00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.013
um,

813
00:45:58.170 --> 00:45:59.850
you may be walking over Cromwells head.

814
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:01.080
Um,

815
00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:01.740
meanwhile,

816
00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:02.700
in the hall of Sydney,

817
00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:03.420
Sussex,

818
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:04.253
um,

819
00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:05.490
beside the high table,

820
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:08.270
they have a portrait of Commonwealth,

821
00:46:08.810 --> 00:46:09.450
um,

822
00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:10.460
Watson to all,

823
00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:10.980
uh,

824
00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:12.900
he famously told a portrait painter,

825
00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:13.860
uh,

826
00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:15.150
that he didn't want to be prettied up,

827
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:17.130
paint me warts and all he said,

828
00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.331
uh,

829
00:46:18.331 --> 00:46:22.050
and he is there and the portrait has curtains.

830
00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:26.550
And if a member of the royal family happens to visit Sydney Sussex,

831
00:46:26.551 --> 00:46:27.810
which happens from time to time,

832
00:46:28.410 --> 00:46:33.360
they draw the curtains across Cromwells portrayed in order not to cause

833
00:46:33.361 --> 00:46:34.194
embarrassment.

834
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.460
Um,

835
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:40.460
but the rest of the time the curtains are open and he looks down on the students

836
00:46:41.341 --> 00:46:42.510
of his former college,

837
00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:44.243
um,

838
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:46.650
who probably know little of his career.

839
00:46:46.651 --> 00:46:47.060
But,

840
00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:47.640
uh,

841
00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:48.473
there is,

842
00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:53.150
I make of him what you will either a cynical power,

843
00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:53.821
hungry,

844
00:46:53.821 --> 00:46:58.821
hypocritical opportunist or the defender of what people still refer to as the

845
00:46:59.071 --> 00:47:00.120
good old cause.

846
00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.450
Or as one biography described him,

847
00:47:03.451 --> 00:47:04.530
God's Englishman.

848
00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:05.910
But there we are.

849
00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:10.590
So next week we will turn to the restoration regime.
