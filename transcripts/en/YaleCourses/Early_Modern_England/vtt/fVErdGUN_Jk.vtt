1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:01.560
Okay.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:01.801
Well,

3
00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:04.700
this week and next week I'm going to concentrate on settings,

4
00:00:04.701 --> 00:00:05.790
the contexts,

5
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:06.240
um,

6
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.950
introducing you to the contours of a UN unfamiliar society.

7
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.130
And today I'll start with the social order.

8
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.170
How people perceive their social world as a whole in the 16th century.

9
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.871
Okay.

10
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:22.081
Well,

11
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:24.990
500 years ago in the fall of the,

12
00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:25.560
uh,

13
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.790
1,509,

14
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.590
a man named Edmond Dudley lay imprisoned in the tower of London,

15
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.660
the great royal fortress,

16
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.470
which dominated decent parts of London as it still does.

17
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.520
He was there on trumped up charges of treason.

18
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.740
A Dudley was a lawyer.

19
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.720
He had assisted King Henry the seventh in some very unpopular policies.

20
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.030
And in 1,509,

21
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.380
the old king died,

22
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.920
the new King Henry the eighth came to the throne,

23
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.680
h on the 18 and one,

24
00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:02.550
some quick popularity by throwing admin Dudley to the wolves.

25
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.890
But as he lay in prison awaiting execution,

26
00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.120
Dudley made his peace with man and God by writing a book,

27
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.450
which he called the tree of Commonwealth.

28
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.880
It didn't save him and he probably never expected that it would,

29
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.450
but it's survived and it remains a classic statement of 16th century social

30
00:01:26.731 --> 00:01:31.590
values and it can serve to introduce some of the keywords of 16th century

31
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.424
society

32
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.200
in the tree of Commonwealth.

33
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.100
Dudley attempted as a loyal subject to describe what he saw as the ideal

34
00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:48.201
conditions for the prospering of the kingdom under its new King Henry the

35
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:49.044
eighth,

36
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.100
the word that he used it as title Commonwealth was a real key word of 16th

37
00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:57.510
century political discourse.

38
00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.200
It meant the body politic,

39
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.910
the whole of the realm.

40
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.660
It also meant the common good,

41
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.320
the common interests,

42
00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:11.130
the public welfare of society.

43
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.070
In discussing it,

44
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.490
um,

45
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.323
Dudley,

46
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.900
in his book I took the form of an elaborate allegory.

47
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.440
He imagined the Commonwealth as a great tree.

48
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.430
There were four routes of Commonwealth,

49
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.020
love of God,

50
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.213
justice,

51
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.620
trust and Concord.

52
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.540
And there were four fruits of Commonwealth tranquility.

53
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.280
Good example,

54
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.840
worldly prosperity and the honor of God.

55
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.761
Well,

56
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:45.810
the fruits of Commonwealth,

57
00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:50.811
this happy outcome of harmonious Commonwealth involved the reconciling under the

58
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:53.340
guiding hand of the king,

59
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.820
of the interests of all the principles,

60
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.850
social groups,

61
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.420
so that conflict would be avoided and everyone would be welded into a harmonious

62
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.843
Commonwealth.

63
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.260
So in describing the Commonwealth,

64
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.200
Dudley describe the various components,

65
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.310
social groups,

66
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.340
and he divided the subjects of the realm,

67
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:16.160
uh,

68
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.160
in a way that was very conventional into what he called three estates or orders,

69
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.320
three estates,

70
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.980
each of which had its role and each of which had its duties.

71
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.000
First of all came the clergy.

72
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.530
Their role was to pray for the good of the whole,

73
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.490
uh,

74
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.230
to sustain Christian values by their pastoral ministry and to avoid the

75
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:44.710
temptations of worldliness or lusts of the flesh.

76
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.080
All of this was explained.

77
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.740
Then he turned to the second estate,

78
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.480
what he called the chivalry,

79
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.010
chivalry with a late elite ranging in status from Duke's at the top down to mere

80
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.040
nights,

81
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.660
esquires and gentlemen,

82
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.730
all of these people were considered to be of gentle blood.

83
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.800
Their duty was to defend the realm in time of war and to governor justly in time

84
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.660
of peace under the king.

85
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.830
They should avoid the abuse of their power as governors or as landlords.

86
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.350
They should protect and relieve the poor and the weak and serve the king well.

87
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.570
Thirdly,

88
00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.810
there were those that Dudley called the commonalty of the realm,

89
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.920
the commonalty,

90
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.080
and basically that was all the rest,

91
00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.760
the common people from the peasantry of the countryside to the great merchants

92
00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:46.594
of the cities,

93
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.720
all those who are not of gentle blood.

94
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.960
Their duty was to work,

95
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.450
to get in living that was appropriate for their place in society to keep their

96
00:04:58.451 --> 00:05:02.980
families and to support all the rest.

97
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.110
They were advised by Dudley to avoid covetousness or greed,

98
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.710
to avoid idleness and to avoid what he called presumption above the degree.

99
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.290
They should keep their place.

100
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.290
They should also avoid grunting and murmuring against the fact that they were

101
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:28.291
born as he put it to live in labor and pain and for the most part of their time

102
00:05:29.801 --> 00:05:32.080
in the sweat of their face.

103
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.450
This is an excellent advice for students.

104
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.050
I I repeat that.

105
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.020
Avoid grudging and murmuring.

106
00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.460
Accept that you're here to live in labor and pain and the most part of your time

107
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.590
in the sweat of your face.

108
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.630
Okay,

109
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.841
well,

110
00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:57.410
all of this is a perfectly conventional account of the structures and purposes

111
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.140
of the social order in the 16th century.

112
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.850
It's partly descriptive of the major component groups of society.

113
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.400
It's partly obviously prescriptive.

114
00:06:07.401 --> 00:06:12.200
It's prescribing how they should live and in doing so,

115
00:06:12.201 --> 00:06:16.820
it embodies the central ideals of the social morality of the time as it was

116
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:21.821
conceived by people like Dudley harmony duty order.

117
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.281
Now,

118
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:29.600
clearly this idea was communitarian w was very preoccupied with the

119
00:06:29.601 --> 00:06:30.231
Commonwealth.

120
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:33.530
That's an association of interdependent parts,

121
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.263
a community,

122
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.230
but equally clearly it was not egalitarian.

123
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.710
The component groups might be interdependent,

124
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.830
but they were emphatically not equal.

125
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.090
Each group was expected to contribute in its degree as Dudley put it in its

126
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:54.800
degree according to its place,

127
00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.790
and each could share in the benefits of the Commonwealth after it's degree in

128
00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:03.950
accordance with its place.

129
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:06.860
Now by degree,

130
00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.190
he meant of course the different gradations of wealth and status inside each of

131
00:07:12.561 --> 00:07:13.700
the three estates.

132
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.870
That's hierarchical ranking was fundamental to 16th century notions of the

133
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:24.200
social order and people were never allowed to forget it.

134
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.501
Okay,

135
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:32.330
well let's leave Edmund Dudley meditating in his cell in the tower and imagine

136
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:37.331
ourselves instead in one of England's 9,000 parish churches a few decades later.

137
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.820
So Sunday morning,

138
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.060
the bells are tolling to call people to church.

139
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.340
The church wardens,

140
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.910
kind of like the teaching fellows of the 16th century parish.

141
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.370
The church wardens are petroleum.

142
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:55.460
The isles getting people sat in their proper place,

143
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.200
gentry up at the front,

144
00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.090
the lowly at the back,

145
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.350
and they're chasing up the dogs because people brought their dogs to church in

146
00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:06.380
those days and settling everyone down.

147
00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.500
And once a year the grave gray beard administer of the parish would come into

148
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:17.591
the pulpit and read out from the book of homilies.

149
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:22.460
Book of harmonies were official sermons which were published by the Church of

150
00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.180
England and what we read out periodically in the course of the year

151
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:29.563
he began,

152
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.200
thus all mighty God hath created and appointed all things in heaven,

153
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:42.040
earth and waters in a most excellent and perfect order in heaven.

154
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:49.270
He has appointed distinct orders and estates of archangels and angels in Earth.

155
00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.600
He has assigned kings,

156
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.780
princes with governors under them all in good and necessary order.

157
00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.370
Every degree of people in their vocation,

158
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:10.880
their calling and their office have appointed to them their duty and order.

159
00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:15.570
Some are in high degree,

160
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.070
some in low,

161
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.140
some kings and princes,

162
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.170
some inferiors and subjects,

163
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.600
priests and laymen,

164
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.270
masters and servants,

165
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.670
fathers and children,

166
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.400
husbands and wives,

167
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.620
rich and poor

168
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:40.650
and where there is no right order there ane oth all abuse,

169
00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.390
carnal liberty,

170
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.500
enormity,

171
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.770
sin and Babylon.

172
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.920
Nickel confusion.

173
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.100
Well that's the opening paragraph of the homily on obedience.

174
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:58.190
The homily on obedience published for the first time in the 1540s and another

175
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:03.590
niche statement of to the perceptions of the social order and his emphasis on

176
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:07.140
hierarchy and degree audit.

177
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.770
The word echoing through that opening paragraph.

178
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.810
Well put Dudley and the homily on obedience together.

179
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:20.870
And you've got a world which certainly had certain communitarian ideals,

180
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:22.314
the Commonwealth,

181
00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.900
but one in which it was also assumed that those ideals were best served by

182
00:10:27.901 --> 00:10:32.901
maintaining a sort of graduated ladder of authority and subordination within

183
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:36.900
each one of the degrees of society.

184
00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.670
And indeed the three degrees as Dudley described them can be shuffled together

185
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:46.700
into a single rank order of precedence as they were when people went on

186
00:10:47.641 --> 00:10:48.474
processions.

187
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.870
Uh,

188
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:49.703
for example,

189
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:51.450
on the back of your handout,

190
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:56.451
you'll find a chart laying out as one hierarchy.

191
00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.030
That classical social hierarchy,

192
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.430
which you've already read about.

193
00:11:02.431 --> 00:11:02.960
I hope,

194
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.510
uh,

195
00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:06.420
in the chapter set from English society.

196
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:08.460
Okay,

197
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.930
well if you think back to what I've said so far,

198
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:18.480
it's clear that within all of this they were making four kinds of distinctions

199
00:11:18.481 --> 00:11:19.410
between people.

200
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.870
There were distinctions of function,

201
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.970
your role in the Commonwealth,

202
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.660
there were distinctions of rank and have status.

203
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.510
They were distinctions of course in gender.

204
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:33.660
And there were distinctions of age,

205
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:34.883
parents and children.

206
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:39.510
And many of these distinctions tended to overlap.

207
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.530
So I want now to look at them a little more closely,

208
00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:47.220
starting by looking at rank and status,

209
00:11:47.221 --> 00:11:49.830
the hierarchy that they emphasized so much.

210
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.950
And here I'll skip along quite smartly.

211
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.470
You've had a chance to read about this already to some degree,

212
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.110
but I just reinforced some of the main points.

213
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.980
Okay,

214
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:03.101
well,

215
00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:04.600
at the top of the social hierarchy,

216
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:09.490
obviously enough stood the king and his immediate family.

217
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.660
The king was not only the greatest of the English nobility,

218
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:18.010
which he was and the greatest single landowner in the kingdom,

219
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:19.480
which he also was,

220
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.420
but he was also something special.

221
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.500
The king was the anointed of God as they put it,

222
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.840
ritually anointed with sacred oil at the time of the coronation,

223
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:37.590
the fount of all secular authority in the realm but also considered to be ruling

224
00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.980
by the special grace of God.

225
00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:50.530
Beneath the crown came Dudley chivalry and that was itself internally

226
00:12:51.201 --> 00:12:55.700
differentiated into on the one hand and your hand out will help with this.

227
00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:56.691
On the one hand,

228
00:12:56.691 --> 00:12:59.360
the peerage and on the other hand,

229
00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.253
the Gentry,

230
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.210
the peerage where the greater nobility,

231
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:11.280
they were the nobles who are distinguished by having inheritable titles which

232
00:13:11.281 --> 00:13:13.410
could be passed on to their sons.

233
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:14.970
Duke's Oh,

234
00:13:14.971 --> 00:13:16.440
those mock courses,

235
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:17.523
icons,

236
00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.710
Barron's lords.

237
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.400
They also had a favorable position before the law.

238
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:26.190
They could only be tried by their peers,

239
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:27.750
usually in the House of Lords.

240
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.070
When parliament sat,

241
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:34.940
they had the right to sit in parliament by virtue of their birth and social

242
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.623
position.

243
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.350
Alongside those great lane nobles,

244
00:13:41.351 --> 00:13:44.020
one can also place some of the great churchmen,

245
00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.213
the bishops,

246
00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.500
the abbots of great monasteries.

247
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:52.570
They also sat in parliament in the House of Lords because they were the lords of

248
00:13:52.571 --> 00:13:53.410
the church.

249
00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.270
But an important distinction of course was that their positions were not

250
00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:59.493
inheritable.

251
00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.580
They were appointed and the early 16th century appointed by the pope,

252
00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.720
though usually on the advice and recommendation of the king,

253
00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.350
so we've looked at the peerage,

254
00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.460
the greater nobility.

255
00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:15.250
Then there was the lesson ability,

256
00:14:15.251 --> 00:14:18.310
which contemporaries referred to usually as the gentry.

257
00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:26.390
They were themselves internally differentiated into nights.

258
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:31.970
Esquires and Mir gentleman nights

259
00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.020
were created by the monarch for service,

260
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:41.560
for service in war usually or in government as indeed they still are high

261
00:14:42.021 --> 00:14:45.650
ranking civil servants in Britain and military officers very often get a

262
00:14:45.651 --> 00:14:48.560
knighthood at the end of their active careers.

263
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.630
Though the notion of service has broadened somewhat nowadays to include other

264
00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:55.130
roles in society.

265
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:58.190
So we have a Syrian Mckellen,

266
00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:58.730
uh,

267
00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.930
also known as Gandalf.

268
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:01.220
Um,

269
00:15:01.220 --> 00:15:03.500
we have support and Mccartney of course,

270
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.410
and we even have a sub Mick Jagger,

271
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.960
which proves that he was just a nice boy really all along.

272
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.023
Um,

273
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:16.303
so the,

274
00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.390
the apartment of nights,

275
00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:21.770
the dubbing of nights by the Mana continues of course in the 16th century,

276
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:26.270
they were usually selected to be made nights for amongst the leading families of

277
00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:29.240
each of the 40 counties of the kingdom.

278
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:31.790
And the title could not be inherited.

279
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:36.820
You had to be made at night again in each new generation below them where the

280
00:15:37.491 --> 00:15:41.870
lesser gentry of Esquires and Meir Gentlemen,

281
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.050
they had no title except the right to be called Mister.

282
00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:50.620
Only a gentlemen could be called Mr. And they had the right also to bear a coat

283
00:15:51.861 --> 00:15:52.694
of arms.

284
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.380
Collectively the nobility,

285
00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:02.650
both the peerage and the church leaders and the gentry were the principal

286
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.800
landowners of England and Wales,

287
00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:06.320
uh,

288
00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.690
in the county of North Yorkshire,

289
00:16:08.691 --> 00:16:09.190
for example.

290
00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:10.610
It's up here in the north of England.

291
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.590
In the early 16th century,

292
00:16:12.591 --> 00:16:13.820
a study has been done,

293
00:16:13.821 --> 00:16:15.890
which shows that the nobility,

294
00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:16.521
the peerage,

295
00:16:16.521 --> 00:16:18.650
owned 27% of the land.

296
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:24.110
The gentry owned 46% and nearly all of the rest belong to the church.

297
00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.490
Land was not only a source of income,

298
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:29.300
the rent,

299
00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.220
which were paid to the great landowners,

300
00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:35.840
but it was also a source of power over tenants.

301
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.400
It was a source of Lordship as they put it in this period.

302
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.140
Lordship over men,

303
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.450
some gentlemen that owned only a single smaller state.

304
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.370
Some had many,

305
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:51.500
and by the time you get to the peerage,

306
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.690
some of them had vast territories.

307
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:54.980
The Earl of Shrosbree,

308
00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:59.840
whom land counter again at various times owned a great deal of land in the

309
00:16:59.841 --> 00:17:02.030
center of England and the counties of Nottingham.

310
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.910
Sure Darbyshire and Shropshire.

311
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.280
And he was described at the time as being like a prince in four counties in the

312
00:17:10.281 --> 00:17:11.031
heart of England.

313
00:17:11.031 --> 00:17:14.510
He was the biggest landowner by far in that whole region.

314
00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:17.570
So in any one county,

315
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:23.260
those who possess the land constituted it's natural governing class,

316
00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.920
and some of them had been in that position for generations,

317
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.690
but whatever pride they took in their rank and their ancestry,

318
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:37.580
they knew very well that it was based ultimately upon the land that they

319
00:17:37.581 --> 00:17:39.650
possessed upon their land at wealth.

320
00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:41.210
One gentleman said,

321
00:17:41.211 --> 00:17:44.480
John Logar advised his sons as follows,

322
00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:46.460
without wealth,

323
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:51.300
the support and upholder of gentry and worldly reputation,

324
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:57.080
then nobility and gentility is but vain and contemptible title in England and

325
00:17:58.801 --> 00:18:03.801
always has been preserve your estate if you will preserve your gentility and

326
00:18:05.131 --> 00:18:06.600
nobility of blood,

327
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.860
which is nothing else but a descent of riches.

328
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.050
Got a frank recognition of the realities of the social structure.

329
00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.211
Okay,

330
00:18:18.211 --> 00:18:21.330
so no woman and gentlemen possessed most landed property,

331
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.780
but of course they were only a tiny proportion of the population.

332
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.790
Probably something like 2%.

333
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:31.980
The other 98% where the commonalty and of these,

334
00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:33.660
the majority lived in the countryside,

335
00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.440
England in the 1520s,

336
00:18:37.441 --> 00:18:41.580
the earliest period for which we can make really good population estimates had

337
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:46.581
about 2.4 million people and not more than 10% of them lived in towns.

338
00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.373
Indeed,

339
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:49.650
uh,

340
00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:53.910
only 5% of them lived in towns that were bigger than 5,000 inhabitants.

341
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.390
5,000 inhabitants was considered a good big town.

342
00:18:57.780 --> 00:18:58.860
In the 16th Century,

343
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.540
uh,

344
00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:04.890
Wales had a population of only about a quarter of a million and even fewer lived

345
00:19:04.891 --> 00:19:05.431
in towns.

346
00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:06.630
It's a mountainous region,

347
00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:10.110
very few urban settlements except around the coast.

348
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.970
So we're dealing with an overwhelmingly rural society.

349
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.800
But the commonality we're far from being just an undifferentiated massive

350
00:19:19.801 --> 00:19:24.801
peasants in rural society beneath the landowning gentleman who drew their income

351
00:19:25.471 --> 00:19:26.310
from rents,

352
00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.290
people will normally divided into four subordinate groups.

353
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.633
There were Yeoman,

354
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:34.320
there were husbandman,

355
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.420
they were craftsmen and tradesmen,

356
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.300
and there were cottages and laborers.

357
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.830
You'll find definitions of these different groups on your handout.

358
00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:49.160
Yoh men are sometimes defined as being owner occupiers who possessed freehold

359
00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:50.483
land.

360
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.690
And there's sometimes where,

361
00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:54.510
but in fact most of them were tenant farmers.

362
00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:58.890
The crucial thing about Yeoman is that they were substantial tenant farmers.

363
00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.230
People who employ labor,

364
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.660
people who could produce them,

365
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.650
a substantial marketable surplus which they could sell to the towns.

366
00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:13.620
These were the people who were sometimes described as the better sort of people

367
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:16.800
in their villages or the teeth inhabitants

368
00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:24.180
beneath them where husbandman small family farmers generally with holdings of

369
00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:31.491
under 30 acres or so enough to support their families and to produce a modest

370
00:20:32.131 --> 00:20:33.330
surplus to sell,

371
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.660
but relying for the most part on their direct family labor.

372
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.130
Then there were village craftsmen and tradesmen.

373
00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:47.030
Some of them might be people of Substance Millers and blacksmiths.

374
00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.490
We're able to make a good living.

375
00:20:48.491 --> 00:20:49.324
For example,

376
00:20:49.330 --> 00:20:52.150
others were usually poor tailors or ale.

377
00:20:52.151 --> 00:20:55.810
Housekeepers who brewed ale were generally relatively poor.

378
00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:01.470
Most craftsmen felt somewhere between the two and most of them also farmed as

379
00:21:01.991 --> 00:21:05.020
well as performing the duties of their craft.

380
00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.100
And finally there were the cottages and laborers.

381
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:14.800
They sometimes held a few acres of land which they rented from a local landlord

382
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.620
or from a local farmer.

383
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:21.370
Some of them might have a trade from time to time,

384
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.410
but most of them relied upon wages for at least a significant part of their

385
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:31.411
income working as farm laborers on the holdings of bigger tenants.

386
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:34.120
Well,

387
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:35.890
one can generalize in that kind of way,

388
00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:39.010
but the proportions of the rural population that fell into these different

389
00:21:39.011 --> 00:21:42.250
groups varied enormously from place to place.

390
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.520
What you can say in general is that rural society was highly differentiated.

391
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.280
A large minority of big yeoman farmers,

392
00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:56.170
a broad middle band of people who could get a secure living as a craftsman or as

393
00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.050
husbandman and another large minority,

394
00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:04.140
probably about a quarter in the early 16th century who put together a rather

395
00:22:04.181 --> 00:22:08.650
bare hand to mouth to mouth living as cottages and laborers,

396
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:14.770
but most people still had access to the land one way or another.

397
00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:20.230
Even cottages and laborers generally had a small holding and they would have the

398
00:22:20.231 --> 00:22:25.231
right to graze their animals on the Commons of their village rights of pasture

399
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:32.010
complete dependence upon wage labor was still exceptional in the countryside and

400
00:22:33.221 --> 00:22:36.640
I emphasize that because that's something that was going to change as we will

401
00:22:36.641 --> 00:22:38.950
see in the course of the 16th century.

402
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:43.370
What about the towns then

403
00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:45.591
towns,

404
00:22:45.591 --> 00:22:45.831
people?

405
00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:46.401
As I've said,

406
00:22:46.401 --> 00:22:47.660
we're very much a minority,

407
00:22:47.661 --> 00:22:49.700
but there were a very significant minority.

408
00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:55.900
The town's ranged from tiny market towns which came alive on market day two what

409
00:22:55.971 --> 00:23:00.230
were considered the great cities with populations of above 5,000

410
00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:04.580
and the one truly significant city,

411
00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:09.700
the city of London down here in the southeast with the population in the early

412
00:23:09.831 --> 00:23:10.880
16th century,

413
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:16.390
which had already reached about 55,000 so London was a significant city by the

414
00:23:17.061 --> 00:23:18.170
standards of the day.

415
00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.050
I look at the distribution of towns in another lecture,

416
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:29.080
but the thing to stress today is that even small towns had a much more very

417
00:23:29.841 --> 00:23:32.750
gated occupational and social structure.

418
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:34.430
Then did country villages,

419
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.550
they contain merchants,

420
00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.350
they contained manufacturers.

421
00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:44.351
They contained the small number of highly prestigious professional people,

422
00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:45.973
lawyers,

423
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.120
physicians.

424
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:50.810
They contain more clergy than country villages,

425
00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:55.130
and they contained also large numbers of unskilled laborers.

426
00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.100
So much for the range of occupations.

427
00:23:58.101 --> 00:23:59.090
But within that range,

428
00:23:59.091 --> 00:24:03.470
they were considerable differentials of wealth and status at the top.

429
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:09.160
The great merchants of the cities could be men of prodigious wealth who were

430
00:24:09.391 --> 00:24:11.570
generally also the rulers of their towns.

431
00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.670
To give you just one example,

432
00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:14.141
uh,

433
00:24:14.141 --> 00:24:16.340
a man named Robert Janice,

434
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:17.900
spelled j,

435
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:18.350
a.

436
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.920
N.

437
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:18.950
N,

438
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:19.251
y.

439
00:24:19.251 --> 00:24:20.084
S,

440
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:21.251
he was a,

441
00:24:21.251 --> 00:24:26.120
a grocer and he was the mayor of the city of knowledge here in east Anglian

442
00:24:26.121 --> 00:24:28.550
region in the early 16th century.

443
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:29.571
In 15,

444
00:24:29.571 --> 00:24:34.571
23 attacks was levied a for which the return survive.

445
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:39.910
And so we know that Robert Genesis personal tax return was bigger than the

446
00:24:40.131 --> 00:24:41.630
entire city of Rochester,

447
00:24:41.631 --> 00:24:44.150
which was the biggest city down here in Kent.

448
00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:49.790
He was a plutocrat and there were men of such prodigious wealth in all of

449
00:24:49.791 --> 00:24:51.590
England's major cities,

450
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:57.940
but it's the urban elites where the average master craftsman of the towns,

451
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:03.710
those who provided

452
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.170
clothing,

453
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:07.610
leather goods,

454
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.150
metal wares and so forth from their own workshops.

455
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:15.140
The principle of distinction amongst these people was between those who were

456
00:25:15.141 --> 00:25:19.190
independent mastercraftsman with their own workshop and those who are known as

457
00:25:19.191 --> 00:25:20.024
journeymen,

458
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:23.120
people who work for wages by the day,

459
00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.050
skilled workers serving as employees of the master craftsman

460
00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.510
among the master craftsman.

461
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:35.700
Most of them worked entirely on their own account producing and retailing their

462
00:25:35.701 --> 00:25:36.534
goods,

463
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:42.230
but there were also those in some cities who had become virtually employees of

464
00:25:42.301 --> 00:25:46.350
large scale merchant capitalists who gave them raw materials to work on,

465
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.950
collected the finished products and marketed the goods.

466
00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:52.290
This was known as the putting out system.

467
00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:57.300
You put out work to skilled workers and you collect the goods and market them,

468
00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.560
and I mentioned it specifically because it was the form of organization in

469
00:26:01.561 --> 00:26:04.590
England's most important single industry,

470
00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:05.940
the cloth industry,

471
00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.400
the manufacturer of woolen cloth,

472
00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:13.830
most of which was exported to Europe and which was very prominent in certain

473
00:26:13.831 --> 00:26:14.664
regions.

474
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.440
Norritch was a great cloth city,

475
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.990
so were many of the other towns of East Anglia,

476
00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.720
southern England and parts of the West country.

477
00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:27.053
<v 1>Okay.</v>

478
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:31.810
<v 0>We've looked at at some of the major distinctions of wealth and status,</v>

479
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.340
rank and degree.

480
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:38.680
Let's turn to two other categories that contemporaries tended to stress gender

481
00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.360
and age

482
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.201
for the most part.

483
00:26:46.201 --> 00:26:50.220
So far in talking about wealth and status and rank,

484
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.490
I've been talking about adult men

485
00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:59.250
and to do that is an accurate reflection of the attitudes of the time,

486
00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:04.800
the attitudes which they held towards the position of women and of the young

487
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:11.690
women and young people took their place in the social order from either their

488
00:27:11.821 --> 00:27:16.380
husbands or their fathers or their masters.

489
00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.810
And to that extent it's been said,

490
00:27:18.811 --> 00:27:21.390
their social identities were subsumed,

491
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:26.510
absorbed into the social identities of the adult male heads of the households

492
00:27:29.011 --> 00:27:30.510
within which they lived.

493
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.830
When people talked about the social order as a whole,

494
00:27:34.831 --> 00:27:37.260
women and children became almost invisible.

495
00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:42.510
They were just subsumed into the identities of adult male householders.

496
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.113
Nevertheless,

497
00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:48.930
contemporary moralists did have very clear views about the place of women and

498
00:27:48.931 --> 00:27:53.931
children and the young in general and in both cases that place was a subordinate

499
00:27:55.771 --> 00:27:56.604
one.

500
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:03.800
Now of course women and some of the young word distinguished by social rank just

501
00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:06.690
as adult men were.

502
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:12.680
Some women in particular might hold positions of great status and power by

503
00:28:14.071 --> 00:28:19.071
virtue of their birth and their inheritance and we'll meet quite a few of them

504
00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.650
in the course of the 16th century.

505
00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:24.031
But nonetheless,

506
00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:26.760
although women were obviously distinguished by their rank,

507
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:31.050
they were also collectively distinguished by gender.

508
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:36.830
The social roles deemed proper for the different sexes and such.

509
00:28:37.531 --> 00:28:41.040
Distinctions were also fundamental to the structure of the social order as the

510
00:28:41.041 --> 00:28:42.810
homily on obedience makes clear

511
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:45.571
in general,

512
00:28:45.571 --> 00:28:50.571
women's place was seen as that of being dutiful adjunct to men as daughters,

513
00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:52.411
as wives,

514
00:28:52.411 --> 00:28:54.870
as mothers or as sisters.

515
00:28:55.590 --> 00:29:00.590
They had little recognized role outside the household and few opportunities to

516
00:29:01.381 --> 00:29:04.260
pursue an independent career.

517
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.750
At least in theory it was so

518
00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.820
that's subordination was justified by the authority of scripture.

519
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:17.870
Saint Paul was constantly quoted on that point and it was also justified in

520
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:19.830
English law,

521
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:21.900
especially the law of property.

522
00:29:23.790 --> 00:29:28.590
According to English common law property was vested in Male household heads.

523
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:35.040
An unmarried woman who was described in law it using the Norman French that they

524
00:29:35.041 --> 00:29:38.730
used in the law courts who was described in law as a thin sole.

525
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.890
You'll find the term on your handout.

526
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.700
And unmarried woman could hold property,

527
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:47.050
she could make a contract,

528
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.590
she could engage independently in economic life.

529
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:57.240
But a married woman was subject to the legal doctrine of cover tour.

530
00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:00.220
She was described in the law as a femme covert

531
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.100
and her rights was seriously curtailed by cover tour.

532
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:07.263
She could hold,

533
00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:08.050
um,

534
00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:12.370
no goods independently in marriage unless a separate trust had been erected for

535
00:30:12.371 --> 00:30:13.204
her.

536
00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:14.740
There was no community of goods.

537
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:19.840
Her husband got a life interest in any lands which he brought to the marriage.

538
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.140
All of the movable goods of the family were his

539
00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:27.940
and her rights were limited to her dollar.

540
00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.780
That was usually a third of the land and goods of the family,

541
00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.960
which was reserved when her husband died to keep her in her widowhood and would

542
00:30:37.601 --> 00:30:41.710
eventually revert to the main air of the family.

543
00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:47.110
So that was the law as regards women and in particular their property rights.

544
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:52.540
And all of this was bolstered by widespread assumptions about the allegedly

545
00:30:52.541 --> 00:30:54.730
inferior capacities of women,

546
00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.660
not only in terms of physical strength but also in terms of at an allegedly

547
00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:07.260
weakness of intellectual capacity and emotional stability.

548
00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:13.090
The piece on the longer reading list by Crawford and Mendelssohn on women in

549
00:31:13.091 --> 00:31:18.091
early modern England has an excellent lucid discussion of these issues in its

550
00:31:18.101 --> 00:31:19.060
opening tractor,

551
00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:22.120
especially the medical attitudes towards women at the time.

552
00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:24.250
So as a result,

553
00:31:24.251 --> 00:31:27.640
any failings which were observable in women were attributed not to,

554
00:31:27.641 --> 00:31:30.670
they're on equal opportunities or they're restricted education,

555
00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.780
but supposedly they're natural weaknesses.

556
00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:39.820
And the fact that many men also shared these weaknesses was conveniently

557
00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:40.773
overlooked.

558
00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:43.301
Well,

559
00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:48.301
the official view of the church on all of this was again read out every year in

560
00:31:48.971 --> 00:31:49.960
another homily,

561
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:52.690
the homily on marriage,

562
00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:58.890
the homily on marriage declared that and quoting the woman is a weak creature,

563
00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:04.600
not endowed with the like strength and cost,

564
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:07.060
constancy of mind as men.

565
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:12.990
Therefore they be the sooner disquieted and they'd be the more prone to week

566
00:32:13.931 --> 00:32:18.931
affections and dispositions of the mind more than men B and the homilist went on

567
00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:20.351
that.

568
00:32:20.351 --> 00:32:21.184
Therefore,

569
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:26.520
a woman must be spared and born with the rather in that she is the weaker

570
00:32:26.771 --> 00:32:27.604
vessel,

571
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.080
the weaker vessel.

572
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:32.050
A phrase from the homily on marriage,

573
00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:33.670
which was often repeated,

574
00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:39.470
the same homily went on to advise that men and women should live in perpetual

575
00:32:39.471 --> 00:32:40.304
friendship.

576
00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:46.540
But it was one based of course upon the assumption of female acceptance of male

577
00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:48.613
authority.

578
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.880
One of the great preachers of the late 16th century,

579
00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:53.990
William Perkins,

580
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:58.280
a great puritan preacher who preached in the city of Cambridge,

581
00:32:59.030 --> 00:32:59.863
uh,

582
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:01.190
set as follows,

583
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:03.830
concerning husbands and wives.

584
00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:09.220
The good man or the master of the family is a person in whom restaurant,

585
00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:13.880
the private and proper government of the whole household.

586
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:19.600
And he comes to it not by election but by the ordinance of God settled even in

587
00:33:23.421 --> 00:33:24.800
the course of nature.

588
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.170
And he continued.

589
00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:32.380
The good wife of the house is a person which yielded help and assistance in

590
00:33:33.951 --> 00:33:38.120
government to the master of the family for he is,

591
00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:39.200
as it were,

592
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.900
the prince and tiff ruler.

593
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.920
And she is his associate.

594
00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:48.381
Well,

595
00:33:48.381 --> 00:33:52.460
how far these prescriptions were actually observed in practice.

596
00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:53.510
Um,

597
00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:55.340
we'll see in the next lecture.

598
00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:56.180
Uh,

599
00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.490
and also if you wish to work on it.

600
00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:01.040
There's an abundant literature on that issue,

601
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:04.010
but these were the prescriptive values of the time.

602
00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:05.961
Now,

603
00:34:05.961 --> 00:34:06.794
of course,

604
00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:07.640
women,

605
00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:12.640
whatever their formal subordination to their husbands and their fathers did of

606
00:34:12.981 --> 00:34:17.981
course bear some authority in the Commonwealth alongside their husbands.

607
00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:23.650
They bought authority over their children and over the servants and apprentices,

608
00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:28.310
the young people who lived within their households.

609
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:30.861
Seventh,

610
00:34:30.861 --> 00:34:31.820
we're generally young,

611
00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:37.600
genuinely age between about 14 and the mid twenties they were generally hired on

612
00:34:37.851 --> 00:34:41.570
annual contracts and they lived in the households of their masters and

613
00:34:41.571 --> 00:34:44.810
mistresses and in return for their labor,

614
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:49.820
they were fed and clothed and give him lodging and a small wage,

615
00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:52.370
which was very often paid only once a year.

616
00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.460
Some seven stayed with particular households for years and might form quite a

617
00:34:58.461 --> 00:35:01.640
close bond with their masters and mistresses,

618
00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:04.430
but most moved on at the end of each year.

619
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:09.320
They would go to the hiring fair and be hired into a new household moving around

620
00:35:09.321 --> 00:35:14.321
an area from village to village until they would eventually settle down and

621
00:35:14.661 --> 00:35:17.600
marry in their mid to late twenties

622
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.540
in the towns,

623
00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:25.340
the duties of sevens were largely domestic and servants were mostly women

624
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:31.210
leading some towns to have an unbalanced sex ratio in favor of women in the

625
00:35:31.251 --> 00:35:31.911
countryside.

626
00:35:31.911 --> 00:35:35.330
Both male and female servants worked on the farm,

627
00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.000
engage in domestic tasks or in agricultural tasks.

628
00:35:39.001 --> 00:35:42.990
They were known as servants in husbandry because they engaged in husbandry,

629
00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.670
agricultural work,

630
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:49.530
but whatever the case servants were,

631
00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:53.640
a very large and a very distinctive part of society,

632
00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:58.620
a distinctive part of the labor force in particular in 16th century England,

633
00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:04.820
it's been estimated that perhaps a quarter of the entire population lived in

634
00:36:05.371 --> 00:36:08.040
other people's households as servants,

635
00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:14.330
and it's been estimated that 60% of the population aged between 15 and 24 we're

636
00:36:16.321 --> 00:36:18.990
living as servants at any one time.

637
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:23.820
So it was a distinctive element of the population and the distinctive phase of

638
00:36:23.821 --> 00:36:24.840
the lifecycle.

639
00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:26.850
For most young people

640
00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.990
while they were living through that stage,

641
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:36.860
they lived under the authority of a master and the mistress in a household which

642
00:36:37.291 --> 00:36:41.100
perhaps did a great deal to shape their social expectations,

643
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:45.060
particularly their expectations regarding authority.

644
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.520
Part of their socialization.

645
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:55.310
Apprentices were predominantly urban and they were usually male

646
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.230
young men in their late teens and early twenties.

647
00:37:01.231 --> 00:37:02.064
For the most part,

648
00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:07.460
one tends to think of apprentices as little boys sent out to learn a craft at

649
00:37:08.011 --> 00:37:09.510
the age of seven or 10.

650
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:10.050
Um,

651
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:10.561
in fact,

652
00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:12.180
they were more like modern students.

653
00:37:12.181 --> 00:37:17.010
They were generally in their late teens and early twenties and they had been

654
00:37:17.011 --> 00:37:22.011
bound by an indenture illegal indenture to a master to learn a trade over a

655
00:37:23.311 --> 00:37:24.360
period of years.

656
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.600
Usually apprentices were migrants to the towns.

657
00:37:27.601 --> 00:37:29.700
They'd come in to learn a trade.

658
00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:34.860
We're bound lived in with their masters and like servants.

659
00:37:34.861 --> 00:37:36.420
They were very numerous.

660
00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:41.970
It's been estimated that in 1550 about 10% of the population of London were

661
00:37:41.971 --> 00:37:42.804
apprentices.

662
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:48.780
They differed from servants in that they tended to stay with their master for

663
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.490
the whole period of their training,

664
00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:54.240
which was usually a period of seven years.

665
00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:59.310
They enjoyed a superior status because they had superior prospects in life.

666
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:05.610
One day they would be skilled journeymen and then perhaps mastercraftsman

667
00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.180
themselves and they were aware of this distinction,

668
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:15.180
but in the meantime they too lived very much under the authority of their

669
00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:16.014
masters.

670
00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:24.560
So most of the young then lived in positions of subordination and they had

671
00:38:26.461 --> 00:38:31.461
social identities which were merged with those of the adult householders under

672
00:38:32.371 --> 00:38:34.230
whose authority they lived.

673
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.050
Um,

674
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:37.450
to give you one example of this,

675
00:38:37.451 --> 00:38:38.530
I recently encountered,

676
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:42.650
I was looking at the deaths recorded in Paris,

677
00:38:42.651 --> 00:38:47.651
registers a in a play gear in the early 17th century and it was striking that

678
00:38:49.241 --> 00:38:52.300
servants were not recorded under their own names.

679
00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.330
When servants had died of the plague and were buried,

680
00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:00.600
they will put down in the parish register as Robert Foster's made or a man of

681
00:39:02.111 --> 00:39:04.000
John Atkinson or terms like this,

682
00:39:04.001 --> 00:39:06.430
the actual name of the servant not mentioned,

683
00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:07.600
they just anonymous.

684
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.290
They're attributed to their master or the mistress.

685
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:12.693
When they were buried.

686
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:17.050
It's just a striking example of that kind of social,

687
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.890
um,

688
00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:22.120
submergence within the identities of their superiors

689
00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:27.970
and outside the household to the prevailing ideal of the age was what's been

690
00:39:27.971 --> 00:39:29.800
called Geron Tow cratic.

691
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:33.280
That is to say the old should rule,

692
00:39:33.700 --> 00:39:37.090
the young should serve and show respect.

693
00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:41.740
The more or less of the time when they wrote about youth conventionally saw it

694
00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:46.770
as a time of hope but also of danger.

695
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:52.540
The young were conventionally portrayed as being unusually subject to fits of

696
00:39:52.541 --> 00:39:54.910
passion to rashness,

697
00:39:55.210 --> 00:39:56.590
to volatility,

698
00:39:56.950 --> 00:40:01.210
to intemperance and to sexual lasciviousness.

699
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:02.200
Um,

700
00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.970
where they got this idea from one condo.

701
00:40:03.971 --> 00:40:04.804
Imagine,

702
00:40:05.350 --> 00:40:06.183
um,

703
00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:11.310
wisdom and self control were regarded as coming only with age.

704
00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:16.540
And accordingly there was a preference for agents seniority in all institutional

705
00:40:16.541 --> 00:40:17.374
life.

706
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:18.783
Well,

707
00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:20.231
one could say,

708
00:40:20.231 --> 00:40:22.360
well that's just the same today,

709
00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:27.490
but one important difference is that in the 16th and 17th centuries are far

710
00:40:27.850 --> 00:40:30.580
larger proportion of the population were young.

711
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:36.150
The high birth rates of the time and the low life expectancy meant that the

712
00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:39.340
population was far younger than is the case today.

713
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:44.640
Far fewer people lived through to their 50s and even fewer to their sixties when

714
00:40:45.761 --> 00:40:48.160
they enjoyed these positions of authority.

715
00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:56.070
So then the young lived also in a situation of subordination to adulthood came

716
00:40:57.551 --> 00:41:02.551
only when they eventually married and achieved economic independence and had

717
00:41:02.981 --> 00:41:05.170
households or workshops of their own.

718
00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:10.180
Then young men were transformed into masters of families.

719
00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:15.450
Young women were transformed into mistresses of families and their place in the

720
00:41:15.521 --> 00:41:19.990
social order shifted upwards accordingly from that point on,

721
00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:25.410
differences in their rank where paramount for men in the public domain of

722
00:41:25.991 --> 00:41:28.370
society at large that within the house.

723
00:41:28.371 --> 00:41:29.470
So differences of gender,

724
00:41:29.471 --> 00:41:31.330
of course still held their place.

725
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.450
So to sum up,

726
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:41.560
this was a very highly structured and stratified society.

727
00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:46.940
It was in egalitarian in its social ideals.

728
00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:52.220
It was conceived of as a Commonwealth as an organic whole,

729
00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:57.650
but one constituted of people whose opportunities and experiences we're very far

730
00:41:57.651 --> 00:41:59.690
from uniform or equal.

731
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:05.710
And that structured in a quality was taken to be part of the natural order of

732
00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.733
society.

733
00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:07.573
Indeed,

734
00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:11.360
it was taken to be ordained by God as we've seen.

735
00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.640
It was a predominantly rural society in which most people gain their livings

736
00:42:16.641 --> 00:42:17.474
from the land,

737
00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:19.850
but in which a large minority,

738
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.270
we're also engaged in manufacturers and in trade.

739
00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.610
It was a world in which most people still aspire to gain their living relatively

740
00:42:28.611 --> 00:42:32.420
independently on the land or by practicing a trade,

741
00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:37.280
but in which a large minority already dependent on selling their labor and

742
00:42:37.281 --> 00:42:38.570
skills to others.

743
00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:41.750
Throughout the whole structure,

744
00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:45.410
the household was the principal place,

745
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:46.820
not only of residents,

746
00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:49.460
but of economic production,

747
00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:55.120
and it was the most immediate unit of authority under its master and mistress.

748
00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:59.690
It's been said that to a very large extent,

749
00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:04.990
social organization in this period was domestic organization focused on the

750
00:43:05.991 --> 00:43:06.824
household,

751
00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:11.750
be it the humble household or the great household of the aristocracy,

752
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.450
or indeed of the Monique himself.

753
00:43:15.590 --> 00:43:20.450
So next time I'll take a closer look at how those thousands of households

754
00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:23.570
functioned on the roles of men,

755
00:43:23.571 --> 00:43:23.901
women,

756
00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:25.490
and children within them,

757
00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.910
on their priorities and strategies,

758
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:30.710
their basic values,

759
00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:32.030
how they were formed,

760
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:35.180
and how so far as we can tell they lived.
