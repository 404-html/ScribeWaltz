WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:02.580
So the last three weeks,

2
00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:06.330
then we've been going through some of the major developments in terms of

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:11.331
political and religious change in the course of the 16th century.

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.060
And for the next three weeks we'll be looking at other aspects of,

5
00:00:17.191 --> 00:00:19.270
of what was going on,
uh,

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.320
in the reign of Elizabeth and under the early Stuart's dealing with a number of

7
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:28.920
themes that run across from about 1562,
1640,

8
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.650
and then we'll returned to the political narrative.

9
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.280
So I'm going to look at things like witchcraft and crime and popular protest and

10
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.390
education and the growth of literacy.
Um,
but first of all,
this week,

11
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:46.680
in order to understand all of these developments and create the context of

12
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:47.514
change,

13
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.020
we need to know what was going on in economy and society,

14
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.390
both of which were changing in their structure,

15
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:59.130
quite significant in these two generations at the turn of the 16th and 17th

16
00:00:59.131 --> 00:00:59.964
centuries.

17
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.830
And today I'll focus on the economic developments.
Um,

18
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.350
so a bit of economic history,

19
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.940
economic history is rarely immensely popular.
Um,

20
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.380
but it does matter.
Uh,
it's absolutely basic.

21
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.130
Um,
it's perhaps an unfamiliar kind of history.

22
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:22.770
It's mostly done in economics departments.
Um,

23
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.750
but what I've tried to do basically is to give you a clear overview of what we

24
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:32.370
know about what seems to have been happening in this period and your handout.

25
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:35.340
We'll provide you with some statistics,
uh,

26
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.370
to chart the overall developments and illustrate some of the details.

27
00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.900
Okay.
So by the 1560s already,

28
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.883
as you know,

29
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.070
population growth and price inflation had impacted to some degree upon

30
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:54.750
established patterns of social relationships,

31
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.870
especially on the land between landlords and tenants.

32
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.410
In this situation,

33
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.560
there was need for sustained economic expansion if a growing population was to

34
00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:07.620
be maintained.

35
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.020
And in particular if the younger generation were to be able to find employment

36
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.530
to enjoy living standards comparable to those of their parents and such

37
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:24.861
expansion needed to be considerable if it was to keep pace with continued

38
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.460
population rise.

39
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.780
If you look at your handout table number one there we have the best figures

40
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:35.310
available for population showing that by the beginning of Elizabeth's reign in

41
00:02:35.311 --> 00:02:39.750
1561 or two already reached about 3 million by 60,
you know,

42
00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:44.751
wanted to topped 4,000,016 41 the population had risen to just over 5 million.

43
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.930
And in fact the population in England seems to have been rising faster and for

44
00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:59.931
rather longer than was generally the case in Europe at the time between the

45
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:02.440
1520s and the 1640s,

46
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.220
the population of England and Wales roughly doubled.

47
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.120
Whereas in most European countries which have a continental European countries

48
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:13.900
which have been studied,
uh,
the rise was something like 50%.

49
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.250
Um,

50
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.250
that suggests that whatever the population rise in England had in common with

51
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:24.760
what was going on elsewhere in Europe,
perhaps in terms of its origins,

52
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.140
it was nonetheless being sustained rather long,

53
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.760
longer perhaps because of factors peculiar to the English situation.

54
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:39.240
That seems to have been a capacity to absorb increased numbers of people to a

55
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:43.630
somewhat greater extent than in much of continental Europe.

56
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.040
And that this could happen at all is of course an indication that some kind of

57
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:53.170
economic expansion was probably going on.

58
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.210
And so the question arises and has been extensively investigated,
uh,

59
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.590
as to what were the areas of economic expansion in this period?

60
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.500
Well,
in a predominantly rural society,

61
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:10.930
of course we need to begin with agriculture.

62
00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.970
And if you look at a table two on your handout to a,

63
00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.610
there's an index there of agricultural output.

64
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.280
It's the best estimate currently available,

65
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.760
calculated by the agricultural historian Mark Overton.

66
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.750
And it suggests that grain output rose by about 38% in England between and 50

67
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:37.531
and 1600 and by a further 26% between 1,616 50 over the entire period,

68
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.730
something like a 75% increase in grain output.

69
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.850
Well,
how do they achieve that?

70
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.190
One thing they did was to extend the cultivated area.

71
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.570
In fact,
very little land was not used at all.

72
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.900
So really this was largely a matter of changing the use of the land so as to

73
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:06.610
increase the intensity of its use.

74
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:09.280
They did that in many ways.

75
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.340
One way was by clearing woodlands and bringing him the wood,

76
00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.450
the woodland into Arabelle production.
I'm a good deal of that.

77
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:20.860
Went on in the heavily wooded areas of the West Midlands here and elsewhere.

78
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.823
Piece meal.

79
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.740
Another thing they did was to drain a waterlogged land and to reclaim it for

80
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:33.810
agriculture.
It was a good deal of that going on piecemeal around the country.
Uh,

81
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.830
down here in eastern England,
for example,

82
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.520
a lot of salt marsh along the coast was brought in permanently.

83
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.290
They built dikes so it wouldn't flood,
uh,
and drained it,
uh,

84
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.840
much in the manner that was practiced in the Netherlands of course.
Uh,

85
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.970
and brought that land into permanent pasture use.

86
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:57.370
A lot of wasteland was plowed up and brought into cultivation.

87
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.740
There was a lot of piecemeal change of that kind wherever wasteland was

88
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:04.100
available.
But there are also some very large projects of that kind,

89
00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:07.880
which was sponsored and overseen by the Royal Privy Council.

90
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.160
Uh,
in the west of England.
A lot of forested land was Disa,

91
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:15.760
forested by the crown.
That is,
it's a,

92
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.580
it's a status as far as land was,
was canceled.

93
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.260
A woodlands were cleared.
Land was brought into cultivation all over the west.

94
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.880
Um,
another major scheme was in the Fed lands of East Anglia,

95
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.670
the fens where from the 16,

96
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:36.671
20 onwards gradually drained and that land was brought into cultivation.

97
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.300
Dutch engineers were brought in because of the expertise in draining land,

98
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:44.120
building dikes,
drainage channels and so forth.

99
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.700
It's because of that drainage which took place in the 17th century.

100
00:06:47.701 --> 00:06:49.010
And if we drive through that area,

101
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.590
you find the roads are higher than the surrounding land.

102
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.300
Well,
much change then have this kind of going on.

103
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.520
And this tended to recast the balance between Arabelle and pastoral production

104
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.200
in the kingdom as a whole.

105
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.340
It also furthered increased specialization in accordance with the best use of

106
00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:13.850
the land in the forest of Arden,
for example,

107
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:19.690
in Warwickshire an area which was previously largely an area of grazing in

108
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:22.400
forest clearances,

109
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:27.530
much of the forest was cleared and the land went over from meat production to

110
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:31.460
Arabelle and dairying.
Um,
amongst the arable crops,

111
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:36.670
they began growing more barley as well as wheat to diversify the product.

112
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.760
They generally increased the food base of the area.

113
00:07:40.761 --> 00:07:45.761
They were producing milk and cheese and grain as well as meet and you've got

114
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:48.830
other areas where there's even more diversification.

115
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.650
I'm down in Kent to the southeast of London.

116
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.240
Northern can't became an area specializing in producing wheat for the bakers of

117
00:07:56.241 --> 00:08:00.920
London.
Other areas of the county specialized in,
in fattening cattle,

118
00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:04.010
which were driven down from the north fattened up and then went to butchers in

119
00:08:04.011 --> 00:08:08.420
London.
There were areas specializing in hop production as they still are for the

120
00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:13.421
brewers of London areas specializing in market gardening for the city,

121
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:20.210
proximity to the vast food market of London of course encouraged specialization

122
00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:21.044
of that kind

123
00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.660
and such specialization in various parts of the kingdom.

124
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.990
Intern encouraged intensification of cultivation

125
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:36.850
sometimes that was by introducing technical changes in agricultural production.

126
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.630
There was a lot of attention paid to better forms of maneuvering the land.

127
00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:48.270
I'm not just using animal muck but also spreading Lyme on the fields or modeling

128
00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:52.310
the fields,
uh,
model as a kind of chalky clay.

129
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.700
They would dig it up and spread it on the fields and then plow it in.
Um,

130
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.940
techniques of that kind had the effect of reducing the acidity of the soil and

131
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:05.670
they encouraged nitrogen mineralization,

132
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:08.220
which encouraged the fertility of the soil.

133
00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.610
They didn't know the chemistry of what was happening,

134
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.850
but they knew that it worked and techniques of just kind,

135
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.530
we're quite widely practiced.

136
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:23.270
There were also technical changes in the form of changing rotations in the use

137
00:09:23.821 --> 00:09:28.821
of land between having it down to grass or plowing it up for arable crops in

138
00:09:29.941 --> 00:09:31.680
particular and innovation,

139
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:36.681
which was known as convertible husbandry or up and down husbandry.

140
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:42.320
It was often called previously the practice had been in the great open fields

141
00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:46.410
around villages to leave one of them follow each year.

142
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.980
It would be rested for a single year and then brought back into production.

143
00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.680
Convertible husbandry was a much more efficient form of rotation.

144
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.490
You would leave the grass,
the land down to grasp for quite a long time,
10 years,

145
00:09:59.700 --> 00:10:00.660
12 years perhaps.

146
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:05.340
Then plow it up for just two or three years and then put it down to grass again.

147
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:11.010
The effect of this change in rotation was that the land was we got,

148
00:10:11.011 --> 00:10:12.570
it's hard to restored better.

149
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:17.310
You've got greatly improved serial yields when it was plowed up for Arabelle,

150
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:22.320
but at the same time you had more of your acreage down to grass at any one time

151
00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:27.380
so you could keep more animals so they could increase both their output of grain

152
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.460
and the density of the livestock,

153
00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:34.970
which they raised this practice up and down or convertible husbandry had long

154
00:10:36.571 --> 00:10:38.550
been known in some areas,

155
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.590
but it gradually spread as a particularly efficient practice.

156
00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:44.311
Uh,

157
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:49.200
and it spreads all over lowland England between about the 1580s and the 1650s.

158
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.910
And finally change of all these kinds could be facilitated by enclosing the land

159
00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.590
into individually managed farms.
As you know,

160
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:06.090
in the 16th century,
that had been great hostility to end closure for pasture,

161
00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:11.040
which took land out of Arab oil production in the late 16th century,

162
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:15.300
partly because of this hostility to enclosure the enclosure movement slackened.

163
00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:20.780
But at the turn of the 17th century,
it began to pick up again,
uh,

164
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:25.500
in the central England county of Leicestershire in the what people refer to as

165
00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:28.680
the Midland plain of central England.
For example,

166
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:34.310
about a third of the county had already been enclosed by 1550 in the second half

167
00:11:35.401 --> 00:11:39.990
of the 16th century,
only 5% more was in close the movement slackened.

168
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.790
But in the early 17th century,

169
00:11:41.791 --> 00:11:46.100
it picked up again and 40% more of the county was in closed.

170
00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.760
Similar figures have been produced for other areas,
particularly in the Midlands,

171
00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:57.020
well this second of and closure of dividing up the fields and common into

172
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.290
smaller fields individually managed.

173
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:04.090
It was different in two respects from the earlier and closure movement.

174
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:05.583
First of all,

175
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.390
it was now not so much and closure for conversion to pasture,

176
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.460
especially conversion to sheep ranching.

177
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:18.390
Now it tended to be enclosure for the practice of improved Arabelle husbandry or

178
00:12:18.461 --> 00:12:20.140
convertible husbandry.

179
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.810
When the forest of the West were cleared and the fence of the east were drained,

180
00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:31.060
the land brought into production tended to be divided up into individual fields

181
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:36.010
and then let out to local farmers where they practice convertible husbandry and

182
00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:39.730
they're in closed farms.
Secondly,

183
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.900
this differed because it was not a thing which was just pushed through

184
00:12:43.901 --> 00:12:48.190
unilaterally by the local gentry who wanted to create sheep ranchers in the

185
00:12:48.191 --> 00:12:50.410
early 16th century.
Now,

186
00:12:50.411 --> 00:12:54.070
it was a movement which tended to proceed by agreement agreements,

187
00:12:54.071 --> 00:12:58.180
which will be struck between local gentlemen and the principal,
local farmers,

188
00:12:58.181 --> 00:13:02.380
their biggest tenants in the main,
and so you find all over the kingdom,

189
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.500
local communities coming to agreements of this kind to enclose the common fields

190
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:12.520
or the common pastures to take just one example is a village up in the West

191
00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:13.720
Midlands called highly,

192
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.520
which has been much studied and it has excellent records and it's highly,

193
00:13:18.521 --> 00:13:19.001
for example,

194
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:23.400
it was in the 1610s and the 1620s that the open fields of the parish will

195
00:13:23.401 --> 00:13:25.960
gradually and close little by little by agreement,

196
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:30.340
and then they rounded the whole thing off by dividing up and portioning out the

197
00:13:30.341 --> 00:13:33.370
woodlands and common pasture of the manner.

198
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.830
The whole idea of this was to create consolidated farms,

199
00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:43.750
which would be under the individual management of a particular farmer that gave

200
00:13:43.751 --> 00:13:48.751
those farmers freedom of movement in managing and adapting their husbandry

201
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.210
practice as they saw fit.

202
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:58.810
Intensification of methods was not impossible in the old open fields,

203
00:13:58.811 --> 00:14:03.190
but it was much easier on farms under individual management.

204
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:04.360
And in consequence,

205
00:14:04.361 --> 00:14:09.361
the old commonary managed customary system of agriculture gradually weakened it.

206
00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:15.190
We can get hold on.
Agricultural Organization generally survived in some areas,

207
00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:20.020
but in many parts of the country it was gradually disappearing and in some it

208
00:14:20.021 --> 00:14:22.540
was almost wholly extinguished.

209
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:25.510
Right?

210
00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:30.510
Overall various combinations of changes of this kind appear to have boosted

211
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.210
agricultural output considerably,

212
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.040
even boosting the yields per acre,
the productivity of the land,

213
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.413
um,

214
00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:45.690
the study which is represented by the figures on to table to be on your handout

215
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.390
of land productivity in a number of counties,

216
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:54.560
a study based farmers inventories the crops that are recorded in their

217
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:57.830
inventories and also on some surviving account books.

218
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:03.370
This suggests that in these counties serially yields numbers of bushels per acre

219
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:10.270
rose by about 15% in the late 16th century and by another 4% in the early 17th

220
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:15.110
century.
Okay.

221
00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.053
Well,

222
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:22.120
gradual change of this kind in agriculture implies that there existed a larger

223
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.690
market for agricultural produce and in some ways a more distant market for

224
00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:31.970
agricultural produce that farmers we're trying to serve.

225
00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.030
And those markets were found,

226
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:40.390
as you would imagine above all in the towns and in those areas of the country

227
00:15:41.261 --> 00:15:44.130
side,
which had large populations,
um,

228
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.330
which we're engaged in activities other than agriculture,

229
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.730
industrial areas of the countryside.

230
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.910
This was a period of very marked urbanization,

231
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.520
very significant urban growth.

232
00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:03.230
Some of the figures are there on table three on your handout for a number of

233
00:16:03.231 --> 00:16:06.200
cities in Worcester,
for example,

234
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:11.450
the population rose between 1550 and 60 and 50 from just over 4,002 roughly

235
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.940
8,000 in Norridge,

236
00:16:13.941 --> 00:16:18.710
the population of the city rose from about 10,000 to over 30,000

237
00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.070
and above all,

238
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:27.350
there was a massive population growth in the city of London.

239
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.940
The figures are there for you.

240
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.600
1550 London was already about 70,000 by 1600 200,000 by 1650 400,000 and still

241
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.923
growing

242
00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:48.250
by 1600 London already contained 5% of the national population by 1650 London

243
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:57.251
contained just over 9% of the national population and we're still growing and

244
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:05.110
today it's about 10% because it almost reached that proportion in the mid 17th

245
00:17:05.451 --> 00:17:09.110
century.
So very significant urban growth,

246
00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.840
all of that involved within particular cities,

247
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:19.870
the taking up a vacant space within their walls for building the subdivision of

248
00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:26.291
existing housing and the growth of suburbs outside the old city walls in London

249
00:17:28.641 --> 00:17:29.181
for example,

250
00:17:29.181 --> 00:17:33.860
by the 1580s there were complaints by the local authorities of what they called

251
00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:39.220
pestering of houses with diverse families or multiple occupation or again,

252
00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.000
multitudes of people.

253
00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:45.980
These are quotations multitudes of people brought to inhabit in small rooms and

254
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:50.040
heaped up together and in a sought almost smothered,

255
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.910
said one report overcrowding congestion.

256
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.230
In addition in the parish is outside the city walls.

257
00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:00.570
There was significant suburban growth.

258
00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.800
The parishes of east London to the east of the Tower of London.

259
00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:10.010
The modern east stand in the 1570s contained about 7,000 people already.

260
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.120
There's already a significant population in these parishes just outside the old

261
00:18:15.121 --> 00:18:18.330
city walls.
By the 1630s,

262
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.800
there were 50,000 people in the East London suburbs,

263
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.780
or if we turn to western London,
um,

264
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.920
the parish of Saint Martin in the fields,

265
00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:32.700
which was literally in the fields in the mid 16th century,

266
00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:34.740
had a population of about 600.

267
00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:39.480
When Elizabeth came to the throne by the 1630s,

268
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:44.250
saint Martins had a population of 18,000 to this single London.

269
00:18:44.251 --> 00:18:49.251
Suburban parish contained more people than most of the cities in other parts of

270
00:18:50.071 --> 00:18:50.904
the kingdom.

271
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:55.170
The Church of Saint Martin's in the fields is the one that stands beside

272
00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.860
Trafalgar Square today,
right in the heart of the city.

273
00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:01.500
Well,

274
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:06.500
this formidable urban growth occurred despite alarming levels of urban mortality

275
00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:14.190
in the overcrowded,
increasingly insanitary towns,

276
00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:16.170
they didn't have adequate water supply.

277
00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.920
They didn't have adequate sanitation measures.

278
00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:21.900
Background mortality,

279
00:19:21.901 --> 00:19:26.700
ordinary everyday mortality from infectious disease in the towns was very bad

280
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:30.330
followers.
And in the countryside,
even within the cities,

281
00:19:30.331 --> 00:19:32.730
it could vary quite significantly.
For example,

282
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.610
in the late 16th century,

283
00:19:35.611 --> 00:19:40.611
average life expectation at birth in the wealthier districts of London was 30 to

284
00:19:42.661 --> 00:19:47.661
35 average life expectation of birth in the poorer parishes of the east end was

285
00:19:49.471 --> 00:19:51.750
only 20 to 25.

286
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.100
The towns were also prone,
of course,

287
00:19:56.101 --> 00:20:00.270
to catastrophic crisis mortality in the form of epidemics,

288
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:04.440
particularly epidemics of bubonic plague norritch.

289
00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:09.770
So five major epidemics of plague between 1579 and 1640 London also.

290
00:20:12.631 --> 00:20:17.631
So five in the same period and most other major cities witnessed a number.

291
00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:21.240
These are brakes,

292
00:20:21.241 --> 00:20:25.860
could kill 10 to 15% of the population or even worse.

293
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:28.860
Um,
in York in 1,604,

294
00:20:28.861 --> 00:20:32.640
which was a really bad year when the plague spread from city to city across the

295
00:20:32.641 --> 00:20:34.800
kingdom in York in that year,

296
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:39.860
roughly 30% of the population died in new castle up here in the northeast in

297
00:20:40.711 --> 00:20:45.711
1636 an estimated 47% of the population died between May and October of that

298
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.433
year.

299
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:55.950
These were absolutely devastating events and they were at their worst in the

300
00:20:56.681 --> 00:20:58.870
poorer,
overcrowded,

301
00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:02.980
dirtier areas of the cities.
It's been said by Paul.

302
00:21:02.981 --> 00:21:05.830
Slack has written a wonderful book about the impact of the plague,

303
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:09.880
that there was a distinct urban topography of the plague.

304
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.250
The disease was no respecter of persons,

305
00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:16.330
but it raged at its worse under certain social conditions

306
00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.910
and yet despite these appalling catastrophes,

307
00:21:22.690 --> 00:21:26.500
the town's continued to grow London above all,

308
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.660
one of the earliest demographers,
a man named John Grant,

309
00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.200
who published a study based upon the mortality figures for London,

310
00:21:37.631 --> 00:21:41.290
which were regularly collected by the city authorities to keep an eye on the

311
00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:45.610
epidemic disease situation.
He studied them for the first time.
He,
he,

312
00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:48.520
he made various projections on the base of those fingers.

313
00:21:48.521 --> 00:21:51.850
He was a great pioneer of the use of statistical information.

314
00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:56.920
He came to the conclusion,
I'm quoting him,
let the mortality be what it will.

315
00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.030
This city repairs itself.
Within two years,

316
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:06.780
the loss of inhabitants could be rapidly replaced and the evidence is that this

317
00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:07.924
was so,

318
00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:13.650
and of course the loss was replaced primarily by continued migration to the

319
00:22:14.261 --> 00:22:15.094
towns.

320
00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:20.260
It's been calculated that in order to replace the numbers who died under these

321
00:22:20.261 --> 00:22:24.910
dreadful mortality conditions and to continue to grow in the way that it did,

322
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:30.510
London needed an average of 6,000 new people a year coming into the city to

323
00:22:32.441 --> 00:22:33.970
replace his losses and grow.

324
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.750
And the evidence is that they came,

325
00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:44.670
some of them came as what one demographer describes as betterment migrants,

326
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:50.730
people who came to the city in fairly confident expectation of better

327
00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:52.840
opportunities.

328
00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:56.590
They might come in as apprentices to be apprentice to a particular trade,

329
00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.500
their apprenticeship,
having been arranged by members of their family.

330
00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:04.600
They might be people who came in with a known place to fill very often,

331
00:23:04.601 --> 00:23:05.081
for example,

332
00:23:05.081 --> 00:23:07.750
they might have relatives already in the city who would encourage their

333
00:23:07.751 --> 00:23:09.950
migration to join them.
Uh,

334
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:15.050
a very interesting study by Vivian Brodsky of single women marrying for the

335
00:23:15.191 --> 00:23:19.000
first time in London,
uh,
and taking out licenses to marry,

336
00:23:19.001 --> 00:23:21.340
which give us some details of their circumstances.

337
00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:26.550
She finds interestingly that two fifths of these single women marrying in London

338
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.640
had kin in the city with whom they were living at the time that they married.

339
00:23:32.861 --> 00:23:34.510
So they'd come in from the countryside,

340
00:23:34.511 --> 00:23:37.420
they were living with family members already in the city,

341
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.540
and then they established themselves and,
and married.
Then

342
00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:47.210
other people came not as betterment with good prospects of that kind,

343
00:23:47.211 --> 00:23:51.050
but as what have been described as subsistence migrants,

344
00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:56.740
people looking for any opportunity to find work and hoping that the city would

345
00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:01.610
provide it.
And clearly it did,

346
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:05.630
perhaps not the opportunities that people hoped for the streets of London.

347
00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:07.310
We're certainly not paved with gold,

348
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.390
but opportunities of a kind to make a living of some kind.

349
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:16.520
The quickening urban economies of other cities also did the same.

350
00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.840
Um,
in culture stir and in Norridge for example,

351
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.530
the cloth industry was expanding,
uh,

352
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.860
particularly with the help of refugees from the Netherlands,

353
00:24:27.861 --> 00:24:32.360
from the religious wars of the Netherlands who came and were placed in those

354
00:24:32.361 --> 00:24:34.450
cities by Elizabeth's government,
uh,

355
00:24:34.451 --> 00:24:38.150
and who are welcomed because they introduced certain advanced cloth making

356
00:24:38.151 --> 00:24:42.500
techniques which helped to improve the local cross industry and assist its

357
00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:46.250
expansion
in London.
Above all,

358
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:51.520
you get a spectacular diversification of manufacturing activity in east London.

359
00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.450
Along the river.
There were shipyards.

360
00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:01.990
They will also businesses producing all sorts of other goods ancillary to the

361
00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:06.050
shipping industry,
rope making,
sail making,

362
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.320
Cooper's making barrels,
um,

363
00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.640
people making pulleys pulley makers for the,
the ropes that held,
you know,

364
00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:19.730
for the rigging of the ships.
Um,
in London you also find tech styles,

365
00:25:19.731 --> 00:25:23.870
especially luxury textiles,
a massive brewing industry,

366
00:25:23.871 --> 00:25:28.340
metal trades,
sugar refining,
starch making,
soap making,

367
00:25:28.341 --> 00:25:31.130
glass making and so on,
could go on.

368
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:35.960
And then of course there was all the activity around the wharves and river in

369
00:25:35.961 --> 00:25:38.690
what was England's greatest trading city.

370
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.710
So urban economies were expanding the numbers of apprentices being taken on with

371
00:25:46.711 --> 00:25:49.530
growing the level of activity was growing,

372
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:51.750
the activities themselves were proliferating,

373
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:58.770
but manufacturing and other industries also extended well beyond the cities.

374
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.970
Manufacturing of some products had long been established in rural villages under

375
00:26:04.971 --> 00:26:06.410
the putting out system.

376
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:12.970
And this period also witnessed considerable growth in activities of this kind.

377
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:19.900
It rarely involved really significant technological change of the kind that we

378
00:26:20.241 --> 00:26:24.200
associate with the industrial revolution and the birth of the factory system.

379
00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:29.980
But what it often saw was the adoption or the imitation of the best practices

380
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:36.430
known at the time and the diversification of the products which were being

381
00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:37.694
produced.

382
00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:42.380
And there was also something of a spread in the geographical location of various

383
00:26:42.381 --> 00:26:44.160
kinds of activity.

384
00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:47.641
As you know,

385
00:26:47.641 --> 00:26:52.641
the premia traditional industry was the production of woolen broadcloth.

386
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:59.820
Most of it exported to the Netherlands where traditionally it was finished and

387
00:26:59.821 --> 00:27:01.770
then passed onto markets across Europe.

388
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:07.110
This traditional industry had had something of a crisis of overproduction in the

389
00:27:07.111 --> 00:27:12.111
1550s and thereafter found that its markets were somewhat declining.

390
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:16.560
It's overseas markets are somewhat declining and it faced a pretty stiff

391
00:27:16.561 --> 00:27:18.510
competition from the Dutch.

392
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:22.260
But the textile industry has continued to expand.
Nonetheless,

393
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.410
the most dynamic areas of tech styles,

394
00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.020
we're not the old broad cloth industry,

395
00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:31.830
but the production of what they called the new draperies,

396
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:36.840
the new draperies,
these were lighter,
fully finished,

397
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:41.840
more colorful clots.
Um,
rather than like modern suit cloth.
If,

398
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:46.020
if old fashion,
if the old broad clots were rather like a heavy blanket,
uh,

399
00:27:46.021 --> 00:27:48.020
then if you imagine modern modern suiting cloths,

400
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.240
that's what the new draperies were like Wooster's of various kinds.

401
00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:54.960
They had lovely names for them and they are always inventing fancy names for

402
00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:59.961
these new clots bays and ses and perpetual armors and Kelly Mancos.

403
00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.220
All of these were different forms of Worcester cloth.

404
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:12.700
The new draperies were centered in the towns of East Anglia where they had been

405
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.160
with their establishment had been greatly assisted by the influx of skilled

406
00:28:17.161 --> 00:28:19.770
refugees from the Netherlands.

407
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:25.410
They brought their expertise and they helped to revive and transform the clot

408
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.480
industries of those areas,

409
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:30.720
especially around knowledge and culture stuff,

410
00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:37.850
but the new draperies weren't not the whole story of textile diversification up

411
00:28:39.391 --> 00:28:41.970
in Lancashire around the town of Manchester,

412
00:28:41.971 --> 00:28:45.210
which at this time is not a great city,
but a small market town.

413
00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:49.200
There was the growth in the late 16th and early 17th centuries of the

414
00:28:49.201 --> 00:28:52.450
manufacturer of so called fusty Ian's first.

415
00:28:52.451 --> 00:28:57.451
Ian's involved a mixture of cotton and linen and the production of this clot.

416
00:28:57.871 --> 00:28:58.501
It was cheap,

417
00:28:58.501 --> 00:29:02.430
coarse cloth for the home market cloth for the poor was centered around

418
00:29:02.431 --> 00:29:03.031
Manchester.

419
00:29:03.031 --> 00:29:07.350
It's the distant ancestor of what was later to be the great cotton industry of

420
00:29:07.351 --> 00:29:08.820
the city of Manchester.

421
00:29:09.270 --> 00:29:12.600
Another thing that was spreading in many rural areas was stuck in knitting.

422
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:17.820
The wives of farmers and agricultural laborers were often involved in knitting,

423
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.320
high quality stockings.
Many people knitted stockings for themselves,

424
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:26.340
but there was a market for high quality stockings supplied by people working in

425
00:29:26.341 --> 00:29:27.174
that way.

426
00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.440
The stocking industry spread all over Norfolk spread across the Midlands into

427
00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:35.010
Nottinghamshire area,
which is actually still to this day,

428
00:29:35.011 --> 00:29:39.330
a set date for the manufacturer of stockings and the underwear marks and

429
00:29:39.331 --> 00:29:44.140
Spencer's gets a lot of stuff from Nottingham Shit.
Um,
and so on.

430
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.770
Um,
one could talk about silks,
luxury textiles,

431
00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:52.240
silks were introduced by French Protestant refugees from southern France and

432
00:29:52.241 --> 00:29:56.680
silk production became established principally in eastern London and also in the

433
00:29:56.681 --> 00:29:58.690
town of Canterbury,
in Kent.

434
00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:01.960
So a lot of diversification,

435
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:07.090
not only in woolen textiles but in some new developments like silk.

436
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:13.320
And this was part of a larger diversification of manufacturing in town and

437
00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:16.980
country.
A lot of the new manual,

438
00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:21.640
the altogether new manufacturers which were introduced were really forms of

439
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:27.060
import substitution and courage by the royal government so that things could be

440
00:30:27.311 --> 00:30:30.310
produced at home rather than imported.

441
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.801
Traditionally,

442
00:30:32.801 --> 00:30:37.420
a great deal of miscellaneous manufactured goods actually were imported

443
00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:40.810
principally from the Netherlands or north Germany

444
00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.240
under Elizabeth.

445
00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:48.570
The Privy Council was very responsive indeed to anyone with good ideas for

446
00:30:49.121 --> 00:30:51.520
introducing these things into England.

447
00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.700
They would often encourage them by granting them a patent,

448
00:30:54.940 --> 00:30:59.320
which would give them the monopoly of producing a certain item for a stated

449
00:30:59.321 --> 00:31:03.280
period of years after which it would be open to anyone who wished to participate

450
00:31:03.281 --> 00:31:07.360
in the industry once it was established.
It's the origins of the patent system.

451
00:31:07.361 --> 00:31:11.560
Of course.
Well,
numerous Peyton's were granted,

452
00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:17.130
um,
to take some examples,
which may seem almost silly,
but they mattered.
Uh,

453
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:18.033
pins,

454
00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:22.960
well it doesn't usually think of pins when one thinks of some major economic

455
00:31:22.961 --> 00:31:26.020
expansion.
But in 1597,

456
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.620
England imported 40,000 pounds worth of pins from the Netherlands.

457
00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:38.890
That's a lot of pins and a lot of money.
Um,

458
00:31:38.950 --> 00:31:42.770
in the first decade of the 17th century pin manufacturing was established and

459
00:31:42.771 --> 00:31:44.500
the picking in the suburbs of London,

460
00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:49.230
they mostly employ children making the pins.
By the 1630s,
uh,

461
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:53.380
the patent had expired and it spread beyond London became particularly

462
00:31:53.381 --> 00:31:56.800
established in villages in the west of England,
in the Gloucestershire area.

463
00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:01.120
From about this time onward,
most English pins were produced at home.

464
00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:04.330
And so one could go on.

465
00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:09.390
Glass was nearly always important before the 1580s Peyton's.

466
00:32:09.641 --> 00:32:14.440
But then granted for introducing glass manufacturer particular to particularly

467
00:32:14.441 --> 00:32:17.860
to the counties of Kent and Sussex,
and then it spread to some other places.

468
00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:21.730
They were glass glassworks around Newcastle very soon,
um,

469
00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:23.560
by the 1620s,

470
00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:27.310
nearly old glass bottles used in England were being produced at home instead of

471
00:32:27.311 --> 00:32:31.510
imported and so on.
Well,

472
00:32:31.511 --> 00:32:35.530
industries of this kind would generally somewhat decentralized in their

473
00:32:35.531 --> 00:32:39.010
organization.
They were organized on the putting out system.

474
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.750
They didn't involve a great deal in the way of investment in fixed capital,

475
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.530
in the form of industrial plant machinery and so forth.

476
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:52.170
Principally,
they needed the capital,
uh,

477
00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:56.120
to buy raw materials to pay workers who are working in their own cottages or

478
00:32:56.121 --> 00:32:59.990
workshops to market the finished goods.

479
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:05.540
It was all done on the putting out system but there were a number of other

480
00:33:05.541 --> 00:33:10.070
industries which were also beginning to bring a rather different face to

481
00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:14.630
industrial activity.
Iron for example,

482
00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:21.910
iron manufacturing really got going in the mid 16th century when the technique

483
00:33:23.421 --> 00:33:28.421
of using blast furnaces was introduced into England from Germany.

484
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:33.500
It was greatly encouraged by Elizabeth's Privy Council because they wanted iron

485
00:33:33.501 --> 00:33:37.580
production domestically for the production of munitions.

486
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:44.290
By the 1570s there were over 50 blast furnaces operating in the forests of the

487
00:33:44.451 --> 00:33:47.660
area known as the wheels down here towards the south coast,

488
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:53.170
the forested area with fast running streams which was suitable for driving some

489
00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.440
of the machinery involved in the early 17th century.

490
00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:01.520
The industry in the wheeled a had stabilized,
even declined a little,

491
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:06.260
but there was a great deal of relocation to south Wales largely because that

492
00:34:06.261 --> 00:34:11.261
area offered a combination of iron ore for us to provide the timber to produce

493
00:34:12.081 --> 00:34:17.081
charcoal for the blast furnaces and also fast running streams to drive the

494
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.600
machinery which was used in slitting mills in iron production machinery driven

495
00:34:22.671 --> 00:34:23.690
by water wheels.

496
00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.490
All of this is a very interesting to go into in detail to see the technology

497
00:34:28.491 --> 00:34:30.860
they use,
but I'll spare you that.
Um,

498
00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:33.650
but it can be followed up if these things interest you.

499
00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:40.730
Buy
by the 1580s,

500
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:46.360
the levels of iron production of the 1550s had increased three fold by the 1640s

501
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:52.820
England was producing 2120 4,000 tons of pig iron a year.

502
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.390
Those were the signs of things to come in the iron industry,

503
00:34:56.391 --> 00:34:57.680
which continued to grow,

504
00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:02.600
but a lot of iron was still imported from Scandinavia in particular from Sweden

505
00:35:02.601 --> 00:35:07.070
especially to serve a growing industry,
producing metal wares.

506
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:11.540
And that was centered in the West Midlands around the town of Birmingham.

507
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:18.760
Metalware production had taken place there for many years in deed centuries but

508
00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:21.410
was greatly increasing.

509
00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.480
They produce their many metal products used in agriculture and in the building

510
00:35:26.481 --> 00:35:27.950
industries and the shipping,

511
00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:32.120
nails and blocks and sides and buckles,

512
00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:36.950
latches for doors,
bits and stirrups for horses and so forth.

513
00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:42.360
All of this was organized by iron masters who lived in emerging towns like

514
00:35:42.361 --> 00:35:45.510
Birmingham,
Warsaw and star bridge.

515
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:50.700
And they did it partly by employing independent master to produce specialized

516
00:35:50.701 --> 00:35:54.210
goods for them.
And also by putting out work,

517
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:57.870
putting out raw materials for the simpler items like nail making,

518
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:00.540
two cottages who work part time

519
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.960
and so on can go on.

520
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:09.690
Led production was also expanding.
Some of the figures are there,
uh,

521
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:14.720
in table four 1560 is only about 600 tons of lead produced per annum.

522
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:17.670
By the 1630s,

523
00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:22.850
well over 12,000 led production was centered in the hills of Darbyshire and in

524
00:36:24.541 --> 00:36:28.050
parts of Somerset where led deposits,
where to be found.

525
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:33.360
And finally,
perhaps most spectacular of all in the introduction of these new,

526
00:36:33.361 --> 00:36:37.590
heavier industries was the growth of the coal industry.

527
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.130
The coal industry centered around new castle on the river.

528
00:36:41.131 --> 00:36:46.131
Tyne grew spectacularly under Elizabeth and the early Stuart's in response above

529
00:36:48.061 --> 00:36:53.061
all to the demands for fuel exerted by London and other growing cities.

530
00:36:55.410 --> 00:37:00.000
In the 50 [inaudible] Newcastle exported to London through the coastal trade,

531
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:02.820
50,000 tons of coal a year.

532
00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:08.540
By the 1640s it was exporting 300,000 tons of coal per year.

533
00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:14.480
In addition to which by 1640 another 200,000 tons were being exported to other

534
00:37:16.050 --> 00:37:17.640
English cities.

535
00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.570
The coal industry could not have grown as it did without the demand being

536
00:37:21.571 --> 00:37:23.640
exerted by these growing urban centers.

537
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.210
Those urban centers could not have grown as they did without the fuel,

538
00:37:27.211 --> 00:37:28.110
the cheap fuel,

539
00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:33.350
which was coming from the minds of the north by 1650 the northeast alone,

540
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:37.020
and they were coal fields in some other areas too,

541
00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:42.380
but the northeast alone was producing half a million tons of coal per annum.

542
00:37:42.990 --> 00:37:47.520
Quite extraordinary output.
Just to give you a sense of what that might mean.

543
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:52.910
A recent historian of these developments has calculated that a ton of coal

544
00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:58.530
yields roughly the same heat energy as the charcoal,

545
00:37:58.531 --> 00:38:03.120
which could be produced by harvesting timber on an acre of land.

546
00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:08.400
Okay.
So same heat heat energy as the timber from an acre of land.

547
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:14.510
So if you're producing half a million tons of coal per annum,

548
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:19.790
you have in effect created half a million acres of land as it were in terms of

549
00:38:22.081 --> 00:38:26.610
your,
the capacity you would need in order to produce that amount of heat energy.

550
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.880
And that he tended,
she was used not only for domestic heating,

551
00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:33.090
but for any industrial process which required heat.

552
00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:37.660
They couldn't use it for smelting iron,
but um,
they could use it for many,

553
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:40.240
many industrial processes.

554
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:45.490
So that clear did you get them the point?
Um,

555
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:47.980
it's an interesting way of,
of,
of,
of,

556
00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:51.370
of representing the difference that that kind of industrial development could

557
00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:54.910
make.
Okay.
Well,

558
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.490
much of this built on existing foundations,

559
00:38:57.491 --> 00:39:00.760
but the sheer scale of expansion began to give a very distinct regional

560
00:39:00.761 --> 00:39:02.410
geography to the English economy.

561
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:07.090
They were distinctive areas of agricultural specialization emerging and there

562
00:39:07.091 --> 00:39:10.630
were also those areas which were rendered distinctive by their involvement in

563
00:39:10.631 --> 00:39:11.650
industrial activity.

564
00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:17.370
One traveler traveling through the West Midlands near Birmingham in the 1640s

565
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:21.010
described it as being like one continued village,

566
00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:26.330
large village after large village,
heavily involved in iron production.
Um,

567
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:31.680
the Star valley area stretching up from culture to where the new draperies we're

568
00:39:31.841 --> 00:39:32.830
well established.

569
00:39:32.831 --> 00:39:37.831
It was described as with a continuing of consisting of a constellation of

570
00:39:39.101 --> 00:39:43.420
villages in which a small number of clothing is set on work,

571
00:39:43.421 --> 00:39:45.640
a great company of poor people

572
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:52.000
or there again there's the extraordinary moonscape which was emerging around

573
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:56.110
around the new castle coalfield area in which there were many,

574
00:39:56.111 --> 00:40:01.111
many individual pits working down to depths of two or 300 feet and then they

575
00:40:02.831 --> 00:40:04.990
couldn't really go any deeper because of drainage problems.

576
00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:06.850
So they would simply open a new pit,

577
00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.660
creating a kind of moonscape across that whole area.

578
00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:17.980
This kind of regional differentiation enhanced the redistribution of the

579
00:40:17.981 --> 00:40:22.981
population as people seeking work moved to places which had the capacity to

580
00:40:23.861 --> 00:40:26.380
provide them with some kind of employment.

581
00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:30.670
Be It in agriculture of particular kinds or in industry.

582
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:33.400
I've already touched on the migration to the towns.

583
00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:38.700
There was also migration to certain rural areas which were becoming very densely

584
00:40:39.701 --> 00:40:40.534
populated,

585
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:45.660
especially the manufacturing districts and those Dan densely populated areas of

586
00:40:46.181 --> 00:40:49.990
course exerted demand in their turn for the agricultural products of a more

587
00:40:49.991 --> 00:40:51.490
specialized agriculture.

588
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:59.230
Something of the redistribution of population which was going on is summarized

589
00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:03.190
in section five of your handout.

590
00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:08.470
There are some figures calculated by the demography ea Wrigley showing that

591
00:41:08.471 --> 00:41:13.471
between 1520 and 1670 the rural agricultural population,

592
00:41:14.561 --> 00:41:17.980
those directly employed in agriculture was significantly reduced.

593
00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:24.240
The urban population living in towns of over 5,000 rose from about 5.5% to over

594
00:41:24.971 --> 00:41:29.971
13% and the rural nonagricultural population rose from about 18% to something

595
00:41:32.171 --> 00:41:37.171
like 26% that's the people living in small towns or working in rural industry.

596
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:42.840
<v 1>Okay.</v>

597
00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.690
<v 0>All of this was of course linked together by internal trade.</v>

598
00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:51.390
The established arteries of internal trade grew and their significance road

599
00:41:51.391 --> 00:41:54.870
traffic,
increased traffic around the coast and on the rivers.

600
00:41:55.390 --> 00:42:00.390
A very good way of moving bulky goods greatly increased networks of internal

601
00:42:00.541 --> 00:42:04.650
trade were elaborated and tightened.
If that had not happened,

602
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.650
then none of these developments would have been possible.

603
00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:12.780
The emerging picture is one of an elaborating web of commercial interconnection,

604
00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.800
pulling the various regional economies together even more tightly than had

605
00:42:16.801 --> 00:42:21.801
previously been the case and this intensification of commercial activity

606
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:28.250
involved new commercial practices and one of the best indicators of the sheer

607
00:42:29.041 --> 00:42:33.990
extent of what was going on is actually provided by the evidence of the law

608
00:42:33.991 --> 00:42:34.824
courts.

609
00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:40.950
A great deal of the litigation which took place in England's law courts

610
00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.590
concerned broken contracts,

611
00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:49.020
disagreements over debts or the meeting of our contractual obligations.

612
00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:54.300
There was an absolutely massive rise in the amount of such business within the

613
00:42:54.301 --> 00:42:57.630
courts.
If you look at section six of your handout,

614
00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:02.820
you'll see that in 1560 just over 5,000 cases of this kind were heard by the

615
00:43:02.821 --> 00:43:04.170
central courts in London.

616
00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:10.140
By 1640 it was almost 29,000 cases being heard a year,

617
00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.740
and this is just the tip of the iceberg.

618
00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:19.010
These are the deals that went wrong and resulted in someone suing someone else.

619
00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:25.310
One can only imagine the massive amount of commercial activity which was going

620
00:43:25.531 --> 00:43:26.364
on,

621
00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:33.080
whereas in 1500 then a great deal of the marketing which had taken place in

622
00:43:33.301 --> 00:43:38.301
England was rather localized with some longer distance flows going across the

623
00:43:38.371 --> 00:43:42.540
kingdom in particular commodities,
cattle cloth and so forth.

624
00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:44.640
By the early 17th century,

625
00:43:44.641 --> 00:43:49.590
one gets a picture of a society which was ever more closely interconnected and

626
00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:53.460
integrated by market dealings and commercial transactions.

627
00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:59.480
This was in short are commercializing society and emergent market economy in

628
00:44:00.931 --> 00:44:05.931
which the living and the daily economic dealings of a far larger proportion of

629
00:44:06.001 --> 00:44:09.810
the population were shaped by the market.

630
00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:11.993
<v 1>Okay.</v>

631
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:13.123
<v 0>And finally,</v>

632
00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:18.590
it wasn't just becoming a more internally integrated commercial society.

633
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:25.420
It was one which was also linked increasingly to a larger world because the same

634
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.920
decades in the late 16th and early 17th centuries saw a transformation of,

635
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:36.900
of overseas trade from a pattern which had been very much based on short

636
00:44:36.901 --> 00:44:40.320
distance traffic across the English Channel.

637
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:43.620
Few voyages down to other French and perhaps Spanish ports,

638
00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:48.890
but predominantly concentrated on the narrow cs two one in which English

639
00:44:49.021 --> 00:44:53.880
merchants were trading directly with far more diverse areas of the world.

640
00:44:55.290 --> 00:44:59.010
They began doing so partly to look for new markets for English cloth,

641
00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:04.910
partly also to get direct access to the source of much desired imports,

642
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:08.760
which had previously been obtained from the Netherlands.

643
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.560
They start trying to go direct to source looking for grain for wine,

644
00:45:13.561 --> 00:45:17.760
for spices,
for luxury textiles from far a field.

645
00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:22.860
That eight 16th century of course was the beginning of the great age of

646
00:45:22.861 --> 00:45:27.150
exploratory voyages by English navigators,
divisors of Francis Drake,

647
00:45:27.151 --> 00:45:29.280
Martin Frobisher and so forth.

648
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:32.760
But the really significant thing from the point of view of the economic

649
00:45:32.761 --> 00:45:37.740
development of the period were those who undertake under took trading voyages to

650
00:45:37.741 --> 00:45:40.920
establish new trades,
often with royal backing,

651
00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.380
often through forming companies,

652
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:47.760
which would get a royal charter to conduct trade with somewhere with which

653
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:49.920
England had not previously traded direct.

654
00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:55.370
So companies were founded with royal charters to trade to the Baltic in search

655
00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:59.730
of the furs,
the grain of Poland,

656
00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.800
the timber products of Scandinavia,

657
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.490
all of which had a place in England's growing economy.

658
00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:07.680
Companies were founded to trade with Russia,

659
00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:11.610
sailing north around Scandinavia to the port of Archangel.

660
00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:17.040
They intended to proceed from there to get access to central Asian goods.

661
00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:20.880
Um,
though that was an enterprise which didn't succeed,

662
00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.370
but they established trade with Muscovy.

663
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:26.310
There was increasing trade direct with Spain,

664
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:31.080
but principally foot for wine and currents or which were extremely popular.

665
00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:34.770
There was direct trade with Italy,
first of all.

666
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:39.690
And then with the Levant,
bringing in spices,
luxury,

667
00:46:39.691 --> 00:46:44.550
textiles,
wine,
uh,
and other goods.
And finally,

668
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:49.500
once the Muscovy company had learned that it could not successfully reached the

669
00:46:49.501 --> 00:46:50.880
east via Russia,

670
00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:55.650
they imitated the Portuguese and went the other way around Africa to establish

671
00:46:55.651 --> 00:46:58.080
the trade with east indies.
Um,

672
00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:03.230
with the voyages of the east India Company chartered in 50 99 and voyaging for

673
00:47:03.841 --> 00:47:06.000
the first time in 1,601

674
00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:08.970
all of these trades,

675
00:47:08.971 --> 00:47:13.971
once they had become established were consolidated and expanding in the course

676
00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:18.990
of the early 17th century when they were joined by yet another area of activity,

677
00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:22.410
the Atlantic traits by the 16th 30th.

678
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:27.430
We're already 300 English ships a year fishing of Newfoundland and bringing back

679
00:47:28.441 --> 00:47:33.010
the fish to Europe where dried card was particularly popular in parts of

680
00:47:33.011 --> 00:47:38.011
southern Europe and increasingly trade had been established with the colonies

681
00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:43.210
established upon the American mainland after 1,607 in Virginia and then Mary

682
00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:49.500
Land of course from the 16 twenty's onwards in the northeast and Caribbean

683
00:47:49.811 --> 00:47:54.310
colonies,
notably Barbados being established in the same period.

684
00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:56.950
Jamaica wasn't conquered til the 16th fifties.

685
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:03.250
Most of these colonies managed to get on their feet through establishing

686
00:48:03.251 --> 00:48:05.110
plantation economies of course,

687
00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:09.670
and they produce the goods which were increasingly imported into England and

688
00:48:09.671 --> 00:48:13.960
then sold on to other customers.
Tobacco,
for example,

689
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:18.640
tobacco first being produced in large quantities from 1617 in Virginia,

690
00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:21.130
the salvation of the colony,

691
00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:26.820
60,000 pounds of tobacco will being imported into London already by 1622 by 1638

692
00:48:28.631 --> 00:48:32.530
they were bringing in 2 million pounds of tobacco per annum.

693
00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:36.670
And from,
yes,
we're very ungrateful to tobacco.

694
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:39.780
It had a major role,
uh,

695
00:48:39.781 --> 00:48:44.440
and that was followed from the 1640s by another product about which were very

696
00:48:44.441 --> 00:48:49.441
ungrateful sugar being produced in the West indies and export it for refining in

697
00:48:51.071 --> 00:48:51.904
London.

698
00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:56.800
So then we have a panorama of economic expansion.

699
00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:03.090
Attempts to establish overall national income in this period are extremely

700
00:49:04.751 --> 00:49:05.584
dodgy,

701
00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:10.450
but a number of heroic economic historians have attempted to do it.

702
00:49:10.451 --> 00:49:14.110
And you'll find the estimates there.
In section eight of your table,

703
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:21.330
it seems likely that between the 50s sixties and the 1590s national income has

704
00:49:22.601 --> 00:49:27.601
risen by about 48% and it rose by a further 51% between the 50 nineties and 1640

705
00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:31.780
over the 80 years as a whole,

706
00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:36.670
something like 120% growth in national income.
In real terms,

707
00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.250
if they're right about that,

708
00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:44.440
and even if they're wrong by 20% it's still a lot if they right about that,

709
00:49:44.441 --> 00:49:48.810
it helps to account for the fact that population growth was sustained as along

710
00:49:48.850 --> 00:49:52.270
as it was and for the growing signs of prosperity,

711
00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:56.620
which one finds throughout this period.
And yet,

712
00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:59.470
despite those positive and optimistic signs,

713
00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:02.590
as you'll see in the final table,
table nine,

714
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:07.030
the prices of basic food stuffs was still rising,

715
00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:10.450
suggesting that despite increased output,

716
00:50:10.451 --> 00:50:14.620
there was a continued imbalance between population and food resources.

717
00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:20.970
The period also saw complaints of poverty and a Dick continuing decline in the

718
00:50:21.311 --> 00:50:25.060
purchasing power of wages,
the declining real wages,

719
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:30.270
which you'll find in the final column of that table on the right.

720
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:36.410
So having looked at the panorama of economic expansion,

721
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:41.770
what we have to do next time is to look at how this growing national wealth was

722
00:50:43.221 --> 00:50:48.221
actually distributed socially and how the trends of this period worked out in

723
00:50:49.641 --> 00:50:54.641
terms of the actual life chances of particular social groups.

724
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.900
And I'll do that on Thursday.
