1
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.460
Okay.
Well,
as you know,
in 15,
28,

2
00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:10.080
religious change had not been a significant issue in English politics.

3
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.300
By 1558,

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.140
it was in many ways the central issue.

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.370
And it was about to take another turn.
Uh,

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.770
on the 17th of November,
1558,

7
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.430
Elizabeth the first was proclaimed Queen Young Woman of 25,

8
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.970
highly intelligent what educated and long schooled in the necessity of caution,

9
00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.870
discretion and even dissimulation in order to survive the dangers that she had

10
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:45.990
faced.
She was of course,

11
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:50.070
an Berlin's daughter and as ambulance daughter,

12
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.100
it was in a sense her conception in December of 1532 that had finally

13
00:00:56.521 --> 00:01:00.000
precipitated the assertion of Henry the eighth royal supremacy.

14
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.540
So you could say in a sense that Elizabeth's whole identity and above all her

15
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:07.290
claims to the throne,

16
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.770
we're bound up with the rejection by her father of papal authority.

17
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.070
Not the precise nature of her personal beliefs remains uncertain.

18
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.370
Um,
she didn't really disclose them,

19
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.680
but unquestionably,

20
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.670
she identified herself with the Protestant cause.

21
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.870
Um,
shortly after her ex session that Christmas 1558,

22
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.260
she very ostentatiously walked out of mass in the Royal Chapel at the point at

23
00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:41.490
which the host was elevated.

24
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.510
A month later in January,

25
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.510
1559 she very ostentatiously embraced an English Bible which was offered to her

26
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:55.581
by the citizens of London on her state entry to London prior to her coronation.

27
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.180
So Elizabeth was making no secret of the fact that she inclined towards reform

28
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.980
as indeed everyone expected.
But if you inclined towards reform,

29
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.380
she was neither dogmatically,

30
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.410
north straight forwardly Protestant and the religious settlement of 1559 the

31
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:22.170
first business of her reign very much reflected that fact.

32
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.150
It was in part the product of theological convictions,

33
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.750
but it was also very much a settlement that reflected earlage his preference

34
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.100
that was tempered by sheer political expediency.

35
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.680
What actually happened remains rather cloudy.

36
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:46.020
Some aspects of the documentation are inadequate,

37
00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.990
but the most convincing interpretation of the settlement to my mind is that of a

38
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.950
Norman Jones.
In his view,

39
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.880
Elizabeth and her chief advisor,
William sessile,

40
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.750
intended initially to return to the situation of 1552 just before the death of

41
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:04.750
her brother Edward,
the sixth.

42
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.820
But they met severe opposition in parliament,

43
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.320
particularly in the House of Lords.

44
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.280
Opposition not only from the Catholic bishops who sat in the Lords,

45
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.300
but also from some of the leading lay members of the peerage.

46
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.320
And so they had to return to parliament with a distinctly watered down draft

47
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.260
prayer book,
setting out their desires for religious settlement.

48
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.330
So for example,

49
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.650
in 1559 in the prayer book they brought to parliament,

50
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.520
the communion service was in fact a blend of the prayer book of 1552 with its

51
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:44.860
very protestant,
uh,

52
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:48.850
statements regarding the communion service being essentially a service of

53
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:51.130
remembrance and Thanksgiving.

54
00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.330
They blended that with the earlier 1549 prayer book,

55
00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.460
which had allowed for the possibility that there was a real presence of Christ,

56
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:03.010
body and blood in the communion service.

57
00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.880
And so in 1559 the wording at the administration of the communion was it was as

58
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:14.290
follows,
it read the body of our Lord Jesus Christ,

59
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.350
which was given for the preserve thy body and soul unto everlasting life.

60
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.480
That's 1549 followed immediately by take and eat this in remembrance that Christ

61
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:32.221
died for the and feed on him in my heart by faith with thanksgiving,

62
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.370
that's 1552 they blended the two together so that you could read it as you

63
00:04:38.591 --> 00:04:39.400
chose.

64
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.290
It's been described by Dermot Mcculloch has a masterpiece of theological

65
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.680
engineering or fudging the issue.
You could say

66
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.870
again in 1559 the bill brought before parliament put forward the title for

67
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:58.330
Elizabeth,
not of Supreme Head of the Church of England,

68
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.570
but only of supreme governor that's often seen as being a more appropriate title

69
00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.630
for a woman governor rather than head.

70
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.550
But it also of course left open the possibility that the settlement might be

71
00:05:12.551 --> 00:05:13.384
accepted,

72
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.920
that the position of supreme governor might be accepted by people who regarded

73
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:21.640
the supreme head of the church as being elsewhere in Rome.

74
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.900
Even so,
despite these compromisers,

75
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:28.960
Elizabeth and her counselors were able to get their settlement through

76
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.720
parliament only by purging the House of Lords.

77
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.470
They ruthlessly excluded many of the Catholic bishops in the end,

78
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.260
and they still got a majority of only three votes.

79
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.540
They squeezed it through the House of Lords.

80
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:42.400
Supporting the Commons was much stronger.

81
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.840
So the Church of England was reestablished.

82
00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.770
England was Protestant.
Again,
sort of.

83
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.970
It was a confessional state bound by an act of uniformity that the prayer book

84
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:59.360
should be used throughout the kingdom.

85
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.970
Uniformity to the religion set down by the queen in parliament,

86
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.620
what was often described as the religion by law established,

87
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:16.420
but that religion was less imposed by simple royal diktat than a reflection of

88
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:21.710
what Elizabeth and her advisors had proved,
willing to settle for.

89
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.290
There was no doubt that England had turned in a pro broadly Protestant direction

90
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:28.124
again,

91
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.400
but there was also a lot of ambiguity about the nature and the extent of that

92
00:06:34.971 --> 00:06:38.480
Protestantism.
Okay,

93
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.070
well maybe Elizabeth and William sessile and the other counselors got less than

94
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:44.750
they originally intended,

95
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.030
but they accepted it and they could even use it to their advantage.

96
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.170
It was perhaps no bad thing in the England of 1559 that the religious settlement

97
00:06:57.171 --> 00:06:58.730
contained a lot of ambiguity.

98
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.700
30 years of religious flux had left the nation profound,
profound,

99
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:06.860
the divided in matters of faith.

100
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.550
No change during those 30 years had had time to put down deep roots to some

101
00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:16.310
historians like Christopher.
Hey,

102
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.120
most of the people remained in the main traditionalists in their religious

103
00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:26.300
beliefs,
uh,
to other historians like Robert Whiting.

104
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.480
People had grown almost indifferent,

105
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.530
acquiescing and conforming to change after change,

106
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.330
but essentially guarded and an UN enthusiastic in their attitudes.

107
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:41.780
But also,
as you've seen in last week's reading,

108
00:07:41.781 --> 00:07:45.260
there was a third reading of the situation represented by the work of

109
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:47.960
Christopher Marsh people.

110
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.640
We're now only too aware of the existence of alternatives in religion

111
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.420
alternatives,
which hadn't existed back in the 1520s.

112
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.540
Some of them Hank had after the old ways.

113
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:04.340
Some of them were drawn to the attractive features of the new doctrines.

114
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.360
But everyone knew the danger of religious conflict.

115
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:14.330
They'd witnessed enough of that under Mary as a result of marsh suggests they

116
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.930
held their piece and as you know,
he uses that term in a double sense.

117
00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.900
Negativity in the sense that they were compliant.

118
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.560
They remained silent before the demands of authority,

119
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:30.790
positively in the sense that they preserved the piece of their own communities

120
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.570
as best they could.

121
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.850
One could say that that was an attitude that had developed as a result of the

122
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:42.530
turmoil of the late 1540s and early 1550s in particular.

123
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.110
Um,
even under Mary,
uh,

124
00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.620
the mayor of Exeter in the West down here in Devin was a man who,

125
00:08:50.781 --> 00:08:55.470
although I'm a devout Catholic in his own practice,

126
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:01.190
regarded Protestant sympathizers among his neighbors with some discretion and

127
00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:01.800
tolerance.

128
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.800
It was said of him that he did friendly and lovingly bear with them and wink at

129
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.320
them.
He shut his eyes to their practice.

130
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.670
I one could say that Elizabeth was winking at people too.

131
00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.090
She winked to people in many ways.

132
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.440
She was the supreme governor of the Church of England.

133
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.600
She was the head of a confessional state.
But she also said early in her reign,

134
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.590
I will not make windows into men's souls.

135
00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:36.900
A striking metaphor.
I will not make windows into men's souls.

136
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.830
What she and her counselors wanted was order outward conformity,

137
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.980
stability,
and in pursuit of those objectives,

138
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:51.981
the ambiguities of 1559 were in many ways advantageous and they could be

139
00:09:52.141 --> 00:09:52.974
developed

140
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.500
soon after the passage of the settlement through parliament,
um,

141
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.590
a set of injunctions concerning worship are issued.

142
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:07.670
They permitted the images which had survived Protestant iconoclasm to remain in

143
00:10:08.881 --> 00:10:13.320
churches so long as they were not superstitiously abused.

144
00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:19.820
They said that in future communion tables were to be used for holy communion

145
00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:22.740
rather than alters.
But nonetheless,

146
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.490
the communion table could stand where the old ulta had stood.

147
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.180
I totally communion traditional wafers we used rather than common bread.

148
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:35.730
The women he concessions of this kind,

149
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.170
Elizabeth herself would have liked to have kept the rood screens above the

150
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.930
chancel with their crucifixes,
et cetera.

151
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.210
She kept a crucifix in her own Chapel,

152
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:49.530
but her more Protestant bishops really wouldn't stand for that.
And many routes,

153
00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:52.200
screens what graduate dismantled throughout the kingdom.

154
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.090
In the course of the 1560s

155
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.630
or again in dealing with the clergy,

156
00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:03.770
she faced in parliament bishops who put up such a stiff opposition that she was

157
00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.430
forced to deprive them.
She would have liked them to stay.

158
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.223
They didn't,

159
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.760
but new appointments to the episcopal bench where rarely religious extremists

160
00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:19.140
was significant that you chose as Archbishop of Canterbury,
Matthew Parker,

161
00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.250
a Cambridge academic who was a protestant certainly,

162
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.570
but two had not gone into exile and Mary,

163
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.630
he had conformed and kept his head down.

164
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:31.560
She considered Parker a more appropriate choice than some of them are radical

165
00:11:31.561 --> 00:11:33.720
Protestants that she could have selected

166
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:39.390
amongst the parish clergy to there was no mass purge.

167
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.130
Many of the clergy were allowed to keep their positions and even to get away

168
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:49.350
with formerly subscribing to the prayer book and the Act of uniformity,

169
00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:52.850
but continuing many traditional practices on hindered

170
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:55.870
the toleration,

171
00:11:55.871 --> 00:12:00.250
which was extended to traditional practices,

172
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:05.350
allowed them to preserve in many ways the appearance of tradition in the way

173
00:12:05.351 --> 00:12:07.450
they conducted services in their parishes.

174
00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:09.640
Christopher Haigh has a nice phrase for it.
He says,

175
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.150
many of these people were liturgical hermaphrodites.

176
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.680
They use the prayer book,
but they could tweak it their own way.

177
00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.403
Again,

178
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.340
fines were laid down for people who fail to attend the Church of England at

179
00:12:24.341 --> 00:12:27.400
least once a month,
but they were set very low.

180
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:32.530
The fine was 12 pence a month.
If you fail to attend Church of England services,

181
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.310
which was about the equivalent of a day's wages for a London labor.

182
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:40.900
Not a steep fine at all.
So what did it all mean?

183
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.030
Clearly that is a birth was no catholic,

184
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.880
but she refused to persecute.

185
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.030
And equally she refused to countenance any further reform.

186
00:12:56.260 --> 00:13:00.100
She seems to have learned a lesson in 1559 about the art of the possible and she

187
00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:02.770
stuck to it.
And that came up very clearly,

188
00:13:02.771 --> 00:13:07.771
just a few years later in 1563 when it's a meeting of the convocation of the

189
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.290
Church of England,
the assembly of the clergy of the Church of England,

190
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.580
there occurred what's known as the Vestey area and controversy.
Uh,

191
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.720
some of the more radical Protestants in convocation wanted to get rid of

192
00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:23.200
traditional vestments worn by the priest during services.

193
00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.910
They described them as the rags of Rome.
These however,

194
00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:32.911
had been retained in the prayer book of 1559 and Elizabeth insisted upon

195
00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:39.180
retaining traditional clerical dress and forced Archbishop Parker to demand it

196
00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:41.920
of the clergy.

197
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:48.430
So what was England religion in the fifties and sixties?
Ultimately,

198
00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:51.220
one could say it was the queen's religion.

199
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:56.560
With regard to the pope's authority,
it was emphatically schismatic.

200
00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.040
Papal Authority had been abrogated once again,

201
00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.260
with regard to essential doctrines,
it was essentially Protestant,

202
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:07.240
but nonetheless,

203
00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:12.390
it retained a latitude to make of the settlement to read the prayer book as you

204
00:14:13.031 --> 00:14:16.780
chose,
provided you conformed.
In general,

205
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.720
the only element of settlement one could say which was totally without ambiguity

206
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:26.020
was the act of uniformity,
conform

207
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:32.200
and hold your peace.
Well,

208
00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.250
in an age of religious partisanship,

209
00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.010
in what was already becoming in Europe and age of religious war,

210
00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.620
that was not really a bad deal,

211
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.850
but of course it couldn't stand there.

212
00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.260
Whatever the ambiguity's of the settlement,
first of all,

213
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.320
no one could really doubt that it was basically Protestant in orientation and

214
00:14:56.361 --> 00:14:57.194
secondly,

215
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.550
no one yet knew that Elizabeth would live to be 70

216
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.180
and those two facts shape the attitudes of both committed Catholics and the more

217
00:15:08.181 --> 00:15:09.350
committed protestants.

218
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:13.610
And by 1560 of course there were plenty of both.

219
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:20.030
Both groups of zealots were preoccupied with what might happen next.

220
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.040
Would that be another turn of the wheel?

221
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:27.190
What Elizabeth survive on both sides were determined to do what they could to

222
00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:29.570
shape events to their own advantage.

223
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.590
If such a possibility of future change emerged.

224
00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:39.420
So let's look at the two groups who opposed in different ways the Elizabethan

225
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.100
settlement and how their challenges were met.

226
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.620
We can start by looking at the Catholics.

227
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.940
Christopher Haigh argues persuasively.

228
00:15:50.941 --> 00:15:55.350
I think that there was a great deal of what he calls traditionalist survivalism

229
00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:57.720
to a considerable degree.

230
00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.800
The idea there's a booth and church was attempting to accommodate that

231
00:16:01.801 --> 00:16:05.160
traditionalism amongst the population as a whole,

232
00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.310
but the more committed,

233
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.120
more theologically aware and more politically aware,

234
00:16:12.121 --> 00:16:17.121
Catholics knew that this was a recipe for the gradual erosion of Catholic

235
00:16:19.291 --> 00:16:20.124
principle.

236
00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:25.980
There were a lot of people who were described at the time as church papists in

237
00:16:25.981 --> 00:16:30.360
the fifties and sixties people whose bodies were in the Church of England,

238
00:16:30.361 --> 00:16:34.800
as it were,
but whose hearts remained with the old religion,

239
00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:41.420
such people would gradually become hopelessly compromised over time unless

240
00:16:42.991 --> 00:16:47.340
something was done to stiffen their resistance to a gradual slide into

241
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.430
conformity and acceptance of the new ways

242
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.040
I did the eyes of those who feared this.
There was,
after all,

243
00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:02.050
every possibility that the settlement of 1559 would not endure any longer than

244
00:17:02.051 --> 00:17:02.890
other changes.

245
00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:09.120
It all hung on the life of one young woman and in 1562 Elizabeth contracted

246
00:17:10.391 --> 00:17:12.490
smallpox and almost died.

247
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.740
Her counselors were in a panic as she lay on her sick bed.
She recovered,

248
00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.940
but it was a warning of what could happen.
We have to remember this,

249
00:17:21.941 --> 00:17:26.670
this vital element of uncertainty.
Whenever we look at the Elizabeth,

250
00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:29.590
Elizabeth,
and church and indeed it other aspects of her reign.

251
00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:37.200
So you get in these years the gradual emergence of what might be called a kind

252
00:17:37.201 --> 00:17:40.470
of shadow church or a church in exile,

253
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:45.560
waiting for the possibility of a return to the old ways and the years 1568 to

254
00:17:47.941 --> 00:17:52.941
1570 to be in many ways a turning point for these Catholics.

255
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.710
In 1568,
William Allen,
uh,

256
00:17:56.740 --> 00:18:01.740
a former Oxford don who had fled to the continent founder the college or do a in

257
00:18:02.261 --> 00:18:07.261
the Netherlands for the purpose of training priests who would be smuggled back

258
00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:12.381
into England and who could operate in secrecy to stiffen the faith of English

259
00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.610
Catholics
in the same year.
In May of 1568,

260
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.270
Mary Stewart,
the Queen of Scotland,
a Catholic,

261
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.650
was deposed by her own subjects and fled into England.
They asked,

262
00:18:26.651 --> 00:18:30.900
she was kept under house arrest by Elizabeth,
but while she remained,

263
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:36.060
she was clearly a claimant to the English throne within reach of those who are

264
00:18:36.061 --> 00:18:38.340
posting Elizabeth,
but she was Elizabeth's nearest relative,

265
00:18:38.341 --> 00:18:43.110
a cousin and a Catholic.
I'll say more about Mary Queen of Scots next time,

266
00:18:43.111 --> 00:18:46.440
but her presence is a constant factor in the equation.

267
00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:53.420
In 1567 to 68 almost simultaneously came the outbreak of the Dutch revolt revolt

268
00:18:56.221 --> 00:18:57.780
of the provinces of the Netherlands,

269
00:18:57.781 --> 00:19:02.190
just across the narrow see against Spanish rule,

270
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:07.200
which led to the establishment in the Netherlands have a powerful Spanish army

271
00:19:07.201 --> 00:19:10.950
to put down that revolt sent by King Phillip the second of Spain,

272
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:13.440
the champion of the counter reformation in Europe.

273
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.580
It's arrival was followed by a massive repression of Protestants in the

274
00:19:17.581 --> 00:19:21.450
Netherlands and the flight of many of them to England.

275
00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:29.510
And in the following year in 1569 came the revolt of the northern Earl's

276
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:36.740
that began with a plot to release Mary Queen of Scots from captivity to marry

277
00:19:37.831 --> 00:19:40.590
her to the Duke of Norfolk,
who was a crypto Catholic,

278
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.460
to restore her to the Scottish thrown with the help of the Spanish army,

279
00:19:44.461 --> 00:19:46.920
which was just over the seas in the Netherlands.

280
00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:52.850
And to depose Elizabeth when the scheme was discovered by Elizabeth's

281
00:19:52.951 --> 00:19:57.180
intelligence service,
the olds of Northumberland and of Westmoreland,

282
00:19:57.181 --> 00:20:00.330
the two dominant nobles of the North Rose and rebellion.

283
00:20:00.331 --> 00:20:04.560
They raised about 5,000 men.
They captured the city of Durham.

284
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:07.740
They restored the mass in Durham Cathedral.

285
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.810
They moved gradually south.

286
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.540
The government responded to the rising by securing Mary and moving her south out

287
00:20:15.541 --> 00:20:16.374
of their reach.

288
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:21.630
She was placed under the tutelage of the Earl of Shrosbree down in the Midlands.

289
00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.620
The northern Earl's fail to move swiftly.

290
00:20:25.621 --> 00:20:28.320
They got bogged down besieging a castle near Durham,

291
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:31.650
which was held by the loyal Bose family for Elizabeth,

292
00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.580
and eventually realizing that their support was eroding.

293
00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.670
They gave up and fled into Scotland.

294
00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.820
There then followed up two years of diplomatic and military bullying before.

295
00:20:44.791 --> 00:20:48.550
Eventually the Earl of Northumberland was surrendered back to the English and

296
00:20:48.551 --> 00:20:51.100
was executed by then.

297
00:20:51.101 --> 00:20:54.130
The rebellion was long over by December,

298
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:56.320
1569 it had proved to be a fiasco and it fizzled out,

299
00:20:56.950 --> 00:21:01.930
but in February 15th 70 rather too late,
the pope having heard of it,

300
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.460
offered his support.

301
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:09.750
He excommunicated Elizabeth and he absorbed her subjects from their obedience to

302
00:21:10.721 --> 00:21:15.550
the Queen.
He was telling her Catholic subjects,
in other words,

303
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.930
that rebellion against this heritage queen was no sin,

304
00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:23.620
a little too late,
but nonetheless at last,

305
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:27.880
a clarifying decision on the part of the papacy.
With regard to Elizabeth,

306
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.593
<v 1>the</v>

307
00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:33.150
<v 0>for,</v>

308
00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:38.150
for the Catholic subjects of the Queen in 1568 to 71 could say the moment of

309
00:21:40.481 --> 00:21:41.860
truth had at last come.

310
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.270
At last they had been principled resistance to the Elizabeth and settlement.

311
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.670
At last,
there had been a lead from the papacy,

312
00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:54.340
but in a sense it was also a disaster for the average traditionalist in
religion.

313
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.310
Now,
they were in a position where they had to choose,

314
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.240
they had to make a stand like it or not.

315
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:06.190
Geopolitical realities increasingly demanded it and for many of them that was an

316
00:22:06.191 --> 00:22:08.140
absolutely agonizing situation

317
00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.530
and they didn't.
He has had followed in many ways.

318
00:22:12.531 --> 00:22:17.531
It got worse from the 15 from the mid 1570s missionary priests trained in the

319
00:22:20.211 --> 00:22:24.980
Netherlands,
began arriving to stiffen the faith of the Catholic faithful.

320
00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:30.380
There was something like 60 who arrived in the course of a later 1570s between

321
00:22:30.381 --> 00:22:35.381
then and the end of the reign in 1,603 something like 500 Catholic priests were

322
00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:40.900
smuggled into England to operate in secret from the 1580s they were joined by

323
00:22:41.361 --> 00:22:42.980
another group,
the Jesuits,

324
00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:48.610
the shock troops of the Catholic counter reformation in Europe who joined in the

325
00:22:49.191 --> 00:22:50.570
mission to England.

326
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.770
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

327
00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.130
<v 0>Now,
of course from their perspective,
these were heroic people</v>

328
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:03.020
and yet they were fatally compromised by their association with a Foreign Power

329
00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:04.253
Spain,

330
00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:09.840
and they were inevitably associated with the dynamics of religious conflict in

331
00:23:09.841 --> 00:23:10.590
Europe,

332
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:14.520
not least because some of the leaders of the Catholic mission subscribe to the

333
00:23:14.521 --> 00:23:19.521
view that it was no sin to depose or even murder a heretical Monique

334
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.550
and so began a series of plots which were uncovered throughout the middle and

335
00:23:26.550 --> 00:23:31.550
later years of Elizabeth's reign in 1571 the Ridalfi plot to depose Elizabeth

336
00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.410
Place Mary Queen of Scots on the throne,

337
00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:39.650
Mary her to the Duke of Norfolk that ended in 1572 with the execution of Norfolk

338
00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:46.250
in 1572 the news came from France of the Saint Bartholomew's massacre of

339
00:23:46.281 --> 00:23:47.630
Protestants in Paris.

340
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.340
This seemed a demonstration of a broad of the risk of catholic treachery.

341
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:58.570
In 1583 the Throckmorton plot to murder Elizabeth was uncovered a year later in

342
00:23:59.691 --> 00:24:03.920
1584 the leader of the Dutch Protestants,
William the silent,

343
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:09.160
was murdered in the Netherlands in 50 and 86 the Babington plot to depose

344
00:24:10.911 --> 00:24:14.870
Elizabeth and elevate Mary Queen of Scots to the throne was uncovered.

345
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:21.760
The atmosphere then was one of tremendous insecurity and the government's

346
00:24:21.771 --> 00:24:23.570
response was severe.

347
00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:29.860
In 1581 it was declared by parliament treason to be absolved from schism with

348
00:24:31.521 --> 00:24:36.521
Rome and to be reconciled to the Catholic church records and see fines for not

349
00:24:36.621 --> 00:24:36.981
attending.

350
00:24:36.981 --> 00:24:40.460
The Church of England were raised from one shillings a month to 20 pounds.

351
00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:45.080
That's a 400 fold increase in the size of requisites he finds.

352
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:51.430
In 1585 England was at last after long hesitation brought to declare open war

353
00:24:53.511 --> 00:24:56.840
with Spain and to send troops to the Netherlands to help stiff and the

354
00:24:56.841 --> 00:25:01.100
resistance of the Dutch Protestants.
And in the same year,

355
00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:06.050
parliament made it treason for any ordained priest of the Catholic Church.

356
00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:11.110
Even to enter England for a priest to be found on English soil was treason in

357
00:25:13.971 --> 00:25:16.190
1586 following the Babington plot,

358
00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:20.690
Mary Queen of Scots was at last brought to trial,
sentenced to death.

359
00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.820
And then after long hesitation on the part of Elizabeth finally beheaded in

360
00:25:25.821 --> 00:25:27.920
February,

361
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.250
1587 and then in 1588,

362
00:25:31.251 --> 00:25:36.251
the whole nation was mobilized to resist the threat of invasion by the Spanish

363
00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:41.801
armada great fleet sent by Philip the second intended to pick up troops in the

364
00:25:43.131 --> 00:25:47.820
Netherlands,
transport them across the narrow sees and attack London,
um,

365
00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:52.460
a plan which was eventually foiled only by the resistance,

366
00:25:52.461 --> 00:25:54.590
which was put up by the English fleet in the channel.

367
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.630
And then the scattering of Spanish ships as they sailed north and eventually

368
00:25:59.631 --> 00:26:02.840
around Scotland and Ireland to return to Spain.

369
00:26:02.841 --> 00:26:04.640
Many of them being lost on the way,

370
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:07.850
following the,

371
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:12.710
what was seen as the divine deliverance in the modern campaign.

372
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:16.580
The war dragged on right through to the end of Elizabeth's reign.

373
00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.180
Well in such a context,

374
00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:25.840
any priest who landed in England to do God's work amongst the Catholic faithful

375
00:26:25.881 --> 00:26:30.770
as they saw it,
we're inevitably regarded by the government as the traitor,

376
00:26:30.771 --> 00:26:32.330
his servants of a foreign power

377
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:39.310
between 50 and 81 and 1,603 131 catholic priests were arrested and executed

378
00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.880
together with 60 of the lay people who had hid them.

379
00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.850
All of them being executed as traitors.

380
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:51.780
These are those who are regarded in English Catholic tradition as the Catholic

381
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:52.614
martyr's

382
00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:59.160
and in a nation that was increasingly prone to regard itself as a big league at

383
00:26:59.161 --> 00:27:02.820
island,
threatened by mighty enemies.

384
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:08.670
Catholicism almost inevitably became tainted by its association with that

385
00:27:08.671 --> 00:27:13.140
threat.
Of course,
that was mistaken.

386
00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:18.600
Many of the Catholic nobility and Gentry went out of their way to stress their

387
00:27:18.601 --> 00:27:22.740
loyalty to Elizabeth that they would not support any foreign invasion.

388
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:23.461
They would indeed,

389
00:27:23.461 --> 00:27:28.230
sometimes openly declared themselves as sufficiently loyal to oppose it.

390
00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:30.240
They were well known.

391
00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.960
They will often trusted as individuals by their Protestant neighbors,

392
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.990
the fines levied upon them for their Catholic requisite.

393
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:42.230
We're often very selectively and intermittently and forced amongst the Catholic

394
00:27:43.051 --> 00:27:44.100
population as a whole.

395
00:27:44.101 --> 00:27:48.990
There was only a tiny number of zealots who were ever actively involved in

396
00:27:48.991 --> 00:27:52.350
treasonable plots,
especially against the queen's life.

397
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:54.180
Nevertheless,

398
00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:59.420
be that as it may in the situation after 1570 and especially after the outbreak

399
00:27:59.701 --> 00:28:04.701
of war in 1585 the catholic community as an entity lay under the shadow of

400
00:28:06.451 --> 00:28:11.451
distrust and it was subject to a developing prejudice which would take centuries

401
00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.590
to dispel.
As Patrick Collinson has written,

402
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.980
Anti Catholicism became almost a sheet anchor of English nationhood and the

403
00:28:23.731 --> 00:28:28.320
Catholic community within England became in a sense aliens within their own

404
00:28:28.321 --> 00:28:29.154
land.

405
00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.220
<v 1>Okay.</v>

406
00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.920
<v 0>What about the other threat?
The Radical Protestants,</v>

407
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:41.090
those who we think of now as puritans,

408
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.850
that that was not a term they used initially.

409
00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:46.610
It was a term of insult that was sometimes thrown at them.

410
00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:51.240
They were described usually at the time as the hotter sort of Protestants,

411
00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.670
the hottest sort of Protestants

412
00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:56.413
<v 1>to them.</v>

413
00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:02.050
<v 0>The accession of Elizabeth in 1558 had been a providential deliverance,</v>

414
00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:05.440
a divine intervention in English affairs.

415
00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:09.760
November the 17th the queen's accessing day was celebrated with the ringing of

416
00:29:09.761 --> 00:29:12.940
bells.
It became almost like a Protestant holy day,

417
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:17.700
but though they regarded the church of England,

418
00:29:17.701 --> 00:29:22.380
which he established a year later in 1559 as undoubtedly a true church,

419
00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:26.640
it seemed to these Protestant radicals that it was a church which was only half

420
00:29:26.641 --> 00:29:30.780
reformed
and they too were worried about what happened,

421
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.250
what might happen next.

422
00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.270
They could have no certainty that it would last.

423
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:42.230
They were anxious to push ahead to consolidate the position to move version the

424
00:29:42.671 --> 00:29:45.430
to what they described as further reformation

425
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:52.260
especially they wanted reformation of some of the traditional structures of the

426
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.290
Church of England and the removal of some of the more traditional aspects of its

427
00:29:56.291 --> 00:29:57.520
forms of worship.

428
00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.930
They wanted to get rid of the rags of Rome or the dregs of popery.

429
00:30:01.931 --> 00:30:04.120
This is the sort of language they used.

430
00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.470
So there was from the beginning,

431
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:13.530
an element of dissidence even amongst those who could be regarded as Elizabeth,

432
00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.430
most enthusiasts supporters.

433
00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.980
And that was especially true amongst the younger clergy who were emerging from

434
00:30:20.981 --> 00:30:24.670
the universities now thoroughly trained in Protestant doctrine.

435
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.490
And who we're becoming,
if anything,

436
00:30:27.491 --> 00:30:31.600
more emphatically Protestant even than those who would lead the church.

437
00:30:31.601 --> 00:30:33.430
In the later years of Edward,
the sixth

438
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:39.670
this younger generation,
we're moving beyond the doctrinal position,

439
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:44.260
which had been established by Archbishop Cranmer in the early 1550s and was

440
00:30:44.261 --> 00:30:47.560
enshrined in the prayer book.
Increasingly,

441
00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:50.080
they felt the influence of John Calvin,

442
00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.850
the Great Protestant leader of Geneva and his successor there.

443
00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:59.500
They had all Beazer
in terms of the doctrine of salvation.

444
00:30:59.501 --> 00:31:03.250
They increasingly adopted the doctrine of predestination,

445
00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.140
championed by Calvin.

446
00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:11.280
The notion that only an elect minority would find salvation.

447
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:17.200
Many also adopted the doctrine of double predestination,
champion by basin,

448
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:23.070
the view that God had decreed from the beginning of the world who would be elect

449
00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.350
and who would be damned.
This kind of belief,

450
00:31:28.351 --> 00:31:33.150
bread amongst them are very anxious.
Spirituality at the individual level.

451
00:31:33.151 --> 00:31:36.990
They were deeply anxious about their own spiritual state.

452
00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:40.230
Were they or were they not amongst the elect?

453
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:46.070
They tended to indulge an intense spiritual self searching rigorous attempts to

454
00:31:47.131 --> 00:31:51.870
sanctify their personal lives in a way that would give them a sense of assurance

455
00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:53.070
of their own election.

456
00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.110
It was also a kind of theological position,
which bread,

457
00:31:58.111 --> 00:32:01.410
what's been described as a PI board mentality.

458
00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:07.290
They saw things in very black and white terms,
a piebald mentality.

459
00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:12.650
The godly saw themselves as a beleaguered minority in a world that was dominated

460
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.720
by the reprobate,
the unregenerate.

461
00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:19.440
They tended to describe themselves as the little flock,

462
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.450
a godly remnant.

463
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:24.703
<v 1>Okay.</v>

464
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:28.440
<v 0>And that in turn seems to have bread amongst them.</v>

465
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.930
I kind of activist mentality.

466
00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:36.060
There was a duty to demonstrate their own godliness by standing up for the honor

467
00:32:36.061 --> 00:32:40.040
of God,
by doing his work in the world by truth,

468
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.610
by combating sin,
an error,
a form of activism,

469
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:45.800
which in a sense could give them greater assurance.

470
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:52.640
For the most part,
they did that work in relative obscurity.

471
00:32:52.641 --> 00:32:54.650
Down in the many parishes of the kingdom.

472
00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:58.250
Puritans were amongst the most zealous preachers.

473
00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:01.940
They were often chosen as lecturers,

474
00:33:01.941 --> 00:33:06.941
people who would be hired by local authorities to preach extra sermons on market

475
00:33:07.551 --> 00:33:09.380
days,
for example,
or on the weekdays.

476
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:13.850
In some areas,
they were numerous enough.

477
00:33:13.851 --> 00:33:18.851
By the 1572 found regular meetings of sympathizers,

478
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.850
which were known as prophesied rings.
Uh,

479
00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.090
these were meetings of the local clergy who would get together to hear a sermon,

480
00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:30.260
a two debate its doctrine.
They often open these meetings.

481
00:33:30.261 --> 00:33:31.490
The members of the Laity.

482
00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.010
It was thought to be an excellent method of improving clerical knowledge,
uh,

483
00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:40.250
of passing on theological knowledge to the Godly Laity.
Uh,

484
00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:43.520
and uh,
in,
in areas of some areas of the country.

485
00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:47.720
They were extremely influential in influencing the whole tone of local religious

486
00:33:47.721 --> 00:33:51.440
life.
Um,
east Anglia was a great area of Puritan strength.

487
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:54.680
There were eight of these prophesizing meetings and the county of Suffolk in the

488
00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:59.030
middle of East Anglia and in the county of Essex just to the south.

489
00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:03.320
There were six of them operating by the early 15,
seventies.

490
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:06.980
But after 15,
70,

491
00:34:06.981 --> 00:34:11.000
puritanism also began to acquire something of a political edge

492
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.800
specifically that came in the form of a movement to try to formally alter the

493
00:34:18.771 --> 00:34:23.150
structures of the Church of England and to purge the prayer book of what they

494
00:34:23.151 --> 00:34:26.480
saw as traditional papist survivals.

495
00:34:26.930 --> 00:34:28.370
Those who became involved in it.

496
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:33.640
We're convinced that the new testament laid down a clear model of church

497
00:34:33.681 --> 00:34:37.010
government,
that it did not involve bishops,

498
00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:41.660
that it should be based upon autonomous congregations who elected their own

499
00:34:41.661 --> 00:34:46.661
ministers and elders who would in turn meet together at a higher level in

500
00:34:46.821 --> 00:34:51.020
counsels and synods to govern the church as a whole.
In other words,

501
00:34:51.021 --> 00:34:53.960
a Presbyterian system of church government.

502
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:59.180
This is what they desired and advocates of such a system.

503
00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.250
What amount of series of challenges to the Elizabethan settlement between 1517

504
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:09.520
and 1587 and there were a number of landmarks in that process.

505
00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:15.800
In 1570 for example,
the professor of divinity at the University of Cambridge,

506
00:35:15.830 --> 00:35:20.830
Thomas Cartwright gave a series of lectures in the university in which he argued

507
00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:25.160
that the English church failed to follow the model of the New Testament and

508
00:35:25.161 --> 00:35:27.320
advocated a Presbyterian system.

509
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:31.130
There was a tremendous controversy in the university.
As a result,

510
00:35:31.131 --> 00:35:33.200
Cartwright in fact lost his job.

511
00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:38.100
He was quickly picked up by one of Elizabeth's,
the out of Lester,

512
00:35:38.101 --> 00:35:41.670
who sympathized with the puritans and placed in a living elsewhere.

513
00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:44.550
So he survived.
But he lost his position at the university

514
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:48.690
in 1571 in parliament,

515
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.960
one member William Strickland introduced a bill to revise the Preble can purge

516
00:35:54.241 --> 00:35:59.010
it.
Members of the council sitting in Parliament,

517
00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:01.680
um,
oppose this move.

518
00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:06.510
He was cold before the Royal Privy Council and warned not to trespass on the

519
00:36:06.511 --> 00:36:08.670
queen's prerogative in matters of religion.

520
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:15.440
But a year later when parliament met again John Field and Thomas Wilcox to

521
00:36:15.691 --> 00:36:20.691
leading puritans published the admonition to parliament and outspoken attack

522
00:36:21.511 --> 00:36:25.890
upon the structure of the Church of England as not being a truly reformed
church,

523
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:29.730
calling them in parliament to take steps to further reform it.

524
00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:31.321
Indeed,

525
00:36:31.321 --> 00:36:34.710
it was so extreme and some of its statements that had greatly scandalized a

526
00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.370
moderates amongst Protestants.
And there was no,
um,

527
00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:40.110
successful action in parliament.

528
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:45.960
In 1576 they came a further attempt to discuss the church in parliament.

529
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:47.011
And on that occasion,

530
00:36:47.011 --> 00:36:52.011
Elizabeth had to intervene personally to ban discussion of religion in

531
00:36:52.171 --> 00:36:53.004
parliament.

532
00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:58.170
The Queen also became convinced in that year that the prophesizing meetings

533
00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:02.280
where a destabilizing influence on the church in the localities.

534
00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:05.760
She ordered Archbishop Grindle to put a stop to them.

535
00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:11.220
The archbishop protested.
He thought they were doing good work.

536
00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:16.530
They were beneficial to the clergy.
As a result of the queen simply suspended.

537
00:37:16.531 --> 00:37:20.880
Him and the Archbishop of Canterbury himself was suspended from exercising his

538
00:37:20.881 --> 00:37:25.380
duties from 1577 through to his death in 1583

539
00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.520
well,
at that point,

540
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.480
grindle's death in 1583 it could be said in a sense to symbolize the passing

541
00:37:37.831 --> 00:37:40.590
away of the first generation of Elizabethan bishops.

542
00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:46.680
Many of them people who have sympathized with the desire for further reformation

543
00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:50.250
within the church.
Men who had been willing to serve,

544
00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:55.110
willing to bear with the Elizabeth and compromise for the time being but in

545
00:37:55.111 --> 00:37:57.960
their hearts would have liked to have seen more.

546
00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.680
The phrase that was often used for people like that was that they were willing

547
00:38:01.681 --> 00:38:03.540
to Terry for the magistrate.

548
00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:08.580
They were willing to wait until such time as the queen was willing to move

549
00:38:08.581 --> 00:38:10.470
further in a Protestant direction

550
00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:17.640
and they were gradually being replaced by people of a different stamp and the

551
00:38:17.641 --> 00:38:22.620
most significant of the new bishops to emerge was the new archbishop of

552
00:38:22.621 --> 00:38:24.780
Canterbury.
John Wick gift

553
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:29.880
with gift was a very different kind of man from Grindle.

554
00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:33.000
He was a Calvinist in his doctrine.

555
00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:37.420
No products could ask for more in terms of his theological position,

556
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:43.510
but he was also a man who had grown up with the Elizabethan settlement and two

557
00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:46.810
was deeply committed to the settlement in itself.

558
00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:53.340
In addition to which she was a firm disciplinarian and in 1583 as a means of

559
00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.740
preventing further action on the part of puritans with gift introduced what was

560
00:38:59.741 --> 00:39:04.540
known as the three articles to which each of the clergy was required to

561
00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:05.374
subscribe.

562
00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:10.120
They included recognition of the royal supremacy,

563
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:15.460
recognition of the 39 articles of religion laying down the doctrine of the

564
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:20.460
Church of England and taking an oath that there was nothing in the prayer book

565
00:39:20.501 --> 00:39:22.450
which was contrary to the word of God.

566
00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:29.350
He proceeded to use the church courts in particularly has his own court of high

567
00:39:29.351 --> 00:39:34.351
commission to examine suspected dissidents within the church under oath and to

568
00:39:34.901 --> 00:39:36.490
administer the three articles.

569
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:40.240
He was in fact prevented by members of Elizabeth's council,

570
00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:44.170
sympathetic to the puritan cause from taking this policy as far as he would've

571
00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:45.490
liked.
Nonetheless,

572
00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:50.500
it was a clear statement of his unwillingness to tolerate dissidents from

573
00:39:50.501 --> 00:39:54.400
radical Protestants.
Well,

574
00:39:54.401 --> 00:39:59.401
the advent of wit gift perhaps provoked what turned out to be the Presbyterian

575
00:40:01.601 --> 00:40:06.460
or puritans final throw.
Some of the prophesies meetings,

576
00:40:06.461 --> 00:40:10.240
which are now forbidden,
simply went underground in some areas.

577
00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:12.910
They developed into what's known as the classes movement,

578
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:17.200
secret meetings of the clergy who were practicing a kind of underground

579
00:40:17.201 --> 00:40:20.080
Presbyterianism John Field,

580
00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:24.460
one of the authors of the admonition to parliament in 1572 built up quite an

581
00:40:24.461 --> 00:40:29.140
extensive network of Presbyterian sympathizers amongst the clergy and the Laity

582
00:40:29.141 --> 00:40:30.010
throughout the kingdom.

583
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:36.630
And that network was activated in 1580 450 and 86 to try to introduce further

584
00:40:37.091 --> 00:40:41.560
bills into parliament calling for a Presbyterian system system.

585
00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:43.600
And the revision of the prayer book.

586
00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:49.450
These attempts were against scotched by royal counselors sitting in parliament

587
00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.690
in 1586 for example,

588
00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:57.960
parliament itself sent both the promoter of the bill and those who defended it

589
00:40:58.131 --> 00:41:01.690
in parliament to the tower of London briefly to cool their heels.

590
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.260
The Presbyterians had failed again,

591
00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:11.520
but the aspiration and the frustration that they felt it was vividly expressed

592
00:41:11.681 --> 00:41:16.681
in 1550 and 88 to nine in the secret publication of a number of extremely

593
00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:20.740
scurrilous attacks upon the bishops of the Church of England.

594
00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.590
These were known as the Mar prelate tracts.

595
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:28.240
They were directed against bishops prelates,
the Mar prelate tracts.

596
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:33.710
The Archbishop of Canterbury instigated an investigation to discover secret

597
00:41:33.711 --> 00:41:35.060
press that was producing them,

598
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:39.980
and in the course of that John Fields pure network was uncovered and the

599
00:41:39.981 --> 00:41:44.960
movement was essentially smashed.
Meanwhile,

600
00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:50.600
as the 1580s drew to a close,
some of the leaders of puritanism,
we're dying away.

601
00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:55.900
John Field died in 1588 some are for sympathizers in the Royal Council.

602
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:58.580
Did you have Leicester?
So Francis Walsingham.

603
00:41:58.581 --> 00:42:03.230
So Walter Mildmay all died in 1589 or 50 90

604
00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:09.990
puritanism as a political movement was over for the time being,

605
00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:16.840
but it left three legacies.
First of all,

606
00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.500
there were small groups of puritan extreme as to was so disillusioned that they

607
00:42:22.501 --> 00:42:27.240
broke from the church of England altogether formed separatist congregations

608
00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.530
meeting in secret.

609
00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:32.880
One of their leaders said that they had decided they would have reformation

610
00:42:32.881 --> 00:42:36.930
without tarrying for any,
they wouldn't Terry for the magistrate,

611
00:42:36.931 --> 00:42:40.350
they would have reformation without tarrying for any,

612
00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.890
some of them would eventually forced to flee abroad.
Uh,

613
00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:49.440
the group led by Robert Brown based in the city of knowledge removed themselves

614
00:42:49.441 --> 00:42:52.020
to the Netherlands to escape potential persecution.

615
00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:55.260
Another group led by Henry Barrow in London,

616
00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:59.190
went underground and some of them eventually also emigrated to the Netherlands

617
00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:03.030
where they enjoyed religious freedom in the Protestant areas of the Netherlands.

618
00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:07.500
Henry Barrow returning to England at one point was arrested and was eventually

619
00:43:07.501 --> 00:43:11.430
hanged for sedition was from long studies,

620
00:43:11.431 --> 00:43:15.030
groups of radical separate as to a broken completely with the Church of England.

621
00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:19.800
That's some of the Mayflower pilgrims of 1620 what eventually to be drawn.

622
00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.730
So one legacy was separatism,

623
00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:30.010
a tiny minority who broke away completely.
Secondly,

624
00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:35.160
there was a much broader legacy of activist evangelism within the Church of

625
00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:36.663
England.

626
00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:41.350
Many puritans sympathizers felt that if they could not change the structures of

627
00:43:41.351 --> 00:43:42.220
the Church of England,

628
00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:47.580
then they could at least transform its spirit and thereby leave their own

629
00:43:48.341 --> 00:43:52.240
distinctive stamp on the nature of English Protestantism.

630
00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:56.380
They advocated a religion heavily based upon the Bible,

631
00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:02.680
advocating,
preaching,
practicing the sanctification of the sabbath,

632
00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:06.250
insisting upon strict moral behavior,

633
00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:10.180
pursuing moral reformation where they had the power and the opportunity,

634
00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:16.950
and they constantly drummed upon the theme of the failure of England to live up

635
00:44:17.471 --> 00:44:22.270
to the,
to show proper gratitude for God's deliverance of the kingdom,

636
00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:26.480
the need to turn to a more strict religious observation in,

637
00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:28.690
in return for God's favor.

638
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.690
So that was a second legacy.
Thirdly,

639
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.700
there was a legacy of a different kind.

640
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:41.460
Some of those who had defended Elizabeth and settlement from Puritan attacks

641
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:46.790
began to develop an altogether more positive view of the Elizabethan settlement.

642
00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:51.690
They began to see it not just as a temporary compromise,

643
00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:56.220
but as a distinctive and valid alternative,

644
00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:01.940
a distinctive middle way between Catholicism on the one hand and radical

645
00:45:02.611 --> 00:45:04.200
Protestantism on the other

646
00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:11.410
Clo gins like Richard Hooker and Richard Bancroft saw the retention of a

647
00:45:12.361 --> 00:45:16.410
traditionalist structure in the Church of England does not simply a matter of

648
00:45:16.411 --> 00:45:19.350
convenience or political expediency,

649
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:23.160
but as a valid Protestant alternative.

650
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:25.320
Indeed in Bancroft's view,

651
00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:30.450
a divinely ordained form of church government in which England maintain the

652
00:45:30.451 --> 00:45:34.350
tradition which descended from Christ's apostles,

653
00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:39.980
purified of the corruptions which had crept in and the Catholic Middle Ages.

654
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:45.540
So a new one more positive notion of Anglicanism as a middle way was also

655
00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.890
emerging amongst the defenders of the church.
Dammit.
Mcculloch has said of this,

656
00:45:49.891 --> 00:45:54.891
that perhaps the Anglican gift to the Christian story is the ability to make a

657
00:45:55.081 --> 00:45:56.910
virtue of necessity.

658
00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:06.350
But what finally about those who were neither Catholics nor radical puritans?

659
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:12.950
No Anglican divine's the mass of the people down in the parishes.

660
00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.860
It's been said that for most of them,

661
00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.530
the reformation under Elizabeth was essentially a series of conforming

662
00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:23.640
experiences,

663
00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:29.690
a slow shift from the visual and ritual and symbolic richness of late medieval

664
00:46:32.161 --> 00:46:34.200
religion to a somewhat plainer,

665
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:38.280
more verbal religion based on the English Bible,

666
00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:43.520
based on the prayer book of 1559 including such things as more frequent

667
00:46:43.951 --> 00:46:47.370
preaching,
psalm singing another novel practices.

668
00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:53.820
That process of gradual shift in religious culture was probably aided by the

669
00:46:53.821 --> 00:46:58.821
elements of continuity observable in Church of England services and gradually it

670
00:46:58.861 --> 00:46:59.730
did its work.

671
00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:05.160
The older generation of both the clergy and the Laity who could remember the old

672
00:47:05.161 --> 00:47:10.161
days had largely died away by the 15th eighties and increasing proportion of the

673
00:47:11.221 --> 00:47:14.910
population knew no other church than that of Elizabeth.

674
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:19.670
They faced no serious threat from the Catholic mission.

675
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:23.750
The Catholic missionary priests concentrated their attention on politically

676
00:47:23.751 --> 00:47:27.860
significant people.
Most of their work was done amongst the gentry.

677
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:33.010
There was no real mission to the common people and by 1,603 the church of

678
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:37.780
England had something like two and a half million communicants.

679
00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:43.710
While they were only some 8,000 to 9,000 known Catholic requisites.

680
00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:49.480
Most of the members of the gentry or their immediate tenants sheltered under

681
00:47:49.481 --> 00:47:52.150
their protection.
To this extent,

682
00:47:52.151 --> 00:47:54.880
one could say that the Catholic trek was actually diminished.

683
00:47:57.070 --> 00:47:57.903
Meanwhile,

684
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:02.650
the Anglican clergy were gradually adapting to their role as pastors and

685
00:48:02.651 --> 00:48:04.750
teachers.
Initially,

686
00:48:04.751 --> 00:48:07.990
they'd been a severe shortage of preachers and have educated clergy,

687
00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:12.730
but steady work by the bishops steady work or deigning young men.

688
00:48:12.731 --> 00:48:16.930
And the university's meant that by the death of Elizabeth preaching was

689
00:48:16.931 --> 00:48:19.030
commonplace in most areas of the kingdom.

690
00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:22.150
The clergy were increasingly university graduates.

691
00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:24.610
That level of learning was improving

692
00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:31.660
the most severe and the more demanding of the clergy could be highly critical of

693
00:48:31.661 --> 00:48:33.610
the religious attitudes of the common people.

694
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:38.440
Some of them saw the common people as being perhaps d Catholicized,

695
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:41.800
perhaps hostile to papal authority,

696
00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:46.120
but scarcely protestantized in any deep and meaningful sense.

697
00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:50.710
But perhaps that's too harsh a judgment on people who've been nicely described

698
00:48:50.711 --> 00:48:55.210
as parish Anglicans or prayer book.
Anglicans,

699
00:48:55.750 --> 00:49:00.750
building up a loyalty to the form of religion with which they were familiar by

700
00:49:00.941 --> 00:49:05.170
the 50 nineties it's likely that they certainly thought of themselves as being

701
00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:08.530
members of the Protestant family as it were,

702
00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:13.660
even if their theological grasp on exactly what that meant was probably rather

703
00:49:13.661 --> 00:49:17.020
shaky.
At the same time,
of course,

704
00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:21.700
it remains the case that puritan saw the reformation has essentially unfinished

705
00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:24.040
amongst the population at large

706
00:49:25.780 --> 00:49:28.690
and there were a fair number of people who shared that perception that it

707
00:49:28.691 --> 00:49:33.691
remained unfinished for the audience of the Godly preachers was by 1603

708
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.570
significantly larger,
significantly more literate,

709
00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:46.140
significantly more likely to have a better knowledge of the Bible and of the

710
00:49:46.331 --> 00:49:51.331
prayer book significantly more likely to have read some of the English language

711
00:49:51.881 --> 00:49:55.870
religious publications in the Puritan tradition which were pouring from the

712
00:49:55.871 --> 00:50:00.610
pressers.
People are more deeply involved in a vernacular religious culture,

713
00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:06.730
much of it produced by puritans who had abandoned their political opposition,

714
00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:11.830
but who had emerged as the most active evangelicals,
the most earnest,

715
00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:16.890
the most godly counselors of the Protestant tradition in the parishes

716
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:20.103
at this level.

717
00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:24.640
The later reformation was perhaps mostly undramatic,

718
00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:29.150
except in the private drama of personal conversion.

719
00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:33.470
But if the situation of 1600 was one of relative calm,

720
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:38.270
it was also storing up the seeds of future drama.

721
00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:43.460
Protestantism was gradually working its way into popular culture.

722
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:47.780
The Puritan minority was extending its influence,

723
00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:49.460
not as a political movement,

724
00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:54.820
but as a widespread religious style hostility to what was described as popery

725
00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:01.720
was increasingly widespread and tensions remained regarding what the nature of

726
00:51:01.731 --> 00:51:06.320
English Protestantism should be.
And they would give rise,

727
00:51:06.321 --> 00:51:07.310
as we will see later,

728
00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:12.140
to what have been called England's wars of religion in the 17th century

729
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.730
disputes,

730
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:18.730
not between Catholics and Protestants that was perhaps largely settled by 1600

731
00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:25.660
but disputes between different conceptions of what it was to be a protestant.

732
00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:29.123
Okay.

733
00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:33.890
And next time I'll turn to other aspects of Elizabeth's reign,

734
00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:38.780
and in particular the modes of political participation and the Queens

735
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:41.180
relationship with our counselors.
