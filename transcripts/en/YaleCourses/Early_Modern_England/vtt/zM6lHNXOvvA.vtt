1
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.340
Right?

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.170
Well today is the fourth and final of the contextual lectures introducing 16th

3
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:08.010
century England.

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.430
Um,

5
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:09.780
we've looked at the social order,

6
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.150
we've looked at households,

7
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.141
institutions,

8
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:15.120
and relationships in local communities,

9
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.030
and now I want to look at the networks of connection,

10
00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:18.391
the tie,

11
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:19.470
the whole thing together,

12
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.840
joining up the dots as it were.

13
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.260
So it's a bit of historical geography or if you like it kind of guided tour of

14
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.800
16th century England,

15
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.700
uh,

16
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.290
a bit of historical tourism.

17
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.270
Well,

18
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.270
last time I stressed that local communities had a certain distinctive local

19
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:42.630
peculiarity or local particularity,

20
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.310
which was partly constructed out of their local customs and institutions,

21
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.510
but it was also something that was influenced by the different ways that they

22
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:54.600
will link together into the larger world.

23
00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.830
The myriad of tiny local communities in this period was on the one hand,

24
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:02.871
a,

25
00:01:02.871 --> 00:01:07.110
a kind of complex of places which were distinctive entities in their own rights.

26
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.210
But on the other hand,

27
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.240
they were also integral parts socially and politically of larger spaces.

28
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.680
And it's those larger spaces and the ties that bound them together that I'm most

29
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:23.490
concerned with today.

30
00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.190
Okay.

31
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.150
Well amongst the most significant of those larger spaces or what contemporary is

32
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:32.340
referred to as countries.

33
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.550
Uh,

34
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.070
they use that word not in the modern sense of a territorial state,

35
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.560
but to mean a distinctive area.

36
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.480
Uh,

37
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.551
uh,

38
00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:42.370
landscape,

39
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.631
uh,

40
00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:43.470
society,

41
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.430
uh,

42
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.680
in some respects a local culture.

43
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.390
Um,

44
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.410
these countries as they thought of them could be quite localized.

45
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.400
For example,

46
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.870
on the Scottish border TV at Dale or down in Gloucester should avail of Barkley.

47
00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:01.980
These were regarded as distinctive countries or they could use the term more

48
00:02:01.981 --> 00:02:02.521
broadly.

49
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:04.320
People talked about the north country.

50
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.620
They talked about the west country areas with less distinct boundaries.

51
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.490
When someone said in a letter or in a political speech or whatever that he was

52
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:17.221
referring to,

53
00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:18.660
the opinion of his country,

54
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.660
he was referring to such a local area.

55
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.730
Touch come trees are usually discussed by historians in terms of contrasting

56
00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:30.660
landscapes,

57
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.460
physical geography,

58
00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.100
and to certain extent economic activity.

59
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.810
Um,

60
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.590
if you look at map won the small relief map,

61
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.850
you'll find that agrarian England,

62
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.720
what's customarily divided up into,

63
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:49.560
um,

64
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.520
on the one hand,

65
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.100
the Highland zone of the north and the West,

66
00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:55.410
you have all the high land represented there.

67
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.570
The highlands zone on the other hand,

68
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.210
the Loland zone of the south and east.

69
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.290
That's one way of perceiving these broad distinctions,

70
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.610
uh,

71
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.800
that were noticed at the time.

72
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:09.730
And subsequently,

73
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:11.170
uh,

74
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.801
on the other hand,

75
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:15.790
people sometimes make distinctions between what they call the field and areas,

76
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:16.890
areas of practiced,

77
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.250
mixed agriculture,

78
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.050
mostly Loland and various pastoral zones,

79
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.820
practicing mainly,

80
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.750
uh,

81
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.950
animal husbandry.

82
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.050
And there could be a various types,

83
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.830
um,

84
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.010
there where the open hill pastures of the high land,

85
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.140
they were the woodland pastures.

86
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.770
Uh,

87
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.740
much of the west of England was still pretty densely wooded,

88
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.660
some parts of East Anglia as well.

89
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.030
And they practice the distinctive,

90
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.480
uh,

91
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.290
pastoral husbandry focusing on Darien.

92
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.550
Uh,

93
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.720
and then finally there were the pastoral,

94
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.560
uh,

95
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.690
practices of the fen lands,

96
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.130
the areas of eastern England,

97
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:55.630
which were waterlogged in winter.

98
00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.640
Uh,

99
00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.140
and where for the most part,

100
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.370
the inhabitance practice,

101
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:01.540
pastoral husbandry,

102
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.910
it's very distinctive area in this period,

103
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.360
uh,

104
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.040
flooded during the winter.

105
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.790
Um,

106
00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.990
the inhabitants regarded as having an extremely distinctive culture of their

107
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:11.410
own.

108
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.510
In fact to shreds of that continue,

109
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:14.680
it's often said that,

110
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:15.220
um,

111
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.020
people from the fence have webbed feet.

112
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.513
Um,

113
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.151
this is,

114
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:19.570
uh,

115
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.403
this is not true.

116
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.280
I had a roommate from the fence when I was a student and he definitely didn't

117
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:25.114
have webbed feet.

118
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.110
Um,

119
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.190
though he was a good swimming.

120
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:29.380
Well,

121
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.470
this kind of distinction in the physical geography,

122
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.950
um,

123
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:33.371
can,

124
00:04:33.371 --> 00:04:35.980
can be extended to Scotland and Wales,

125
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.540
but there's less variety.

126
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.373
Scotland,

127
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.240
two thirds of Scotland is,

128
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.680
is a Highland,

129
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.281
uh,

130
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:47.110
only the lowland zone between the fourth and the Clyde is really very good for

131
00:04:47.111 --> 00:04:47.944
agriculture,

132
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.130
uh,

133
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.003
for um,

134
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.440
um,

135
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.080
Arabelle agriculture and areas around the coast.

136
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.681
Wales,

137
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:56.350
again dominated by the central Cambrian.

138
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.393
Massive,

139
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.700
very difficult in this period to travel north to South in Wales.

140
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:01.900
And as you go around the coast,

141
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:03.460
most people,

142
00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.090
most of the major routes travel east to west because of the mountains.

143
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.760
So it's as varied.

144
00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.741
Okay.

145
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:14.260
If we turn to another kind of distinctiveness,

146
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.980
um,

147
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.580
there's that associated with the practice of various industrial activities in

148
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:19.414
the countryside.

149
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.280
That was a matter not so much of the physical geography though that could

150
00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:26.230
influence their location.

151
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.190
Um,

152
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.230
but dependent upon other factors.

153
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.310
We think of this as a preindustrial age.

154
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.690
And yet there were already some areas which were rendered distinctive by,

155
00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:38.411
for example,

156
00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:42.970
the practice of mining and quarrying that clearly dependent upon geographical

157
00:05:42.971 --> 00:05:43.804
factors.

158
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.020
Uh,

159
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.610
you get led being mined in the hills of Darbyshire or in the hills of some

160
00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:49.690
section down here,

161
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.600
um,

162
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.820
iron in the forest of Dean down in Sussex down here.

163
00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.260
And Cole was produced especially around the river Tyne in the northeast and in a

164
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:03.680
scattering of other places across the countryside and in south Wales.

165
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.950
These industries were already established.

166
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.200
And then there was metalworking.

167
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.190
It was a great deal of metal working around the town of Birmingham in the West

168
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:13.611
Midlands,

169
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:15.290
which later grew into a great city.

170
00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.220
I'm one of England's greatest centers in the industrial revolution for light

171
00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:19.940
engineering.

172
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.580
That was based on its earlier metal working trade.

173
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.650
When Henry the eighth in invaded Scotland in 1523,

174
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:31.670
he placed bulk orders for arrowheads from the smiths of Birmingham.

175
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:32.504
They supplied him.

176
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.350
Sheffield was also very well known for its metalworking.

177
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.000
The knives of Sheffield.

178
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.310
We're very famous as indeed to some extent,

179
00:06:40.311 --> 00:06:41.144
they still are.

180
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.163
Um,

181
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.050
most people carried what they'd call the Sheffield wiggle,

182
00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.370
wiggle a little knife and you carried around with you to cut your food.

183
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:50.450
Uh,

184
00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.670
and it's from that name of course,

185
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:57.080
that we get the practice of whittling whittling wood from a Sheffield wiggle.

186
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.993
Okay.

187
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.410
Above all,

188
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.350
there was on a much larger scale,

189
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.280
the manufacture of woolen cloth usually manufactured in the putting out system,

190
00:07:09.651 --> 00:07:10.700
which I described to you.

191
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.970
Raw materials put out by capitalists,

192
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.260
clothiers to workers who spun the wool into yarn,

193
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.370
wove the yarn into cloth in their own cottages,

194
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.380
scattered across the villages around a major urban center and that kind of

195
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:28.220
organization.

196
00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:32.090
And the putting out system up the cloth industry was very widespread.

197
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.953
Indeed.

198
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.000
Many of the villages of East Anglia.

199
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:36.080
We're heavily involved.

200
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.340
Parts of Kent,

201
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:42.680
lots of places in the West country and a number of places scattered across the

202
00:07:42.681 --> 00:07:43.370
north.

203
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:47.660
We're heavily involved in manufacturing England's most famous product at this

204
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:48.494
time.

205
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.200
High Quality Woolen cloth.

206
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:54.110
All right.

207
00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.943
All that's fine.

208
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:59.950
As a brief descriptive typology of different kinds of areas of their

209
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:01.910
distinctiveness.

210
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.460
Physical geography goes only so far in explaining all this variation.

211
00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:13.420
It's also to do with the not only the physical attributes of the area,

212
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:18.170
but also invisible factors,

213
00:08:18.171 --> 00:08:20.240
the patterns of connection,

214
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:21.650
the patterns of interaction,

215
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:26.920
the flows of goods and people which gave areas distinctive qualities.

216
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.960
Um,

217
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.050
so for example,

218
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.170
to indicate what I'm trying to express here.

219
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:33.980
Um,

220
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.970
the fact that the coal industry was centered on Tyneside up here in the

221
00:08:37.971 --> 00:08:39.140
northeast of the country.

222
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:43.040
There's not simply because coal was found there and was found near to the

223
00:08:43.041 --> 00:08:46.940
surface where it could be reached with relatively simple technology.

224
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.570
It was also to do with the fact that it lay very close to the river.

225
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:53.150
Tyne a major navigable river.

226
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:54.581
So the cold,

227
00:08:54.581 --> 00:08:56.400
which was bulky and difficult to transport,

228
00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.120
could easily be put onto smaller boats called Kiehl's,

229
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.250
brought down the river onto,

230
00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.170
loaded onto Kalia ships,

231
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.760
which then transported it,

232
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:06.180
isn't he?

233
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.680
Down the coast to the cities along the coast and above all to the city of

234
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:11.514
London.

235
00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:16.610
London could never have grown as it did in this period if it hadn't had a

236
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:17.301
regular field.

237
00:09:17.301 --> 00:09:22.301
Supplies brought at a reasonable price by coastal routes from the North East.

238
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.230
That's why the northeast became the center of the coal industry.

239
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.720
Whereas other areas which had coal deposits,

240
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.910
we're not yet exploited.

241
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.920
They were too inaccessible.

242
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.260
Well,

243
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.370
that's one example.

244
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:36.690
One could think of others,

245
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.720
but it's examining flows of that kind.

246
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.640
That's crucial to understanding how particular localities develop their special

247
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:49.790
qualities and also the way in which they got articulated into larger national

248
00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:52.950
systems.

249
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.670
So do you understand all of that?

250
00:09:56.671 --> 00:10:01.590
One needs to look at these connections and the flows which linked local

251
00:10:01.591 --> 00:10:03.690
societies together into the national whole

252
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:06.271
one could look,

253
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:09.240
one can look at those connections in many ways that are the connections which

254
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:10.380
had to do with the state.

255
00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.460
And we look at them next week.

256
00:10:12.461 --> 00:10:16.860
But I look at the attitude of monarchy and the reassertion of royal authority.

257
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.090
There are connections to do with the church and we look at them a lot in dealing

258
00:10:21.091 --> 00:10:21.960
with the reformation.

259
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:27.300
But today I want to focus principally on connections through markets and through

260
00:10:27.301 --> 00:10:28.170
flows of people.

261
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:33.171
Demographic flows across the countryside and in particular looking at them

262
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:36.300
through the pattern of the urban system,

263
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:41.630
the towns which helped to organize and to some extent channel these flows

264
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.440
well for analytical purposes you can distinguish various levels of connection.

265
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:57.900
There were local market areas based on a smaller market town linking together

266
00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.730
the activities of the villages within particular countries.

267
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:01.901
Secondly,

268
00:11:01.901 --> 00:11:06.901
there were regional and interregional patterns of trade and finally they were

269
00:11:07.151 --> 00:11:10.840
trading systems of national or even international significance.

270
00:11:10.841 --> 00:11:12.010
And I'll touch on each of them.

271
00:11:12.011 --> 00:11:12.844
In turn,

272
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.960
local market areas were based upon small market towns

273
00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.110
within a particular country,

274
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:25.630
the rural and the urban.

275
00:11:25.631 --> 00:11:27.250
We're not separate spheres.

276
00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:27.790
Um,

277
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:32.710
it's helpful to think of them as being bound together by connections to a

278
00:11:32.711 --> 00:11:34.600
particular market town.

279
00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.650
All towns needed the country's products,

280
00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.280
food and raw materials,

281
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.150
the country dependent upon the towns to provide a place to trade.

282
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.450
And also for specialist manufacturers,

283
00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.430
specialist's services of various kinds.

284
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.050
So the essential unit to think of is the market town,

285
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.130
its hinterland

286
00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.320
and one can distinguish various kinds of market town.

287
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.240
Some of them were really very tiny.

288
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:02.650
The smallest spawns a,

289
00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.860
we're not very impressive as urban entities.

290
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:07.240
They were just large villages.

291
00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.721
Uh,

292
00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:11.980
they've been described as villages with an overlay of urban activities.

293
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.550
Uh,

294
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.690
market villages.

295
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.410
Uh,

296
00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:19.410
one person rather poetically has described these market towns as being folky and

297
00:12:20.081 --> 00:12:20.914
time.

298
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.010
They just came alive on market day the rest of the time.

299
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.710
They're pretty much just like any other village.

300
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.970
Well,

301
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:31.090
those are the settlements that provided weekly markets and the range of

302
00:12:31.091 --> 00:12:32.320
specialist services.

303
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.940
Most rural villages would have a Smith the Carpentaria wheel,

304
00:12:36.941 --> 00:12:37.774
right.

305
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:40.570
But there were other crafts which needed a bigger market.

306
00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:43.930
And so they tended to be located in the market towns.

307
00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:48.640
People like coopers who made barrels or join us who made furniture and so forth.

308
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:49.300
Uh,

309
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.740
to give you a specific example,

310
00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:53.020
there's an area of the county of Suffolk,

311
00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:53.500
uh,

312
00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.850
called Babbo hundred.

313
00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:56.013
There's the name,

314
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:56.913
that's how it's spelled.

315
00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:58.030
Um,

316
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.690
it's a delightful area of the country.

317
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:05.800
Recent survey by the Royal Commission on historical monuments found that in that

318
00:13:05.801 --> 00:13:06.634
area,

319
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:11.620
no less than 24% of the houses date back before 1700.

320
00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.570
It's got remarkable level of survival of late medieval and early modern

321
00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:17.440
buildings,

322
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.490
which makes it delightful.

323
00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.640
You've probably seen it many times in BBC shows.

324
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:22.271
Uh,

325
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:24.130
if you want an ideal English village,

326
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.960
that's the kind of place you'd go to film it.

327
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.330
Well,

328
00:13:28.330 --> 00:13:29.980
Babylock hundred in 15,

329
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:30.814
22,

330
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:32.920
there was a survey done of able bodied men,

331
00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:36.880
which led them to listing the inhabitants and that trades and occupations.

332
00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.940
There were 32 settlements in the area.

333
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:45.130
27 of them had only between two and 14 different occupations.

334
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.360
Four of them had between 18 and 27 occupations.

335
00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:50.740
They were the market towns.

336
00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.420
And finally there was one place which had as many as 49 occupations.

337
00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.130
That was a big market town,

338
00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.160
the town of Sudbury,

339
00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:05.620
the name which will be familiar to you know that there are many sub berries in

340
00:14:05.621 --> 00:14:06.580
the United States.

341
00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:13.410
Well all market towns then we're essentially closely connected and part of the

342
00:14:14.831 --> 00:14:16.240
countryside they served,

343
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.370
they gained their living from it,

344
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.500
but they also serve to bind those settlements into what you can think of as a

345
00:14:23.501 --> 00:14:28.120
kind of social area around which people move on a regular basis.

346
00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:28.840
Um,

347
00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.220
just to take an example of this,

348
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.190
it was a small village called Kibbe with Harcourt.

349
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:34.420
It's in,

350
00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.860
it's in Leicestershire roundabout there.

351
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.310
Um,

352
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.430
a study of kid with hardcore,

353
00:14:39.431 --> 00:14:40.031
it's been done,

354
00:14:40.031 --> 00:14:43.400
which shows that kid with Harcourt lay,

355
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:43.900
um,

356
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.760
within a days walk of,

357
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:47.703
um,

358
00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.230
a variety of small market towns.

359
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.160
So here we are in kid with Harcourt,

360
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:57.200
people who had different things to sell on any given day of the week,

361
00:14:57.201 --> 00:15:00.860
virtually could go out to a market town nearby

362
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:05.540
<v 2>and in turn</v>

363
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:10.350
<v 0>people were coming in from other villages to those market towns on different</v>

364
00:15:10.351 --> 00:15:11.310
market days.

365
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.000
What you get is the interconnection of the whole area.

366
00:15:15.001 --> 00:15:15.570
Of course,

367
00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:19.980
all the villages from these different communities are gradually intermingling in

368
00:15:19.981 --> 00:15:21.960
the marketplaces of these market towns.

369
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.310
That's how a local society meshed together.

370
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:32.250
Contemporaries were very aware of this and the cost of the reformation when the

371
00:15:32.251 --> 00:15:34.800
attempt of Protestant ties the country was at its height.

372
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.030
Um,

373
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:37.860
a good deal of attention was paid,

374
00:15:37.861 --> 00:15:38.401
for example,

375
00:15:38.401 --> 00:15:40.770
to preaching in market towns.

376
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.930
Preachers were appointed to preach in market town.

377
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:44.730
That was how you reach the people.

378
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:46.770
That's how you penetrate it an area.

379
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.201
Well,

380
00:15:49.201 --> 00:15:49.711
in addition,

381
00:15:49.711 --> 00:15:51.780
some market towns had a stronger role.

382
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.940
The bigger ones like Sudbury,

383
00:15:55.350 --> 00:16:00.350
which could articulate patterns of interaction over a significantly larger area.

384
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.010
Um,

385
00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:06.120
one historical geographers described these as what he calls cardinal markets,

386
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:07.290
really important ones.

387
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:08.550
Um,

388
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:12.150
linking countries into sub regions.

389
00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.900
Very good example is the town of Richmond in North Yorkshire,

390
00:16:15.901 --> 00:16:16.620
which has been,

391
00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:17.250
uh,

392
00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:18.360
quite well studied.

393
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.470
Richmond was placed between the hills of the Yorkshire Dales,

394
00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.690
beautiful high country,

395
00:16:24.691 --> 00:16:25.620
sheep country,

396
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.460
um,

397
00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.470
wonderful place to go walking or hiking.

398
00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.460
Uh,

399
00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.720
and the Vale of York,

400
00:16:30.721 --> 00:16:31.860
the Lowland Vale of York.

401
00:16:31.861 --> 00:16:35.220
It channeled the relationship between those two areas,

402
00:16:35.221 --> 00:16:36.480
the sheep and the,

403
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:37.440
um,

404
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:37.740
uh,

405
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.600
dairy produce of the details,

406
00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.000
including the famous Wensleydale cheese,

407
00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:43.020
um,

408
00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.430
which you may have encountered.

409
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.530
It's available in some places in America,

410
00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:47.603
recommended,

411
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:49.303
um,

412
00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:53.430
big wedge of Wensleydale on top of a slice of Apple Pie,

413
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:54.270
uh,

414
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:55.200
eaten together.

415
00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.220
This is definitely one of life's more fulfilling experiences.

416
00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:01.380
I do recommend it just sort of,

417
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.080
it's a sort of crumbly white cheese,

418
00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:04.973
tiny,

419
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.250
the best way to Dallas,

420
00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.650
still made from sheep's milk originally made by monks from the monasteries in

421
00:17:10.651 --> 00:17:11.470
that region.

422
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:12.600
Still still produced,

423
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.531
uh,

424
00:17:13.531 --> 00:17:14.070
anyway,

425
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:14.400
uh,

426
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.233
cheese,

427
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:20.240
sheep wool coming down to Richmond where they meet the grain and cloth and other

428
00:17:22.111 --> 00:17:23.330
products coming up from the,

429
00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.480
the Vale of York.

430
00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:29.660
And that's the main center for an exchange in 1536 when the north rose against

431
00:17:30.871 --> 00:17:32.490
the reformation in the rebellion,

432
00:17:32.491 --> 00:17:36.450
known as the pilgrimage of Grace Richmond was one of its major centers.

433
00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:37.170
Uh,

434
00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:41.160
proclamations of the rebellion took place at the market cross in Richmond.

435
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.640
Again,

436
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.780
it makes perfect sense.

437
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:44.730
This is how you reach people.

438
00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.840
Actually speaking of Richmond,

439
00:17:48.841 --> 00:17:49.140
I mean,

440
00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:51.540
you forgive a small sort of divergence.

441
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.463
Um,

442
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:53.550
uh,

443
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.900
when people visit Britain,

444
00:17:54.901 --> 00:17:55.081
you know,

445
00:17:55.081 --> 00:17:55.880
they're very often,

446
00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.100
you know,

447
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:56.970
go to London,

448
00:17:56.971 --> 00:17:57.331
Oxford,

449
00:17:57.331 --> 00:17:58.110
Cambridge,

450
00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.610
maybe Canterbury Cathedral,

451
00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:03.270
and then skip up to Edinburgh a or whatever.

452
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:04.080
Um,

453
00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:08.220
it's well worth taking the time to go to some of the provincial regions where

454
00:18:08.221 --> 00:18:10.350
you can see some lovely places.

455
00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:11.190
Uh,

456
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:15.450
the north is a very good example in Richmond is a splendid place to visit.

457
00:18:15.451 --> 00:18:16.230
It's,

458
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.810
it's enormous.

459
00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.060
Perfect market town.

460
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.500
I've got a 12th century castle perched on a bluff above the river swale,

461
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.720
a delightful streets.

462
00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.940
Most of the 17th and 18th century built in sort of yellowish sandstone,

463
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.140
monastery ruins.

464
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.580
It's got everything.

465
00:18:32.581 --> 00:18:32.791
And,

466
00:18:32.791 --> 00:18:32.971
you know,

467
00:18:32.971 --> 00:18:33.720
pick people,

468
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.220
tourists visit places like this.

469
00:18:35.221 --> 00:18:36.510
Very often it's well worth doing.

470
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.600
If you happen to go to Richmond,

471
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:42.460
I would recommend near the marketplace.

472
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.130
There's an in called the black lion,

473
00:18:44.131 --> 00:18:46.440
which does excellent lunches.

474
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:47.563
Um,

475
00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:48.570
I mean,

476
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.340
as you'd expect in that part of the country,

477
00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:51.720
the roast lamb is terrific,

478
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:53.190
but then they have modernized.

479
00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:55.110
They do now have vegetarian options.

480
00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:56.843
Um,

481
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.350
and they have wonderful beer.

482
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.420
The black sheep breweries is a small brewery in that area,

483
00:19:03.421 --> 00:19:05.580
which is very well known.

484
00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:06.750
Um,

485
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.660
and they produce a black sheet bitter.

486
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.281
Uh,

487
00:19:11.281 --> 00:19:12.114
and also,

488
00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:12.580
um,

489
00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:12.650
uh,

490
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:14.340
most most unusual bottled beer,

491
00:19:14.341 --> 00:19:15.870
which is called rig welter.

492
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:17.983
Um,

493
00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.020
which needs explaining,

494
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:20.213
uh,

495
00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.020
it's a dialect word.

496
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:22.921
A rig,

497
00:19:22.921 --> 00:19:27.480
welter in the dialect of this particular area of the north of England is a sheep

498
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:31.230
which has fallen on its back and can't get up again.

499
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.570
You know what I mean?

500
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:32.850
This,

501
00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:34.020
this happens with sheep.

502
00:19:34.021 --> 00:19:34.321
You know,

503
00:19:34.321 --> 00:19:34.830
they,

504
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:35.451
they tripped,

505
00:19:35.451 --> 00:19:37.470
they roll on their backs and then they lie,

506
00:19:37.471 --> 00:19:41.040
they're waggling their feet and the shepherd has to come and turn them up again.

507
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.770
Well,

508
00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:42.603
that's in,

509
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:43.840
in the dialect of the area.

510
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:45.060
It's a sheep like that.

511
00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:46.020
It's rig welted.

512
00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:46.621
It's a rig,

513
00:19:46.621 --> 00:19:47.454
welter.

514
00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:50.100
And they call this bottle of beer rig welter,

515
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:51.970
because if you,

516
00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.720
if you consume it in unwise quantities,

517
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.280
it has it exactly the same fact.

518
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:01.993
Um,

519
00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:03.271
I tell you this,

520
00:20:03.271 --> 00:20:04.260
not to encourage you,

521
00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:05.071
but to,

522
00:20:05.071 --> 00:20:05.520
um,

523
00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:05.880
you know,

524
00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.020
if you get happen to go to that part of England to warn you against,

525
00:20:10.021 --> 00:20:10.320
you know,

526
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.760
the possible consequences.

527
00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:13.890
Okay.

528
00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.840
Well to get back to the point.

529
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:16.783
Um,

530
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.500
so we have significant market towns,

531
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.693
um,

532
00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.040
and they connect villages in the localities,

533
00:20:23.041 --> 00:20:24.900
localities into countries,

534
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.020
countries into sub regions.

535
00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:34.140
And that role is revealed in their recorded patterns of population mobility.

536
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.910
As you know,

537
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:37.200
a village populations,

538
00:20:37.201 --> 00:20:37.891
we're not rooted.

539
00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:42.150
And the mobile people moved about finding work as servants,

540
00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.410
marrying,

541
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.040
taking up a tendency of land that was available and so forth.

542
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.580
And to some extent you can trace the distances people moved from their place of

543
00:20:51.581 --> 00:20:53.290
birth in the course of their lives.

544
00:20:53.670 --> 00:20:56.980
Once that has been done of Worcestershire over here on the Welsh border.

545
00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.490
And that suggests that people were generally living within 10 miles of the place

546
00:21:00.491 --> 00:21:01.324
they were born.

547
00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:01.530
Yeah.

548
00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.070
So it can moving around the country.

549
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.260
And there are other similar studies,

550
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.970
very good one was done of Kent,

551
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:08.530
of um,

552
00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.180
the geography of marriage.

553
00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:15.130
And it found that half of the people in the study married people from their home

554
00:21:15.131 --> 00:21:15.964
parish,

555
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.350
70% married people from under five miles,

556
00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:27.090
84% married people from under 10 miles and 95% married people from under 15

557
00:21:28.781 --> 00:21:30.040
miles from where they were born.

558
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.391
And again,

559
00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:34.810
it gives us a sense of the area in which people were moving around and where

560
00:21:34.811 --> 00:21:36.700
they of course met marriage partners.

561
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:38.733
Okay.

562
00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:43.980
Well distances like that reflect the area of regular social interaction and

563
00:21:45.371 --> 00:21:50.371
movement shaped by local markets and the towns where they were located,

564
00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:56.610
which created social areas with their own distinctive identities and their own

565
00:21:58.970 --> 00:21:59.750
particular,

566
00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:00.100
um,

567
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.510
orientations.

568
00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:07.180
I've noticed since living in Connecticut that there's an invisible wall across

569
00:22:07.181 --> 00:22:07.750
Connecticut,

570
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:12.490
which seems to divide red sox fans from Yankees fans,

571
00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:13.390
um,

572
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.930
which presumably has something to do with the kind of orientation of people at

573
00:22:16.931 --> 00:22:18.030
different parts of the state,

574
00:22:18.031 --> 00:22:18.220
you know,

575
00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.050
towards New York or towards Boston.

576
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:23.440
So it's an example of the kind of thing I'm talking about,

577
00:22:23.441 --> 00:22:25.300
the way in which people's connections,

578
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.650
where they go shopping,

579
00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.170
where they go for business and so forth,

580
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.540
Orient them in particular directions.

581
00:22:31.541 --> 00:22:35.200
And that's what we created these countries in 16th century England to,

582
00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:36.820
okay,

583
00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:37.653
let's move on.

584
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:39.851
In addition,

585
00:22:39.851 --> 00:22:42.460
there was some longer distance flows.

586
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:44.763
Um,

587
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:50.070
the key commodities that one finds in these inter regional systems of um,

588
00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.460
connection and interdependence,

589
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:53.950
uh,

590
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.090
would have several kinds.

591
00:22:55.091 --> 00:22:56.470
I mean they were food stuffs,

592
00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:00.700
not every area produce enough food to feed its local population.

593
00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:05.910
You tend to get a flow of grain from the south and east towards the north and

594
00:23:06.761 --> 00:23:07.270
west.

595
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:09.160
A lot of it went up the coast for example,

596
00:23:09.161 --> 00:23:14.161
from east Anglia and in reverse you get flows of animal products from the

597
00:23:14.741 --> 00:23:17.650
pastoral areas of the north down to the south.

598
00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:18.460
Uh,

599
00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.350
heading usually towards the cities.

600
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.040
Uh,

601
00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:21.630
many,

602
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:21.791
uh,

603
00:23:21.791 --> 00:23:25.840
cattle and sheep were driven in great herds having been assembled,

604
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:26.331
uh,

605
00:23:26.331 --> 00:23:31.030
in the market towns of the north and the West Wales driven down to London in

606
00:23:31.031 --> 00:23:34.930
particular where they'd be fattened up in the villages around London,

607
00:23:34.931 --> 00:23:39.460
but I graziers before being sold to the butchers of the city.

608
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.590
So you get flows of that kind,

609
00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:44.890
you get flows of raw materials.

610
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:46.160
Um,

611
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.410
the world which was produced in East Anglia,

612
00:23:48.411 --> 00:23:51.710
in Lincolnshire or the North would find its way down to the woolen industry in

613
00:23:51.711 --> 00:23:53.170
the West on the south east.

614
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:56.840
And one gets other things to the,

615
00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:57.710
um,

616
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:58.543
uh,

617
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.100
luxury products,

618
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:02.150
um,

619
00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.220
which were traded over long distances.

620
00:24:04.221 --> 00:24:06.620
Things like wine and spices,

621
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.270
find quality fabrics.

622
00:24:08.271 --> 00:24:12.320
They would tend to come into London and one of the major ports like Bristol,

623
00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:13.130
uh,

624
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:15.710
and then be disseminated across the countryside.

625
00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:20.120
Longer distance flows of foodstuffs,

626
00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.410
raw materials,

627
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:22.550
luxury goods,

628
00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:23.390
and indeed some,

629
00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.630
some less significant,

630
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:26.120
um,

631
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.230
manufactured goods.

632
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:28.580
The knives of Sheffield,

633
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:29.220
uh,

634
00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.910
were found everywhere in the country.

635
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.160
If you visit London and are standing by the river at low tide,

636
00:24:37.161 --> 00:24:41.900
you might notice people on the mud banks by the side of the river putting mud

637
00:24:41.901 --> 00:24:43.220
into citizen sieving.

638
00:24:43.221 --> 00:24:44.054
It,

639
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.380
um,

640
00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:46.800
they're known as mudlarks there.

641
00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:47.673
Um,

642
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:48.100
uh,

643
00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.640
amateur archeologists,

644
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.090
what they're doing is finding stuff in the mud,

645
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.350
which fell out of people's pockets in London long ago.

646
00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:58.893
Um,

647
00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.580
as you probably aware,

648
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:02.503
um,

649
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:03.463
uh,

650
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.380
the taxi system of 16th century London was,

651
00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:07.340
well,

652
00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:11.330
little boats on the river waterman road people hit the render that the

653
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.240
Shakespeare in love is a good example of that kind of thing.

654
00:25:14.241 --> 00:25:15.320
If you've seen that movie,

655
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.730
um,

656
00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:20.780
things fell out of people's pockets when they were on the river and they can be

657
00:25:20.781 --> 00:25:22.880
found in the mud anyway.

658
00:25:22.881 --> 00:25:24.380
One of the most common things,

659
00:25:24.381 --> 00:25:27.740
the mud locks find our Sheffield knives.

660
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:32.300
People carried a knife all the time and they would fall in the river and they

661
00:25:32.301 --> 00:25:34.280
can be found and they end up in museums.

662
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:37.730
Well,

663
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:42.730
longer distance flows then any town could have a role in distributing goods over

664
00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:44.570
the longer distance,

665
00:25:44.571 --> 00:25:49.571
but some had a particularly important role and they were of greater than sub

666
00:25:51.201 --> 00:25:52.910
regional significance.

667
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:58.510
And the greatest of them are sometimes described as being provincial capitals

668
00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:00.080
places,

669
00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:05.080
which in the early 16th century would have a population over five or 6,000,

670
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:09.410
which seems paltry to modern eyes,

671
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:14.440
but it was quite significant at the time and which exerted influence over a

672
00:26:14.751 --> 00:26:17.300
whole area of the country.

673
00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.350
Um,

674
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.360
to give a good example,

675
00:26:20.361 --> 00:26:21.194
York,

676
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.230
effectively the capital of the north of England.

677
00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:30.880
York was a city of ancient origin and considerable importance.

678
00:26:32.991 --> 00:26:35.660
It was the great ecclesiastical center of the north.

679
00:26:35.661 --> 00:26:38.990
The Archbishop of York was based there in York,

680
00:26:38.991 --> 00:26:39.824
Minster,

681
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:41.300
Wonderful Cathedral.

682
00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:42.530
Um,

683
00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.880
it was a center of royal government for the north,

684
00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:48.870
the king's council of the North sacked at York in the king's manor.

685
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:50.320
Uh,

686
00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:55.320
and York was also a natural point of exchange for the largest county in the

687
00:26:55.411 --> 00:26:56.244
kingdom.

688
00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.250
If you look at your map of towns and counties,

689
00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.100
you'll see that Yorkshire here,

690
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.050
by far the biggest county,

691
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:08.243
well,

692
00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:13.280
York dominated the trading networks of the entire area.

693
00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:20.010
It provided also all kinds of specialists services for the whole of the north of

694
00:27:20.011 --> 00:27:20.844
England.

695
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.220
If your church needed new bells,

696
00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:26.040
York was the only place you would get a bell cast.

697
00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.670
If you wanted to buy a clock,

698
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.740
you would probably need to go to York.

699
00:27:31.741 --> 00:27:35.730
Not many clocks were manufactured as very specialist occupation in a tiny number

700
00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.050
of the greatest cities.

701
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:38.490
If you wanted a book,

702
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.510
beautifully bound,

703
00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:40.830
you would go to York.

704
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:44.820
York had people like bookbinders serving cathedral and so forth.

705
00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:51.050
It's position on the river ooze meant that it was also a town which um,

706
00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:56.610
controlled a major artery of long distance trade.

707
00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:57.480
Um,

708
00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.810
the river ooze runs up from the city of Harlan,

709
00:28:00.811 --> 00:28:05.811
the coast up into North Yorkshire and along the river would pass many goods

710
00:28:08.911 --> 00:28:13.410
being landed at Harland coming up into the area or coming down the river and

711
00:28:13.411 --> 00:28:17.670
then being shipped to national and international markets.

712
00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:24.540
Any of the really great cities of the time had that same kind of role.

713
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:30.140
Norridge was in effect the Capitol of East Anglia and was the second largest

714
00:28:30.961 --> 00:28:31.950
city at the time.

715
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.180
Bristol in effect the capital of the West country.

716
00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:37.433
Um,

717
00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:42.620
Chester very significant also to the north of Wales and controlling trade with

718
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:47.160
Ireland and so on could go on new castle up in the northeast.

719
00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:48.450
Also very significant,

720
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.330
strategically important close to the Scottish border

721
00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:58.920
just as patterns and population mobility within particular localities indicates

722
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.580
the local social areas within which people moved.

723
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:08.030
So the patterns of migration to the really great cities tell us about their

724
00:29:08.281 --> 00:29:10.590
regional and inter regional significance.

725
00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:12.241
For Norwich,

726
00:29:12.241 --> 00:29:13.074
for example,

727
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:16.620
there are surviving lists of apprentices and where they came from,

728
00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.110
the young men who came in to learn a trade,

729
00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:21.120
they came from all over East Anglia,

730
00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.020
the whole region,

731
00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:23.620
and indeed from further afield,

732
00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.030
Norwich was important enough to pull people in from the Midlands.

733
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:30.960
And the same sort of thing is true of other areas that can be studied.

734
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:31.890
Uh,

735
00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:34.170
in that way in Bristol,

736
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:39.530
similar study shows that the apprentices came from all over the West Midlands

737
00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.400
and they came from,

738
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.670
uh,

739
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:43.870
let me just check the figure.

740
00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:50.700
37 different towns and villages of which 25 we're actually located on the river

741
00:29:52.061 --> 00:29:52.894
seven,

742
00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:55.720
which runs up like that.

743
00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.350
It's pretty obvious what was going on here.

744
00:29:59.351 --> 00:30:03.010
These places were particularly connected to Bristol was the river trade and

745
00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:07.540
people were coming down river to stop their careers in Bristol as apprentices.

746
00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:09.250
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

747
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:13.690
<v 0>Bristol also do apprentices from Wales and from the southwest of England.</v>

748
00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:15.813
<v 3>Okay.</v>

749
00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:19.911
<v 0>Okay.</v>

750
00:30:19.911 --> 00:30:24.911
Cities such as Bristol or York or Norwich where already places of national

751
00:30:25.731 --> 00:30:26.564
significance.

752
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:31.810
They focused entire regions and bound them together into the national unit and

753
00:30:32.811 --> 00:30:34.760
they channeled interregional trade.

754
00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:40.250
But the final element of the kind of articulation that I'm talking about,

755
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.940
of course,

756
00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:45.620
is at the ultimate national level and that's provided above or by the Capitol

757
00:30:45.621 --> 00:30:46.640
City London.

758
00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.090
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

759
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:50.290
<v 0>As you'll know from your reading,</v>

760
00:30:50.291 --> 00:30:55.291
the English urban system in this period was rather polarized.

761
00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:02.010
There was only one city with more than 15,000 population in the early 16th

762
00:31:02.981 --> 00:31:03.550
century,

763
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:04.383
and that was London.

764
00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:09.340
Nowhere else could come near rivaling London.

765
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:10.810
Um,

766
00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.070
in the 1520s,

767
00:31:12.071 --> 00:31:14.830
London already had a population of 55,000,

768
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:18.760
which made it something like four times the size of March.

769
00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.130
And it was growing.

770
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:21.941
Indeed,

771
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:22.540
it was gross.

772
00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:26.230
It was to grow to a population of something like 200,000.

773
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:30.400
By the last decades of the 16th century,

774
00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:36.580
London was the biggest marketing center for food and raw materials.

775
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:37.570
Um,

776
00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:39.640
London supplying London meant,

777
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:39.881
you know,

778
00:31:39.881 --> 00:31:44.680
farmers all over eastern and southern England was sending their goods towards

779
00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.330
the capital city.

780
00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:48.130
There was a lot of road traffic.

781
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:48.821
Uh,

782
00:31:48.821 --> 00:31:51.100
there was also river traffic down the river Thames,

783
00:31:51.101 --> 00:31:56.101
coastal traffic bringing goods to where there could be landed to supply London.

784
00:31:58.700 --> 00:31:59.330
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

785
00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:03.500
<v 0>London was also the biggest supplier of goods that were desired elsewhere in the</v>

786
00:32:03.501 --> 00:32:04.334
kingdom.

787
00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:08.990
It was the biggest center of manufacturing of all kinds of things which would be

788
00:32:08.991 --> 00:32:13.610
sent out to cities and towns elsewhere in the kingdom.

789
00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.800
It was the biggest supplier also have all kinds of specialist services which

790
00:32:18.801 --> 00:32:21.620
weren't readily available elsewhere.

791
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:23.300
London had a lot of lawyers,

792
00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:23.931
for example,

793
00:32:23.931 --> 00:32:25.610
if you wanted legal business done,

794
00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.800
London was the place to go.

795
00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:29.960
London was where the Royal Courts,

796
00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:33.200
Matt hearing the most important court cases,

797
00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:38.620
London was the place which had a lot of proper university trained physicians.

798
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.720
If you had medical problems,

799
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.930
it was very rare to find a physician like that,

800
00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:45.740
uh,

801
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.030
out in a small town.

802
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.180
So it was the place to go for all kinds of things.

803
00:32:50.181 --> 00:32:50.980
I mean,

804
00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.460
an almost ridiculous example,

805
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:53.140
if you were,

806
00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.640
if you were to break nobleman or a gentleman,

807
00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:56.631
uh,

808
00:32:56.631 --> 00:33:01.631
and you wanted to have a grand renaissance to erected in your parish church in

809
00:33:01.971 --> 00:33:03.350
preparation for your death.

810
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:04.790
And lots of them did this.

811
00:33:04.791 --> 00:33:07.820
They even wrote the inscriptions themselves while they were still alive,

812
00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:08.540
you know,

813
00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.670
saying how wonderful guys they'd be.

814
00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:12.081
And,

815
00:33:12.081 --> 00:33:12.500
uh,

816
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.810
if you wanted something like that and you could afford it,

817
00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:16.790
London was the place that you've got it.

818
00:33:16.791 --> 00:33:19.190
That's where the stone masons work could do something like that.

819
00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:19.760
Uh,

820
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:24.760
they were manufactured in London to order and then shipped out in pieces to

821
00:33:25.641 --> 00:33:29.180
wherever they were to be erected and then there would be erected by local masons

822
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:32.540
in a parish church somewhere else in the kingdom.

823
00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:33.421
It's just,

824
00:33:33.421 --> 00:33:34.254
it,

825
00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:34.820
it's true.

826
00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:35.361
But you know,

827
00:33:35.361 --> 00:33:36.920
it's sort of silly example in a way,

828
00:33:36.921 --> 00:33:37.610
but it,

829
00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:38.443
it makes the point

830
00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.320
right above all,

831
00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:46.910
London was the great center of International Trade.

832
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.670
The dominance of London was based upon the fact that it was so close to the

833
00:33:52.671 --> 00:33:54.380
crossing across to the Netherlands.

834
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:58.850
You can have a short voyage across the North Sea to the cities of the

835
00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:01.760
Netherlands and above all the city of Antwerp,

836
00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:05.890
which should be marked on the bottom corner of your Mac,

837
00:34:05.891 --> 00:34:08.180
but seems to have got lost in the xerox machine.

838
00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:08.781
Uh,

839
00:34:08.781 --> 00:34:10.040
in some cases,

840
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:15.170
London was the major market for English cloth,

841
00:34:15.171 --> 00:34:16.670
which was exported abroad.

842
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.930
And it was the principal place where imports were landed.

843
00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:22.431
In fact,

844
00:34:22.431 --> 00:34:27.431
woolen cloth alone made up two thirds of English exports in the early 16th

845
00:34:29.571 --> 00:34:30.170
century.

846
00:34:30.170 --> 00:34:35.060
Two thirds of India's exports with woolen cloth and at least half of that cloth

847
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.540
went to the continent through London.

848
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.430
It was gathered in London from all over the north and the West of England and

849
00:34:43.431 --> 00:34:48.431
from Wales and export it in fleets of ships organized by a company called the

850
00:34:49.611 --> 00:34:50.780
merchant adventurous.

851
00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:52.970
In return,

852
00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.100
all kinds of goods were brought back,

853
00:34:55.101 --> 00:34:58.580
especially from the Netherlands luxury textiles,

854
00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:00.560
fine quality linen silk,

855
00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:02.150
um,

856
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:07.150
miscellaneous manufacturers which were not made an England pins for example,

857
00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.320
they didn't manufacture pins in England.

858
00:35:09.321 --> 00:35:10.880
They came from Holland,

859
00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:11.810
uh,

860
00:35:11.810 --> 00:35:12.620
starch.

861
00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:16.430
They didn't manufacture starch that came from the Netherlands to paper.

862
00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.920
There were no paper manufacturers in England.

863
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:24.220
The book trade based in London of course dependent upon imports of paper from

864
00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.593
the Netherlands.

865
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.580
And then there were all sorts of groceries,

866
00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:29.691
olive oil,

867
00:35:29.691 --> 00:35:31.010
fruit spices,

868
00:35:31.011 --> 00:35:31.844
sugar,

869
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.983
wine.

870
00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:36.710
A great deal of this came via the,

871
00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:41.850
the Netherlands is the great trading area of northern Europe with its cities,

872
00:35:41.851 --> 00:35:42.840
notably Antwerp.

873
00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.410
And they connected the trade of Scandinavia,

874
00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:51.440
the Baltic and the north to trade down the Atlantic coast and to the

875
00:35:51.991 --> 00:35:55.500
Mediterranean and also the river roots of Europe,

876
00:35:55.501 --> 00:35:56.910
which culminated in the Netherlands,

877
00:35:56.911 --> 00:36:00.030
like the Rhine or brought in goods.

878
00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:05.060
The Netherlands was the center and England was connected to world trade via the

879
00:36:06.031 --> 00:36:06.864
Netherlands.

880
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:09.930
I keep mentioning Antwerp.

881
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:13.710
Antwerp was the center of all of this and its importance was very well

882
00:36:13.711 --> 00:36:14.461
recognized.

883
00:36:14.461 --> 00:36:16.860
It was with Antwerp that the English traded bubble,

884
00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:22.020
it's no accident that when Sir Thomas Moore in 15,

885
00:36:22.021 --> 00:36:24.720
17 wrote his book utopia,

886
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:29.880
he sets it in Antwerp where he presents himself on an,

887
00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.080
uh,

888
00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.380
an embassy to Antwerp,

889
00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:35.550
which actually took place talking to the sailor Rafael Hitler Day,

890
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.060
who tells him the story of the wonderful land of Utopia,

891
00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:43.320
which is located in his voyages to the west.

892
00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.910
Other things came from the Netherlands to ideas.

893
00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:53.490
It was one of the major centers for the smuggling of early Protestant books into

894
00:36:53.491 --> 00:36:55.700
England from the 1520s onwards,

895
00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:56.603
for example.

896
00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.233
<v 2>Okay.</v>

897
00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:04.550
<v 0>So London's dominant position was reflected in the fact that it had a truly</v>

898
00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.450
national migration field.

899
00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:15.330
Study's been done over a thousand new Freeman of the city in 1551 to 1553 young

900
00:37:18.991 --> 00:37:22.830
men completing their apprenticeship and becoming Freeman of the city.

901
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:28.350
Only a fifth of them had been born in London or the metropolitan area itself.

902
00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:32.580
A quarter of them came from the South East and east Anglia.

903
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:34.920
A quarter of them came from the Midlands,

904
00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.810
a quarter of them came from the north,

905
00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:41.040
and then there were a scattering of others from different parts of the kingdom,

906
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.210
relatively fruit,

907
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:43.440
few from the southwest.

908
00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.360
Probably the importance of Bristol men,

909
00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.480
young men from the South West went there rather than to London.

910
00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:52.470
But London's catchment area was truly national.

911
00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:58.260
<v 2>Okay.</v>

912
00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:02.160
<v 0>Well this description and analysis of marketing structures and the way they're</v>

913
00:38:02.161 --> 00:38:07.161
articulated perhaps gives a sense of the integrated nature of a system of

914
00:38:07.861 --> 00:38:10.410
exchange already in the early 16th century.

915
00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:11.050
Uh,

916
00:38:11.050 --> 00:38:12.240
and so it was,

917
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:18.530
it's not difficult to imagine a merchant sitting in his counting house in

918
00:38:18.991 --> 00:38:19.824
Bristol,

919
00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:21.870
perhaps eating some stock fish,

920
00:38:22.290 --> 00:38:25.560
which would have been caught off the coast of north Wales.

921
00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:27.780
It would have been packed into barrels,

922
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:30.300
which were made with barrel staves,

923
00:38:30.301 --> 00:38:32.520
which probably import it from Ireland by Chester.

924
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.130
It would be salted with salt,

925
00:38:35.350 --> 00:38:37.450
which was produced in the county of Cheshire,

926
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:38.583
nearby.

927
00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:39.191
I mean,

928
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:42.370
if he's accompanying it with a little wine,

929
00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:43.001
uh,

930
00:38:43.001 --> 00:38:46.840
that would have come from southwestern France and was probably landed in

931
00:38:46.841 --> 00:38:47.674
Bristol.

932
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:50.140
If he was drinking that out of a pewter goblet,

933
00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:54.250
the pewter would have been made with led from the Mendip hills and tin from

934
00:38:54.251 --> 00:38:55.084
Cornwall,

935
00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:59.710
probably actually produced by craftsmen working in Bristol itself.

936
00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:03.220
And maybe he's wearing a nice gown to keep the drafts off,

937
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:04.690
which would be fine quality.

938
00:39:04.691 --> 00:39:09.640
What's did cloth from Norridge and if he's got a fine linen shirt because he's

939
00:39:09.641 --> 00:39:10.474
very well off,

940
00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.600
it would be Netherlandish linen.

941
00:39:12.601 --> 00:39:13.510
And that was the best.

942
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.760
The cheap stuff came from England,

943
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.660
from Lincolnshire.

944
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:17.740
Uh,

945
00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.450
and if it starched as color,

946
00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.150
the starch would've come from Antwerp probably.

947
00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:27.330
Let's have him cut his fish up.

948
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.630
He uses a Sheffield knife.

949
00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:31.241
Well,

950
00:39:31.241 --> 00:39:32.560
it's easy to imagine that,

951
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:33.220
you know,

952
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.050
that it,

953
00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:34.350
it,

954
00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:35.183
it,

955
00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:39.010
it mattered that those connections existed and they did exist.

956
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.480
But we also finally just have to appreciate the limits of that kind of

957
00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:46.180
sophisticated commercial interconnection.

958
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.200
Remember what I've said before,

959
00:39:50.201 --> 00:39:55.201
this was still primarily a rural world in which people lived within relatively

960
00:39:55.571 --> 00:40:00.130
contained areas and focused mostly on a little bit of local exchange and

961
00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:02.620
producing their own subsistence.

962
00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:05.230
So most people,

963
00:40:05.231 --> 00:40:09.880
most of the time had only limited connections to these larger flows,

964
00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.480
to these larger commercial networks.

965
00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:17.770
The people who were really involved with them were distinctive groups in

966
00:40:17.771 --> 00:40:18.400
society.

967
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.960
Townspeople of course,

968
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:23.080
especially the inhabitants of the greatest cities,

969
00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:23.891
um,

970
00:40:23.891 --> 00:40:24.701
to a lesser extent.

971
00:40:24.701 --> 00:40:28.930
Also the inhabitants of those areas like the industrial areas,

972
00:40:28.931 --> 00:40:31.660
which we're producing goods for longer distance trade.

973
00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:32.650
Um,

974
00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:35.350
the big commercial farmers who were involved in,

975
00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:36.070
um,

976
00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:41.070
longer distance marketing of grain or cattle and a variety of middlemen who

977
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:44.380
conducted that trade.

978
00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:46.300
And finally,

979
00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:46.631
uh,

980
00:40:46.631 --> 00:40:49.510
deeply involved in all of this where the social elites,

981
00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.060
they were the people who consumed the luxuries.

982
00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:56.230
They were the people who went down to London to attend the royal court from time

983
00:40:56.231 --> 00:40:57.064
to time.

984
00:40:57.280 --> 00:40:57.640
Uh,

985
00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:02.110
they were the people who had truly national social networks

986
00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.010
with their equals as members of the elite.

987
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:12.130
But the point is that the intensity of the integration varied a lot.

988
00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:13.660
It very socially,

989
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:15.460
it varied geographically.

990
00:41:15.610 --> 00:41:19.750
Some areas were probably pretty densely connected and commercialized.

991
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:21.580
The southeast in particular,

992
00:41:21.670 --> 00:41:22.840
it has more towns.

993
00:41:22.841 --> 00:41:24.370
It's more heavily populated.

994
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:27.340
It has a better road system and so forth.

995
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:31.780
Other areas were less closely interconnected.

996
00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:35.030
Some of the longer connections I've described,

997
00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:40.480
we're flowing across areas where people's lives were in fact much more contained

998
00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:46.060
on a day to day basis when historians try to conceptualize the whole thing,

999
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:51.890
they have to try to express both the reality of the interconnections and their

1000
00:41:51.891 --> 00:41:52.724
importance,

1001
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:54.050
but also their limits.

1002
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.340
The continuing importance of localism within your country.

1003
00:41:59.840 --> 00:42:04.840
People talk about an elaborate mosaic of interlocking local societies.

1004
00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:06.440
Uh,

1005
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:10.820
they talk about what it was still a highly territorialized society,

1006
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:16.300
although a national society also they talk about an AML gam of different local

1007
00:42:17.091 --> 00:42:22.091
societies at different stages of development influencing each other.

1008
00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:28.030
And yet often a world in which old ways coexisted with the new,

1009
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:33.231
well,

1010
00:42:33.231 --> 00:42:36.230
both dimensions of the picture have validity,

1011
00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:41.740
commercial relations have a vital place and yet many local societies and

1012
00:42:41.841 --> 00:42:42.530
economies,

1013
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.330
we're still to a great degree,

1014
00:42:44.331 --> 00:42:46.370
autonomous or semi autonomous.

1015
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:48.043
All in all,

1016
00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:52.580
it could be described as not yet a fully integrated commercial society,

1017
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:57.410
but a traditional agrarian world with a limited commercial sector

1018
00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.760
within that commercial sector,

1019
00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:05.120
the predominant flows tended to be,

1020
00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:05.870
um,

1021
00:43:05.870 --> 00:43:08.900
from the north and the West towards the south and the east.

1022
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.740
But to imagine it as being simply a dynamic,

1023
00:43:12.741 --> 00:43:17.741
advanced southeastern core and a rather backward northern Western periphery,

1024
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.510
uh,

1025
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:22.220
doesn't do justice to the more distant provinces.

1026
00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:25.490
It's better I think to think in terms of,

1027
00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:26.683
um,

1028
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:32.230
certain core activities which are to be found all over the kingdom,

1029
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:38.030
though they tend to be somewhat more concentrated in the south and the east.

1030
00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:47.890
But those outposts and those connections really mattered.

1031
00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:55.370
They exercise the degree of leverage in local economies,

1032
00:43:55.940 --> 00:44:00.020
on local cultures and on local politics.

1033
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:04.160
So we have a set of local societies,

1034
00:44:04.161 --> 00:44:05.240
local economies,

1035
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:10.040
even local cultures with important elements of linkage.

1036
00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.470
It's those links,

1037
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:17.530
those connections that get activated and get elaborated by some of the really

1038
00:44:18.861 --> 00:44:20.810
significant developments of this period.

1039
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:23.960
The commercial developments of course,

1040
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:25.910
most obviously perhaps,

1041
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:31.120
but it's also through those same links and connections that people in distant

1042
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:34.830
areas of the kingdom became involved in.

1043
00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:37.440
Some of the other major changes of the period,

1044
00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:39.750
the so called educational revolution,

1045
00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:41.070
the growth of literacy,

1046
00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.140
religious change,

1047
00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.330
political change,

1048
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:51.740
what have been talking about really is essentially a framework of communication

1049
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.950
which is central to economic life,

1050
00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:57.300
to cultural life,

1051
00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.620
to the political dynamism of the period

1052
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:10.100
and finally the national society as a whole was one which was created not only

1053
00:45:11.821 --> 00:45:14.610
by those ties vital as they were,

1054
00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.830
but also by other forces,

1055
00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:21.210
by political forces and by religious forces.

1056
00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:26.850
And it's those that I'm going to turn to next week when we come at last to look

1057
00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:31.910
at the activities of the early Tudor kings and to what was going on in the

1058
00:45:33.361 --> 00:45:36.630
church on the eve of the reformation.

1059
00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.310
So context done.

1060
00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:42.720
Hopefully it will help you to understand the dynamics of change,

1061
00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:44.580
which we turn to next.
