1
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:01.920
Well,

2
00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.120
we've looked at a number of ways in which the late Elizabeth and,

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.450
and early 17th century period was a rather anxious age.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.561
Uh,

5
00:00:10.561 --> 00:00:14.020
and one of the things that the authorities in Elizabethan England and under the

6
00:00:14.021 --> 00:00:18.450
early Stuarts were very generally concerned about was the problem of order,

7
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.810
which naturally raises the question of just how disorderly society was at the

8
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:26.910
turn of the 16th and 17th centuries.

9
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:29.400
And today I want to approach that in one way,

10
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.000
uh,

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.030
by looking at two of the kinds of crime,

12
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.780
uh,

13
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.120
which provided much of the,

14
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.600
um,

15
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.500
serious,

16
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.400
um,

17
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.960
criminal activity dealt with by Elizabeth and devotee steward courts,

18
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.040
uh,

19
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.710
and which will help us to approach this general problem.

20
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.370
Uh,

21
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.370
one aspect of crimes of violence and the other crimes against property and how

22
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:53.580
they were dealt with.

23
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.681
Okay,

24
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:56.850
let's start with violence.

25
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.880
So how violent the society was that as a beacon and a re Stuart,

26
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.810
England?

27
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.991
Uh,

28
00:01:02.991 --> 00:01:06.990
it's a question which is quite seriously divided historians,

29
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.220
um,

30
00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.660
prior to the 1970s,

31
00:01:09.661 --> 00:01:14.661
I suppose that was a general consensus that it was indeed an exceedingly violent

32
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:17.010
society by modern standards.

33
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.090
Um,

34
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.960
Lawrence Stone,

35
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:21.540
the Great Princeton early modernist,

36
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.493
um,

37
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.280
uh,

38
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.460
provides one of the most forthright statements on this point.

39
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:30.300
He was historian who was good at really forthright statements and in his book

40
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:31.830
the crisis of the Aristocracy,

41
00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:36.831
he writes that the behavior of the property classes and that of the poor was

42
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:43.011
characterized by the ferocity childishness and lack of self control of the

43
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:44.640
Homeric age.

44
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.220
Imagine Brad Pitt in Troy

45
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.550
and unless we can grasp these basic psychological premises,

46
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:58.410
we cannot hope to understand the scale of the problem which the tutors faced.

47
00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.790
That's Lauren Stone.

48
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:00.740
He continues,

49
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.700
their nerves seem to have been perpetually on edge breeding language in corals,

50
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.790
so intemperate as to be almost deranged and a readiness to resort to direct

51
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:15.831
action with no holds barred and a general contempt for legal restraint.

52
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.401
Well,

53
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:18.480
a couple of decades later,

54
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:21.090
Alan Mcfarlane in a book on crime in the north of England,

55
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:25.050
the justice and the mayor's Ale took an almost diametrically opposed view.

56
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.560
He quotes contemporary travelers and diarists of the 17th century and concludes

57
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.780
the very strong impression these works give me is of a society in which people

58
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.540
were not moved by irrational anger and fury.

59
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.630
Whether you did not live or travel in fear,

60
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.210
we're despite physical hardship,

61
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.820
there was a great deal of tenderness and affection.

62
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.041
Well,

63
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:53.910
what I want to suggest in looking at some of the evidence today is that both of

64
00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:56.280
these positions have some merit,

65
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.390
but they're also partial because both are in different ways.

66
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.650
One sided.

67
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.680
And if were to approach this problematic ugly,

68
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.290
we really need to make a number of distinctions,

69
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.850
distinctions geographically between different parts of the kingdom distinctions

70
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:15.580
socially between the behavior of different groups.

71
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.170
And we need also to look at these matters chronologically with a sense of the

72
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:22.810
changes which took place over time.

73
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.610
And I've tried to do these things,

74
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.431
but,

75
00:03:26.431 --> 00:03:26.680
uh,

76
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.980
let's begin by looking at some of the special cases,

77
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.250
uh,

78
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.990
geographically and socially,

79
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.980
uh,

80
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.260
which will give us a little drama to start with.

81
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.060
There's no doubt,

82
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.343
for example,

83
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.760
that in the late 16th century and into the early decades of the 17th century,

84
00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.030
there were some areas of England and Wales which were indeed quite seriously

85
00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:53.440
disorderly and in which violent crime was more or less endemic.

86
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.600
The most notable area of all was the Scottish border area running between

87
00:03:58.601 --> 00:04:03.601
Carlisle and barrack and consisting of high bare hills dividing England from

88
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.493
Scotland,

89
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.920
this whole area and the counties to the south of it where periodically disturbed

90
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.710
by the threat of what was called raving rating conducted by members of the so

91
00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:19.120
called surnames,

92
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.100
members of certain border clans who might be situated on either side of the

93
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:24.934
border,

94
00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.370
also known as Moss troopers,

95
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.020
men who belonged to families like the Armstrongs,

96
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.040
the grahams,

97
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.030
the Wrigley's,

98
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.870
the Robson's,

99
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:35.620
the halls,

100
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.453
the fosters,

101
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.323
the Elliot's,

102
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.530
the Dixons.

103
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.180
I noticed looking through the roster,

104
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:42.910
we have a Dixon in this class which is quite worrying.

105
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.220
These were people who would set up when the,

106
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.310
when the opportunity provided itself on their little Galloway ponies generally

107
00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:55.270
armed with a leather jacket,

108
00:04:55.271 --> 00:05:00.160
jerkin and a steel cap dagger at the back of on the saddle.

109
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:05.200
Lance and sword to raid and they rated both the other side of the border and in

110
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:08.800
their own kingdoms also.

111
00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.203
Um,

112
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.960
it was set of the Armstrongs and the Grahams was a contemporary proverb,

113
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:16.540
Armstrong's and Graham's ride thieves all,

114
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.861
well,

115
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:18.880
these were the Mohs troopers,

116
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:19.930
the border rivers.

117
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.800
Um,

118
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.550
I've actually looked at the indictments for the courts for the county of

119
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:26.860
Northumberland between Newcastle and Barak.

120
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.820
And they reveal a great deal of the activities of these people.

121
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.703
Um,

122
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.900
they're quite distinctive compared to other criminal records.

123
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:36.640
Instead of finding someone accused,

124
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:37.351
for example of,

125
00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:40.690
of stealing a hand or a piglet or something like that,

126
00:05:40.691 --> 00:05:43.900
kind of commonplace thefts in this area,

127
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:48.901
you find people accused of stealing 20 cattle or 40 sheep of attacking houses,

128
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.750
of taking people for ransom.

129
00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:54.220
Um,

130
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.100
so many of those involved belonged to these particular surnames,

131
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.060
particular families who were notorious,

132
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.020
um,

133
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.860
that they were frequently given nicknames because so many of them had the same

134
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:05.690
name and these survival.

135
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:06.920
So in the wreck chords.

136
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.813
Um,

137
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.871
so for example,

138
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:13.760
amongst the men who were accused in Northumberland in the 1580s and nineties of

139
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:18.350
receiving or of slaying use with using swords,

140
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.000
daggers or lances,

141
00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.841
we find,

142
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:21.561
for example,

143
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:23.470
a Thomas Armstrong known as George.

144
00:06:23.471 --> 00:06:24.320
He's Tom,

145
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.180
his father was called George.

146
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:27.470
So he's Jody's Tom.

147
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.710
We have William Wrigley known as SLAC.

148
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:31.544
We'll,

149
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.670
we've got William Hall known as Saucy will.

150
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.340
We have John Dodd's alias,

151
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.410
crooked Jock,

152
00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:39.530
uh,

153
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:40.400
John Foster,

154
00:06:40.401 --> 00:06:40.910
alias,

155
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:41.361
alias,

156
00:06:41.361 --> 00:06:41.841
read,

157
00:06:41.841 --> 00:06:43.490
John and so on.

158
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:43.911
Could go on.

159
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:45.380
I think you'd get the general idea.

160
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:46.610
Um,

161
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:47.510
my favorite border,

162
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.540
he was in fact a Scotsman,

163
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.541
Clement Crosier,

164
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:54.740
who was known by the wonderful nickname of Nablus,

165
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.690
Clem nebulous Clem and nab in the dialect of the area is the tip of your nose.

166
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.210
That's your Neb and nebulous.

167
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:05.120
Clem had lost the tip of his nose in a sword fight.

168
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.680
Broadswords stroke.

169
00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:08.000
It taken off the end of his nose.

170
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.720
So he was known ever after is nebulous Clem.

171
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.660
And so one could go on.

172
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.940
So in 1,603 when Elizabeth the first died,

173
00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.010
the Graham family on the border decided that until King James,

174
00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:28.700
the sixth of Scotland reached the south of England and was crowned as James the

175
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:30.050
first of England.

176
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.000
The laws were temporarily suspended and they set off to take advantage of that

177
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:35.810
fact.

178
00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.810
In a week they rated south as far south as a Penrith in Cumbria and it became

179
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:44.660
known as busy week.

180
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.270
They took 5,000 cattle.

181
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:52.850
They did almost 7,000 pounds worth of damage to property.

182
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.470
They captured 14 men whom they held for ransom.

183
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.440
And in the course of attempts to resist them,

184
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:02.510
they killed another six.

185
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.480
So this is the kind of thing which could happen though.

186
00:08:05.481 --> 00:08:06.920
It's an extreme example.

187
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:07.791
Now,

188
00:08:07.791 --> 00:08:09.710
none of this of course is typical,

189
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:10.700
but it existed.

190
00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:14.150
It was going on on the border in the border counties,

191
00:08:14.151 --> 00:08:15.410
and it needs to be considered.

192
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.131
And in fact,

193
00:08:16.131 --> 00:08:16.911
the Welsh border,

194
00:08:16.911 --> 00:08:21.740
they'll less bad was also an area which was known for its relative lawlessness

195
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:26.150
because of the possibility of criminal slipping between jurisdictions across the

196
00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:26.984
border.

197
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:28.910
Right?

198
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.780
So if the geographical periphery of the kingdom had some rather special

199
00:08:32.781 --> 00:08:33.614
problems,

200
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:38.060
then so too did the social periphery of the aristocracy and the Gentry,

201
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.170
uh,

202
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.990
Lawrence Stone in the crisis of the aristocracy sites,

203
00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:47.290
far too many specific cases of aristocratic and gentry violence to be ignored.

204
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.400
These were people who could be exceedingly touchy about personal honor and

205
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:57.401
willing sometimes to resort to extreme measures to revenge slights against their

206
00:08:58.471 --> 00:08:59.304
honor.

207
00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.060
Um,

208
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:04.740
some of them indeed were virtually above the law in their capacity to get away

209
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:05.574
with it.

210
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.060
Um,

211
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.841
so for example,

212
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:08.880
it's a fact that in 1589,

213
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.720
so Thomas Langton and 80 of his men besieged the Thomas Hotan and 30 of his men

214
00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:19.110
in Lee Hall in Lancashire up in the northwest.

215
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:20.700
And when they broke in,

216
00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.550
they killed Houghton and several of his defenders,

217
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.970
when the government established a special commission to look into this

218
00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:33.840
particularly bad example of feuding amongst the Gentry,

219
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.430
only three of the jurors who were appointed dead to turn up the rest were too

220
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:42.270
intimidated by the local power of those responsible.

221
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:43.170
And in fact,

222
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.980
no formal present moment of this offense was ever made.

223
00:09:46.981 --> 00:09:47.670
At Law,

224
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.470
the Privy Council had to deal with it in other ways or to take another example

225
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:54.750
in 1580 the Earl of Oxford,

226
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.260
the man whom some people think wrote Shakespeare's plays,

227
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:03.000
but got an illegitimate child on a gentle woman who was under the protection of

228
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:03.960
Sir Thomas Navid.

229
00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:06.900
And that resulted in a feud between the two,

230
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:12.680
which included an assassination attempt on divot in London and several armed a

231
00:10:13.251 --> 00:10:18.060
phrase between their retainers and servants in the streets of London in which

232
00:10:18.061 --> 00:10:21.840
four men were killed and three were seriously wounded.

233
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:27.260
And yet the courtiers responsible with too powerful to be actually indicted in

234
00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:28.650
the courts.

235
00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.011
Again,

236
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:32.250
the Privy Council pacified it in other ways.

237
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:32.970
Well,

238
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:37.590
that kind of aristocratic and gentry violence could be added to from all over

239
00:10:37.591 --> 00:10:38.424
the kingdom.

240
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.790
It was the results of a code of behavior,

241
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:46.791
which later stress on competitive assertiveness in defense of a man's face and

242
00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:52.221
pride and reputation and one which could assume in some cases at any rate that

243
00:10:55.201 --> 00:10:58.050
resort to violence was both natural and justifiable.

244
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:02.280
Well,

245
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.370
the special problems that are posed by both the geographical and the social

246
00:11:05.371 --> 00:11:05.971
peripheries.

247
00:11:05.971 --> 00:11:10.230
We're fully recognized by contemporary authorities and the tutor and early

248
00:11:10.231 --> 00:11:12.630
steward state did it's best to try to deal with them.

249
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:17.580
The northern and Welsh boarders where under the special jurisdiction of

250
00:11:17.581 --> 00:11:22.350
particular councils established after 1560 to deal with their special problems.

251
00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.510
The council of the north sitting in York,

252
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:29.610
the council in the marches of whales sitting in Ludlow and they labored to bring

253
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.670
offenders to heal wardens of the marches were appointed who also also had the

254
00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:39.510
duty of cooperating with their opposite numbers on the other side of the border

255
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.210
in order to bring offenders to heal.

256
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.160
Some of them did some successfully,

257
00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:46.980
some not so successfully in Northumberland.

258
00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.570
So John Foster,

259
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.520
who was the warden of this part of the border,

260
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.190
um,

261
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:53.600
was notoriously in league with most of the border,

262
00:11:53.601 --> 00:11:55.060
even families himself.

263
00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:55.750
Uh,

264
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:58.420
but he was succeeded by others who did the job better.

265
00:11:58.660 --> 00:11:58.880
Uh,

266
00:11:58.880 --> 00:11:59.441
one of them,

267
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:01.540
Robert Carey loved it.

268
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.450
You wrote with enthusiasm to one of his friends in the south.

269
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:08.680
Have you spent every day in the saddle pursuing people across the border.

270
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:09.933
Um,

271
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.440
when Elizabeth died,

272
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.770
he was selected to be the man to carry her ring to Scotland to give to James a

273
00:12:16.771 --> 00:12:19.210
six as a token of his succession.

274
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.700
They chose him because a,

275
00:12:21.701 --> 00:12:23.800
he was a good writer and B,

276
00:12:23.801 --> 00:12:25.510
they thought he could get through the border safely.

277
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:31.570
Board of commissioners were appointed by James the sixth and first when he

278
00:12:31.571 --> 00:12:34.720
became king of England in order to cooperate even more closely.

279
00:12:34.721 --> 00:12:38.470
And indeed the level of violence and the board of county steadily diminishes

280
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.610
from that point onwards.

281
00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.050
By the 1620s,

282
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:45.280
it was largely over by the 1640s in some local histories.

283
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:49.990
It was being recalled as a rather romantic past rather than,

284
00:12:49.991 --> 00:12:50.051
uh,

285
00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:52.330
rather terrifying present reality

286
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:54.850
again,

287
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:59.850
in dealing with feuds and corals amongst the aristocracy and Gentry,

288
00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:04.930
the Privy Council did its best to try to pacify and restrain people.

289
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:06.910
It heard complaints,

290
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:10.990
alternative channels through which feuds could be settled.

291
00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:12.130
It made inquiries,

292
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:17.340
it's summon defenders before it to answer it forced arbitration upon upon people

293
00:13:17.651 --> 00:13:19.600
whose feuds might lead to violence.

294
00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:22.900
It put them under bond to keep the peace.

295
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:28.030
The Court of Star Chamber sitting in Westminster was particularly active in

296
00:13:28.031 --> 00:13:33.010
dealing with riotous and violent behavior amongst lesser offenders going out

297
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:35.110
fines and imprisonment and so forth,

298
00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.270
and they use of crown patronage could also help to keep people in line if they

299
00:13:40.271 --> 00:13:42.490
wanted to retain royal favor.

300
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.980
Gradual success in measures of this kind can be traced.

301
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.360
That kind of behavior became less common as a 17th century advanced and it was

302
00:13:52.361 --> 00:13:55.480
probably a company buy something of a shifted social values.

303
00:13:57.310 --> 00:14:02.290
Humanist educators of the period were beginning to teach an alternative notion

304
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:07.291
of honor and nobility which laid greater stress upon civility and restraint and

305
00:14:09.071 --> 00:14:14.071
service to the state rather than on a prickly form of individual honor.

306
00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:19.570
That was the influence of Protestant preachers to who preached her sober and

307
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:22.390
restrained model of manhood.

308
00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.930
All this was slow to affect behavior,

309
00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:30.430
but perhaps significant in the long run in changing the expectations of what was

310
00:14:30.431 --> 00:14:33.070
tolerable behavior amongst the elite.

311
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:34.180
Indeed,

312
00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.630
it could be said in some ways that they were providing a model of sort of,

313
00:14:37.631 --> 00:14:40.420
sort of new man for the period.

314
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.850
There were limits to the success of all that competitive assertion was still

315
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:47.080
commonplace.

316
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:47.711
Uh,

317
00:14:47.711 --> 00:14:52.370
even in such a peaceful environment as the University of Cambridge in the late

318
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:53.750
16th century,

319
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.840
outbreaks of violence amongst the students were actually quite common.

320
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:58.430
There are many records of students.

321
00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:01.670
Disciplined for such activities is pulling one another's beards,

322
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.940
which was a way to insult someone if you're in a quarrel with them,

323
00:15:04.941 --> 00:15:05.751
pull their beard.

324
00:15:05.751 --> 00:15:07.640
It was thought to be terribly humiliating.

325
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.780
Um,

326
00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.321
or,

327
00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:10.130
um,

328
00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:13.010
activities such as in a 60,

329
00:15:13.011 --> 00:15:13.341
no one,

330
00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:16.880
I think it was when the students of St John's College,

331
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:17.391
uh,

332
00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:22.070
attacked Trinity College on mass armed with clubs.

333
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:23.390
Um,

334
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.960
they were repelled by the students of Trinity College who climbed to the top of

335
00:15:26.961 --> 00:15:31.010
the tower and through pieces of masonry down on the attacking mob.

336
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.000
Um,

337
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
this had to be quelled by the university watch and many of the students concern

338
00:15:37.591 --> 00:15:41.480
were whipped in their college halls or put in the stocks in their college halls

339
00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.460
as a means of discipline.

340
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:44.250
Uh,

341
00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:46.480
and so on could go on the records of University of chemistry.

342
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:51.230
Extremely interesting in this respect and one occasion in the 60 90 is a group

343
00:15:51.231 --> 00:15:56.231
of students pretended to be the city watch and went around forcing taverns which

344
00:15:56.811 --> 00:15:59.060
had closed for the night to open and serve them.

345
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:03.890
They trashed the cross keys tavern and again there was a major disciplinary

346
00:16:03.891 --> 00:16:05.060
action as a result of this.

347
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:09.620
One of those who trashed the cross keys tavern was a future bishop of Durham

348
00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:12.980
because he was there training for the clergy.

349
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.910
One could go on the dual also remained of course a feature of aster cratic

350
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:21.030
culture for a long time.

351
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.780
They're examples of dueling right through to the 19th century.

352
00:16:23.781 --> 00:16:27.740
Most prime ministers of Britain fought a duel at one time or another right up to

353
00:16:27.741 --> 00:16:31.010
the Duke of Wellington in the early 19th century.

354
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.880
But that was the kind of individual one on one violence,

355
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:39.970
not as common as it's sometimes thought and very different from open feuding

356
00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.470
with gangs of armed retainers,

357
00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:45.410
which had been the kind of thing which had existed earlier.

358
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.040
But to move on,

359
00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:50.000
what about the,

360
00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:55.020
the heart of the kingdom and less elevated offenders and that can be approached

361
00:16:55.911 --> 00:16:57.710
by looking at the records for homicide.

362
00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.190
The records of your size courts at the king's bench,

363
00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.510
which met in London,

364
00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.500
a contained many inquests and indictments for homicide.

365
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:07.461
Uh,

366
00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:11.210
they're pretty full and these provide a fair opportunity to examine the actual

367
00:17:11.211 --> 00:17:13.610
incidents of crimes of this kind.

368
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:18.860
It was a hard crime to conceal when someone was killed and investigation by

369
00:17:18.861 --> 00:17:20.660
coroner's was virtually automatic,

370
00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:22.640
which could lead to criminal prosecution.

371
00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:25.160
Jia Sharp in his book,

372
00:17:25.161 --> 00:17:30.161
crime in early modern England has attempted for part of the mid 17th century to

373
00:17:30.831 --> 00:17:35.831
produce an actual rate of homicide crimes per 100,000 population.

374
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:42.130
And he calculates that the homicide rate in mid 17th century England was about

375
00:17:42.591 --> 00:17:45.920
three times that of modern Britain.

376
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:52.080
It may indeed have been somewhat higher since sometimes coroner's inquests would

377
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.950
fail to bring a charge in circumstances where today it would almost certainly be

378
00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:57.630
listed as a homicide.

379
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:03.560
Others have also attempted calculations of this kind and what they tend to bring

380
00:18:03.561 --> 00:18:04.100
out.

381
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:06.050
They all agree the figures vary,

382
00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:10.040
but they all agree that the levels of indictment for homicide,

383
00:18:10.041 --> 00:18:15.041
we're actually gradually falling from the late 16th century right through to the

384
00:18:15.201 --> 00:18:17.420
late 18th century in fact,

385
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:21.380
and some of the figures that have been produced or they're on one of the tables

386
00:18:21.381 --> 00:18:22.214
on your handout.

387
00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.660
If you look at table two

388
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.260
it's worth looking at in detail,

389
00:18:27.261 --> 00:18:31.970
but if you just look at the last two columns there you have the a rate

390
00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:37.490
calculated per hundred thousand population for the counties of Surrey and Sussex

391
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:38.451
Urban,

392
00:18:38.451 --> 00:18:38.811
sorry,

393
00:18:38.811 --> 00:18:39.620
is London,

394
00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.453
south London.

395
00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.241
Then we have rural,

396
00:18:41.241 --> 00:18:41.541
sorry.

397
00:18:41.541 --> 00:18:45.590
Then it total for the whole county and we also have the figures for Sussex,

398
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.061
sorry,

399
00:18:47.061 --> 00:18:48.410
is here to the south of London.

400
00:18:48.411 --> 00:18:52.140
Sussex is on the south coast and what you'll see you,

401
00:18:52.141 --> 00:18:57.141
there is a steady decline in the rate of homicide gradual process of

402
00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.400
pacification.

403
00:19:01.401 --> 00:19:02.234
One could say,

404
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.140
<v 1>okay,</v>

405
00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:10.140
<v 0>so this suggests perhaps that it was indeed a period with more serious violence</v>

406
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.200
than our own,

407
00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.970
but not one which was in new or to simply casual slaughter.

408
00:19:18.971 --> 00:19:23.971
We seem to be somewhere in between Laurence stones violence and unrestrained

409
00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.430
emotional infants and Alan Mcfarland's.

410
00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:28.960
Nice orderly Englishman.

411
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.390
<v 1>Okay.</v>

412
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.520
<v 0>The circumstances of the cases that were heard,</v>

413
00:19:33.521 --> 00:19:33.790
um,

414
00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.920
bring that out even more.

415
00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:36.970
Um,

416
00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:38.770
in the 16th and 17th centuries,

417
00:19:38.771 --> 00:19:43.771
people killed their families less and their neighbors more than is the case

418
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:49.900
today in 17th Century Essex and indeed in late 16th Century Essex to,

419
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.830
um,

420
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:54.280
violent slaying was much less confined to the family and modern Britain.

421
00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:58.030
About 50% of homicides take place within the family.

422
00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.160
In Essex,

423
00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.480
in the early modern period,

424
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.190
it was only 21%,

425
00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.950
even if you include the killing of servants.

426
00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:10.210
So violence is more broadly spread in society,

427
00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.880
but the killing was rarely premeditated.

428
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:18.510
It usually a rose from quite spontaneous resort to violence in the course of a

429
00:20:18.881 --> 00:20:19.714
quarrel.

430
00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.340
In many ways,

431
00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.950
the homicide cases that survive in the wreck chords,

432
00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.320
we're actually cases of aggravated assault.

433
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.610
Jia sharp has analyzed the weapons that were used.

434
00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:32.350
He finds a poisoning,

435
00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.680
very calculated act of homicide was very rare.

436
00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.700
Guns and swords and knives were rarely used,

437
00:20:39.701 --> 00:20:43.300
which is perhaps surprising since nearly everyone carried a knife to cut up

438
00:20:43.301 --> 00:20:44.134
their foot.

439
00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.670
Even housewives,

440
00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:46.990
jeopardy carry two knives.

441
00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.120
There's a batch of their position in the family.

442
00:20:49.121 --> 00:20:52.420
They had double sheets with two knives to use about their duties.

443
00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:58.620
The commonest weapons used for homicide in this period where simply tools,

444
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:02.710
which people have picked up in a moment of anger or sticks or cudgels,

445
00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.190
oss,

446
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:04.480
fists and feet.

447
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:08.470
More than two thirds of the cases examined by sharp people,

448
00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:11.050
killed others with their fists or their feet.

449
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:15.160
These were brawls then which resulted in a death.

450
00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:17.930
<v 1>Okay,</v>

451
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:22.430
<v 0>so homicide emerges is largely a question of violence arising amongst neighbors</v>

452
00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:25.280
in the course of day to day quarrels.

453
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
It does indeed suggest that there was a degree of willingness to strike out with

454
00:21:31.551 --> 00:21:33.200
relatively small provocation,

455
00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.060
which is unfamiliar,

456
00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:36.170
at least among men.

457
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:37.970
Women are very rarely involved.

458
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.950
They turn up in homicide cases,

459
00:21:39.951 --> 00:21:43.220
usually only under very special circumstances of accusations,

460
00:21:43.221 --> 00:21:45.950
of witchcraft or of infanticide.

461
00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:50.413
<v 1>So</v>

462
00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.310
<v 0>before coming to the conclusion that this was a significantly more violence</v>

463
00:21:55.311 --> 00:21:56.370
society than our own,

464
00:21:56.371 --> 00:22:01.371
we should also take into account the fact that in the 17th and 20th centuries,

465
00:22:03.001 --> 00:22:04.980
the figures are not strictly comparable.

466
00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:10.240
Many of those who died as a result of such casual violence in the 17th century,

467
00:22:10.241 --> 00:22:14.520
you would actually have been saved today by modern medical techniques.

468
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:20.400
The crimes concerned would be down a serious assault rather than as homicide and

469
00:22:20.401 --> 00:22:21.540
what has to allow for that.

470
00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:22.523
But nevertheless,

471
00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:25.680
something was going on in the period,

472
00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.950
a gradual decline in the rates of homicide.

473
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:34.430
Even though modern medical techniques had not come in during the period of the

474
00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.560
covered by the tables that you have there.

475
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.540
So something is going on

476
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.331
overall.

477
00:22:43.331 --> 00:22:46.660
Then one can say some areas of the kingdom which should provide a special

478
00:22:46.661 --> 00:22:48.130
problems were being pacified.

479
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.010
Some social groups who presented a special problem.

480
00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:56.011
We're being pacified and it seems likely that the higher degree of spontaneous

481
00:22:56.681 --> 00:23:01.120
violence amongst otherwise respectable people was gradually being reduced.

482
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:06.130
There were limits to the violence of the period limits to what was regarded as

483
00:23:06.131 --> 00:23:06.964
tolerable.

484
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.980
Serious efforts to try to contain it and the figures suggest that they were

485
00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:13.690
meeting some success.

486
00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:16.820
<v 1>Okay,</v>

487
00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.650
<v 0>well let's turn now to crimes against property.</v>

488
00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:23.240
If violence might seem to us,

489
00:23:23.241 --> 00:23:26.450
the principal indicator of the orderliness of a society.

490
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:32.660
Contemporaries were actually much more concerned with the problem of trends in

491
00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:33.733
theft.

492
00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:38.660
Many of them believed that they were witnessing and at the turn of the 16th and

493
00:23:38.661 --> 00:23:43.550
17th centuries something of a wave of crimes against property.

494
00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:45.890
And when you look at the records,

495
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:50.920
it's always property crimes which predominate in the evidence that survives.

496
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:56.680
If you look at your handout table one that breaks down the crimes dealt with by

497
00:23:58.161 --> 00:24:02.000
various court jurisdiction in the counties I've marked on the map here.

498
00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:07.720
And overwhelmingly property offenses dominate those statistics.

499
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:17.780
Property crimes of all sorts in fact seem to have been rising in most of the

500
00:24:17.781 --> 00:24:22.781
areas of England for which we have evidence from roughly the 1580s through to

501
00:24:22.791 --> 00:24:27.170
roughly the 1620s and then gradually diminishing.

502
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:32.350
And there's an example of that in table three on your handout where we have the

503
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:35.210
figures for Chester in the northwest,

504
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:36.830
which has very good records.

505
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.570
And you get that upward trend followed by a significantly lower level of

506
00:24:41.571 --> 00:24:44.630
property offenses later in the 17th century.

507
00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:52.420
Well certain trends can be discerned then a real problem at the turn of the

508
00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:55.430
century getting somewhat better later on,

509
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.780
but when we talk about property crime of course it's a rather than blanket term

510
00:24:59.781 --> 00:25:02.330
and it covers a multitude of specific offenses.

511
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:08.450
There are two principle distinctions in property crime that we need to take note

512
00:25:08.451 --> 00:25:09.284
of.

513
00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:10.071
First of all,

514
00:25:10.071 --> 00:25:14.450
they made a distinction between capital and non capital.

515
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.010
Forms of theft,

516
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:22.030
capital forms of theft with were those which were punished by death and they

517
00:25:22.101 --> 00:25:23.720
included highway robbery,

518
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:28.990
burglary and housebreaking and also thefts of goods worth more than one

519
00:25:29.871 --> 00:25:30.470
shilling.

520
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.870
It's about a day's wage for a London Labor,

521
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:34.543
12 pence,

522
00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:35.383
one shilling.

523
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:38.100
If you stole goods worth more than 12 pencil,

524
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:38.953
one shilling,

525
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:43.730
you were guilty of grand larceny and that carried the death penalty.

526
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:46.910
Then there were non capital thefts,

527
00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.230
Petty Larceny,

528
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:52.490
goods of lesser value valued at less than one shilling that was punishable by

529
00:25:52.491 --> 00:25:53.300
whipping,

530
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.520
so they distinguished capital and non capital.

531
00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:56.623
Secondly,

532
00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.720
they distinguished forms of property offense,

533
00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.930
which were clergy payable and those which were non clergy table.

534
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:04.543
What did that mean?

535
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:10.040
A clergy or bill offense was one which was subject to benefit of clergy,

536
00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.020
benefit of clergy.

537
00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:13.363
That meant

538
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:19.070
that a person found guilty even of a capital crime,

539
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.640
could escape hanging by claiming benefit of clergy by claiming to be a member of

540
00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:25.970
the clergy.

541
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:28.250
It was a hangover from the medieval laws,

542
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:32.660
which had exempted the clergy from the jurisdiction of the state's courts by

543
00:26:32.661 --> 00:26:33.231
this period.

544
00:26:33.231 --> 00:26:34.490
It was a complete fiction,

545
00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:38.570
but they continued to use it in the procedures of the courts.

546
00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:43.890
You proved that you deserve to benefit of clergy by proving that you could read

547
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:48.540
and you proved that you could read by reading what was known as the neck verse

548
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:50.250
because it saved your neck.

549
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:54.570
The neck verse Psalm 51 verse one it's very appropriate.

550
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.250
Have mercy upon me.

551
00:26:56.251 --> 00:26:57.084
Oh Lord.

552
00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.250
According to thy loving kindness,

553
00:26:59.490 --> 00:27:01.860
according to the multitude of thy tender mercies,

554
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:04.110
blot out my transgression.

555
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.050
If you could read that successfully,

556
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:08.100
you would be spared.

557
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:10.950
Grand Larceny was clergy table.

558
00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:15.480
Though some offenses were considered so serious that clergy was not permitted.

559
00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.950
Housebreaking burglary,

560
00:27:16.951 --> 00:27:17.850
highway robbery,

561
00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:19.530
and some other offenses,

562
00:27:20.610 --> 00:27:24.300
clergy applied only to men because only men could be members of the clergy,

563
00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:29.690
but a woman found guilty of a capital offense was allowed to plead her belly as

564
00:27:30.061 --> 00:27:30.894
they put it.

565
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:33.870
That's to say she could claim that she believed herself to be pregnant.

566
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.731
If so,

567
00:27:35.731 --> 00:27:36.600
she would be spared.

568
00:27:36.601 --> 00:27:41.601
Since it was clearly unjust to hang a pregnant woman and if so spared,

569
00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.060
she might ultimately be reprieved after the birth of the child.

570
00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:48.990
So much for definitions.

571
00:27:48.991 --> 00:27:53.991
Then the problem in discussing property crime is that though one can understand

572
00:27:54.481 --> 00:27:56.310
the system of how they dealt with it well enough,

573
00:27:56.311 --> 00:28:01.311
it's impossible to establish the actual incidents of these crimes because what

574
00:28:01.921 --> 00:28:05.310
we have in the court records are not the records of all crimes committed,

575
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:10.700
but simply the records of those that got prosecuted and that leaves us with what

576
00:28:11.431 --> 00:28:16.431
people refer to as the dark number of offenses that we just don't know about.

577
00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:19.470
In 1596 for example,

578
00:28:19.471 --> 00:28:23.370
one justice of the peace for Somerset said that in his opinion,

579
00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.810
only about a fifth of the property offenses which were committed ever came

580
00:28:27.811 --> 00:28:28.890
before the courts.

581
00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.160
The rest went on prosecuted largely because people didn't consider it worth the

582
00:28:34.201 --> 00:28:38.700
time and trouble and charge of bringing a case over over goods,

583
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:39.870
which were of low value.

584
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:42.263
Nevertheless,

585
00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.010
as the figures show,

586
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:49.740
there was a considerable rise in the numbers of people who were prosecuted at

587
00:28:49.741 --> 00:28:52.230
the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries

588
00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.990
that might possibly be accounted for partly by population rise,

589
00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:02.910
but also there appears to have been a real increase over and above what can be

590
00:29:02.911 --> 00:29:05.610
accounted for by simply a rising population.

591
00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.180
So then are we dealing with a real increase in property crime,

592
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:12.300
a crime wave under Elizabeth and the early Stuart's,

593
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:14.010
or on the other hand,

594
00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.750
is it just a tightening up of the law,

595
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.400
not an increase in crime,

596
00:29:17.401 --> 00:29:19.230
but an increase in prosecution?

597
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:21.811
Well,

598
00:29:21.811 --> 00:29:23.610
I'd suggest that it was a bit of both

599
00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.810
in considering the problem.

600
00:29:27.811 --> 00:29:27.921
It's,

601
00:29:27.921 --> 00:29:30.480
it's helpful to ask the simple questions,

602
00:29:30.481 --> 00:29:30.660
you know,

603
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:31.680
who were the thieves,

604
00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.040
what were the circumstances of their offenses and so forth.

605
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:40.290
There's very little evidence in the court record hoards of the existence of a

606
00:29:40.291 --> 00:29:43.570
professional criminal class in England.

607
00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.820
It certainly existed in London.

608
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.610
London is another special case in London.

609
00:29:48.611 --> 00:29:52.090
Certainly had a core of professional criminals,

610
00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:53.283
but elsewhere,

611
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:58.320
it's rare to find people repeatedly prosecuted in the courts from whom for whom

612
00:29:58.991 --> 00:30:01.510
one can reconstruct a criminal career.

613
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:03.310
They exist and their careers.

614
00:30:03.311 --> 00:30:07.990
We're not necessarily cut off by being hanged for their first defense as we'll

615
00:30:07.991 --> 00:30:08.824
see,

616
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.840
but they seem to have been few of them.

617
00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:14.800
The nearest thing you get to a criminal class in the countryside were vagrants

618
00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:18.580
who might steal as part of the way in which they manage to get by.

619
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:23.170
And occasionally delinquent families in particular villages who seem to have

620
00:30:23.171 --> 00:30:26.890
been held responsible for a lot of petty offenses.

621
00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:27.551
Uh,

622
00:30:27.551 --> 00:30:30.850
in one village I worked on in Lancashire,

623
00:30:30.851 --> 00:30:31.684
for example,

624
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:36.190
there was a man who was known locally by the nickname desperate Tom.

625
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:37.630
Uh,

626
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:40.540
because of the frequency with which he was involved in petty crime.

627
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:42.190
Of one kind or another.

628
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.180
There were such people but not a professional criminal class in the sense that

629
00:30:46.181 --> 00:30:47.530
we might expect it.

630
00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.510
Most defenders turn out to have been drawn from the lowest ranks of the rural

631
00:30:52.511 --> 00:30:53.344
population.

632
00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.220
Laborers,

633
00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.960
poor craftsman servants.

634
00:30:55.961 --> 00:30:58.930
These are the people who are disproportionately represented.

635
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:02.210
You very rarely find yeoman farmers or husband,

636
00:31:02.211 --> 00:31:06.040
man or craftsmen of substance being press presented.

637
00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:08.260
They're overwhelmingly men.

638
00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.720
You very rarely find women being prosecuted.

639
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:15.870
Only about 15% of those accused of property crimes in the county of Hartford

640
00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:16.810
Cheer,

641
00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:17.421
for example,

642
00:31:17.421 --> 00:31:21.370
to the north of London were women and other counties have similar figures.

643
00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:27.280
Most of the offenses they committed also turn out to have been rather

644
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:29.290
opportunistic acts.

645
00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:33.070
What you get is someone stealing perhaps a small animal,

646
00:31:33.071 --> 00:31:36.490
which it's strayed or taking small goods,

647
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:42.120
which they happened to have the opportunity to pilfer and most students of the

648
00:31:42.641 --> 00:31:44.650
problem suggest that for many of the rural,

649
00:31:44.651 --> 00:31:45.484
poor,

650
00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:49.210
occasional petty pilfering of that kind may have been part and parcel of the way

651
00:31:49.211 --> 00:31:50.110
they got by.

652
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:56.040
That certainly brought out vividly in years of bad harvest or trade depression

653
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:58.630
in the town of Manchester.

654
00:31:58.631 --> 00:31:59.530
For example,

655
00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:02.050
in the fairly normal years,

656
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:07.230
1615 to 1621 there were about 13 people tried for property offenses each year in

657
00:32:10.511 --> 00:32:15.511
the bad harvest year of 1622 to 1623 the finger shot up to 38 and that kind of

658
00:32:17.051 --> 00:32:22.051
fluctuation in particular crisis years is something that has been found in every

659
00:32:23.171 --> 00:32:24.970
county that's been studied.

660
00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.720
Sometimes you have the detailed circumstances of cases in the examinations or

661
00:32:31.721 --> 00:32:36.721
the confessions of those who were brought to trial and that provides supporting

662
00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:38.080
evidence.

663
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:38.913
For example,

664
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.350
in 1626 in your county of Worcestershire,

665
00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:47.650
a man called William Bride was prosecuted for stealing a sheep and he said he

666
00:32:48.171 --> 00:32:52.340
confessed and said in his own defense that the same ship was rotten.

667
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:56.930
That's to say it was sick and that he took it for one to food to relieve his

668
00:32:56.931 --> 00:32:58.820
wife or again,

669
00:32:58.821 --> 00:33:00.950
in 1623 Robert Whitehead,

670
00:33:00.951 --> 00:33:05.951
a laborer from the village of Tiling and Essex stole and with his family,

671
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:11.710
ate a sheep and he confessed and said that he did it having a wife and seven

672
00:33:12.111 --> 00:33:14.420
small children and being hungry.

673
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:19.520
They actually identified him as the teeth because they found a skin of the sheep

674
00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:20.540
in his cottage.

675
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:21.523
It had been eaten.

676
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.800
These things considered,

677
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:29.780
it may very well appear that the general rise in the incidence of theft in the

678
00:33:29.781 --> 00:33:32.630
court records at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries,

679
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:37.840
especially these petty thefts may relate to the general process of polarization

680
00:33:38.931 --> 00:33:39.950
of the rural poor,

681
00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:45.340
which we've already observed being at its worst in this period and as an

682
00:33:45.681 --> 00:33:46.640
excellent study of this,

683
00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:50.570
which you find on the reading list by Peter Lawson called property crime and

684
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:51.620
hard times.

685
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:53.361
However,

686
00:33:53.361 --> 00:33:55.400
of course that's only part of the explanation.

687
00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:59.390
One can't simply equate poverty and theft.

688
00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:04.660
Clearly most of the poor didn't steal and of those who did not all were

689
00:34:06.531 --> 00:34:11.531
prosecuted and various other considerations are at work in the kinds of figures

690
00:34:12.051 --> 00:34:13.730
that we have from the court records.

691
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:20.710
Often cases weren't brought because victims of crime simply couldn't be bothered

692
00:34:21.801 --> 00:34:26.801
with the expense and trouble involved having to bring a case of themselves,

693
00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.670
especially if the goods had been recovered,

694
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:35.840
which they sometimes where when goods were found missing those off to search by

695
00:34:35.841 --> 00:34:36.674
the constable.

696
00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:37.790
If they were recovered,

697
00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:41.510
the victim quite frequently declined to prosecute.

698
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:45.140
That was sometimes partly out of pity for the thief,

699
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:49.820
not least because the person responsible and might very often be a neighbor,

700
00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:51.470
someone well known to them.

701
00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:57.080
There was definitely a preference for mediation in settling disputes of all

702
00:34:57.081 --> 00:34:58.430
kinds at the local level.

703
00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:00.500
The early 17th century clergyman,

704
00:35:00.501 --> 00:35:05.501
George Herbert clergymen and poet wrote and advised that in such cases,

705
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:12.080
gentle and neighborly admonition was the best course to take.

706
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:17.500
One should prosecute in the courts only if a delinquent persisted in delinquent

707
00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:19.033
activity.

708
00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.310
So what it is you

709
00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:28.120
in understanding how these cases came up to be recorded in the court records is

710
00:35:29.031 --> 00:35:34.031
of course the whole tenor of social relationships within particular

711
00:35:34.041 --> 00:35:34.874
neighborhoods.

712
00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.380
And it's not surprising that people have found when they looked very closely at

713
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:45.090
cases heard in the courts that those who were prosecuted as Steve's very often

714
00:35:45.091 --> 00:35:46.740
have particular characteristics.

715
00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:48.510
They were often outsiders,

716
00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:50.700
not members of the village community,

717
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:53.550
not sheltered by being known,

718
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:56.400
perhaps even liked within the village.

719
00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:57.653
They will often,

720
00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:00.330
if they weren't outside as very marginal people,

721
00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:03.660
the kind of people who were accused of witchcraft,

722
00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:04.494
for example,

723
00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:10.160
they were sometimes known delinquents who had finally exhausted the patients of

724
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:14.460
the local community by persisting in their activities.

725
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.960
But even when they were actually brought before the courts,

726
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:23.990
there were various ways in which the full rigor of the law could be spared.

727
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:30.480
Sometimes having brought a prosecution in order to scare someone,

728
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:36.680
the victim would allow it to lapse by not turning up to see the case through the

729
00:36:36.871 --> 00:36:37.830
grand jury's,

730
00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.870
which had to look at the cases in the courts,

731
00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:41.610
vetter d indictments,

732
00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.180
which were brought before them very carefully and they could be very

733
00:36:45.181 --> 00:36:50.070
conscientious in weeding out cases in which they considered the evidence to be

734
00:36:50.071 --> 00:36:53.850
deficient or they suspected that there might be an element of malice.

735
00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:58.380
In the prosecution or were they simply decided that in the circumstances of the

736
00:36:58.381 --> 00:37:00.240
case they were going to be merciful.

737
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:04.500
They vetted each case if they wanted it to go to trial.

738
00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.270
They endorsed the indictment,

739
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.170
biller Vera,

740
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:07.980
a true bill,

741
00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.710
and it went forward if they thought it could be,

742
00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:12.030
it should lapse.

743
00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.370
They endorsed the bill ignoramus.

744
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.740
They wrote the word ignoramus on the bill.

745
00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:17.251
Literally,

746
00:37:17.251 --> 00:37:20.760
we do not know and the case would be dropped

747
00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:26.940
in the county of Sussex in the early 17th century,

748
00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.440
as many as a quarter of indictments were actually dropped in this way by the

749
00:37:31.441 --> 00:37:34.230
grand jury or again,

750
00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.200
if the case came to trial trial,

751
00:37:37.201 --> 00:37:41.100
juries of neighbors frequently failed to convict.

752
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:46.910
Some of them were moved probably by a degree of compassion for the person before

753
00:37:48.601 --> 00:37:49.434
them.

754
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:54.150
They frequently indulged in the practice of reducing the valuation of the goods

755
00:37:54.151 --> 00:37:58.500
which had been stolen so that a person would get a lesser conviction.

756
00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.400
So for example,

757
00:37:59.401 --> 00:38:04.401
they may might have someone before them for stealing a sheep valued at two

758
00:38:04.561 --> 00:38:05.394
shillings,

759
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:07.980
which would have carried the death penalty.

760
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:12.540
They decided that the person needs punishing but not that severely and so they

761
00:38:12.541 --> 00:38:13.351
would find them guilty,

762
00:38:13.351 --> 00:38:16.830
but reduces the value of the sheep to 10 or 11 pounds,

763
00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:22.400
which would mean petty larceny and the person concerned would be whipped rather

764
00:38:22.531 --> 00:38:23.364
than hand.

765
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.640
All of that was extremely common.

766
00:38:26.641 --> 00:38:27.211
For example,

767
00:38:27.211 --> 00:38:32.010
in Elizabeth and Essex of fifth of all property offenses had the valuation

768
00:38:32.011 --> 00:38:33.930
reduced in that manner.

769
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:36.071
I'd finally,

770
00:38:36.071 --> 00:38:37.720
there was use of benefit of clergy.

771
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:42.820
This was very important indeed in Elizabeth and Essex,

772
00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.880
only a tiny proportion of those who were convicted of stealing sheep,

773
00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:49.990
which was clergy bubble.

774
00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:52.750
We're actually sentenced to hang.

775
00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.680
It could be as low as 6% in particular years.

776
00:38:56.681 --> 00:38:59.350
The rest were permitted clergy,

777
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:04.090
and since the levels of literacy were so low in this period that it seems highly

778
00:39:04.091 --> 00:39:08.090
unlikely that such a high proportion of of,

779
00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:08.350
of,

780
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:10.930
of felons could actually read.

781
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.960
It's perfectly clear that the magistrates and the judges were permitting any

782
00:39:16.061 --> 00:39:18.520
kind of stumbling through the next verse,

783
00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.750
often from memory,

784
00:39:19.751 --> 00:39:24.751
probably in order to allow them to have this means of escaping the death penalty

785
00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.340
of that,

786
00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:32.340
to give you the precise figures of 790 people who were allowed to attempt to

787
00:39:33.671 --> 00:39:36.970
read in the courts of Elizabeth and Essex,

788
00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:39.640
only nine failed to do so

789
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.950
and finally convicted and condemned felons were not infrequently reprieved.

790
00:39:47.951 --> 00:39:51.280
If the judge thought that there was a case for mercy,

791
00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:55.240
the judge ended every asides caught by recommending those who would be

792
00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:56.253
reprieved,

793
00:39:56.350 --> 00:40:00.520
especially if there were respectable members of the community who are willing to

794
00:40:00.521 --> 00:40:01.354
speak for them.

795
00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:08.260
All of this goes to show quite clearly that the apparent savagery of the law did

796
00:40:08.261 --> 00:40:13.261
not in practice vent itself on people quite as severely as one might suspect or

797
00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:17.410
certainly not in an unrestrained manner.

798
00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:22.720
It was used with a great deal of discretion and discretion in the way the law

799
00:40:22.721 --> 00:40:27.040
was used as something of a keyword for historians of criminal justice in this

800
00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:27.873
period.

801
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:32.880
That issue discretion and how it was used is absolutely central to the two

802
00:40:33.581 --> 00:40:38.581
classic articles which you'll be reading for next week's section in one of them.

803
00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:44.170
Douglas Haye has argued that this use of discretion was a quite calculated

804
00:40:44.171 --> 00:40:49.171
policy by the magistrates to balance the terror of the law with the practice of

805
00:40:50.201 --> 00:40:51.034
mercy.

806
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:56.790
And by doing so to retain the gratitude and the deference of the poor.

807
00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:59.950
Make examples of a few pardon the rest.

808
00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:01.840
It's conducive to order.

809
00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:03.220
That's his argument.

810
00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.890
Cynthia Harrop takes a rather different line.

811
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:11.080
She argues that the operation of the law involved many elements of participation

812
00:41:11.081 --> 00:41:12.520
by rulers and rules,

813
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.801
uh,

814
00:41:12.801 --> 00:41:15.280
like not only the judges and the magistrates,

815
00:41:15.281 --> 00:41:17.020
but the members of jewelries and so forth.

816
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:22.470
As many as three dozen people could be involved in a case from its earliest

817
00:41:22.811 --> 00:41:25.540
investigation through to the actual trial.

818
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:30.550
And she suggested amongst such people there were certain shared ideals of

819
00:41:30.551 --> 00:41:31.384
justice,

820
00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:36.710
which meant that they tended to practice the gradual shifting out at various

821
00:41:36.711 --> 00:41:41.711
stages of the case of those whom they deemed to be truly culpable,

822
00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.150
truly criminal.

823
00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:47.750
Those hanged with those who stole for profit,

824
00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:49.610
who stole in a planned manner,

825
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:53.990
who were strangers who failed to confess and express remorse.

826
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:59.960
And she argues that this expressed what was fundamentally a religious attitude

827
00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:05.620
that all people are potentially sinful but only some are so hardened in evil

828
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:09.980
that they are incapable of reformation.

829
00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:15.620
Well these are cases you can read for yourself and debate next week.

830
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.070
So then discretion was widely used,

831
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:25.150
but nevertheless it should also be emphasized that non of this leniency and

832
00:42:25.671 --> 00:42:30.020
clemency and discretion could be guaranteed.

833
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.470
The terror of the law was often mitigated by justice and by mercy,

834
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.030
but that was at the discretion of prosecutors have neighbors of jury,

835
00:42:41.031 --> 00:42:42.020
men and judges.

836
00:42:42.021 --> 00:42:44.810
And it wasn't always forthcoming.

837
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:50.530
There was no ultimate guarantee that only the most guilty would be sentenced to

838
00:42:51.171 --> 00:42:53.690
a flogging or the hangman's noose.

839
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:58.550
And there's also evidence that in those difficult generations in the last years

840
00:42:58.551 --> 00:43:01.640
of Elizabeth and the early years of the Stuart's,

841
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:06.950
something of a greater punitive harshness was being used in the courts.

842
00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:11.300
The harshness greater than that.

843
00:43:11.301 --> 00:43:12.860
That was later to be the case.

844
00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.570
I mean more prosecutions,

845
00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:19.190
less use of benefit of clergy and indeed more executions.

846
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:23.720
In the final six years of Elizabeth's reign at the county town of Chelmsford in

847
00:43:23.721 --> 00:43:24.171
Essex,

848
00:43:24.171 --> 00:43:29.060
they were hanging 28 26 people a year in public

849
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:35.710
in the 1620s 17 a year were being hanged at Chester between 1,616 10 25 a year

850
00:43:39.141 --> 00:43:42.920
were being hanged at Exeter down in the South West.

851
00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:49.090
It's been estimated that perhaps 600 plus people were publicly hanged every year

852
00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:55.850
in the last years of Elizabeth and the early years of King James.

853
00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.013
The first,

854
00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:02.720
and those are pretty high figures by the standards of what we know about later

855
00:44:02.721 --> 00:44:03.500
periods,

856
00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:08.500
especially the 18th and 19th centuries when most counties saw only a handful of

857
00:44:08.991 --> 00:44:11.810
executions in each year.

858
00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.140
To give you a comparison,

859
00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.400
which might be more meaningful.

860
00:44:16.401 --> 00:44:21.401
I read yesterday in the Times that in Texas there have been 334 executions since

861
00:44:24.351 --> 00:44:29.351
1997 which works out at an average of almost 26 a year.

862
00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:36.170
The same figure as were being hanged in Chelmsford Essex in 50 97 but Essex had

863
00:44:38.851 --> 00:44:43.680
a population of approximately a hundred thousand Texas has a population of 26

864
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:44.513
million,

865
00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:46.710
so in other words,

866
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:52.640
the rate per million in Texas of executions annually is just over one one per

867
00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:56.124
million.

868
00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
The rate in late Elizabethan England was 150 per million.

869
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:06.951
The point I'm making,

870
00:45:06.951 --> 00:45:07.784
obviously as it,

871
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:12.490
despite the many mitigating circumstances which were used in done,

872
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:17.510
still had a pretty bloody criminal code and it was still pretty bloody Lee

873
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:22.490
enforced on hardened evil doers certainly,

874
00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:26.180
but also perhaps sometimes on those who simply didn't have the position or the

875
00:45:26.181 --> 00:45:31.181
connections who were outsiders who were vagrants and could not escape the rigor

876
00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:34.280
of the law through the use of discretion.

877
00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:38.030
We mustn't exaggerate the ferocity of the law,

878
00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.830
but equally we mustn't forget.

879
00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:43.370
It's very harsh realities in this period.

880
00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:45.050
At its very heart,

881
00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:50.110
we're not only certain social ideals of justice regarding who most deserved such

882
00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:51.654
a punishment,

883
00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:56.450
but also what's been described as the logic of exemplary punishment.

884
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:59.960
They believed that since they could not deal with all crime,

885
00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:03.260
they must make examples of some,

886
00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.960
and they did on a scale,

887
00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:09.080
which by modern standards is shocking.

888
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:11.470
<v 1>Okay.</v>

889
00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:12.303
We can leave it

890
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.411
<v 0>next time.</v>

891
00:46:19.411 --> 00:46:21.450
I've gone to look at another aspect of order,

892
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:22.583
the

893
00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:26.340
small scale forms of popular protest,

894
00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.710
demonstrations and riots,

895
00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:30.630
which one finds in this period.
