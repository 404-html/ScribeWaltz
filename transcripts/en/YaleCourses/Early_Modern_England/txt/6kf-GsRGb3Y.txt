Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay, well last time we looked at the early tutors reestablishing the authority of the monarchy and now we turn towards what was to prove one of the biggest problems for most of the 16th century. The question of the authority of the church and of the nature of English religion. Um, let's start by taking you to a couple of places. A few miles north of the city of Cambridge in the Fed lands the flatlands stretching up to towards the sea. Uh, there lies the small city of Ely, which has one of the greatest of English cathedrals in it. Um, Eley Cathedral dates back to the 12th century. And, uh, when you go there, um, the main nave of the Cathedral is a magnificent Norman architecture, uh, but rather gloomy. Um, but at the bottom of the name there's a little door which leads through to the lady chapel. And if you go through there, you get struck almost immediately by dazzling light.

Speaker 1:          01:03          You find yourself in a beautiful chapel, late medieval chapel with vast windows glazed in clear glass with the light streaming through on a sunny day. It's quite an astonishing contrast. And it's only when your eyes get used to light that you notice that in the stone tracery of the windows, there are niches where once statues stood, some of them are still there with the heads broken off for half the status. You still there and here and there in the white glass in the windows, uh, you see a little bit of stained glass that they found and replaced in what were once windows full of stained glass pictures. So that's Ely cathedral. If we go a couple of hundred miles north to North Yorkshire, there's a little church there called Saint Agatha's ease be, it lies by the river, not far from the town of Richmond, which I was talking about last week. Uh, and at DSP there's a tiny 12th century church, Saint Agatha's.

Speaker 1:          02:04          Um, the windows are very small. Um, and when you go in it's exceedingly dim. But again, when your eyes adjust to the light, you notice on the walls faded war paintings, which were probably put there sometime early in the 13th century. Um, there's Adam and eve. Uh, there's the Nativity, very nice nativity scene with a very sweet donkey. Uh, and so the story continues around the walls, through the crucifixion and the resurrection. Um, and in the spaces left by the main paintings, uh, they're are little portrayals of medieval peasants at work, sewing, plowing and so forth and outside by the river are the ruins of ease, be happy, which was quite near the Church of Saint Agatha's. Okay, well we can use those two places to symbolize the way that the Protestant reformation has been presented in the historiography of early modern England. To some people it was, as it were, a flood of light purifying, racing, invigorating, liberating.

Speaker 1:          03:21          On the other hand, other historians have greatest sympathy for the religious culture represented by those faded wall paintings in the church at ECSB or the empty niches in the windows at Ely cathedral or the ruined monastery by the river east be Abby. They have a greater sense of what was lost of the destruction of a great deal of beauty in the course of the zeal of the reformation. Well prior to the 1980s one could say in general, it was the first approach, which tended to be the dominant tradition. The reformation was generally seen as being positive. As Christopher Marshall puts it, it had purpose and direction and even a certain inevitability.

Speaker 1:          04:11          Nowadays, the dominant trend is rather in the other direction, it tends to stress the destruction of the older religious tradition. A destruction, which to quote marshe again was regrettable, undesired and undesirable. So as a result, we now have a much more two dimensional historiography of the reformation. And that's a good thing. A history should involve critical examination rather than mere celebration or self congratulation. But if we have a more two dimensional picture, one which includes not only the reformers and the victors, but also those who resisted and those who lost, it's still not exactly even handed. Historians inevitably have their preferences. They tend to lean one way or the other. And this whole story is one which still engages a good deal of passion. Well, today I want to start approaching all of that. Um, by considering the nature of the old religion and the state of the Prereq Formation Church, it's strengths, it's weaknesses, uh, and those who were already there are criticizing some of its features and that will help us to begin consideration of how it was possible in only a few years to bring this great edifice crashing down at the beginning of the 16th century.

Speaker 1:          05:43          The church was of course the greatest corporate institution in the kingdom. It was the English branch of a great international institution, which gave Western Europe it's identity collectively as Catholic Christendom the church in England, because there wasn't a church of England yet. The church in England was organized into two provinces with archbishops at Canterbury and York. And then there were 21 diocese, each of them headed by a bishop. And beneath that archdeacon reason deaneries and so on, down to somewhat more than 9,000 parishes at most local level, each with its parish church. And in addition, scattered around the landscape but particularly concentrated in the parts of the north and the West where the great monasteries and nunneries, uh, some 750 of them in all the clergy who staffed this institution. We're a distinct est of the realm. As you already know. Uh, attempts have been made to estimate their numbers.

Speaker 1:          06:53          It's been estimated about 60,000 in all, which would mean that the clergy comprised about 4% of the entire national population or since most of them were men, something like 8% of the entire male population, very large presence. Members of the clergy enjoyed a privileged position before the law they were dealt with in the church courts. In the first instance though, they could sometimes be handed over to the secular authorities if they had committed crimes and they were supported by a variety of fees and dues paid to them. And in particular tides by which people gave a 10th of their income or produce for the maintenance of the church. And then of course there was a great endowments given to the Church by Pius members of the Laity. So it was a great institution, a wealthy institution, the owner of a great deal of land and property, but also a collection of more than 9,000 small Christian communities periodically United in their parish, churches in worship, in the practice of their religion, and in considering the old religion and it's nature, we should perhaps start there with the fundamentals of the nature and characteristics of the old faith.

Speaker 1:          08:17          Well, the central doctrines can be covered briefly. They were as follows. Christ's sacrifice on the cross had made salvation available to sinful humankind through grace. Divine favor, access to grace, the means of salvation was made available through the church and through its sacraments. Membership of the church was gained through the sacrament of baptism, usually in infancy, of course, and it was demonstrated by continued participation in the sacraments, especially the mass when elements of bread and wine were consecrated and transformed into the body and blood of Christ. Through the miracle of transubstantiation, the Christian life involved obedience to the 10 commandments, avoidance of the seven deadly sins, participation in the sacraments, the doing of good works and prayer.

Speaker 1:          09:18          Given that all mankind was sinful, believers will enjoy enjoined to repent of their sins, to confess them, to perform penance for them. And in return, they were granted absolution by the priest. The church as a whole was conceived of as a community of saints. And so it was possible to pray for the souls of others. In addition to which the saints already in heaven were believed to intercede with God on behalf of living believers. So petitionary prayers could be addressed to saints. And finally, the expiation of sins committed in life could continue after death. When souls lingered in purgatory, until they were purged of sin and made fit for Heaven for heaven, the living could ease the passage of the dead through purgatory by their press.

Speaker 1:          10:23          Only those who fail to achieve salvation by their rejection of the means of grace would probably ultimately suffer eternal torment in hell. Okay. Those are the basic beliefs in its transmission of these central beliefs and in its practices of worship. The pre reformation church fostered what's been described as a ritually and visually rich religion and a society in which the vast majority of people were illiterate. The decorations of the church, the paintings on the wall, like those in Esb, the images, the carved images around the walls or the altars, the stained glass windows with their pictures. All of these were to a large extent the books of the unlearned and often they conveyed the essence of central Bible stories like the progression from the garden of Eden through to the crucifixion and so forth. And he's B and they conveyed sometimes the central doctrines of the faith in visual representations.

Speaker 1:          11:28          And outstanding example of this is a 15th century stained glass window which survives still in a church near Exeter in the West country call at a place called [inaudible]. They have interesting place names in the West country. Uh, I haven't written it on the board because the words too long, but you'll find it on your handout. Darlings can leave. Um, in the great window there, they have portrayals up in seven panels of each of the seven sacraments. Each of those panels is also linked by a red line in the glass to the wounds of Christ on the cross. And the message is quite clear. Christ's sacrifice, the flow of grace along the red lines through the sacraments, which the, the, the, the, the window represents the congregation participating in, or again, most churches had an elaborately carved rood screen which stood at the entrance to the chancel where the altar was, uh, with wooden statues above it.

Speaker 1:          12:35          Again, a crucifix and Various Central Saints. Um, all there for observation and veneration by the congregation. Well, numerous other images and pictures would adorn the side chapels of the churches. They would be alters dedicated to particular saints and so forth. At indeed this devotion to the saints, it was a particularly marked characteristic of late medieval popular religion. Images and shrines and relics of the saints were much venerated and much visited. Uh, there were some very great centers of pilgrimage. Um, in Canterbury Cathedral was the shrine of Saint Thomas, Rebecca to 12th century English. St and Walsingham was a shrine dedicated to the virgin. A Durham was the shrine of Saint Cuthbert. The Great Saxon Saint of the north of England. And so one could go on. These were the great shrines, but there were also many lesser localized places which were visited by pilgrims from the area round about and they would make donations to beautify the images at the alternate the saints and to maintain their shrines.

Speaker 1:          13:52          For example, down near Exeter, again, there was a local saint called Saint Sidwell, sid w, e double l. She was, uh, a Celtic Marta from the early days of the church in Britain and record survive of the gifts that people made to St Sidwell. Uh, in Exeter. Um, one person gave her wedding ring too since it will, uh, girdles were given to adorn the statue rosary beads of fine quality. We're given to be hung about the statue. Uh, there was money given for renewing the gilding on since it will statue. One person even gave money to buy her a new pair of velvet slippers.

Speaker 1:          14:38          And in return, people of course made petitionary prayers to the saints. You could borrow the girdles to lay across a woman in childbirth, which was thought to protect her. Well, obviously this was a system which could offer a great deal of comfort, but at the same time it could be open to the risk of corruption. It could obscure people's focus upon the central doctrines of the faith and substitute devotion to particular saints cults and The Times Expectations of an almost mechanical manipulation of the powers of particular saints in response to acts of veneration and donations. Uh, Erasmus of Rotterdam, the great humanist scholar of the early 16th century who taught at the University of Cambridge for a while, um, was deeply critical of all this. He wanted a simpler, more Bible centered faith and he joked in one of his, one of his essays, uh, about how they were enough pieces of the true cross or alleged pieces of the true cross in churches in Europe that if you've got them all together, you could build Noah's Ark. So Erasmus was prepared to scoff at all of this and he wasn't alone.

Speaker 1:          15:56          There was undoubtedly a, an accretion of superstitious practices around these forms of devotion, which is scrupulous churchmen like Erasmus found very hard to take. And some of the saints who were venerated but rather dubious provenance all over the country. There were holy wells and holy trees where people would hang gifts and offerings and make requests for assistance. Many of these were very dubious origins and probably had originated as Celtic water spirits and tree spirits, which had been gradually incorporated into the local practice of Christianity in the early Middle Ages. And then of course there was a whole business of the relics, the Abbey of Barry Saint Edmonds, which lies about halfway between Cambridge and knowledge, had quite a collection. They had the clippings from Saint Edmonds nails. They had the coals with which Saint Lawrence had been toasted to death. They had, so Thomas Tank, Thomas of Canterbury's pen knife, and one of his boots, all of which were objects of veneration.

Speaker 1:          17:09          Well, a lot of this was clearly very far from being impeccably Christian. It was the product of the medieval churches, toleration of what people refer to as syncretism. That's the word, the blending together of different religious traditions, the Christianizing of some older traditions like those holy wells and sacred trees and so forth. And at times it could undoubtedly be hard to draw the line between where Christian devotion to the saints ended and superstitious practices began. Okay. Well the older historiography tended to lay a lot of emphasis on that kind of thing, stressing the corruption and degeneracy of the old church and the compromised nature of it's spirituality. But more recently in the work of historians like JJ scares brick and Damian Duffy and Christopher, hey, all of whom are on our reading lists, there's been a tendency to point out instead the soundness of some of the core elements of worship and to argue that whatever its faults, the pre reformation religious system was in fact hugely successful and hugely popular, far from being a sort of rotten tree ready to fall before the first blast of reforming wind.

Speaker 1:          18:40          Christopher Haigh argues that late medieval Catholic Christianity, to quote him, was not only secure in early modern England, but also luxuriant and energetic and the strongest arguments in favor of such views derived from the evidence of energetic commitment to conventional devotions at the lowest level, at the level of the parish. Um, there, there are three major sources of such evidence which people draw upon. Um, first of all, there are people's wills. Most of them from the early 16th century leave some bequest to religion. Um, the requests, the bequest of money for services for the beautification of churches and so forth. Uh, one of the most spectacular examples as a man of mentioned before, the extremely wealthy Robert Janice of the city of Norwich who, um, left when he died in the 1520s, uh, the greater part of his fortune for religious purposes, you'd have to 1400 pounds in all which I was trying to translate into modern money.

Speaker 1:          19:50          Um, it's difficult to do that, but five or $6 million perhaps left to religious purposes in modern equivalent. And there was a particular focus in such pious bequests upon the endowing of prayers and masses for dead souls. Robert Janice, for example, of his 1400 pounds laid down that 800 of it was to be spent on paying pre priests to say prayers for his soul and for all other Christian souls. And in addition, he provided 400 pounds, a four masses, which should be said for the same, dedicated to the same purpose. So pious bequests is one form of evidence of this enthusiasm and involvement. Secondly, there are church wardens, accounts, the account books of parish churches which sometimes survive and they reveal the substantial sums of money which people raised and spent on their churches, on the fabric of the church, and it's rebuilding and beautification and on its furnishings.

Speaker 1:          20:52          They spent far more on such purposes than they ever paid in taxes or then they paid to them and oral lords in rents. Thirdly, there's the evidence of the activity of religious guilts all over the country. There were numerous fraternities or gilts formed for religious purposes where people would band together to maintain an altar and to pray for the souls of members of the guild, both the living and those who had passed on. They also often had a charitable functions, poor relief and educational functions, and they were very, very many of these voluntary fraternities and guilts, which people joined in the city of London alone. There were 81 religious fraternities operating in the early years of the 16th century in Norridge in 1500. There were 21 and even much smaller places could have them. The tiny parish of more bath in Devon, which is to the north of Exeter, was a place where they had several guilds which would, which were run by different groups within the population.

Speaker 1:          22:01          It was a women's guild. There was a young people's Guild, um, the peasants of the area dedicated some of their sheep to the maintenance of their gills and the members took turns to look after those sheep. Are the profits went for the maintenance of the guilds activities? Well, clearly there's a lot of evidence of such activity and such investment in traditional religion. It was clearly prodigious and participation was widespread. You can't gain say that the evidence is clear. It supports such views as that of the historian Richard Rex who argues that it's possible that the ideal of a Christian community United in belief and worship, an ideal which was to be pursued so zealously by Protestants and Catholics alike was never so closely approximated to as in the late medieval Paris.

Speaker 1:          23:01          It's certainly possible to read the evidence that way and at present, as I've said, that's, that's the dominant trend in historiography, but at the same time, one has to recognize that it's not without some ambiguity's. One can't be sure quite how well attended parish churches actually where one can't be quite sure just how extensive participation in parish guilds was in some places it seems to have been quite quite widespread though some guilds were somewhat socially exclusive and above all it's been said that a vast amount of the money which was invested in the late medieval church was invested for the specific purpose of easing the passage of one soul through purgatory. That was fundamental to a great deal of it. As in the case of Robert Janice and arguably that preoccupation with easing the passage of souls through purgatory was motivated more by fear than by anything else. In a sense, purgatory could have been a somewhat oppressive doctrine, raising anxiety, particularly amongst those who couldn't afford to pay for masters for their souls. In other words, the fact of heavy investment in traditional religion cannot be denied, but it's meaning is open to interpretation. Like so much historical evidence. You can read it more ways than one.

Speaker 1:          24:38          Well, you can say the same sort of thing about the evidence relating to relationships between members of the clergy and the Laity. Certainly there was some times quite acute conflict, especially over such matters as ties. People sometimes resent it, the payment of ties and resisted it or similarly other Jews which might be demanded by the clergy. Mortuary payments when people died and so forth. And then there was the perennial problem of instances of clerical misbehavior, especially the sexual misconduct of a clergy was, which was theoretically celebrate. That was the butt of a great deal of Ribald comment at throughout the late medieval period. Sometimes the jurisdiction of the church courts which had jurisdiction over such matters as marriage and the probate and wills and other things which would have a spiritual nature. This was sometimes resented, particularly by their rivals. The common lawyers in the secular courts or again, the the pump and the pride of some of the great clergy could occasion a certain amount of cynicism and contempt and outstanding example of a great clergyman.

Speaker 1:          26:00          Who attracted that kind of opprobrium? Uh, was Henry the eighth chief minister, Thomas Woolsey, Cardinal Woolsey, who to all intents and purposes, ran the government on Henry the eighth behalf between 15, 14 and 1529. Woolsey was proud. He was arrogant. He was extremely able, but he was arrogant. He held multiple livings. He was archbishop of York. He was bishop of Durham. He held other church livings, places he never visited and do the income from them. He engaged in a great deal of conspicuous consumption, building his own palaces, most of which would eventually confiscated by the, he had a mistress and children and so on and so forth. It's been argued that if few people envisaged an alternative religion before 1520 there was nonetheless a good deal of anti clericalism, which could be drawn upon when action was eventually taken against the church.

Speaker 1:          27:12          That view clearly has some strength and yet again, one has to consider whether it might be overdrawn. It's true that the parish clergy, what often not very well educated, that some of them had moral failings is that some of them came into conflict with their parishioners, but on the other hand, the crucial issue was whether they were adequate to perform the religious services which were expected of them. Their principal duties were not as educators. Their principal duties were as priests. That principle duties was sac, a Dota. They had to perform the rituals, the sacraments, the mass. If they had their faults, they also had the sacred power by virtue of the ordination to perform those sacraments. They had the power to consecrate the elements in the mass. They had the power to administer the last rites to the dying. They had the par to absolve sin and that above all set them apart and it could make them objects of reverence or even have anxiety

Speaker 1:          28:23          in a sense. Then human weaknesses could be cloaked by the majesty of the office. As for the Higher Claire g by the early 16th century men like Thomas Woolsey, we're really spectacularly exceptional. Most bishops on the whole, quite an impressive group if a lot of them were primarily administrators in their functions and seventh of the state, very often as well as of the church, they were often conscientious enough in running their diocese. So given the powers and the privileges of the clerical estate, it was inevitable. That's abuses could provoke resentment and indeed conflict. And there were occasional notorious scandals which appear particularly significant in hindsight. Nevertheless, if such incidents reveal tensions, they don't necessarily reveal a fundamental hostility to the established church. But there was real criticism which went beyond mere occasion of resentment. And it came from three sources. First of all, there was criticism that came from reformers within the church itself.

Speaker 1:          29:51          Uh, John [inaudible], whose name is on your handout, the Dean of St Paul's Cathedral in London, was a man who was deeply troubled by the failings of the church. He is a famous sermon, which he preached a convocation, which was the gathering of the Eden Clergy, the parliament of the church, if you'd like, in a sermon to convocation in 1511. He castigated the pride and the worldliness, which was, was to be found among some clergy and call. It could be said to be representative of the long reformers tradition within the church itself, whereby strict moralists demanded from time to time that the clergy should live up to the standards of their own profession in a manner which would deserve the privileges that they enjoyed and call it wasn't alone. His close friend, the pious laymen, Thomas Moore, a learned and devout man, um, sympathize greatly with college desire for the reform of clerical standards.

Speaker 1:          30:57          And so did others among the senior clergy, uh, Bishop John Fisher of Rochester, which is down in Kent or Bishop Tunstall first of London, then of Durham, where other bishops who had reforming agendas of this kind within the church. Well, most of these were elite critics. They well could say, enjoyed the luxury of, of, of knowing better, but they weren't willing to challenge the ultimate authority of the church itself. Nor were they really willing to damage, um, the practice of piety of the common people. They were very anxious not to break the unity of Christian Christendom de, they wanted the church to reform itself and all of them died. Catholics, indeed Thomas Moore and John Fisher both died as martyrs for the old faith executed in the early years of the reformation by Henry the eighth. They died in defense of the papal authority over the English church. So there were some critics within the church. The other end of the scale, there were a set of very trenchant plebeian critics of both church authority and the conventional nature of late Medieval Catholicism. And these were the heretics known in England as the law lords.

Speaker 2:          32:21          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          32:21          Lola, where the followers of a 14th century Oxford theologian, John Wycliffe, who had been very critical of the church off his time with cliff had died in 1384 but his ideas survived him. The lords where an underground heretical sect and they had survived for over a century. Despite intermittent persecution. They were deeply hostile to the privileges enjoyed by the church. Many of them saw both the pope and the church hierarchy as being a kind of collective representation of antichrist. Uh, they were deeply hostile to veneration of the saints, the Reverend's shown to saints and to relics of the saints. They regarded it as fraudulent and idolatrous. They were skeptical of the doctrine of transubstantiation in the mass, which they tended to see the community service more as a service of remembers. They regarded the doctrine of purgatory as a false doctrine, which had been late introduced into the church and they saw the saying of masses for souls as simply the mercenary racket to put money into the pockets of the priesthood. And above all, they relied upon the authority of the Bible. From the 1380s onwards, Lorillards had translated the new testament into English and copies of their new testament translation. We're secretly circulated amongst Lorillard groups. Some of them are extremely beautiful. One tends to imagine these as being rather primitive products produced in secret, but some of them survive and they could be in fact very beautifully produced, even illuminated.

Speaker 1:          34:20          So these were the lords and all of these features of their beliefs and attitudes tend to make them sound like Protel Protestants. And so in a sense they were, Wycliffe undoubtedly influenced the Great Bohemian reformer of the 15th century Yan who's of Prague and Yang horses teachings deeply influenced Martin Luther. So there is, there is a connection which can be traced. Both Catholics and Protestants were later to see the Lord's as being for runners of the reformation in England. That's a view you find already current by the 1540s and 1550s but more recently their role has been somewhat questioned or at least a potential for bringing about change. The point usually made is that certainly the law lords were present, but they were not very numerous. Well that's true. Nevertheless, there were some areas of concentration. There were quite a few of them in London hiding out in the crowd as it work.

Speaker 1:          35:31          There were some areas of the country where their influence has spread and remain deeply rooted. The Tilton hills, just to the north west of London, it was one area where they were well established. Um, there were outposts of these scattered through the small towns of East Anglia. We know about all of this because occasionally bishops would conduct a kind of, um, purge of lives within their diocese. They would seek them out. Uh, in 15, 21, one bishop, uh, conducted such a purge in the county of Buckingham Show, which is over here, and he brought in over 400 large suspects. So within a single county, there were a fair number of these people. They were nevertheless contained. The church courts where we're vigilant. There were these occasional purchase. Occasionally a Lord was burned. Though most of them, when they were found tended to recant and then quietly go back when they weren't being observed to their private beliefs. Occasionally though examples were made and people were burned

Speaker 1:          36:40          over the nation as a whole. They were a tiny minority, but they were there and in some areas they were quite a significant presence, especially amongst the literate laity of London and parts of the southeast of England, which scatterings of sympathizers elsewhere. There were even some members of the clergy who secretly sympathized with the lodge, so they were able to retain a presence. They were able to retain a certain coherence through their underground contacts, and I think it's a mistake to dismiss them entirely. One could compare them perhaps to the dissonance of eastern Europe in the 1970s in 1980s who were hard put to survive and we're in no position to overthrow the established system, but when on the lesser corrosive presence within it and when the structures of power where eventually to be shaken the [inaudible] similarly, we're ready to come out into the open when they had the opportunity and many did well between the critics within the church, the reforming members of the higher clergy and the lodge at the other end of the scale, there were small numbers of people who can be legitimately described as early Protestants.

Speaker 1:          38:09          Most of them didn't actually owe much to the Lord tradition. They were mostly highly educated. In fact, they were mostly members of England's to universities, Oxford and Cambridge, but in particularly Cambridge, they were mostly men of evangelical orientation, very pious. And when they learned of Martin Luther's doc trinal protests made in Germany in 1517 they took an interest. Luther's books were actually available in the early years after his first protest of 15, 17. They weren't actually band until the early 1520s, so people could get hold of copies from Germany and they were able to read them to see what was going on. Some of them became persuaded of Luther's arguments. Uh, the Cambridge men who included Thomas Cranmer later to be the Archbishop of Canterbury under the Reform Church, um, met secretly at a tavern known as the White Horse Tavern, uh, which was in the red light district of the town near the river still stands. It's now the Cambridge I folk museum. Uh, and the meetings amongst them were known as little Germany because they were discussing books which had been smuggled from the centers of the early reformation in Germany.

Speaker 1:          39:41          They also discussed the works of the early Swiss reformers, which were available to them. Well, the position of these early Protestants was often rather ambiguous. Not all of them had made a full transition to dock trinal heresy. Uh, one who was much venerated later. Uh, it was a man named Thomas Bill [inaudible], who was actually captured and burned at the stake in 1531. It seems unlikely that bill nee was ever a full blown Lutheran. Nonetheless, he was a passionate evangelical who detested some aspects of the practice of worship. Uh, at the time, uh, he saw it as a cluttered form of devotion. He wanted a much more biblically based religion and he preached openly, uh, these beliefs, um, in his own words, he went up to Jerusalem for those beliefs and was eventually burned in the city of knowledge building was a sort of Protestant. One could say he was halfway there.

Speaker 1:          40:49          Or another example is William Tyndale. Tyndale was the f the first translator other than the Lords of the New Testament into English. The translator of the first published version of the English New Testament. He had long had the idea that it was desirable to translate the scriptures into English. But he originally brought that project to Cuthbert Tunstall, the reforming bishop of London. Uh, he was willing to do it within the boundaries of the existing church. Tunstall however, would not back him. Tunstall, like many churchmen associated the scriptures in English with Lalande. He thought it was dangerous, so Tyndall had to look for support elsewhere. And when rejected, he found patronage from a London merchant called Humphrey. Monmouth Humphrey. Monmouth is known to have been a odd sympathizer. He sent Tyndall abroad where Tyndale eventually became a Lutheran and in 1526 produced his new testament in Germany, had it printed there and copies were subsequently smuggled into England through the cloth trade with the Netherlands.

Speaker 1:          42:07          The fact that these early Protestants were mostly based in Cambridge and parts of East Anglia in London is no accident. These are the areas most easily reached by the trade routes from the Netherlands and Germany. Well, as William Tyndale story indicates, people like him had a rather separate origin from the lol ards, but not infrequently. They eventually linked up with them. The older Lord Networks was sometimes activated to smuggle new testaments into England and look Lutheran books into England once they were banned and by the 1520s the two movements had to a large extent overlapped to some extent. They were merging together and becoming worn a critical underground. So one can say that England had a religious underground by the 1520s it did not in itself mount a significant challenge to the hegemony of traditional religion. In all probability, it would never have spontaneously gained the strength to mount a victorious challenge to the religious status quo of the kind that was mounted by Protestants in some of the cities of Germany and Switzerland and Flanders and so forth. But to say that that they might never have gained the spontaneous strength demands such a challenge is speculation. Because of course what actually happened is that this tiny minority of dissidents, actually one and what made it possible was a contingent circumstance, a contingent circumstance of the kind that so often makes history take turns which are otherwise utterly unpredictable.

Speaker 1:          44:06          And that circumstance is probably known to you. In 1527 King Henry the eighth and man who's hostility to Martin Luther and the early Protestants. Protestants was such that he had written a book against them and had been awarded the title defender of the faith from the pope. In 1521 this man decided that he needed to have his marriage dissolved. He was 35 his wife Catherine, was 40 ish. They had one daughter, but they had no sun and the tutors succession was in danger. Henry needed his marriage dissolved. He needed it desperately. All the achievements of his father and his own early rain in establishing the Tudor Dynasty. What? At risk of being lost without a male heir to the crown. He needed a new wife. He needed to remarry, hopefully to be get such a son to succeed him. The pope Clement the seventh would have loved to cooperate. Pope's usually cooperated with kings over such difficult matters, but he couldn't oblige for political reasons since the pope was in the immediate power of the emperor of Germany, Charles the fifth who happened to be clean Katherine's nephew. So these were the contingent circumstances and it was those contingent circumstances, which were to make all the difference and how that happened. We'll look at next week.
