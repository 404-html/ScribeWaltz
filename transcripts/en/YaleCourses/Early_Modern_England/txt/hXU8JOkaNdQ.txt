Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. Well, in retrospect, looking back from the perspective of the 21st century, the reign of Elizabeth the first tends to Shimmer in the historical imagination. Uh, she reigned for 45 years. She restored political stability. She settled the religious question, at least for the time being. She survived a powerful foreign enemy, Spain. And she presided in all of her iconic splendor over a brilliant court and a flowering of English literature. And at the end of her last parliament in 1,601, the 68 year old queen made her golden speech, as it's called. She told the members of the House of Commons assembled before her that they may have had mightier monarchs, but they'd had nun who had shown greater care to defend them from peril, dishonor, tyranny, and oppression. And she expressed her confidence that though God hath raised me high yet this, I count the glory of my crown, that I have reigned with your love. And she invited each member of parliament to come forward and kiss her hand before they departed into their countries. And so each member filed forward to kiss the queen's hand before leaving her probably knowing that they would never see her again.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Well, this is marvelous stuff and she was great at it. It's the theater of Majesty. Generations of historians feel the urge to bow their knees and kiss her hand too. And me too, I confess it. Um, when the present Queen Elizabeth came to the throne and I was a little boy at primary school and our teacher, Ms Cranston, the lady who taught me to write, uh, told us all the stories about Elizabeth the first and said that we should grow up to be the new Elizabeth six, which was a terrible psychological burden to place on small children. Okay. That's how we tend to look back on Elizabeth's reign. But what we have to remember, of course as historians and, and it's hard to remember, is that none of this was known in advance. It's easy to forget the extent to which her reign was fraught with crises and danger, especially in its early decades. The role of her servants in in some mounting those dangers and the subtle shifts which are long reign brought about in government and in political culture and the sheer exhausting struggle of so much of it. And these are some of the things that I want to talk about today.

Speaker 1:          03:05          When Elizabeth came to the throne on the 17th of November, 1558, it was another sign of people's continued recognition of the legitimacy and the authority of the tutor line. Even her Catholic counselors readily accepted her at session, but the situation was far from stable, far less stable than it had been under Henry the eighth, for example. And that was evident in various ways, uh, not only in the risks posed by the clear internal divisions in matters of religion about which I talked last time, but also an international situation of considerable danger. England as an ally of Spain was at war with France, the city of Cali, the last English possession on the French coast had just been lost. Elizabeth cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots. Then age only 16 was married to the heir to the French thrown and she had a claim to the English throne via her grandmother and radiates sister.

Speaker 1:          04:09          That raised the possibility of a French ambition of uniting both Scotland and perhaps England to the French crown. There was, at this time a French army in Scotland supporting Mary's mother who was ruling Scotland in her daughter's absence. That posed a potential threat from the north. Spain was currently an ally because of Mary's marriage to Philip the second, but Spain was also the champion of research in Catholicism in Europe and closely identified with Mary's Catholic restoration in England. So what my Phillip, the second dude with Elizabeth on the throne. So the young queen needed advice, she needed counsel and it's the relationship between Elizabeth and those who sought to counsel her that gives the early and most decisive part of her reign. It's distinctive political flavor as a sister, Mary had approached death late in 1558 the nucleus of Elizabeth to counsel was already forming and the central figure amongst those who advised her was William sessile later Lord Burley.

Speaker 1:          05:24          Now. Sessile was a somewhat older man. He was in his mid thirties. He is nearly always represented in television and film productions about Elizabeth as an old man, but he was in his mid thirties. At the beginning of her reign. He was to serve the queen for no less than 40 years, and he forged a very close and remarkable partnership with her, which was truly central to the Elizabethan regime. Traditionally, he's portrayed as highly capable but rather stayed rather dull, perhaps unimaginative, congenitally cautious, a bureaucrat, but as is increasingly appreciated, this was far from being the whole man. Certainly he was a very good servant of the state and he was a judicious, deliberative person and a prodigious really hard worker. Uh, he left behind him, masses of papers, many of them in his own hand, which to this day I've never been fully explored. He had the habit of working out decisions which had to be taken by setting up the pros and the cons on any question in lists in his personal papers.

Speaker 1:          06:34          As he worked his way through, he called this reasoning by question upon a matter, uncertain. It was derived from the methods he'd learned in his classical education, but he wasn't simply the queen's cautious plotting advisor. He also had his own ideas and his own ideals sessile and some of his closest colleagues in Elizabeth's first council where essentially Edwardians by which I mean they'd cut their political teeth in the reign of Edward, the sixth as servants, junior servants at that time of a regime that was governed by a privy council in the absence of an adult male ruler. So sessile was the queen's man, but he wasn't just the queen's man. He had a very strong sense of public service, again, derived in part from his classical education and he had a very strong sense of a state which was independent of the person of the Monique.

Speaker 1:          07:36          He also explicitly subscribed to the view that in England, sovereignty lay not in the crown alone, but in the crown in parliament. It was very keen on the notion that the consent of the whole political nation, Queen, Lourdes, and Commons in parliament should be obtained for any major political initiative, strong sense then of the state as an entity. And secondly, sessile and his colleagues had an agenda of their own, which was essentially the reestablishment and preservation of the Protestant state. He wasn't a dogmatist in religion. He was considerably less advanced in his religious views towards, uh, Protestantism than some of his colleagues. But nonetheless, he was a sincere adherent of the reformation. Uh, indeed back in 1552, some of the meetings about the second Edwardian prayer book had been conducted in Settles House.

Speaker 1:          08:38          So the importance of this ideological element, this ideological undertone in the politics of the early reign of Elizabeth mustn't be underestimated. Okay. Then Elizabeth counselors had certain ideas and certain purposes of their own to be pursued in a very dangerous situation. I finally, they had certain assumptions also about the new Monique and about the nature of their relationship to her. Obviously Elizabeth was a woman, a young unmarried woman, and in 1559 shortly after her ex session, the Scottish reformer, John Knox, with quite appalling timing, issued a book called the first blast of the trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of women. It was attack upon what he regarded as the unnatural nature of free female rule, the regimen of women. This book was directed against Elizabeth Sister Mary, the first of England and against Mary of Gears, the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots, who was ruling Scotland as regent.

Speaker 1:          09:54          But by the time it came out, it was deeply embarrassing because it appeared when Mary had died and Elizabeth was on the throne. One of Elizabeth's Bishop's, John Aylmer quickly was recruited to answer it and he wrote a book called a harbor for faithful and true subjects to defend her rule, but it was a very odd defense. He maintained that Elizabeth's rule pose, no threat since. To quote him. First it is not she that rules but the laws and secondly she make us know statutes or laws, but in the honorable court of parliament. Therefore what makes you do wherein his peril in salt. In short, what he's saying is that she would not really rule government would be conducted in her name and by her royal authority, but the general assumption was that she would soon Mary appropriately and in the meantime the Privy Council would assert its role in running the country and parliament would provide safeguards. It's hard to imagine any of this being written about a male ruler.

Speaker 1:          11:07          Well, such expectations showed that Ayla didn't really know Elizabeth and indeed perhaps even sessile didn't yet fully appreciate her potential. She had had a very long schooling in caution and in the avoidance of danger, but she was also in many respects, very much her father's daughter. She knew what it was to be a Monique. She had an imperious temperament and she was perfectly prepared to assert it when she was crossed, nor did she intend to allow her sex two inhibitor. In doing that in 1566 at the age of 33 in to representations made to her by a parliamentary delegation over the succession. She stated though I'd be a woman, yet I have as good a carriage answerable to my place as ever my father had. I am your anointed queen. I will never be constrained to do anything. I thank God I am endued with such quality that if I were turned out of this realm in my petticoat, I were able to live in any place in Christendom. She could play the gender card to her own advantage. And of course she was to do so many times, most famously in her speech to her troops, uh, Tilbury during the Spanish armada campaign. I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king and a King of England.

Speaker 1:          12:50          When the statements like this where repeatedly to show she had a great sense of her own capability and a very strong sense of her place as Monique and assertions of this kind where most likely to come when she felt that her royal authority was being encroached upon. She knew of course that she ruled under the law, but firstly she had no doubt of her rights to the crown. She was a Monique ordained by God and anointed at her coronation. Secondly, she believed that in her person, the imperial kingship of Henry the eighth had been restored. She did not regard her supreme governorship of the Church of England as something which had been granted to her by parliament rather it had been given to her by God and confirmed by parliamentary statute. And thirdly, she regarded certain matters of state as she turned them as lying ultimately within the sphere of her prerogative power, her sole power of decision, the prerogative power, things to be decided by her and notably they included the crucial matter of religion, foreign policy and the succession to the throne on these matters. She would certainly live, listen to advice and counsel, but she alone had the last word and she strongly believed that parliament in particular had no business in meddling in such matters as she told that same parliamentary delegation in 1566 when they pressured her on the matter of the succession. It is a strange thing that the foot should direct the head in. So weightier matter.

Speaker 1:          14:47          All of this considered a great deal then would depend upon how the queen and her counselors would get along in handling the central issues of her reign. And on the whole they got along pretty well. On a day to day basis, the Privy Council ran the affairs of government under the secretary ship, first of sessile and then as a Francis walls income, Elizabeth would attend counsel frequently, but on many days they were allowed to simply proceed with administrative matters. Sessile was given a particularly free hand in his efforts to address the problems of the Commonwealth in Economic and social affairs, uh, to plan legislation to be brought before parliament intended to stabilize and strengthen the nation. Some of these things I've touched on already, but what about those vital matters of state, the really central issues as far as the queen was concerned? Well, the first order of business of course was religion, the religious settlement. And as we saw last time there was essential unanimity between Elizabeth and her counselors on that issue in shaping the religious settlement and in getting it through parliament does. The queen's personality was to become very evident in the way in which, as I described last time, she set the limits to the further reform, which might proceed.

Speaker 1:          16:15          This use of foreign policy and of the succession were much more fraught. And here you've got a pattern repeatedly of pressure being brought upon the queen and of resistance on her part to such pressure pressure on her to make decisions, which are counselors believed to be absolutely crucial. And on her part, a great unwillingness to take categorical decisions which might prove to be irreparable and which might prove to have unforeseen consequences. She was very anxious to avoid decisions which might lead indirections, which might prove disastrous. So to look at foreign policy first of all, early in the rain in April, 1559 the war with France was ended by the treaty of Katto. Can Bracey England suffer the humiliation of losing Cali? It's last French possession once and for all, but that could be blamed upon Mary and Phillip. It had happened under Mary's rain and there was the positive benefit of the treaty that the peace treaty meant that the other monarchs recognized Elizabeth as Queen of England.

Speaker 1:          17:33          That's still left. However, the problem of Scotland, Scotland was still being ruled as a French protectorate by Mary of geese and then in 1559 Mary Queen of Scots became queen of France when her husband Francis acceded to the French thrown to sessile. The best hope of achieving security in this situation was to encourage resistance to French domination in Scotland to encourage in particularly the resistance of the Scottish lords known as the lords of the congregation who were Protestants and who are engaged in what was at that time still a largely unsuccessful resistance to French dominance. Elizabeth was willing to go so far as to act covertly. In the Scottish situation, even authorizing the smuggling back to Scotland of the preacher John Knox in order to stiffen Scottish Protestant resistance, but she was exceedingly reluctant to intervene openly to help any rebels against their true Monique. This time, however, sessile managed to persuade her because of the obvious threat and in 1560 some English troops and ships was sent to aid the Scottish covenanters. They were not very successful militarily, but in June, 1560 Mary of geese died and in July the war in Scotland was brought to an end with the treaty of Edinburgh. French troops were evacuated from Scotland and the Protestant Lords took control in Edinburgh, so that one a breathing space, but it was only a short breathing space because in December, 1560 Francis the second of France, the young king husband of Mary, Queen of Scots died leaving Mary an 18 year old widow.

Speaker 1:          19:35          She returned to Scotland. She accepted the Protestant settlement, which had taken place there though she was herself a Catholic. But she also made great show soon after her return to Scotland of the fact that she maintained a claim to the English throne, a claim to the succession. And this made, this situation became even worse in the mid fifties and sixties. First of all, when Mary married, she married Henry Lord Darnley, who was also descended from the same tutor, grandmother as Mary, Queen of Scots herself by a second marriage that she contracted and who also had a distant claim to the throne. They married. And then in 1566, they had a son, James, who was baptized, a Catholic potential successor to the English crown.

Speaker 1:          20:27          This time the situation was resolved not by any English intervention, but by Mary Queen of Scots own errors of judgment. By 1566, she had fallen out of love disastrously with Lord Darnley. Um, he was a wastrel. He was a rake. Uh, he deeply his exclusion from real power, uh, in a jealous rage. He assisted in the murder of her Secretary David Richo at one point. And in 1567, he was murdered by a group of Scottish Lords acting. Uh, it was said with the covered, uh, uh, assistance of Queen Mary herself with Donnelly dead. Uh, Mary embarked upon an adulterous affair with the Lord James Bothell, rather romantic figure, one of the lords of the Scottish border area, uh, with whom she was in love, uh, and uh, remained with him until he managed to obtain a divorce from his wife. And they married in May 15, 67. All of this was too much for the lords of the congregation. They rebelled. In June, 1567, Mary was forced to abdicate and the Earl of Marie took power as regent for her infant son James.

Speaker 1:          21:52          Yeah. Later Mary managed to escape from her imprisonment in Loch Leven castle, but having failed to re re to raise adequate support to restore her to the throne, she was forced to flee to England. She crossed the border and she appealed to Elizabeth for help in restoring her to the throne. This was highly embarrassing situation. And in this situation, Elizabeth and her counsel had to act very circumspectly. Indeed. They didn't want to restore Mary Queen of Scots to the Scottish throne because the Scottish power in Scotland was now in the hands of friendly lords of the congregation who proceeded to bring up the young James as a protestant. They couldn't let Mary go to France either if they allowed that she might in France reassert her claim to the English throne as well as the Scottish and perhaps try to be restored to Scotland and possibly to England with French military aid.

Speaker 1:          22:53          Elizabeth offered to hear both sides of the story and commissioners met to hear the charges of murder and adultery, which will aid by the lords of the congregation against Mary and to hear Mary's counter countercharges of treason and rebellion against her Scottish subjects and judiciously. Elizabeth eventually determined that the case had not been proved either way, Scotland was neutralized. It was to remain under the rule of the Protestant regency, but Mary could not be released. Instead, she was held in what was deemed honorable imprisonment in a succession of English castles. So that brought a temporary resolution to England's advantage, but it also meant that Elizabeth was saddled as what was described as a permanent and lively danger in the person of Mary Queen of Scots. She was held in custody, but as you know, almost from the beginning, Mary became the focus of plots against Elizabeth indeed already by 1572 after the first of these, some members of parliament, some members of Elizabeth's council, including even some of the bishops, were calling for Mary's head in order to resolve this danger, but Elizabeth wouldn't countenance that she would not execute and anointed clean when parliament asked her to do so, she vetoed the bill, which we've brought before her with the words Lorenzo visa wrap.

Speaker 1:          24:40          The queen will think about it, and she did for about 15 years. She wouldn't execute him anointed queen, nor would she quietly acceded and Mary's assassination, which was also suggested to her as a way out of the problem. Some of her counselors simply despaired and they were vigilant on her behalf, especially Francis Walsingham, the head of her intelligence service, but as yet the queen would not budge.

Speaker 1:          25:13          She also refused to budge on another vital matter, the matter of the succession. And here the tension at the very heart of the regime is perhaps most clearly revealed. Initially, of course, people expected that Elizabeth would soon Mary and that she would bear children, bear and air. In 1559 to 61, various candidates were being talked about, Philip the second of Spain, the former husband of her sister, Mary offered his hand in marriage, but that was diplomatically and politely rejected. Um, there was talk of Lord Robert Dudley as a possible husband, but there were problems there. First of all, he was already married and then in 1560, when his wife was found dead at the foot of the staircase in their country home, there was much suspicion that Dudley might, might've had a hand in her death in order to clear the way. I think there's little question that Elizabeth loved Robert Dudley, but to marry him would have been an active supreme political folly.

Speaker 1:          26:20          They're considered Prince Ed Eric of Sweden, but he was rumored to be mentally unstable. They considered the archduke Charles of Australia, but he was a Catholic and so it went on. Nothing had come of all of this by 1562 and nor would Elizabeth name a successor. In the meantime, and then in 1562 she nearly died of smallpox and the fragility of the situation was vividly demonstrated what would happen if she were to die. In 1563 when parliament met, it almost immediately petitioned the queen to Mary and to name a successor. Both the House of Lords and the House of Commons were involved and they were not very discreet in approaching the queen. The speaker of the House of Commons using his privilege of free speech reminded her of the history of Alexander the Great and the disastrous consequences of his failure to provide for a clear succession. Almost certainly at this point, the members of parliament were actually being covered encouraged by William sessile and the Privy Council who wanted pressure put upon the queen in this matter, but she gave only evasive replies and parliament eventually gave in and went into recess without any definite result.

Speaker 1:          27:43          By the time they met again in 1566 the situation was even worse because of Mary, Queen of Scots Marriage to Lord Darnley and her pregnancy and again, parliament was encouraged to raise the matter and did so pretty bluntly. They declared that they would not pass any taxation bill unless she replied for their petition of 1563 asking her to name a successor. That was why Elizabeth rebuked them in the words I've already quoted to you for encroaching on her sovereign rights. Those he also promised that he would indeed in good time. Mary Jean tended to when parliament pushed again by trying to incorporate that verbal promise into one of their money bills. She rejected it angrily. She told them they would not have dead, have treat her to have treated, have father, thus nor indeed would day it was right. But under the pressures of the Times there had been something of a shift in political life. Uh, Steven Alford says in writing of Williams successful and the Privy Council, these were men who were redefining their relationship with a Monique who refuses to play by the rules of monarchy and name her successor.

Speaker 1:          29:05          The role of the council one could say was shifting somewhat from that of being merely an advisory and an executive body to that of attempting to put political pressure on the queen herself. And Parliament was taking something of a novel role in calling openly for definite policies, definite courses of action in matters. The queen regarded as solely her own prerogative and parliament was to do it again very soon in 1572 when it called for the head of Mary Queen of Scots. So Francis Knowledge, one of the council told the Queen in 1569, it is not possible for Your Majesty's, most faithful counselors to govern your state well, unless you will resolutely follow their opinions in weighty matters. There was a ring of compulsion in that reflecting a rather unfamiliar set of political assumptions about the relationship between the queen and her counsel. As Patrick Collinson has put it. There were citizens concealed within subjects in Elizabethan England, but whatever her, his views, the fact remained that Elizabeth was all they had and she was secure in that knowledge. She knew they depended totally upon her presence on the throne and she stood her ground putting them off with what sessile in exasperation described us. Answers am soulless to their pressures, answers, answer lists.

Speaker 1:          30:43          No one can really say when she decided that she would never marry and perhaps she never actually consciously took that decision. Perhaps matters simply drifted in that direction.

Speaker 1:          30:59          Eddie decisive action perhaps seemed unacceptable at particular points in time and gradually it emerged that she would indeed never marry. It's difficult to believe that she was very serious. For example, about the marriage negotiations which were conducted between 50 and 75 and 50 and 81 with the French Duke of balance on. She was by that time in her late forties and it's unlikely that she really took this seriously, but if she conserved her freedom of action by refusing to act on certain critical matters, that was also just prolonging what seemed to many of her counselors to be a never ending situation of insecurity. And that was especially the case as England's relationship with Spain deteriorated into one of permanent threat, particularly after 1567 with the Dutch Protestant revolt against Spanish rule in the Netherlands and the establishment as a result of a very powerful Spanish army. Just across the narrow cs.

Speaker 1:          32:06          Again, Elizabeth declined to act decisively. There were many in her counsel who urged her to intervene militarily in support of the Dutch or later as the wars of religion broke out in France to intervene on behalf of the French Protestant cause Robert Dudley now Earl of Leicester was one of those who pressed her to do so, so did a Francis Walsingham. They were frustrated by her willingness to countenance covert assistance to these rebels to count him as an undeclared war. Spain being pursued by Privet, like Sir Francis Drake in the Spanish American possessions, but remaining unwilling or ways to openly support any rebels against their sovereign Monique.

Speaker 1:          32:55          Well, at this point we can pause briefly just to consider another dimension of the shifting structure of political life, one that you'll already have discussed or we'll discuss in section. The way in which under Elizabeth local government was gradually intensifying and in increasingly direct relationship was being built up between the Privy Council at the center and local justices of the peace encouraging an extended form of political participation amongst the gentry elites of the English counties. These were men as you know, who were very conscious of their role as local representatives of their counties who pursued that road in their correspondence with the center in their petitions and the questions they raised in their attempts to modify and influence policy. And they were men who are also at the same time, very conscious of their place in the lab, the national structures of government above all, when they periodically came up to the center to serve in parliament and indeed demand for places in parliament, uh, was such that the number of members of parliament was greatly increased under Elizabeth from 251 in 1547 to 370 by the end of her reign representation was being extended. These things you're discussing section, but remember that they also represent a further development of the nature of political participation under Elizabeth in the world, outside Westminster and in Westminster itself. When those people came up to take part in parliament or visited the court. Well, all of these various strands of the situation came together in the mid 1580s.

Speaker 1:          34:45          In 1584, William, the silent leader of the Dutch rebels was assassinated. Spain looked like winning the war against the Dutch under the Duke of Palmer, a brilliant commander. If that happened, would England be next on the Spanish agenda? This together with the discovery of the Throckmorton plot against Elizabeth provoked in 1584 a movement known as the bond of association, the circulation and signing of a public oath by members of the political nation that they would undertake to revenge any successful attempt against Elizabeth's life. The bond of association was signed by members of the Privy Council by members of an ability by the Gentry, by many clergy, by mayors of cities, even in some counties right down to the level of the leaders of parishes, Yeoman farmers, church wardens and so forth. It had probably been designed by sessile and so Francis Walsingham, but it clearly found massive spontaneous support nationwide in 1584 they also brought before parliament and passed an act for the sec for the surety of the Queen's most royal person. This legislated and obligation upon the whole nation to take revenge and to exclude from succession. Anyone guilty of plotting Elizabeth's death, guess who that was aimed at.

Speaker 1:          36:24          Sessile was also secretly drawing up contingency plans for what would happen if the queen was assassinated. He'd actually considered such things as long before as 1563 but in the mid 1580s he went into great detail. If the queen was to die or be assassinated, all officers of the crown were to remain in their posts. That was a constitutional innovation. A council of 30 was to be chosen to govern the nation. Parliament would then be called to meet and to choose a successor. In other words, he was envisaging a kind of emergency republic if necessary, resulting in a parliamentary choice of king. It didn't happen, of course, but it's still quite extraordinary. It shows just how far men like sessile. We're prepared to go if necessary, in order to secure the Protestant regime and national independence.

Speaker 1:          37:29          Other factors entered the situation shortly. In 1585 Elizabeth was forced at last to accept the need for direct intervention in the Netherlands to prevent the victory of the Spanish army and English troops was sent under the Earl of Leicester too stiff and the resistance of the Dutch in 1586 following the clear implication of Mary Queen of Scots in the Babington plot to kill Elizabeth, which may possibly have involved entrapment. Mary Queen of Scots was at last sentence to death. There's a bit signed her death warrant, but then withheld it until the council acted without her permission by dispatching the death warrant to fathering gay castle where Mary Mary was promptly executed. When the news came to London, the queen was furious. She threatened to have the secretary of the council executed and she was probably serious, but that Boyle had been lanced Mary's son, James the sixth of Scotland, now age 20 and beginning to rule in his own right, protested against his mother's execution.

Speaker 1:          38:41          But he got over it knowing full well that being brought up as a Protestant as he had been, he was very likely to be the obvious heir to the English throne in due course. So the rain had reached its crisis point and it had been surmounted by forms of action on the part of central members of the political nation, which have led Patrick Cottonson to describe all this as evidence of a kind of monarchical republic as he puts it. Of course, that term is something of an exaggeration. It's being rather playful in putting it forward for the sake of argument, but it does make a very serious point about the changing structures of political life at about what the expanded increasingly participating political nation was capable of conceiving of and even of doing their capacity to act in defense of the state that they wanted with or without the queens consent.

Speaker 1:          39:47          The queen had stood her ground, she retained the ultimate power of decision but her counselors had got what they wanted to, the crucial decisions had been made and who's to say that the delays which Elizabeth at forced upon them had done a great deal to help in getting them right when they were finally made and so for the moment had rested there. The last years of the rain, we're focused upon the war with Spain and upon a United effort to sustain it, which was a tremendously debilitating effort given England's limited resources. In 1588 the whole nation was mobilized as a Spanish armada or approached the English coast and the defeat of the [inaudible], the prevention of it's loading troops from the Netherlands to land in England and its eventual scattering as it made its way back to Spain around the northern coast of Scotland and Ireland. All of this was regarded as a providential deliverance of England from this tremendous threat, but that providential deliverance as they saw it, was followed by a hard slog through the 50 nineties the durability, the debilitating costs in treasure and in men of maintaining an army in the Netherlands, the costs of facing rebellion in Ireland where the Earl of Tyrone rose against Elizabethan Authority, aided by Spanish expeditionary force, which landed in Ireland.

Speaker 1:          41:24          As the war dragged on, Elizabeth's older counselors gradually died away. Lester died in 1588 she wrote on the last dispatch she'd received from him. His last letter was it Jim died in 50 90 sessile died in 1598 the 1590 [inaudible] saw the absolute pinnacle of the cult of Elizabeth as a kind of national icon represented in the great paintings, the white face, the great elaborate wig, the magnificent dressers and so forth. But also that period saw heads gradually turning away from the Asian Queen and towards the assumed.
