Speaker 1:          00:02          Right? So this is just B, two, five one and this morning I want simply to introduce the class and to explain, uh, what it might offer to you. Um, first of all, it's obviously an outline course. It deals with a large period of history, uh, 200, 250 years covering what I described in the title as early modern England. Um, well that's a label that may or may not mean very much to you. Uh, I could have called the course tutor and Stuart England and indeed that term is used in the subtitle. It is about England in the reigns of the tutor and Stuart monarchs running roughly from the 1480s to the 1710s. Um, but to call it that might suggest that the course is structured around the rulers and that like so much history, the focus is very much on the top. Well, in part it certainly is. Um, in introducing the political narrative, which will form part of the core of the course, I'll certainly be looking at the lives and the times of the great figures who gave their names to the age and the faces on the coins, you might say. Um, the notorious Henry the eighth and his, uh, six unfortunate wives, um, who are always difficult to remember in the right order. And Lucy, you have a, a helpful phrase for this. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:43          Okay. Divorced, divorced, beheaded, died, divorced, beheaded, survived the lucky one. Um, Henry the eighth, um, the stunning and a rather perplexing Queen Elizabeth the first Gloriana good queen best the Virgin Queen. Whether you imagine her as a Cate Blanchett or is Judi Dench, uh, she, she still has the glamour, uh, a woman who announced to her people earlier in her reign that she would not make windows into men's souls. She would not make windows into men's souls. And she's continued to resist the efforts of most historians to try to make windows into hers. And then there's the four Stuart kings, James the first described at the time as the wisest fool in Christendom. A man who after an adventurous youth as king of Scotland, became King of England, and it was said, treated every day thereafter as if it were Christmas Day. Um, Charles, the first his son whose policies precipitated civil war in the mid 17th century and who was eventually put on trial and executed by his own people in 1649, um, his son Charles the second restored to the throne after 10 years of Republican government, Charles known as the Merrie monarch, a man who was energetic principally in his pleasures.

Speaker 1:          03:15          I'm famous for having innumerable mistresses and a 14 illegitimate children. Uh, never don't know. No legitimate children at all. I'm never happier than when swanning around St James's park with one of his mistresses and Hispaniola, um, the, you know, the King Charles Spaniel, nice little black and white spaniel named after him of course. Um, and, uh, the king looked rather like a King Charles Spaniel when he had his wig on. The nice curly is as it were. And, uh, and uh, he had nice Brown eyes too. Okay. And then, uh, his brother James the second former Duke of York came to the throne and after three years was driven from it in the second English revolution of the 17th century, driven into exile later known as the king over the water by those who remained loyal to him. Well, it's been said that two of the Stuart kings were politically astute but morally defective and to a virtuous men whose political ineptitude cost them the throne.

Speaker 1:          04:26          To Paraphrase Oscar Wilde, we could say this remarkable dynasty that to lose the throne once could be considered a misfortune, but to lose it twice, suggest a certain amount of political ineptitude. Well, you will hear and read about all of these people and the many others who shaped England's public destiny and political destiny in this period. Uh, and others too. And today's September the third, which reminds me of a Oliver Cromwell, he was born and died on September the third, and also fought his two greatest battles on September the third, which is probably no coincidence. It was his lucky day. The Great Puritan General, the Lord Protector of the English Republic. Between 1653 and 1658 a man described as a man of agonies and exaltations. They're quite extraordinary figure and idealist in some ways ahead of his time on religious toleration, for example, in other ways tainted by the bigotry of his age and historically perhaps more loved and more hated than almost any other figure in British history.

Speaker 1:          05:46          So there are other great ones, but there's also a much more to it, uh, than can be approached by focusing on such figures alone. And if about a third of the lecture course is devoted to the political narratives and the, and understanding how they unfolded, the rest is devoted to other aspects of the period to its religious history, to its social history, aspects of its economy, aspects of the culture of the time. Uh, these are matters which might sometimes have been vitally influenced by the decisions of rulers, but they also developed in their own independent ways and they obviously involved a far larger cast of characters. So this course is very much about the common people to and their experience of the age as well as about those who ruled them. So like one of the Great Hollywood epics, we have a cast of millions.

Speaker 1:          06:52          That's why I'm using the more capacious, if Vega label early modern England, by which I mean simply the broad period between the end of the 15th and the middle of the 18th century, which saw the laying down of what were to become the essential characteristics of modern Britain in government, in religion, in economy and social structure, in culture, in political values. So I'm inviting you then to take a journey of the imagination through two and a half centuries. But you might say that was an awfully long time ago. This is the kind of history that's long dead, that's drowned in time. Why should you concern yourselves with the distant past so remote from your own contemporary experience? Why bother with England or Britain? Why does it matter?

Speaker 1:          07:56          Well, I'd say there are at least three good reasons for exploring deep history and in a way that takes us way beyond the immediacy of a more familiar historical world. First of all, because to do so is imaginatively enriching. Uh, it involves rediscovering the lost world and that takes imagination. Secondly, because it's also intellectually demanding. All history of course involves us in a fairly rigorous intellectual discipline. We have to develop arguments about causation, about why things happened the way they did. And we do that by establishing a dialogue between the questions that we want to ask and the evidence which the past has left to us. Well, my point is simply that that can be a peculiarly and throwing exercise, four periods of the distant past for which the evidence is often ambiguous or difficult or partial, um, in which it's produced by unfamiliar institutions in which people are thinking with unfamiliar casts of mind.

Speaker 1:          09:20          And we have to try to think ourselves into those minds to understand what was happening in their own terms, informing our causal arguments that can stretch you imaginatively and intellectually. And thirdly, and perhaps most importantly because it creates meaning. It helps us to understand ourselves in time in a deeper way by exposing 21st century attitudes and values and experiences to a much deeper comparative context. Looking at the distant past can alert us to the, to the sheer otherness of the past, to the reality of deep and fundamental change in the course of four or five centuries and to the provisional and contingent and temporary nature of so much that we take for granted today, as well as the family resemblances, which can still be found. That's an exercise which can be enormously provocative and stimulating a challenge that helps us understand better our own place in time.

Speaker 1:          10:40          Right. Well, the story of early modern England has got a good deal to offer in all of these respects. It can certainly capture the imagination. This was a time of great events. The reformation, the civil wars of the 17th century, the foundations of the first British empire. It was a time of great personalities, the rulers that I've already mentioned, but also it was the age of Shakespeare of Milton. The time of the diarist Samuel Peeps, the Protel Democrat, John Lilburn, the early feminist writer, Mary astral and so on, could go on. It was a time of great processes as well as events, longer term processes, great changes in the structures of society, in economic development, in political culture, in the growth of literacy and print culture.

Speaker 1:          11:43          And it's also the period when almost for the first time in British history, we have the evidence surviving that enables us to get to grips with the mass of the population and to explore the everyday dynamics of their lives, their relationships, their emotional palettes. You might say it's only from about the early 16th century that the sources survive in large quantities that enabled imaginative historians to approach the questions like how long do people live, um, how subject worthy to early death from diseases like the plague. Uh, what age did they get married? Who tells their marriage partners? What was the quality of their family relationships, how many people could read, and what did they read if they could read, um, how do people make their livings? And how did the economy change? What were the levels of crime and violence and how well were they controlled, and a host of other questions which are not previously accessible because we don't have adequate sources so one can begin to get a sense of the rest of the population.

Speaker 1:          12:52          And to give you just one particular example round about 1900 box of papers with founding the sellers of Worcester College Oxford, and they turned out to be the papers of the secretary of the Council of Oliver Cromwell's army and included a verbatim shorthand account of debates which had taken place in 1647 at the end of the civil war when the council of the army debated the settlement of the kingdom in the aftermath of the war. One of the extraordinary things about this verbatim account is that you hear the voices of the common soldiers. One of them who's representing a cavalry regiment keeps interrupting the debate. He keeps saying, what is the soldier fought for all this time uses the phrase again and again, what does the soldier fought for? And it's thrilling because you hear for the first time the voice of the common people erupting into the councils of the nation. Well, that's symbolizes in a sense what the available documents enabled people to do from the 16th century onwards.

Speaker 1:          14:02          Secondly, looking at early modern England can engage the intellect. The historical literature is exceptionally rich. It's very large, created by generations of historians from all over the English speaking world and quite a few of the most significant of them were well yell scholars. This literature has produced many of the classic works of historical writing in the English language and it's also proved to be restless and innovative and rather argumentative. All of the recent movements in historical research and writing are represented amongst its practitioners, mainstream political and constitutional history, gender history, the new social history, the new cultural history influenced by critical theory, what people now describe as the new political history, which tries to reintegrate social and political development. All of this is represented and much more. Um, since the 1960s in particular, it's been one of the most vigorous of historical traditions. There's plenty there to engage the intellect, whatever it is that you happen to be most interested in.

Speaker 1:          15:25          And thirdly, it helps to understand ourselves in time. Of course, all periods of history do that, but the events of the early modern period have a peculiar resonance, the events and processes of these centuries or have more than merely historical interest if you're concerned with the institutions of representative government and how they came into being for the first time. If you're concerned with the notion of the rule of law, if you're concerned with the structures and dynamics of a capitalist market economy, if you're interested in concepts of individual liberty and collective responsibility or with the excesses of religious fanaticism or with innumerable social and cultural attitudes which continue to echo in our own relationships and in our own time, if we only know how to recognize them. I mean if you're concerned that the language itself, then early modern England has got a great deal to say to you.

Speaker 1:          16:40          It's because of these issues are so alive in the literature of the period that the literature is so rich. And it's for that reason also that it's very much an international literature. These issues concerned scholars from all over the world. And as a further dimension to that too, which is that a great deal of what happened in 16th and 17th century England later impacted upon a much wider world. The history of early modern England is by extension very much a part, not only of British history, but also of American and Canadian Australian and New Zealand history. It's got things to say about the history of India and Africa. Some of the things that happened in this period left their fingerprints all over the world in all kinds of ways. I mean, they, it certainly left its fingerprints on new haven to come close to home. Um, if you look around the town, I mean, you look at the churches, the episcopal, Presbyterian, congregational baptists, Quakers, all of his religious traditions have their origins in 16th and 17th century England.

Speaker 1:          17:55          Or if you look at the street names running out of Broadway, we have golf, Wally and Dixwell streets. Um, all three of them named after three of the man who signed the death warrant of King Charles the first in 1649 and later hid out in new haven, which was a radically puritan colony, which gave them asylum after the return of the king. Uh, our suburb of Hamden is named after John Hamdan, who in 1637 stood up against the policies of King Charles the first and tried to fight him in a landmark legal case. And if you start turning to other place names in Connecticut, I mean just gets ridiculous. Um, I mean we have new London. Okay. As Old London, uh, we have no which or Norridge as it's pronounced in England. It's up there. A new haven itself is down here. Uh, we have Litchfield that's over there now. We have Durham, she was up there. Now we have Stanford was there, but uh, we have Greenwich, which is over here, same place names. They're just in a different configuration and in a sense that that's symbolic of the relationship between British and early modern in a America early American history, same names, different configuration, slightly different meanings.

Speaker 1:          19:30          So in a sense, a good deal of this is American history by extension and of consequence to everyone who's become involved in America's story over the last two and a half centuries to explore it is to explore part of your own identity. Right? Well, this course is intended to provide an introduction to all of this. Um, it's up to date. It's also intended to be very inclusive in its range and contents. We will run through from the late 15th century to the early 18th century. We look at the momentous changes and innovations, which took place in 1500 England was very much a personal Monaco. The king really ruled by 1700. It's a constitutional monarchy in which the center of political life was a permanently sitting elected parliament and it's become not simply the kingdom of England, but the United Kingdom of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland in 1500 England was part of Catholic Christendom practicing a very lively and vital form of late medieval Catholicism.

Speaker 1:          20:48          By 1700 the country was aggressively Protestant with an established church of England, which could no longer contain all the varieties of Protestant denominations, which had emerged leading to the granting finally of religious toleration in the late 17th century by 1500 in 1500 it was largely a localized economy of peasant families and urban craftsman. By 1700 it was a highly commercialized market economy, capitalistic, instructure and engaged in trade with a much larger world, especially with the east and with the Atlantic in 1500 it's a world of rural communities and small towns with only one significant city, London by 1700 it was the most rapidly urbanizing country in Europe. London had become the biggest city in Europe and the kind of prototype metropolis in 1700 London was regarded as a kind of shock city. The way people thought about New York in the mid 20th century in 1500 most people were illiterate by 1700 literacy was widespread.

Speaker 1:          22:01          There was a vigorous print culture including the first English language newspapers and so one could go on and on pointing the contrast between the beginning and the end of the period. The story of these and other massive transformations used to be told as a kind of triumphalist story and unfolding of British destiny what people refer to as the Whig interpretation of history. Very nationalistic take on the history of this period. It traced the growth from the 16th century of political liberty, religious freedom, economic opulence and world power as a kind of steady upward ascent. Sometimes it had to be hard fought against the forces of tyranny or superstition or backwardness, but in a sense it was portrayed as being almost preordained the kind of English version of manifest destiny.

Speaker 1:          22:58          Well, since the 1950s the perspective has changed massively. Britain's place in the world has changed. People think about its history differently. New Forms of history have been pioneered, other voices or now heard, especially the voices of the losers in these processes or the people who only had a subordinate place in, um, these achievements. As a result, we've now got a less one sided and in many ways a more mature historiography. We've got over the old tendency to Strut and swagger about Britain's historical road. The changes of the 16th and 17th centuries now seem very far from preordained. I'd to say the less one sided perspective reveals the losses as well as the gains, the failures, and the crimes as well as the achievements. The point is, it's all part of the story and it's all available to be studied.

Speaker 1:          24:03          Well, let's look briefly at the syllabus. It's roughly chronological. There's a timeline running through the whole thing. Um, but as it develops, there are overlaps. Um, I planned it as a kind of building up of layers of knowledge, each one acting as a kind of stepping stone to the next. In the earliest lectures, lectures two to six I'll concentrate on trying to establish some of the contexts of society, economy and government as they were in the early 16th century. I'd be looking at the household at local communities, at people's social and economic roles and relationships at the structures of power and authority as they were at the time of kings, Henry the seventh and Henry the eighth roughly between the 1480s and the 1540s that's to establish the context because as has been said, the discipline of history is essentially a discipline of context. Facts acquire their meaning only when one understands the context, which helps us to grasp their meaning.

Speaker 1:          25:19          So we'll set up the context. Then from lecture seven we move into the tracing of change lecture seven and eight we'll look at the impact of the reformation and the opening up of religious divisions between the 1530s and the 1550s in lecture nine we'll pause to look at some of the problems which were produced by the massive population growth which began in the 16th century and the economic stirring which that produced in Lexus 10 and 11 I look at the England of Elizabeth, the first focusing on the problems in religion and in a government policy faced by the queen, the struggle for stability and the immensely insecure environment which she inherited. And then in lectures 12 and 13 I'll go on to look at some of the principal features of social change under Elizabeth and the early Stuart's looking at roughly the 1580s through to the 1630s a period of major transition in society and economy, uh, lectures 14 to 17. We'll look at various aspects of social and cultural change in the same period. The later lizard beaten early Stewart period. I look at the witch craze of that time. I look at crime and disorder, a popular protest and rebellion and at literacy and education.

Speaker 1:          26:54          Then in lectures 18 to 19 we'll come to the religious and political tensions of the early 17th century, uh, which eventually exploded in 1642 into the civil wars we're trying to look at in lectures 20 and 21 and the establishment after the execution of King Charles, the first of the English republic, which lasted until 1660.

Speaker 2:          27:21          Okay,

Speaker 1:          27:21          that's a 22. We'll look at the restored monarchy after 1660 tracing it up to the revolution of 1688. Uh, that's your 23. We'll look at the rapid economic development of the late 17th century, which provided the resources to back the matter, our treat in lecture 24 which was the creation of a new state structure and the emergence of Britain as a significant world power. So that's the rough timeline. Those are the issues which will be covered. Obviously the course has an essentially narrative structure, but it's also very much an analytical narrative. It's about trying to understand how all of these changes intersected with each other, how they influenced each other over time. And I suppose that's what really interests me. Trying to grasp the wholeness of the process of historical change, how it all fits together. And that's the best reason for doing an outline course of this kind did, enables you to see these developments in the round, all the different aspects, how they intersect. Now the readings which is suggested on the syllabus, um, will help you hopefully to do all of that. They've been chosen quite carefully. The three textbooks are available from the Yale Bookstore. The cost packet of additional selections from various books and articles is available from Dakar print down on Whitney. Um, the address is given on the syllabus and the phone number and all of these works are also on reserve in the library in Sterling, the reading runs at about a hundred to 150 pages a week.

Speaker 1:          29:19          Now, some of the readings you'll find are quite demanding, but I make no apologies for that. Um, you can say it's a mark of respect for the capabilities of the students that I'm setting some pretty challenging stuff at times. But if you follow the readings as we go through, you should build up a coherent grasp of the whole period in its different aspects and be introduced to the work of some of the best historians currently writing about it. In a sense. It's a course in good lucid, robust historical pros, the readings and the lectures. Together we'll provide the basis for the section discussions, um, which will tend to develop an add to the lecture themes rather than simply repeating to them, repeating them. And um, two of the sections will be, um, visits to the British art center to look at some of the visible evidence there. Um, those visits have to be on a Friday morning and they are optional. They're not part of the examinable nature of the course, but they're there. If you're interested in, we'd like to go along okay.

Speaker 1:          30:35          Within the sense of the whole period, which I hope you'll develop. Um, you'll, you will be asked to do two pieces of more detailed work, a shorter paper of about five pages and a longer one of about 10 pages. The first due in week seven, the second you in week 14. This should give you an opportunity to develop personal interests. Um, you can have a completely free choice of topic. You can write your papers about any aspect of the period that you find interesting and you want to pursue more deeply. Um, I'll give out, um, in a couple of weeks' time, a list of topics that might interest you. Um, but feel free to bring forward suggestions if your own, um, that you'd like to investigate. Um, or things you might pick up from lectures that you want to take further and so forth. I also see a longer bibliography which will help to prepare, uh, for those papers.

Speaker 1:          31:42          Um, and which will also include material if you'd like to look at the history of Scotland or Ireland or Wales. Um, then there'll be material there on, on, on, on their developments. Also all you need to do about the papers, um, is to consult with me or with the teaching fellows to get advice on the best reading, uh, for researching the papers and, um, uh, subject to that. Um, you have a free hand, whether that's some of the classical issues of the period or whether it's other things that you simply have to have happened to have an interest in. Last year someone was interested in public health and ended up doing work on the plague in early public health measures. For example, um, we had a person also who was interested in pregnancy and childbirth. Well, you know, you can do that. There's a literature on it and so forth. Whatever it happens to be, the overall assessment will be, um, 15% for participation and discussion. 20% for the short paper, 40% for the long paper, and 25% for the final exam, which will be an examine, which you'll be required to write two essays from quite a large choice of about 20 topics covering the whole range.

Speaker 1:          33:16          Okay. Finally, um, let me introduce, um, the teaching fellows. Um, uh, we have Courtney Thomas, uh, and Lucy Kaufman and Justin Gary Vij. Um, all of us will be available to assist you. Um, in section discussions, of course, we shed the old seven sections with a quite a wide spread of times, which hopefully will cater for everyone who's interested. Uh, and, uh, we will it be available of course in office hours, uh, teaching fellows will explain their office hours when sections begin in third week. Um, I'll be available usually on Tuesdays between five and seven and on Thursdays between two and 4:00 PM, uh, in both cases, right? Other times by appointment. And of course, we're all available by email when necessary, uh, throughout. Uh, the basic, uh, teaching philosophy for this course is quite simple. First of all, history should be challenging, but it can also be fun. And secondly, if students are going to do well, they deserve attention. So if you want it, you can have it.

Speaker 1:          34:37          Okay. So this is a terrific period to study. It has a terrific literature to work on. Yale has a long and distinguished tradition in this field and fabulous resources for studying it. In the libraries and the British arts centre in the special collections. My objective is simply to encourage you to engage with this field and to use these resources and to do well to achieve your potential and to enjoy it. I've been teaching and researching and writing about this period for about 40 years. Um, Courtney and Lucy and Justin have been added less long. Um, but they know their stuff. We have three teaching fellows who really know their stuff. They have their own special interests, but they're very familiar with the whole picture. We are in a position to guide you and help you get the most out of this course and doubts in engaging in discussion with you and in discussing your paper topics and so forth. We will also learn from you people new to the subject. Always see things that one's missed no matter how long one has been working on it. So we'll be happy to do all of that. So if the course attracts you, take it and use it and use us to develop your knowledge and your skills. That's what we're here for. And if anyone wants to ask any particular questions, just come on up at the end. Okay.
