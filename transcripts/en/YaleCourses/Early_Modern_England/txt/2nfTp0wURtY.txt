Speaker 1:          00:01          Well, today we turned to politics and the structures of power under the early tutors on the 22nd of August, 1485, uh, Henry tutor who was then the Earl of Richmond, defeated and killed King Richard the third at the battle of Bosworth field, a battlefield, which is located in central England and the county of Leicestershire, and was crowned upon the battlefield with the crown, which was found in the king's tent and became king as Henry the seventh. Now, in fact, his claim to the throne was somewhat weak. Uh, he was descended, uh, on his father's side, uh, from the widow of King Henry the fifth, who had married Henry's grandfather after the king's death. Um, but that didn't establish a direct claim to the throne. His claim came principally through his mother, lady Margaret Beaufort, who was a descendant of the 14th century King Edward. The third, nevertheless, week, though his claim was Henry was the last of the claimants of the Land Castilian House. And he took the throne on the behalf of that particular group in, uh, English politics, which I'll explain later in the 24 years following his seizure of the throne. He made it his business, first of all to hang onto it. Uh, secondly, to assert his authority as best he could. And thirdly, to pass on the crown to his son Henry the eighth who succeeded him in 1,509 and by doing so, he founded a new dentisty, the tutor dentisty.

Speaker 1:          01:55          Well today I want to look at some of the early stages of that dynasty and in particular to introduce the structures of political power and authority as they were exercised under Henry the seventh and in the early part of the reign of Henry the eighth. And by doing so, to show how they managed to establish and consolidate the new regime. Now by power, of course I'm in that I'm concerned with the capacity to secure compliance and obedience on the part of others. By authority, I mean legitimate power, those forms of power and it's manifestations which were deemed by most, if not all people to be legitimate, to be binding, to put you under obligation to obey. There are many sources of such power and authority, economic, ideological, political, military and so forth. And to a considerable degree as we'll see, they all overlapped and reinforced one another, but taken together, they comprised the polity of the time as contemporaries described it, the polity, a system of established government and rule.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Now, in approaching this kind of subject, it's currently fashionable amongst political historians of this period to speak of the need for what they call a new political history, uh, as distinct from the old constitutional history. Uh, it's a central theme in John Guys Book, the Tudor Monarchy from which several of our key readings are taken. By this people mean a political history, which is less narrowly focused upon the development of the institutions of government. That was for a long time the really central concern of historians of this period. They were very focused on the development of particular institutions. Instead, now people are recommending a concern. Instead with the changing context and dynamics of political life and in particular the social and ideological context of politics? Well, I'm very sympathetic to that shift of perspective. Uh, I can still remember only too well, uh, the old constitutional history in its heyday as a student.

Speaker 1:          04:28          I sat sometimes at the feet of the great professor Gr Elton, who was famous for declaring that in getting to grips with the structures of government, it was essential that students should learn to be bored. And, uh, when he could deliver a whole lecture on one of the seals used intuitive government and the purposes for which the seal was employed and so forth, he was a man who sometimes practiced what he preached. But even if the approach has changed somewhat over the years, it's still essential that we do get to grips with the institutions through which government authority was exercised. They provided the forum for political competition and they shaped the way that that political competition was conducted. So historians today are very much concerned with political culture. I've offered a definition of that on your handout, but political culture involves also institutions. They're part of it.

Speaker 1:          05:34          So we'll start by running over some of the aspects of the institutional structure under the early tutors and then look at political society and then at how political society could be animated and controlled and the authority of government sustained by the effective use of all of these institutions under the early. Now the essential points about some of these institutions are laid out on your handout. So I'll just click march through some of them to briefly introduce them. Right. Well, in 1500 England was already a very old and by the standards of the day, uh, quite intensively and uniformly governed monarchy. It had existed as a single monarchy for six to 700 years already. The origins of its high degree of centralization probably go back to the late Saxon kings, but in particular to the time of the Norman Conquest of the 11th century and its consequences. But that's not our business today. Suffice to say that by 1500, many of the central institutions of royal government were very old and had been established by the initiatives of medieval kings and reflected the relationships which they had hammered out over time with their subjects above all, with their most powerful subjects, the nobility, those who serve the king but could also on occasion oppose him and had done so many times in the past.

Speaker 1:          07:17          The king was of course at the very center of the polity. He was described by one 16th century constitutional writer, uh, so Thomas Smith as being the life, the head and the authority of all things that be done in this realm of England, the principal functions of the king where seem to be those of keeping the peace and defending the realm, maintaining the law and the administration of Justice and upholding the church, a relatively limited set of functions compared to modern government. And to achieve those ends. The king enjoyed a variety of palace. He enjoyed what were thought of as is ordinary powers exercise within the framework of the law. But in time of emergency, he might also exercise residual absolute powers, which could go beyond the normal boundaries of the law.

Speaker 1:          08:17          Well, English kings already had a very high notion of their dignity and their sovereign authority. Um, from the 14th century onwards there they very often represented in the coinage. Uh, they're represented wearing what's known as the imperial crown. That's a, a crown which is enclosed at the top, usually with a cross and enclosed crown. It was meant to symbolize the fact that they recognized no authority higher than themselves, save God alone. And though the authority of the pope was exercise within the kingdom over the church agreements which had been reached and statutes which had been passed in the 14th century, meant that in practice, in making appointments and the church, the pope usually acted on the advice. And in consultation with the king, they didn't override his authority. So a monarchy of considerable dignity claiming a sovereignty represented in the imperial crown, but high as the king's dignity was England was also as one contemporary jurist. John Fortescue put it, uh, dominium political ed. Regardless the phrases there on your handout, which meant that Royal Authority was supreme. That's the regardless part, but it was also sustained and restrained by certain political expectations. Certain constitutional institutions.

Speaker 1:          10:05          First kings were expected to take advice. They were expected to be guided by council by the Council of the leading subjects. They ruled with the advice of a variety of councils. Occasionally a great council of the leading nobility could be called, especially when advice and support was needed in the making of some major decision. Henry the seventh called such councils have is leading nobleman on a number of occasions, more usually for day to day administration. The king was advised by a smaller council which attended his person on a day to day basis and handle the executive business of government. Some of its members were great, no woman, but very often their position in the council was one which was largely on a rubric. They tended on the whole to profit their advice to the king informally and occasionally when they were in attendance at court. For the most part. For example, Henry, the seventh day to day council consisted in its principal members not of the great nobles of the Kingdom, but have great members of the church.

Speaker 1:          11:23          Notably Cardinal John Morton, who was one of his closest advisors in the early stages of his rule, and in addition, a number of lawyers and professional administrators, those who are sometimes described as men of business, the nucleus of a kind of royal bureaucracy. So the king was expected to take counsel. In addition, he was restrained by the law. The common law of England described as common because it extended over the whole realm. The king's writ ran everywhere in legal matters. The common law had grown up over centuries by custom and by precedent. It was administered in the king's name or legal writs began with the kings title. It was administered in his name, though under normal circumstances, he was expected to operate within the constraints of the law, the administration of the law, the provision of justice, and the redress of grievances. The means of settling disputes peacefully was one of the principal functions of royal government.

Speaker 1:          12:38          Occasionally the king might still sit himself in judgment. One of the courts which became most feared under Henry the seventh was the king's Court of Star Chamber, which met in a chamber of the Palace of Westminster, which happened to be decorated on the roof with stars, the Star Chamber. It was effectively the king's council sitting as a law court and the king might on occasion be personally present, but for the most part the principal law courts operated outside the royal household. They sat permanently in Westminster in Westminster Hall that still stands besides beside the houses of parliament and they were staffed by role justices, the names of the principal quarter. On your handout, there was a court of Kings bench, which dealt principally with criminal matters, the court of common pleas, which dealt principally with civil cases and the chancery the court of the Lord Chancellor.

Speaker 1:          13:41          That court was a little unusual in that it was not a common law court. It was a court of Equity Equity. That meant that in cases where the common law didn't provide a remedy, principles of natural justice might be administered by the chancellor and for that reason, the chancellor was sometimes described as being the conscience of the king could provide a remedy based on natural justice when the common law did not. Okay. In addition to the central courts, the king also exercise justice by commission. Twice a year, royal judges left West Westminster and went out to ride to literally ride six circuits going from county town to county town where they heard cases arising, civil cases and criminal cases arising in the provinces. Those were the assize courts, the riding of circuits by royal justices, and in addition, the king exercise justice through the commission of the piece in each county, some leading gentlemen were appointed justices of the peace commission to deal with crimes, usually petty crimes and other administrative matters arising. They met in a court called quarter sessions because it met four times a year.

Speaker 2:          15:07          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          15:09          counsel and law came together in another great institution that must be mentioned. Parliament, the periodic meeting of the king, the nobility, who had the right to sit in the House of Lords and representatives of the Commons of the kingdom. The House of Lords consisted of the leading lay and church nobility of the realm summoned by a personal writ to attend in 15, 10. For example, when parliament met, there were 100 of them, 50 laymen, 50 great men of the church. The House of Commons consisted of a gathering of two representatives for each county. They were known as the knights of the Shi'a and two representatives from each city, which had the parliamentary franchise. They were known as buttresses. The city of London, uh, provided an exception if had four members because of its size. Now, theoretically, the members who came for the counties were elected by free holders who had land to the value of 40 shillings. Though in fact, contested elections were very rare. Generally, the elite of the counties would get together in twos from amongst their numbers who would represent them. They were selected rather than elected. The urban franchise might vary in some cities. All householders had the vote in others. The choice of a member for parliament was restricted to a small oligarchy of the leading citizens.

Speaker 1:          16:51          Parliament then represented the whole realm and it had two great functions long established. First of all, only parliament could make statutes new laws, which could override or modify common law custom, so the legislative sovereignty of the realm lay in parliament. We had the king, the Lords and the Commons acted together. Bill's proposing new laws were presented. They were red and debated in each of the houses before being passed and passed onto the king for his consent or his veto. Now, if all that sounds rather familiar, this is where it comes from. Secondly, parliament could grant taxes, which from the 14th century required the consent of the House of Commons. It was essential that the Commons gave their consent to any tax bill passing through parliament.

Speaker 1:          17:54          Okay, one last word on institutions and that concerns finance. The king was expected to live off his own. That's the phrase they use to live off his own. That meant he was expected to live on the revenues of the Royal Land Holdings. The customs do use and other dues which were due to him as feudal overlord of the kingdom and for all normal purposes that should provide for all his expenses. The collection and the disbursement of royal revenues was handled by an institution called the Exchequer at Westminster at least that was so in theory since some late medieval kings took to handling financial business in a more intimate setting within their own household. This was known as chamber finance because they would deal with these matters in the king's own lodgings or chamber. Henry the seventh who was a notorious workaholic and also extremely tight in financial matters, actually personally went over, checked and initialed every page of the chamber accounts to check his financial situation.

Speaker 1:          19:09          Reliance on taxation was rare. Taxes would be voted by parliament for extraordinary circumstances and would then be collected and returned to the exchequer. So for the most part, the king lives of his own. Periodically taxes would be granted for special reasons. Okay. That's a quick run through some of the principal institutions of day to day administration of royal government. But of course, administration is not synonymous with government. If you want to understand the structures of power, we need to look beyond this to the larger political society within which these institutions function or sometimes failed to function.

Speaker 1:          19:58          Obviously the Monique stood at the head of the structure of power. This is still an age of personal monarchy and the personalities of individual Monnox colored and gave a particular texture to particular reigns. Henry the seventh. It was a man who seems by all accounts of him to have been of a cold, somewhat detached, calculative suspicious temperament. His son Henry the eighth in contrast, it was energetic, uh, muscular vein, a mixture of large, yes, on the one hand, uh, but prone to bursts of terrifying wrath, uh, on the other and the personalities of different kings gave something of the flavor to their range. Henry the seventh. So for example, it was only 28 when he won the crown at boss with field. It was only 52 when he died. And yet it's been said, we never think of him as a young man. His personality was such that one doesn't think of him that way. In contrast to his flamboyant son, the young Henry the eighth,

Speaker 1:          21:13          the various institutions of government of course embodied the authority of the Monique. They gave stability and continuity, but the actual exercise of power and the maintenance of the authority of government depended very much upon the personality of the king and the way in which the Kings interacted with various important groups of people, communities of interest within the realm. By 1500, they're already existed. A, a relatively broad political society which was involved in government in one way or another. Most ranks of society down to the, the principal, citizens of the towns or even the leaders of village society were involved in government in one way or another. Uh, except perhaps the very poor who were described by Sir Thomas Smith as being born to be ruled and not to rule others. But of course if many people participated in one way or another in the exercise of royal power, some people mattered a great deal more than others. And those who mattered most word, of course, the nobility and the gentry and their counterparts, the leaders of the church, and the crucial relationship within the whole structure of authority was that between the king and his central officers and those members of the social elites who governed the localities, it was those elites who constituted deep political nation proper. And when historians of this period talk about the political nation, it's primarily those people they're talking about.

Speaker 2:          22:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          22:55          Then our ability were absolutely vital into very obvious ways, which were interconnected. First of all, by virtue of their enormous landed possessions, they were the natural rulers of the provinces. Social Power and political power in the realm intersected

Speaker 1:          23:20          the Percy family, the earls of Northumberland held absolutely vast lands in the north of England alongside the Scottish border where they had the responsibility of defending the border against the Scots. Indeed, they still hold them. Uh, the, um, they've virtually ruled that part of the north from their principal castles at Anik and walk with both of which still, um, if you've seen a Harry Potter film, you've Seen Anna Cassell. Um, it was used to shoot, uh, parts of those movies. The Percys were based there and it was said with only a little exaggeration that in that part of the kingdom they knew no prince but a Percy.

Speaker 1:          24:03          Secondly, the powers of Lordship which were conferred by these great estates translated into military power. The king had no standing army. Henry the seventh was unusual in that he had a small group of royal guards permanently available, the Yeoman of the guard. Otherwise though there was no standing army in time of war, the king relied upon the nobility coming in to support him with their armed retainers and servants and each great Lord had his affinity as it was called, his affinity of retainers. Men bound to his service by ties of personal loyalty and often by formal contract they wore his badge or his livery and they were expected to follow him when called upon people as humble as farm tenants in some parts of the kingdom still had to keep a horse and arms as part of the conditions of holding their farms from the gentry and nobility in the north, for example. That was commonly the case and when called upon by the earls of Northumberland or the earls of Westmoreland who dominated what's now the lake district, they would come in, especially for service on the border.

Speaker 1:          25:27          To give one example of the importance of the military power of nobility in 1536 at the outbreak of the rebellion against the reformation known as the pilgrimage of grace, the Earl of Sros, Bree, who was based in the North Midlands was able to mobilize no fewer than 3000 men in only six days. The rebellion had broken out in Yorkshire. Sros was here. The fact that he could mobilize 3000 men so quickly was absolutely crucial because he was able to move north and too hot. The rebel advance to shadow the rebels until a larger royal force could be mustered. In contrast to his friend and former companion in arms, Lord Darcy based in South Yorkshire, sympathize with the rebels and failed to move. He sat on his hands for a while and then eventually joined the rebels. He should have been mustering his troops to stop them. That's why such men were crucial. Darcy didn't act because he was out of sympathy with royal policy in religion. Shrosbree acted and say today such men were vital.

Speaker 1:          26:43          Have you said all of this? I must be careful not to exaggerate. The nobility were rich and powerful, but they didn't have fully independent jurisdictions of their own where the king's authority didn't run. Some of the great nobility of continental Europe enjoyed that kind of par. So did some of those of Scotland in this period in England. Such jurisdictions had existed in the past, but they had mostly gradually fallen into the crowns hand and been retained. As a result, English nobles depended ultimately for their power upon grants of royal office. Their local authority was granted to them by the king king ad with the fourth who ruled between 1461 and 1483, uh, had ruled very largely by parceling out spheres of influence to the great nobility. His system of government has been described as being somewhat like the mob in the way that each of the great nobles had his Quasar independent sphere of influence, but that was an anomalous situation. For the most part. The nobles depended upon Royal Authority formally granted. Nevertheless, they still mattered a great deal. Maintaining authority over them was absolutely vital. In the middle of the 15th century. King Henry the sixth had failed to do so leading first of all, to rival and factionalism amongst his nobles and eventually to a bid by one of them, the Duke of York, to overthrow him because your cat arrival claim to the throne that led to the on and off civil wars, which ran between 1450 and 1485 usually described as the wars of the roses.

Speaker 2:          28:45          Okay.

Speaker 1:          28:46          Now, the feuding of the 15th century wars of the roses had taken out a number of exceptionally overmighty subjects amongst an ability, but in the reign of Henry the seventh there was still a dozen or so who really mattered and not just in the north or along the Welsh borders, which were areas of insecurity, but in the very heart of the kingdom in East Anglia, the Dukes of Norfolk, the Howard's were paramount in Kent Lord Burger Veni was paramount in the west, the Marquess of Exeter, the Courtney family. What paramount.

Speaker 2:          29:25          Okay.

Speaker 1:          29:26          They still nurtured that affinities of retainers. They still enjoyed great prestige as regional leaders and they still adhere to an aristocratic code that certainly stressed loyalty, honor and service to king, but nonetheless, they could be very haughty, very touchy. They assumed their right to rule. They assume they're right to be consulted and they could be very dangerous indeed if they were slighted. No two of the king was ever likely to forget that. In 1485 at the battle of Bosworth, the Stanley's William Stanley, Lord Darby and his brother Thomas Stanley brought their forces and then sat on the hill waiting to see which way the battle between the claimant, Henry Tudor and King Richard. The third would go when they decided that it looked like today was gaining the upper hand. They joined in on his side leading ultimately to the death of Richard the third and the desperate last charge to try to break through.

Speaker 1:          30:34          That's what had happened on the day that Henry came to the throne. He was unlikely to forget that in his dealings with his nobility. So then how did the early tutors handle their relationships with the various institutions and groups on whom the effectiveness of their rule dependent? I think one can suggest four ways. They did it by propaganda, by patronage, by consultation, and when necessary by simple coercion to ps two C's. Propaganda, patronage, consultation and coercion. At this point in time, propaganda was perhaps the least important of the four, but it was not insignificant. Great stress was laid in royal proclamations and ceremonial and symbolism upon the divine nature of royal authority on the fact that the king was ordained by God and his subjects had a religious duty of obedience and we the seventh was very careful early in his reign to obtain the recognition of the pope.

Speaker 1:          31:47          He further bolstered his claim to the crown by marrying the daughter of his predecessor, King Edward, the fourth uniting the houses of Lancaster and York. Through that marriage, adding to his legitimacy from the reign of Henry the seventh onwards into the reign of his son. The past. The public memory of the past was to some extent remodeled into an exaggerated picture of the horrors which had attended the breakdown of royal authority in the wars of the roses. They elaborated the myth of Richard the third as a kind of monster king. I mean, true enough. He was no sweetie, but he was not the cookie monster, uh, portrayed. For example, in Shakespeare's history plays, uh, historians were commissioned to write appropriate histories celebrating the Tudor Dynasty. Polydore Virgin Italian humanists was brought in to write one history in Latin. Edward Hall produced another history in England and titled the Union of the illustrious families of Lancaster and York, which sustained the tutors claim to the throne.

Speaker 1:          32:58          Shakespeare's history plays of course, reflect very much this tutor interpretation of history. The image of royalty was cultivated in a kind of theater of majesty, tight as he was with his finances. Henry the seventh, never forgot the importance of having a magnificent court and sumptuous clothing. The pageantry of the court was magnificent. Great tournaments were held, great buildings were erected, perhaps the greatest of which Henry the Seventh Chapel at Westminster Abbey, where he's buried. I'm still stands today. Under the reign of Henry the eighth portraiture, royal portraiture began to emerge as a means of royal propaganda. Um, Henry, the eighth doll was, had himself represented as something more than human in the national portrait gallery in London. You can see the cartoon which survives of a great painting of Henry and the to the line, which was once on the walls of his palace, uh, of Whitehall.

Speaker 1:          34:05          Um, Henry himself is shown much larger than life size dwarfing or those around him. Uh, he was indeed a big man, but he's represented as even larger than life. Um, you're probably familiar with the Holbein portraits of Henry, you know, standing arms on hips, Mac gigantic shoulders, pat it out with his doublet. Um, that kind of image of the king is the one that dominates our memory and it was meant to dominate those who saw his portraits. It's an image. It's so familiar to people in England was actually used to sell potato chips. Um, a few years ago there was a, uh, a brand of potato chips. Uh, they know locked. They're no longer sell. So this is not product placement, uh, called tutor crisps. We called crisps in England. Henry the eighth on the packet glowering out as you had your potato chips. Of course he was a king, known for his heart and eating the Nobels themselves of course, imitated all of this, the theater of the great extended to them.

Speaker 1:          35:13          Take a look in the Yale Gallery of British art where you'll see some of where we'll go there later in the term to look at some of the power portraits as they're called, the calm, proud faces of these people staring down from the walls. Well, the main impact of portraiture and so forth was on the members of the elite themselves. They were the ones who are likely to see these paintings, but for a larger audience they were precessions. They were riled progresses where the king would travel around an area in a magnificent procession staying in the houses of his principles, subjects that were royal entries to the city's accompanied by great ritual pageants, display and everywhere the royal badge was displayed. Jen, interesting topic, the, the politics of display, the art and architecture of power and great deals being written about it that interests you. Um, I can recommend some reading.

Speaker 1:          36:15          Well, the most significant then propaganda of this type and in fact vitally significant was the use of patronage, the exercise of what they called good Lord ship that involved the conferring or insignificant subjects of honors and Prestige and material benefits in return for their loyal service. After all, the interests of the king and his great subjects were not opposed. The system ideally could be utilized to the advantage of both. And so from Henry the seventh onwards, the tutors were careful to build up their own affinity, their own loyal retainers, royal lands, we're used to this end. Those who had shown their loyalty and who are trusted would be granted stewardships of royal lands where they would share in the profits, favorable leases, the constable ships of castles, officers of profit, and of course grants of local authority which demonstrated the king's trust and which conferred honor and power within their localities of prominence. Well, if this was not only to the personal benefit of the individual noble, but it also enabled such men to dispense patronage themselves downwards to their own clients and retainers, it enabled them to maintain their own affinities and enhanced their standing.

Speaker 1:          37:46          The Tudor kings had no objection to building up powerful man of this kind, so long as they were loyal. But ideally patronage should be spread around. It should be dispensed judiciously in a way that would maximize the community of interest in obeying the crown.

Speaker 1:          38:12          Let's look now at consultation. The royal court was the very center of the patronage system. Access to the king was vital and those who can control access to the king. We're in positions of real power under the young Henry the eighth. Um, the gentleman of the Privy Chamber, his personal, those who hunted and um, uh, engage in other sports with the king. Um, we're absolutely central figures in gaining access to the king. Um, a principal amongst them, the groom of the stool and office, which still exists in Henry's day. The groom of the stool literally looked after the king's chamber pot and brought it for him when it was needed. These were people in an excellent position to drop names into the king's ear, but the court was also vital to the business of consultation more broadly. Any person of significance was expected to visit the court from time to time.

Speaker 1:          39:19          And when they were there, the king could be quite approachable. Henry the seventh was quite famously approachable. He led people pop into the Privy Chamber where he conducted business. Henry the eighth was famously affable, something of a back slapping hearty type when he was in a good mood. Nobles in particular expected that kind of personal access. They're expected to be able to give their counsel informally on matters of concern. They weren't part of the regular executive, their main duties layout in their countries, but they did expect a visit for part of the year and have that kind of personal contact more broadly. The regular executive council was a point of contact with these members of the political nation. It received letters and dispatch them. It expressed the king's gracious stanks for good service. It handled all kinds of business brought to its attention. And then of course there was parliament, the greatest occasion of consultation, the whole political nation gathered in common action. So Thomas Smith said that every Englishman is intended to be there present either in person or by attorney from the prince to the lowest person, and the consent of the parliament is taken to be every man's consent.

Speaker 1:          40:45          The king, however, only called parliament when he needed money or new laws or support. Before 1529 the early tutors called it only occasionally, but then from 1529 to 1559 in the crisis of the reformation, there were only eight years without a parliamentary session and it grew insignificance as a regular part of the political process. The Tudor kings usually got what they wanted from parliament, but they did it by managing it carefully. It's compliance could never be simply taken for granted. It had to be managed, and it was a genuine form of debate. The speaker of the House of Commons who control the agenda was granted at the beginning of each session the liberty of free speech so that he could speak openly to the king. And by 1547 that liberty had been extended to every member of parliament within the precincts of the meetings of parliament. They could address any issue openly for the good of the Prince and the Commonwealth.

Speaker 1:          41:54          And these members in their turn got what they wanted. Government bills might be amended in the light of their local experience, and a great deal of private legislation intended for particular localities was passed. So parliament as a place of consultation was a very significant forum for the resolution of potential conflict for the presenting of royal policy and its explanation and justification. The tutors used it very carefully to achieve their ends. In fact, on one occasion, Henry the eighth flattered it by saying that his royal dignity was never so high as when he met with parliament and the growing significance of this institution is indicated by the anxiety of members of the governing elite to serve as members.

Speaker 1:          42:47          But finally, if propaganda, the use of patronage and consultation didn't succeed in welding together the interests of the crown and the political nation there remained coercion. What was described at the time as heavy Lordship as distinct from good Lord trip, often evident under both Henry the seventh and Henry the eighth as they established their authority and their dentisty when necessary, they would bring to parliament and rushed through acts of attainder. Acts of attainder simply declared particular individuals guilty of treason depriving them of their lands and their status. They were often used against rebellious nobles. They could be reversed in the interests of the heirs to those estates if they behaved themselves, but they had to prove themselves compliant. Henry the seventh made frequent use of acts of attainder. He very cleverly data the beginning of his reign to the day before the battle of Bosworth. We've got parliament to agree to that.

Speaker 1:          44:00          That meant that everyone who had opposed him, even though they were actually fighting for the person who was the king at the time, was automatically a traitor and their lands were forfeit clever. It enabled him to greatly extend the royal lands in one move and there was more of that to come acts of attainder where also used against those who supported pretenders to the throne who um, were folk AI of um, potential rebellions and actual rebellion in 1487 against Henry the seventh and we was the seventh was also willing to use another coercive measure. The placing of his and a bit of nobility under Rick Cognizance, Rick Cognizance bonds. They were like a bail bond, a bond illegal bond that nobles were forced to enter into to be of good behavior. Or if they failed to pay enormous financial penalties, they usually had to find the sureties from amongst their kinsmen and supporters for those bonds, which meant that those people had an interest in making sure that the Nobel man concerned, complied and would lose out themselves badly if he didn't.

Speaker 1:          45:22          These were used, for example, against any nobleman who in any way infringed the um, requirements of new laws. For example, under Henry the seventh retaining the retaining of an affinity of clients was a regulated by license only. Those who are licensed to do so could retain armed retainers and they were forbidden from retaining any member of the crown's own affinity. You could owe loyalty to the king, only anyone who infringed that was likely to find himself hauled before the council and faced with the recognitions bond Lord Berg of any, the principal magnet and Kent was put under a potential fine of 70,000 pounds, a massive sum of money for such failure to comply. It wasn't actually executed, but it hung over his head like the sword of Damocles anti complied in future.

Speaker 1:          46:23          And then there were the laws of treason. In the 14th century, the law of treason had been introduced defining treason as acts against the king's person or his family or open rebellion against his authority. Under the early tutors, the law of treason was extended. By the time of Henry the eight it came to include even treasonable words, such as, for example, denying the legitimacy of the kings. Many marriages, particularly dangerous individuals, were ruthlessly eliminated under Henry the seventh the young Earl of Warwick, Edward Earl of Warwick, who was the last potential claimant to the Yorkist claim to the throne, was imprisoned in the Tower of London from childhood where he was kept until 1499 when in a moment of danger to the throne, Henry the seventh had him executed. So William Stanley, one of those who had supported Henry at the battle of Bosworth, fell under the king suspicion and was taken out in 1497 under the young Henry, the eighth of presumptuous, Edward Stafford drew Duke of Buckingham was executed on trumped up charges in 1521 his real crime was that he had a distant claim to the throne. Henry didn't yet have a male heir and it was alleged that Buckingham had listened to prophecies that Henry never would have a male heir and that he had made some resentful statements against the king. When this came to the king's knowledge, bucking homes, days were numbered like most nobles who fell under royal displeasure of Buckingham died by the ax.

Speaker 1:          48:13          Less a folk were hung, drawn and quartered and less honorable means of execution. It meant that they were hung by the neck until they were not quite dead. Disemboweled their bowels burned before their eyes and then cut down their bodies cut into four quarters which were dipped in pitch and send it to be displayed at the gates of the leading cities of the kingdom. As an example to warn other potential traitors and trial procedures in treason trials could be extremely arbitrary. The council could order a rest at will. It could order the torture of suspects. Torture wasn't normally used in English law. Defense counsel was denied. Evidence could be fabricated to get rid of unsuccessful losers in court. Factional struggles the very highest levels. Then political conflict was played out to the death, especially under Henry the eighth indeed, one historian of Henry the eight has said that in some parts of his reign, his court had the atmosphere of the Kremlin under Stalin.

Speaker 1:          49:25          With people going in constant fear of arousing the king's displeasure so the crown could deliver large, yes to the loyal. It could consult with its leading subjects but it could also brutally display it's wrath. The Majesty which had displayed on the one hand was counterbalanced by terror. All of this adds up then to a political culture, a set of institutions of government animated by certain understandings and rules and practices which govern political conduct. That unwritten consensus about how things were done was very well understood throughout political society and political stability depended upon sharing power in varying degrees at various levels of the structure in accordance with these understandings. Effective rule was the outcome of the use of considerable political skills by the kings and their advisors within this framework to bring about willing obedience and participation of their leading subjects and for the most part the early tutor kings proved very able in achieving that, in rebuilding the authority of the crown, which had been so much shaken by the civil wars of the 15th Century in instilling habits of obedience in reestablishing the latent power of the monarchy and indeed in enhancing it.

Speaker 1:          50:56          Something that we'll discuss in section, but finally change in government in the 16th century involved more than just reasserting royal authority. It also came to involve something else, the expansion of the very scope and objectives of government. And to understand that we need to see its development in the context of processes of change, which was scarcely on the agenda as late as 1530 but which were very soon to emerge. And in the next few section lectures, I'd be looking at those by examining the most explosive of these new issues, the issues of the succession and the issue of religion.
