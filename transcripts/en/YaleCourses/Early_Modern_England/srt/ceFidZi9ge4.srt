1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,730
Courtney is just pointed
out that today's November,

2
00:00:03,731 --> 00:00:07,710
the 17th significance
of which had evaded me,

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,730
but it's the [inaudible] session day of
Elizabeth the first she would have been

4
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:16,731
greeted in the 16th and 17th centuries
with bell ringing and so forth.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,470
It's no longer kept as a national holiday,
but it used to be okay.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,100
But today we have other business,
um,

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:30,530
the restoration and the run up to the
so called glorious revolution of 1688.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,060
So to start, um, the restoration of,

9
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:40,050
of May,

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,440
1660 clearly represented a fresh
start for the Monica in England,

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,660
but it was a fresh start that has to
be understood against the background of

12
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:49,381
past events,

13
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:54,120
which could not be forgotten even though
people tried hard not to talk about

14
00:00:54,121 --> 00:00:54,954
them.

15
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,000
The constitutional crisis
of 1640 had of course,

16
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:04,770
a risen from a functional breakdown in
the relationship between the crown and

17
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:05,760
the political nation,

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,800
a breakdown traceable ultimately to their
loss of confidence in the purposes of

19
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:13,590
royal government.

20
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,130
And the fear in particular that royal
policy was favoring Potpourri and

21
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,210
arbitrary power.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,800
Initially that crisis of 1640 to 41 had
led to the successful efforts of the

23
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:34,131
long parliament to reverse the trend in
royal policy and to put limits on the

24
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:36,000
king for the future.

25
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:41,850
A civil war of course had to be
fought to try to preserve those gains.

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,130
And in the course of the war,

27
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,430
further dimensions of the situation
emerged no to bleed the demand for liberty

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,420
of conscience. So in all of
that, as I described last week,

29
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:58,830
the one political moment which might
have produced a broadly acceptable

30
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:03,831
settlement had been in 1647
when Cromwellian Diet and
offered Charles the heads

31
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,330
of the proposals as the basis for
a settlement. But as you know,

32
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:14,331
that moment was lost with disastrous
consequences for the king.

33
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:16,860
Well,

34
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:21,860
the restoration has to be seen in this
context of well remembered events.

35
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,580
It was intended to restore the situation
to what it had been in 1641 after the

36
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:35,871
reforming statutes of the long parliament
with the addition of the granting of

37
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:38,700
some liberty of conscience
to Protestant dissenters,

38
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,420
which Charles the second had promised
in his declaration of Breeder.

39
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,060
And if this had happened,

40
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,660
it might indeed have provided
a lasting settlement,

41
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,870
but unfortunately it
didn't work out that way.

42
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,910
The architect of the restoration
settlement was Edward Hyde,

43
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,270
the Earl of Clarendon Charles and seconds
chief minister at the beginning of his

44
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:04,571
reign,

45
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:09,010
a man who'd served his father and advised
a young king throughout his period of

46
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:10,450
exile.
Now,

47
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:14,470
Clarendon was very much
a constitutional royalist

48
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,210
is essential idea was a return to the
constitutional situation of 1641 including

49
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,500
the reforms which he had supported at
the time before the outbreak of war,

50
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,230
which just some
modifications were necessary

51
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,230
in the convention parliament,

52
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:37,231
which began the restoration in 1660 all
of the acts of parliament which had been

53
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:42,370
signed by Charles the first before
the outbreak of war were confirmed.

54
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:48,270
That included all the
reforms and it included the
triennial act laying down that

55
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:51,910
or parliament should meet
at least every three years.

56
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,240
In addition,
royal land,

57
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:58,390
which had been confiscated during
the republic was restored to it.

58
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,290
Church land which had been confiscated,
was restored to the Church of England,

59
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:08,160
and indemnity was granted to the army
for all acts committed during the war.

60
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,900
They were paid and they were disbanded
except for a number of God's regiments

61
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,430
which were kept in London about the king.
In addition,

62
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,820
parliament passed a General Act of
indemnity and oblivion to cover both sides

63
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,073
during the war.

64
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:31,530
Accepting from it only the surviving
regicides 11 of those who had sign

65
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:36,700
Charles's death warrants were
executed and as you know,

66
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:41,020
the corpses of Cromwellian Dighton
were dug up and desecrated.

67
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,130
Okay.
So far so good.

68
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,270
But the so called cavalier parliament,

69
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,840
which was elected in 1661
to replace the convention,

70
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:57,841
parliament continued the process of the
restoration in a manner which turned out

71
00:04:58,121 --> 00:05:03,121
to be far more generous to the crown
and far more vindictive to the crown's

72
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:08,740
former opponents. All military
authority was vested in the king.

73
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,530
The crown was granted a regular income
of over a million pounds a year from the

74
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:16,390
customs and a new tax.

75
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,830
The heart techs in 1662 a licensing act,

76
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:25,750
reimposed control of the press, which
had been free for the previous 20 years

77
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,310
and above all to further steps were taken.
First of all,

78
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,040
the triennial act was weakened.

79
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,610
It was altered to lay down.

80
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,640
The parliamentary sessions should take
place at least once every three years,

81
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,280
but there were no mandatory new elections
as had originally been intended.

82
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,061
In other words,

83
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:53,440
this gave the king the opportunity
to prolong an existing parliament,

84
00:05:53,441 --> 00:05:58,441
which was to his taste by
simply pro ragging it and
then having it reassemble at

85
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:01,310
least once every three years.

86
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,740
And Charles took advantage of that
opportunity. The cavalier parliament,

87
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,950
very favorable to the king elected in
1661 was in fact continued without new

88
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:15,590
elections until 1668

89
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,590
the second major change was that the
cavalier parliament showed no willingness

90
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,860
to grant liberty of conscience to
dissenters as had been promised.

91
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,210
In 1662 of the church of
England was reestablished.

92
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,270
The prayer book was reintroduced
very little altered.

93
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,840
An Act of uniformity was
imposed on the whole kingdom.

94
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:44,290
All clergy were required to subscribe to
the act of uniformity or to be deprived

95
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:49,070
of their livings. As a result, hundreds
who couldn't in conscience subscribe,

96
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,580
we're deprived and a number of
additional acts were introduced against

97
00:06:55,401 --> 00:07:00,401
dissenters between 60 and 61 and 1665
they were banned from holding office in

98
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:07,121
any urban corporation in 1664 they were
banned from holding religious services.

99
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,240
Only services of the Church of
England were permitted. A year later,

100
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:19,220
the five Mile Act banned dissenting
clergyman from living within five miles of

101
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:24,221
any corporate city places where
traditionally they had had a good deal of

102
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:25,154
strength.

103
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,900
Now this was not what
Charles the second wanted.

104
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,210
It wasn't what the Earl of Clarendon
wanted, but they accepted it.

105
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,340
As a result,

106
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,470
a large minority of the population were
forced into the position of being either

107
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,500
active or potential dissidents
in matters of religion.

108
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,550
Surveys that have been done suggest that
Protestant dissenters made up about 10%

109
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,050
of the entire population.

110
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,760
Though their strength varied a great deal
from area to area in some parts of the

111
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:05,630
kingdom, they were very thin
on the ground. The county
of structure. For example,

112
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:10,130
on the Welsh border, a survey done
in 1672 reveals very few of them.

113
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,150
On the other hand, in the town of
Culture Stare in Essex on the east coast,

114
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,200
it's thought that as much as a third
of the population were dissenters,

115
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,520
many of them clickers.
And then if we turn to London,

116
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,330
London appears to have had about a fifth
of its population favoring descent and

117
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:31,490
minority owned your fifth.

118
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,840
But remember in a city the size of
London that meant 100,000 people.

119
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,700
So the restoration had restored too much.

120
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,710
It had gone back too far.

121
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:51,340
It restored not only the consensual
constitutional position of 1641 but also

122
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:58,510
some of the tensions and some of the
stresses of the 1640s and it had weakened

123
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,090
the position of parliament
in one important respect
by modifying the triennial

124
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:10,560
act.
Well,

125
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:15,420
obviously enough religious dissenters
had good reason to be very quickly

126
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:19,830
disappointed and disillusioned
with the restoration settlement.

127
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,020
But more broadly,

128
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,490
it took some time before
tensions began to reemerge fully.

129
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,940
Charles, the second was welcomed back
as the restorer of order. He was young.

130
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:36,210
He was only 30.
He was tall and handsome.

131
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,200
He was a man who was energetic only
in his sports and his pleasures.

132
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,830
Uh, the fact that he hasn't had
many mistresses is very well known.

133
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,160
He managed to father 13
illegitimate children,

134
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,780
all of whom were give them the surname.

135
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,780
Fitzroy son of the King Fitzrovia in the
west end of London is named after one

136
00:09:56,881 --> 00:10:00,450
of them, but he never managed
to have a legitimate heir.

137
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,940
He was happy to be king, though he
played the part well. He was intelligent.

138
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,560
He was shrewd.
He was affable.

139
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:12,360
He swarmed around St James's park
with his Spaniels and his mistresses.

140
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,760
He attended meetings at the Royal Society.

141
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,190
He showed his courage during the great
fire of London in 1666 when he joined in

142
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:23,460
the firefighting.
He knew he looked good in a wet shirt,

143
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,830
but despite all of these qualities,

144
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,900
Charles had no particular political
vision or strategy and perhaps that was

145
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:34,734
adjusted as well.

146
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,260
Can you that beneath the public
celebrations of his restoration,

147
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,040
the restoration had been
and in a very real sense,

148
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:49,041
remained essentially conditional and he
had no desire as he put it himself to go

149
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:54,030
on my travels again,
he was happy to be back.

150
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:57,930
Nevertheless,
if he had no particular vision,

151
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,760
he did have his preferences and from
time to time they got him into trouble

152
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,580
principle amongst them where first of all,

153
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,450
his admiration for the monarchy
off his cousin, King Louis,

154
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:16,560
the 14th of France,
the so called Sun King,

155
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,010
the absolute monarch of Europe's emergent,

156
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,040
great power and the very model of
monarchical magnificence displayed in his

157
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,420
palisade for side.
Secondly,

158
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,340
there was Charles his sympathy to put
it no stronger for Roman Catholicism,

159
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:40,370
the religion of his mother as a religion
which he regarded as more suitable to

160
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:41,904
monarchy

161
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,110
and these preferences led
him into interconnected
initiatives in foreign policy

162
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,770
and in matters of religion,

163
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,340
which were potentially alienating to
some of his subjects far more alienating

164
00:11:55,871 --> 00:12:00,400
than his raffish court or
his personal debauchery.

165
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,670
In 1665 to seven England fought a brief
and unsuccessful naval war with the

166
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:15,070
Dutch. The second Dutch war
triggered off by commercial rivalry.

167
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,880
It was a deeply humiliating episode and
especially so since everyone remembered

168
00:12:23,741 --> 00:12:24,574
very well.

169
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,110
All of a Cromwells military strength and
the triumph in the first Dutch war in

170
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:31,750
the 1650s Samuel peeps,

171
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:36,130
secretary of the navy at this time
confided to his diary repeatedly is

172
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:40,510
dissatisfaction with the manner in
which the war had been conducted is

173
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:45,340
dissatisfaction with the way in which
the king and his counsel would not attend

174
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:48,940
to business as had been done
under the previous regime.

175
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:53,170
As a result of the failures
of the second Dutch war,

176
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,970
the Earl of Clarendon was sacrificed as
escape goat and he was replaced with a

177
00:12:57,971 --> 00:13:00,370
ministry which is known as the cabal.

178
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,440
After the initial letters
of the principal, Miss
Ministers, Clifford Arlington,

179
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,800
Buckingham, Ashley Cooper, and Lauderdale

180
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,330
in 60 and 70 under the cabal ministry,

181
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,560
Charles concluded the
Treaty of Dover with France

182
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,501
in its,

183
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:25,501
he agreed to ally with France in
any future war against the Dutch.

184
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,960
It was not popular with those in the
kingdom who saw France as the truly rising

185
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:36,961
threat of the 1660s potentially a new
Spain aiming at European dominance,

186
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,550
people who also saw the
Dutch as the principal,

187
00:13:42,551 --> 00:13:45,190
opponents of that French hegemony

188
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,590
and the treaty would have been even
less popular if people had known that it

189
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:55,330
contained to secret clauses.
First of all,

190
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,280
Charles had agreed secretly that at an
appropriate moment he would suspend the

191
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:03,670
penal laws against Roman Catholics.
Secondly,

192
00:14:03,671 --> 00:14:08,671
he had agreed with Louis that he would
himself convert to Catholicism at a

193
00:14:09,911 --> 00:14:13,330
propitious moment.
In return for this,

194
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:18,070
he received again in secret a quarter
of a million pounds a year pension from

195
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:21,250
France.
Well,

196
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:26,251
in the aftermath of the Treaty of Dover
in 60 and 72 Louis the 14th declared war

197
00:14:27,191 --> 00:14:29,110
on the Netherlands and invaded.

198
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:35,310
Charles issued a declaration of indulgence
in which he used his power supreme

199
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:41,500
head of the church to just suspend
the penal laws against both Protestant

200
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:46,501
dissenters and Roman Catholics and
indeed he allowed to send us to publicly

201
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:50,290
worship in licensed meeting
houses two days later,

202
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,080
England also war on the Dutch.
The beginning of the third Dutch war.

203
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,820
This war proved again
to be very unpopular,

204
00:14:58,821 --> 00:15:03,821
no to bleed because it was highly
unsuccessful militarily and there was a

205
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:09,671
growing sympathy amongst the political
public with the plucky Dutch and the

206
00:15:09,981 --> 00:15:14,240
young leader William of orange
standing up against the French.

207
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,920
The Declaration of indulgence with its
granting of a degree of religious liberty

208
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:26,890
to those other than members of the
Church of England was even more unpopular

209
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,920
with the Anglican dominated
cavalier parliament.

210
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,360
It met again in 1673 for a new session
and almost immediately attacked the

211
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:43,451
declaration of indulgence declaring
that Penal Statutes in matters

212
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,940
ecclesiastical cannot be suspended,

213
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:52,330
but by an act of parliament and at the
suspending power which the king had used

214
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,800
was innovators.

215
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,440
No such power said the House of Commons
was ever claimed or executed by his

216
00:15:59,511 --> 00:16:00,344
predecessors.

217
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,420
Faced with this kind of opposition
from people who had previously been his

218
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:09,620
strongest supporters,
Charles Back Down,

219
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,690
he showed his characteristic unwillingness
to push his own preferences beyond

220
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:17,120
the bounds of political expediency.

221
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:23,020
The Declaration of indulgence
was withdrawn and under
the threat of withholding

222
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:26,090
supply for the war effort.

223
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:30,800
He agreed to the passage by
parliament of the test act.

224
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:37,090
The test act was an act laying down that
all officers of the crown must swear

225
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,910
the oath of supremacy and allegiance and
take a declaration against the Catholic

226
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:48,941
doctrine of transubstantiation and take
communion in the Church of England.

227
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,820
So it was a test of Anglican
religious conformity.

228
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,820
Prominent amongst its early victims
were, first of all, Lord Clifford,

229
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:03,290
one of Charles as chief ministers who
was a secret Catholic. And secondly,

230
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,160
and even more importantly,
James Duke of York, Charles,

231
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,290
his younger brother,

232
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:13,850
who at this point was of course
also the heir to the throne.

233
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,600
Since Charles and his Portuguese wife
Catherine of Braganza had had no children.

234
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,180
James had declared in 1673
most unpropitious Lee,

235
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,840
his conversion to Catholicism
under the test act,

236
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:34,340
he was excluded from high office.
Well,

237
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,121
this day,

238
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:40,121
barcal led to the collapse of the Cabal
Ministry and the appointment of a new

239
00:17:40,431 --> 00:17:43,430
chief minister, Thomas
Osborne, the Earl of Danby,

240
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,200
who was fiercely Anglican that satisfied
the cavalier parliament and who was

241
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,700
also as it pro Dutch.

242
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,810
But Charles was still secretly getting
a pension from the French in return for

243
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:01,350
keeping parliament out of
session as much as possible

244
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,700
in 1677 when he had to call it again,

245
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:11,030
it met and tried to make the voting of
further taxes conditional upon Charles

246
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:14,400
joining the Dutch led
alliance against France.

247
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:20,310
And at this point that king resisted
successfully arguing that he allowed

248
00:18:20,311 --> 00:18:23,130
parliament to prescribe
his foreign policy.

249
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,910
It is plain that no prince or state in
Europe would any longer believe that the

250
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:32,070
sovereignty of England rests in the crown.

251
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,670
So Charles took a stand on that point,

252
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,450
but Dan be nonetheless
succeeded in building at least
one bridge with the Dutch

253
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,420
when in 1677 he was able to
arrange the marriage of Mary,

254
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,280
the daughter of James by an earlier
marriage, Charles, his niece,

255
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,260
and a Protestant by upbringing.

256
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,940
Her marriage was arranged to
William of Orange and event,

257
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:03,810
which was to prove to be of
profound future significance.

258
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,720
So at this point,
Charles,

259
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:14,760
like his shrewd grandfather James the
first had proved himself flexible enough

260
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,180
to avoid provoking political crisis.

261
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,290
He knew when to give way
as well as when to stand.

262
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,350
But by the late 16th seventies,

263
00:19:25,351 --> 00:19:30,351
anxieties were growing about the threat
of popery and arbitrary power at home as

264
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:32,940
well as abroad.

265
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:39,270
It was made worse in 1674 when the
Duke of York now a declared an openly

266
00:19:39,271 --> 00:19:43,170
declared Catholic, married the
Catholic Princess Mary of Medina,

267
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,460
which pose the risk that there might be
the birth of a future heir to the throne

268
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,620
who would be brought
up as a Roman Catholic.

269
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,690
There was also a growing sense of distance
between the court and the country and

270
00:19:59,851 --> 00:20:02,940
the growing suspicion of
the king's intentions.

271
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:08,130
It was in 1677 that Andrew Marvell
best known today as a poet,

272
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,390
but at that time, member of parliament
for the town of Hull in Yorkshire,

273
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,190
published,
um,

274
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,110
without putting his name on it and account
of the growth of popery and arbitrary

275
00:20:19,111 --> 00:20:24,111
par in which he argued in this pamphlet
that you could discern a plot to

276
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:28,500
introduce what we,
what he described as absolute tyranny,

277
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:32,070
French slavery,
and popup idolatry.

278
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,810
These are the fears that were circulating
amongst Charles as opponents in

279
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:40,770
parliament.
Clearly we've been here before.

280
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,120
The highly combustible elements of 17th
century English political were being

281
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:53,680
mixed again and a spark
which was needed to cause.

282
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:58,681
A new explosion was provided in the
autumn of 1678 when one Titus Oates laid

283
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,740
allegations of a Jesse would plot to
murder King Charles in order to hasten the

284
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:12,370
succession of his brother
James to the throne.

285
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,100
This was the beginning of the
so called pope ish plot affair.

286
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:26,470
The tuchus Oates is wild allegations
were seriously listened to by parliament

287
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,920
and by the political public in general
can be explained only by the preexisting

288
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,580
atmosphere of suspicion,

289
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:39,581
which had been building up in the sixties
and seventies but the allegation soon

290
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:44,840
acquired greater credibility.
So Edmund Barry Godfrey,

291
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,630
the London magistrate who
had taken Oates's, um,

292
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,930
allegations was found murdered,

293
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,960
then a search of the
house of Prince James's,

294
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:01,990
former secretary Edward Coleman revealed
real correspondence between the Duke of

295
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,340
York Secretary and Jesse.

296
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:08,930
What's then there was the
revelation in December,

297
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,880
1678 in parliament by an aggrieved former
ambassador of the secret clauses of

298
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:17,810
the Treaty of Dover of
1670 which caused uproar.

299
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,400
Parliament attempted to impeach
the Earl of Danby for his share of

300
00:22:22,401 --> 00:22:27,401
responsibility for oil policy and Charles
was forced a blast to dissolve the

301
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:31,550
cavalier parliament. In January, 1679

302
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,480
the pope of plot precipitated what
Jonathan Scott has described as the second

303
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:45,740
great crisis of Potpourri
and arbitrary par.

304
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,310
The exclusion crisis as it's called,

305
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:54,580
running from 60 and 79 to 1681 exclusion
crisis because it involved attempts by

306
00:22:57,291 --> 00:23:02,291
parliament to exclude James Duke of York
heir to the throne from the succession.

307
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:13,110
The first exclusion parliament
met between March and May,

308
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,050
1679 elections to this new parliament.

309
00:23:17,051 --> 00:23:22,051
The first elections held and 1661 took
place in an atmosphere of tremendous

310
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,520
political excitement.

311
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:30,190
When it met the Earl of Danby was sent
to the tower of London where he remained

312
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:31,390
for the next five years.

313
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,850
Parliament then proposed a bill to
exclude James Duke of York from the

314
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:40,510
succession and persisted
in demanding this,

315
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:45,780
despite King Charles us offer that he
would have limits put upon the powers of

316
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,590
appointment of any future Catholic king.

317
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:53,570
He was willing to give way to
some degree beyond that. However,

318
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:58,630
Charles was ready to resist defending
the legitimate succession to the throne

319
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,240
was one issue that he would fight for.

320
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Parliament was dissolved and James was
sent off to Scotland to keep him out of

321
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:09,524
harms way.

322
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:17,590
This crisis now unleashed political
agitation and popular involvement in

323
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:23,591
politics of a kind which really hadn't
been seen since the 1640s there was

324
00:24:24,441 --> 00:24:29,441
tremendous debate of the exclusion issue
in the coffee houses and taverns of

325
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:32,510
London and the other major cities.

326
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,190
This debate fueled by an
outbreak of pamphlets hearing,

327
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,350
which was possible because the licensing
act controlling the press had actually

328
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:47,351
expired in 1679 and parliament had d been
dissolved before it had time to renew

329
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:51,710
it temporarily.
The press was free again.

330
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:58,070
Mass demonstrations took place in
London calling for a new parliament.

331
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:03,320
These street demonstrations
were orchestrated by a
former member of Charles has

332
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:03,711
government,

333
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:08,711
the Earl of Shaftsbury and his friends
in the so called green ribbon club,

334
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,310
but they also demonstrated
genuine popular concern.

335
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:17,210
There was a real basis of popular
concern which Shaftsbury and his friends

336
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,740
successfully mobilized,

337
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:23,240
but the agitation wasn't all one way.

338
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,270
As the crisis deepened,

339
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,020
the emergence of two new terms in
politics took place Whigs and Tories terms

340
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:39,641
which were adopted to describe different
political positions both inside and

341
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,150
outside parliament over
the issue of exclusion.

342
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,440
The cell called wigs specialized in
mounting precessions through London at

343
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:54,980
which, which tended to culminate in
the burning of effigies of the pope.

344
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,330
They place great emphasis
upon the threat of popery.

345
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,680
They placed a great deal of emphasis
also on the threat of arbitrary power.

346
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,520
They talked a lot about the need
to defend England's religion,

347
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,180
liberties and property and
called for a new parliament,

348
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:14,390
which alone could save the day.
In their view.

349
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:19,550
The Tories on the other hand placed
their confidence in the king.

350
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,360
They branded the wings as
being predominantly dissenters
in sympathy religiously

351
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:31,100
as closet Presbyterians, as fermenters
of insurrection against the king,

352
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,110
as secret Republicans,

353
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:38,090
as a threat to the Church of England
and to England's true deputies.

354
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,900
They repeatedly played upon the threat
of a new 1641 a new slide into civil war.

355
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:47,830
Yeah.

356
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,020
Behind these insulting labels.

357
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:55,170
Wig and Tory then lay emerging political
alignments rooted in differences of

358
00:26:57,611 --> 00:27:01,960
political principle and these divisions,
as I've said,

359
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,600
where to be found not only
amongst members of parliament,

360
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,710
but also permeated deeply
down through society,

361
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:12,190
beyond the political elite
to the middle sort of people.

362
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,940
Those who supported the
demonstrations of one side or another.

363
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,483
Yeah.

364
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,251
Okay.
Well,

365
00:27:19,251 --> 00:27:24,251
this fever atmosphere in the late
sixties and seventies and early 16 ATS

366
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,730
provided the background to the
parliamentary politics of those years.

367
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,680
In October 60 80,
another new parliament met.

368
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:38,900
This one's usually known as the
second exclusion parliament. Again,

369
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,940
the House of Commons declared that it
would grant supply of money to the crown

370
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,420
only in return for a new exclusion.

371
00:27:47,421 --> 00:27:52,421
Bill Charles promptly dissolved it in
January 60 91 and called for yet another

372
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:56,930
parliament this time to meet,
not in London,

373
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,640
but in the friendly city of Oxford.
Two months later,

374
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,370
the king was clearly playing for time.

375
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,380
In March 60 and 81,

376
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,440
the Oxford parliament met again in an
atmosphere of tremendous public agitation.

377
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,010
It was in the course of, of the Oxford
parliament that the incident took place,

378
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:21,220
uh, in which, um, the
king's mistress Nell Gwynne,

379
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:26,470
the actress proceeding to Oxford in
her coach in order to join the king,

380
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:31,610
found herself surrounded by an angry mob
who thought she was the Duchess of Port

381
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:33,040
Portsmith and other of charges,
Mr says,

382
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:37,150
who happened to be a Catholic now Gwen
was able to get the crowd to leave her

383
00:28:37,151 --> 00:28:41,170
alone by opening the door, showing
herself and crying be still good people.

384
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,880
I am the Protestant Hall.

385
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,580
Meanwhile in Oxford,

386
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:54,300
the House of Commons still demanded the
exclusion of James Duke of York from the

387
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:55,654
succession.

388
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:01,470
Charles roundly declared that he would
not have it and he dissolved them again.

389
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,640
So what next?

390
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,550
Charles couldn't face another parliament,

391
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:15,310
but he decided to call the wigs
bluff and to brazen it out.

392
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:17,560
In the absence of a sitting parliament,

393
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,390
he trusted in the possibility that he
might be able to rally support in the

394
00:29:22,391 --> 00:29:23,890
political nation at large,

395
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:29,790
largely by appealing to Tory
sympathizers and partly by playing on the

396
00:29:30,671 --> 00:29:33,610
widespread fears that if
this agitation continued,

397
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,390
it might lead to another breakdown,
another 41

398
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,320
okay.

399
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,320
In April of 60 and 81 he issued a
studiously moderate declaration of his

400
00:29:45,191 --> 00:29:50,170
position and ordered that it should be
read out from the pulpit of every parish

401
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:54,100
church in England,
and so it was in his declaration.

402
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:59,101
The king explained the basis of his
principled conduct in defending the

403
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:01,930
legitimate succession to the throne.

404
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:08,010
He revived memories of the breakdown into
civil war and how that war had led to

405
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:14,251
the abolition of the Church of England
to military rulership and the subjugation

406
00:30:14,861 --> 00:30:17,830
of English liberties
and threats to property

407
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:21,843
and it worked.

408
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,340
No parliament was sitting to
focus opposition to the king.

409
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,690
Agitation was gradually dying down
and Charles pressed his advantage.

410
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:38,530
Hard Titus Oates was arrested
and tried for perjury.

411
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,750
Found guilty.

412
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:45,100
His allegations declared false and
he was punished in the pillory.

413
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:49,630
The Earl of Shaftsbury leader of
the wigs was indicted for treason.

414
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,480
He fled abroad where he shortly died.

415
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,950
Charles then began a systematic program
of calling in and remodeling the

416
00:30:59,471 --> 00:31:04,471
charters of England cities as a means
of purging the corporations which

417
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:10,381
supported weeks in national politics
and thereby rendering the cities which

418
00:31:11,831 --> 00:31:15,220
elected members of parliament
more politically controllable.

419
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:21,210
Between 60 and 81 and 60 and 85 51 cities
had their charters remodeled in this

420
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:25,810
way to make them more
politically manipulable. 47 more.

421
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:28,600
We're still in the pipeline.
In 60 95

422
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:35,430
Charles also permitted the intensified
prosecution of dissenters in order to

423
00:31:35,441 --> 00:31:40,441
satisfy Anglican prejudices and
to cow the dissenters themselves.

424
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,080
The Quakers suffered especially severely
during the persecution of the early 60

425
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:51,151
[inaudible] in 1683 with the discovery
of an alleged plot against the king,

426
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:58,770
the rye house plot wig radicals were
arrested and two leading wig leaders,

427
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,030
Lord Russell and origin and
Sydney were brought to trial,

428
00:32:04,170 --> 00:32:06,070
found guilty and executed.

429
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:12,330
Finally in 1684 Charles further
consolidated his position by defying the

430
00:32:13,601 --> 00:32:16,570
triennial act under the triennial act.

431
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:20,800
He should have called a new
parliament that year. He didn't.

432
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:28,410
So Charles the second had faced
the crisis of his reign at last,

433
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:35,010
proven himself when stirred to be
politically pretty astute and he had one

434
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,830
in February,

435
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,830
1685 when the king was
suddenly incapacitated by a
stroke and then died after a

436
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:48,470
short illness.
He had never been stronger

437
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,970
and it was on his deathbed that at last
he found the propitious moment he had

438
00:32:55,461 --> 00:32:58,370
been waiting for and
converted to Catholicism.

439
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:02,563
Okay,

440
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,091
well,

441
00:33:03,091 --> 00:33:08,091
Charles had one by gambling that in
the absence of a sitting parliament,

442
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:10,020
which could focus opposition,

443
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:14,370
no one could face the prospect
of armed rebellion against him.

444
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,240
No one could face a renewal of civil war.

445
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:24,590
He had consolidated his
position by appealing to the
fears and the prejudices of

446
00:33:24,601 --> 00:33:29,550
the Tory Anglican majority amongst
the political nation at large,

447
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,860
and he had demonstrated that a
protestant or authoritarianism was not

448
00:33:34,861 --> 00:33:37,860
necessarily unacceptable to those people.

449
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,810
It's interesting indeed to speculate as
to whether if James the Second Charles,

450
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:48,811
his successor had continued to build
up and an enhanced royal power on that

451
00:33:50,671 --> 00:33:51,504
basis.

452
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,060
Whether England might have become a
protestant absolute estate like Sweden or

453
00:33:57,061 --> 00:34:00,660
Denmark,
not impossible,

454
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:07,110
but we'll never know because if chance a
second had had a lot in common with his

455
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,780
grandfather James the first James.

456
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:13,950
The second proved to be rather closer
in temperament to his father Charles the

457
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,350
first in a sense,

458
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,490
he was a better man morally
then his brother Charles,

459
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:26,120
but he also suffered far too much from
energy coupled with a catastrophic lack

460
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:31,890
of political judgment.
James couldn't leave well alone.

461
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,170
Initially his position was very strong.

462
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,870
His first parliament was Tory dominated
and it was willing to trust him despite

463
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:47,550
his Roman Catholicism Parliament was
generous to him indeed in its financial

464
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:48,384
grants.

465
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,490
And then in the summer of 1685 when
Charles has seconds illegitimate son,

466
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:57,540
the Duke of Monmouth, Monmouth,
landed in the west of England,

467
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:02,280
raised a small army and claimed to
be the legitimate heir to the throne.

468
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,500
Parliament quickly granted James the
resources for more troops to head west and

469
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:12,180
crush the rebellion swiftly
and yet,

470
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,510
despite this strength in
the first year of his reign,

471
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,820
in less than three years,

472
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,000
James managed to undermine his own
position with a quite staggering

473
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,080
comprehensiveness.

474
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,440
The problem was of
course James's religion.

475
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,280
It need not have been a
problem, but he made it. One,

476
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,880
he was a deeply sincere catholic
with all of the zeal of a convert.

477
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:47,180
He probably didn't intend to impose his
religion coercively upon the nation,

478
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,090
but he was certainly determined to
remove the disabilities of his co

479
00:35:52,091 --> 00:35:55,110
religionists and to
promote their interests.

480
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:01,100
And he ductless hoped that with more
widespread conversions to Catholicism,

481
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:07,050
eventually the nation would move back
gradually in a Catholic direction.

482
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,600
These were not ignoble ames
from James's point of view,

483
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:16,560
but of course in the conditions
of late 17th century England,

484
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,400
they constituted gross political folly,

485
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:26,570
especially in the 60 [inaudible] at a
time when King Louis the 14th France had

486
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:32,691
recently revoked the toleration previously
granted under rich layer to French

487
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:37,970
Protestants and England was receiving
thousands of Protestant refugees from

488
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,180
Louis brutal persecution in France.

489
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,600
What changes needed if he was to proceed
with his intentions was to get the test

490
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,260
acts repealed.

491
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,760
Parliament clearly was
not willing to grant that,

492
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,480
so James turned instead to his use of
his prerogative powers and in particular

493
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:07,410
to his dispensing path.
Theoretically,

494
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,040
the king was permitted to
dispense particular individuals
from the penalties of

495
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:18,540
the law in special cases where rigid
enforcement of the letter of the law might

496
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:22,950
result in an injustice.
This prerogative power,

497
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:23,610
however,

498
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:28,610
did not extend to authorizing acts
which were contrary to the law.

499
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:33,390
Pure and simple. It was meant for
occasional use in special cases.

500
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:35,730
James,

501
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:40,500
his use of the dispensing power showed a
lack of respect for that distinction in

502
00:37:40,501 --> 00:37:45,210
the law and was deeply provocative.
Indeed.

503
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:50,280
The manner in which it was used was
so provocative as as as to be almost

504
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:53,850
farcical in retrospect,
what one almost imagines that James,

505
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,260
James and his cabinet, we're meeting
every morning and asking themselves,

506
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:01,920
what can we do today,
which will really upset people?

507
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,160
Let's have some Catholics in the privy
council. Four of them. Okay, great.

508
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,990
How about making your Jesuit
confessor a member of the cabinet.

509
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,453
Sweet.

510
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:21,950
Let's make 250 Catholics justices of
the peace in the counties and displace

511
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,900
their Protestant predecessors.
Wonderful idea.

512
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,010
Let's upon Catholic officer's
in the militia and the army,

513
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,870
let's appoint a Catholic Lord Deputy
of Ireland and allow him to wreak Athol

514
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:34,950
assize the army.

515
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,010
Let's make an Oxford
college a Catholic seminary.

516
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,390
Wonderful ideas,
and he did it all.

517
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:50,500
Now, James was not so stupid as not to
realize that this policy would be deeply

518
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,990
alienating to Anglican support,

519
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:57,670
but he thought that he
could counterbalance that
by wooing support amongst

520
00:38:57,671 --> 00:39:02,530
Protestant dissenters.
In April,

521
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:07,530
1687 he himself issued a declaration of
indulgence like his brother suspending

522
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:12,670
the penal laws against both
dissenters and Roman Catholics.

523
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,713
Yeah.

524
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,840
In some then the kings dispensing power
was being exercise with a freedom that

525
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:25,190
was clearly turning it into an
illegal suspension of the law.

526
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,520
The very thing which parliament
had declared against in
1673 and James appeared

527
00:39:32,151 --> 00:39:35,600
to be forcing his base of support,

528
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:40,460
his natural allies amongst
Tories and staunch Anglicans.

529
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,640
He was forcing them to choose between
their loyalty to their church and their

530
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:47,450
loyalty to the king.

531
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:50,503
Okay.

532
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,640
To make matters worse.

533
00:39:51,641 --> 00:39:56,641
In 1687 James embarked upon what appeared
to be a blatant attempt to pack a

534
00:39:57,281 --> 00:40:02,281
future parliament for the purpose of
securing the repeal of the test acts or

535
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:07,501
justices of peace in the counties
and members of urban corporations for

536
00:40:07,751 --> 00:40:12,751
parliamentary constituencies were asked
by the king to answer three questions

537
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,180
relating to whether or not they would
support repeal of the test acts in a new

538
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:20,014
parliament,

539
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:25,290
whether or not they would vote for those
who would support such a repeal if they

540
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,510
were elected to parliament,

541
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,460
and whether they would support
the new declaration of indulgence.

542
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:37,630
James could hardly have signaled
his intentions more clearly.

543
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:42,010
And by doing so,
he occasioned widespread alarm,

544
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,740
not just among Anglicans,

545
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,300
but also amongst the majority of the
dissenters whom he had been trying to woo.

546
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:53,560
They were not disposed to trust.
The king's good intentions

547
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:56,913
at this point,

548
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:02,100
anxieties was perhaps only contained by
expectations that this situation might

549
00:41:03,341 --> 00:41:04,930
not last too long.

550
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,470
King James was now 55 years old,

551
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:12,280
quite a good age for the
time he still had no son.

552
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,040
His eldest daughter Mary.

553
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:19,660
His air was a Protestant and was
married to William of Orange in the

554
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:23,050
Netherlands.
If the king were to die soon,

555
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:27,730
then they would surely succeed
and it might well be the case.

556
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:32,850
The toleration would be achieved for
Protestant dissenters without empowering

557
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,660
Roman Catholics in the
way James was doing.

558
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,030
That may have been many people's hope,

559
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:46,660
but in the winter of 60 87 in the
spring of 60 and 88 to precipitants

560
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:51,350
transformed the situation.
First of all,

561
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:53,510
in November,

562
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:58,510
1687 it became known that Queen Mary
was pregnant and that the pregnancy was

563
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,230
going well.

564
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,120
James might then have a
Catholic air if a son was born.

565
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,900
Secondly,
in April,

566
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,900
1688 James ordered his declaration of
indulgence to be read out in all Anglican

567
00:42:14,871 --> 00:42:18,560
churches.
Seven bishops of the Church of England,

568
00:42:18,561 --> 00:42:23,150
including the Archbishop of Canterbury
himself petitioned against this action.

569
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:28,400
In reply,
they were indicted and tried for sedition.

570
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:34,430
The case of the seven bishops turned
on the legality of the use of the

571
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:38,150
dispensing power by the
king and when it was heard,

572
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:42,680
they were acquitted to
widespread public rejoicing.

573
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,400
And then in June,

574
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,360
1688 Queen Mary was delivered of a child,
a prince.

575
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:55,930
The young Prince James Rumors immediately
began to circulate that in fact,

576
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:01,130
the child was not the king's child,

577
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:06,280
but had been smuggled into the queen's
bed chamber secretly in a warming pan in

578
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:10,220
order to give the appearance of
the birth of an heir to the throne.

579
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,340
People were now so desperate they were
willing to believe stories of this kind

580
00:43:16,341 --> 00:43:17,360
or pretend they did.

581
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:23,390
All of this persuaded seven
leading politicians, five
of them wigs, two of them,

582
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:28,040
Tory's including the all of Danby
Charles former chief minister,

583
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,140
that it was time to do something.

584
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:36,010
This was the third crisis
of popery and arbitrary par.

585
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,690
And in June,

586
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:43,690
1688 these seven leaders who later
became known as the immortal seven sent a

587
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:48,860
letter to William of orange expressing
their fear for their liberties,

588
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:50,810
their religion,
and their property,

589
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:56,320
and inviting him to intervene to secure
a free parliament and to investigate the

590
00:43:57,741 --> 00:44:01,040
suspicious circumstances
of Prince James's birth.

591
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,760
William had in fact already
been anticipating the
likelihood of renewed war with

592
00:44:12,201 --> 00:44:17,201
France in 1688 and he had made contingency
plans for the possible invasion of

593
00:44:19,131 --> 00:44:24,131
England if as he inspect expected
James the second supported Louis,

594
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,080
the 14th France against him.

595
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,120
Louie was indeed ready to support
James in such an eventuality,

596
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:39,260
but the autumn of 60 and 88 came and no
one expected an invasion later than that

597
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:45,030
because of the prevalence of adverse
winds in the English Channel.

598
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,700
By September,

599
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,700
1688 then Louis of France considered
himself free of that threat and obligation

600
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,240
and he moved his troops south in order
to invade the Palatinate in Germany.

601
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:03,420
The first steps in a renewed war.

602
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:09,030
This freed William of orange from fear
of an immediate French attack upon the

603
00:45:09,031 --> 00:45:09,864
Netherlands.

604
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:15,620
In October 60 and 88 he
issued a declaration that he
was coming over in order to

605
00:45:17,221 --> 00:45:20,370
preserve and maintain
the established laws,

606
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,100
liberties and customs of England,

607
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:27,960
and to investigate the birth of
the prince. On the 1st of November,

608
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,600
he sailed was carried down the channel,

609
00:45:30,601 --> 00:45:33,780
but by what was later known
as the Protestant wind.

610
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:38,610
A wind blowing unusually in the
right direction for his purposes.

611
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:42,900
He was carried down the channel to land
at Tall Bay in the west of England on

612
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,020
the 5th of November,

613
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,060
1688 a very propitious day

614
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:54,450
faced with this invasion,
King James initially joined his army.

615
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:57,060
It's Saulsbury in the west country,

616
00:45:57,510 --> 00:46:02,510
but inexplicably lost his
nerve and withdrew to London.

617
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:06,360
James was no coward. He'd fought
very bravely, uh, in his youth,

618
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:10,950
but for some reason he lost his nerve
and withdrew his army's leaders.

619
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,500
Went over to William and joined him.

620
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:18,540
Risings also began to take
place in some provincial cities.

621
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,670
The Earl of Danby for example,

622
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:25,290
Seized York with parties of
the not the Yorkshire Gentry.

623
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,913
At this point,

624
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:33,020
King James sent his family abroad for
safety and on the 11th of December,

625
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,900
himself attempted to flee throwing the
great seal of England into the River

626
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,050
Thames. Before doing so in an
effort to paralyze the government,

627
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:46,020
which needed the great
seal for various acts,

628
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:53,130
James was captured by a fishing boat on
his way out of England and returned to

629
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:57,540
London where he was held in
custody until the 20th of December.

630
00:46:57,541 --> 00:47:02,541
When he again escaped
probably by collusion on the
part of William supporters

631
00:47:03,811 --> 00:47:08,550
who allowed him to escape.
Indeed, his escape was vital.

632
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,660
What would they have
done if James had stayed?

633
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:18,250
There had been back in the position of
1648 of negotiations with Charles the

634
00:47:18,361 --> 00:47:21,300
first,
but with James Gone,

635
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:26,460
the political process could
proceed in his absence.

636
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:32,480
He was allowed to escape to France
and on the 24th of December,

637
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:38,790
1688 and assembly of the nobility asked
William and Mary to take up the reins of

638
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:45,430
government the way it was prepared
for a refashioning of government,

639
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,760
which was to proceed over the next two
decades and which was to transform the

640
00:47:51,731 --> 00:47:52,750
British constitution.

641
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:58,720
But I returned to that after the break.
Next time,

642
00:47:58,930 --> 00:48:02,170
we need to look at some other developments
which were taking place in the late

643
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:06,700
17th century. The extraordinary
economic growth of that period.
