1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,400
I called to tell you at length
from the tutor homily on obedience,

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,620
first published in 1547 with
its stress on hierarchy,

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,360
degree order,

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,790
subordination and obedience.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,650
And yet as you know,

6
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:21,651
within two years of the publication of
that homily in 1547 there was a wave of

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:27,110
peasant protest in 1549 right across the
south of England and open rebellion in

8
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:29,880
east Anglia cats rebellion.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:37,100
This was a society in which the common
people below the level of the middling

10
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:38,280
sought,

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,280
the leaders of village society
had no formal political voice.

12
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,740
They were as the Thomas Smith put it to
be ruled over and not to rule others.

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,620
And yet not infrequently,

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,680
we find those same common people raising
their voices in protest and sometimes

15
00:00:57,751 --> 00:00:58,584
in demand.

16
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,150
It was a society in which
the gentry rulers regarded
their social inferiors with

17
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:07,500
a great deal of condescension.

18
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:13,130
The language they use to describe to them
says it all the meaner sot of people,

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,910
the clowns,

20
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,940
the rudest sought the rabble and
they expected their deference.

21
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,590
Men were expected to uncover their heads
before their social superiors do them

22
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:27,180
hat on her as it was called,

23
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,360
women were expected to Bob a curtsy,

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,130
and yet this condescension on the part
of the gentry was tingy with anxiety and

25
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:41,310
an expectation of insubordination.

26
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,210
As one of them said,

27
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:47,211
John Ugland or put it the common people
are always apt to rebel and mutiny upon

28
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:49,830
the least occasion.

29
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:51,571
Well,

30
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:53,820
how can one reconcile
all of these paradoxes?

31
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:55,381
Well,

32
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:58,200
maybe the answer is in fact simple enough.

33
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,070
Deference and obedience was the norm.

34
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,070
It was instilled by precept.

35
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,090
It was learned by
repeated daily experience,

36
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,910
and yet periodically it could perhaps
be destabilized by circumstances,

37
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,621
a famine,

38
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:21,621
perhaps a particularly callous
example of exploitation by landlord.

39
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,250
Things like that could perhaps
render people desperate,

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,880
leading them to rise in a convulsive
spasm of anger and despair.

41
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,650
And when that happened,

42
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,470
all good order could be
threatened by the mob.

43
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,740
What the gentry called
the many headed monster,

44
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,000
the common people,

45
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:44,160
the beast with many heads,

46
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,790
which a powerful image and not without
historical foundation and yet to

47
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:55,770
characterize all or even most forms
of popular disturbance in early modern

48
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:58,800
England in this way is
profoundly misleading.

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,270
A generation of research
on popular protesters,

50
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,280
so showing just how inadequate that
stereotype is and the resulting shift of

51
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:12,280
perception amongst the storylines is
reflected in the kind of language they now

52
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:14,020
use to describe these things.

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,440
People nowadays talk little about the mob.

54
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,960
They talk more about the crowd,

55
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,750
they talk less about revolt and
more about protest and resistance.

56
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,680
We've moved from the study of riots to
the study of what people term popular

57
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:33,190
political culture.

58
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,310
Okay.

59
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,020
Now whether that term is fully justified,

60
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:37,854
we'll see,

61
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:42,240
but the evidence at least reveals
that the common people were neither

62
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,300
unconditionally deferential
to their rulers.

63
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:46,341
No.

64
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:50,070
Or on the other hand where they secretly
alienated from the existing social

65
00:03:50,071 --> 00:03:50,904
order,

66
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:55,830
but rather as one laboring man from North
Hampton share and the English Midlands

67
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:57,900
put it on one of these occasions,

68
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,670
they could to quote him,

69
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,650
they could tattle well enough.

70
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,290
How to devise a means to help themselves
and they could do that within the

71
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:12,291
parameters of the prevailing structures
of power and authority within which they

72
00:04:13,051 --> 00:04:18,051
were obliged to work because as yet
no one had suggested any possible

73
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,943
alternative.

74
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,300
Popular protest has been well described
by John Walter as being in the first

75
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,910
instance of politics of subsistence,

76
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,650
a politics of subsistence.

77
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:38,370
It's most immediate objectives were
frequently the defense or the amelioration

78
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,730
of a threatening economic situation.

79
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,760
The most obvious case of that
was in the case of food riots.

80
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,420
These tended to occur in years of dearth,

81
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,790
bad harvest years when grain was in short
supply and the prices of food rocketed

82
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:03,330
years like 1587 50 94 to seven 1622
to three 1631 1647 to eight and so on.

83
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,020
Okay.

84
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,730
These riots also occurred in years
of industrial depression when rural

85
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:20,200
industrial workers in particular who were
dependent upon the market for most of

86
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:21,310
their food supplies,

87
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,590
found that they lacked the income to
supply themselves because their employers,

88
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:29,110
we're no longer able to
put out work to them.

89
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,910
1620 saw some very bad industrial
depressions of that kind.

90
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,400
Well either circumstance,

91
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,460
a bad harvest or a year of industrial
slump could produce a sudden and

92
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:46,741
catastrophic decline in what
economists refer to as People's xchange

93
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,880
entitlements.

94
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,150
As consumers or in plain English,

95
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,300
they were unable to afford
the food that they needed,

96
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,820
agrarian disturbances,

97
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,170
what rather than less predictable,

98
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,840
but they occurred sporadically and
occasionally in areas or individual

99
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:10,841
communities where the memorial tenants
or the local population more generally

100
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,210
we're confronted with changes which
threatened to undermine the viability of

101
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:20,120
particular patterns of
local rural economy.

102
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,600
So in 1536 as you know,

103
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:28,601
part of the causes of the pilgrimage of
grace rising where protests against the

104
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:32,840
pushing up of entry fines for land
in parts of Northwestern England.

105
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:38,380
In 1549 cats rebellion was rooted in
protests against the exploitation of

106
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:40,460
landlords grazing rights.

107
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:45,110
But above all in the late
16th and dirty 17th centuries,

108
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:50,111
the grievance which motivated protests
was and closure and closure of the land

109
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,870
which extinguished
rights of common pasture,

110
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,311
pasture rights,

111
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:56,630
which were particularly valued.

112
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,201
So,

113
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:57,800
for example,

114
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,290
in the small town of Berkhamsted,

115
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,620
which is just to the northwest of London
in the county of Hartfordshire in 1,618

116
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,810
several villages existed around a very
large area of common land on which they

117
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:17,570
all had rights to graze
their cattle in sheep.

118
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,320
They had rights to put their
pigs into the woodland.

119
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,740
They had rights to gather for fuel and
wild fruits and to capture small animals

120
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:30,020
for the pot rabbits in particular.

121
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,450
The loss of all of that when attempts
were made to enclose berkhamsted common

122
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,780
would deeply resented and that's the kind
of situation that's so often occurred.

123
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:42,651
Now,

124
00:07:42,651 --> 00:07:46,220
situations of that kind
occurred sporadically though.

125
00:07:46,221 --> 00:07:51,221
Sometimes they also came in clusters in
1607 there was a wave of enclosures in

126
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:58,190
villages where the three counties of
North Hampton share work share and

127
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,470
Leicestershire met in
the Midlands up here.

128
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,360
That was known as the Midland rising
because there was a kind of scattering of

129
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,730
riots across the whole area or again,

130
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:15,970
in 1628 to 1632 they're occurred what's
known as the western rising in the

131
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:18,470
forested areas of the west of England.

132
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,390
Those areas were being Disa,

133
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:21,770
forested and cleared,

134
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,660
and the land turned into when closed farms
and much resistance sprang up amongst

135
00:08:26,661 --> 00:08:29,270
those who had formally enjoyed
common rights in the woodlands.

136
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,560
And finally in the 60 from the 1630s
in response to the drainage of the Fed

137
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:40,871
lands of eastern England and
the allocation of reclaimed
reclaimed land in and

138
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:46,010
closed farms to those who
invested in that improvement,

139
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,080
there was a wave of resistance,

140
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,590
the people of the fence to the south of
the wash and in Lincolnshire lost as a

141
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,270
result of the drainage
that grazing rights,

142
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,890
their fishing rights,

143
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,870
they're wild filing rights,

144
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,370
the rights together rushers
and turf for Thatch or fuel.

145
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,820
And they bitterly resisted these
changes in the so called Finland riots,

146
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,950
which actually sputtered
on for over 30 years.

147
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,270
Okay.

148
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:23,270
So we're dealing primarily with forms of
protest against all forms of resistance

149
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:28,851
to circumstances which had a detrimental
effect upon the household economies of

150
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,170
the inhabitants of particular districts.

151
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,390
And those circumstances were felt at
one time or another all over England and

152
00:09:39,391 --> 00:09:40,224
Wales.

153
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,640
But there was also rather
than more to it than that,

154
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,720
although it took historians quite a
while to appreciate the fact when people

155
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:55,980
first started looking closely at the
wreck chords which survive relating to

156
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:56,850
these events,

157
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,840
the most immediately striking thing
about the evidence was that these risings

158
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,780
revotes or riots were in fact relatively
restrained and relatively purposefully

159
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,323
directed.

160
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,060
Perhaps we'd been misled
by the very term riot,

161
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:21,420
which was often used to describe
them in the legal records.

162
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:22,771
That word,

163
00:10:22,771 --> 00:10:27,480
of course conjures up an image
of Urud breakdown of order,

164
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:28,981
but in fact,

165
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:29,940
in English law,

166
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:35,030
a riot was simply an unlawful act
committed by three or more people who had

167
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:38,130
assembled for the purpose.

168
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,440
As a result,

169
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,400
the reality of those events which are
described conventionally as riots,

170
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:49,430
could be much less harrowing than the
image which the term tends to conjure up

171
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,180
in our minds.

172
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,810
So take foot egg,

173
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:54,541
food rights,

174
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,374
for example.

175
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,390
First of all,

176
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,670
they were by no means an automatic
response to the existence of a dearth or

177
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:04,020
scarcity of food.

178
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:05,731
They were in fact,

179
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:06,780
relatively few,

180
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,300
even in pretty bad years.

181
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:12,960
The form was also relatively restrained.

182
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:18,890
Crowds didn't simply sees food from anyone
who had a stock of food to be seized.

183
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,860
The gentry or big farmers
with wells stock bonds,

184
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:23,694
for example.

185
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:24,661
In fact,

186
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:29,661
food riots were almost exclusively
directed at middlemen in the grain trade.

187
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,410
They were almost entirely
directed against corn dealers.

188
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,623
Again,

189
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,760
crowds involved in these riots,

190
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,570
rarely stole food and took it away.

191
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,363
More likely,

192
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,260
they involve the stopping of
middlemen who were transporting grain,

193
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,320
which they had bought up in bulk in
market and forcing them to sell it to the

194
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:58,480
crowd at prices below
the inflated market rate.

195
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,100
That's to say at prices which local
people thought they could afford.

196
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,771
And finally,

197
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:10,150
they very rarely involved violence
against people quite often,

198
00:12:10,151 --> 00:12:15,151
food riots involved or even led by women
who could be quite violent in their

199
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:17,380
language and their threats,

200
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,690
but rarely physically violent.

201
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:25,200
The object was to prevent the removal
of grain to keep it in the area and to

202
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:28,150
force those who had it,

203
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:32,770
to sell it to local people rather
than to attack them personally.

204
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,660
So essentially it appears to be the
case that these were protests against

205
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:44,500
dysfunctions in the developing
internal traffic in foodstuffs.

206
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,260
Such a trade,

207
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,460
especially in grain,

208
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:54,040
was essential to supply England's
growing cities and those areas of the

209
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:54,730
countryside,

210
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,240
which are often described as dependent
areas which didn't produce enough grain

211
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:00,670
for the local populations needs.

212
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,640
But the system of internal trade which
was developing was not yet sufficiently

213
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,300
well developed to iron out regional
inequalities in the supply of food stuffs

214
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:15,520
which was available in bad years.

215
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,680
And in addition,

216
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,930
that system offered opportunities
or temptations to evade the law.

217
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:29,460
The law stated that the poor should
always be served first in the market at

218
00:13:29,771 --> 00:13:33,850
prices which were agreed by the
market officer's as reasonable.

219
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:39,040
Before large scale commercial
dealers were allowed to participate.

220
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,960
Yet that law was frequently
flouted in Hartfordshire,

221
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,601
for example,

222
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:48,601
to the north of London in 1598 the local
justice has had to deal with a major

223
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:52,690
problem of large scale dealers who
were supplying the London food market

224
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,040
intercepting grain before it
ever came to the local markets,

225
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,030
buying it on the road and
removing it immediately to London.

226
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,171
Problems.

227
00:14:02,171 --> 00:14:05,290
Of that kind could provoke a
great deal of local resentment.

228
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,630
And this kind of situation helps to
explain the geography of food riots.

229
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,100
They tended to take place in or near
market towns in heavily populated areas

230
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:18,640
with many consumers,

231
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,570
dependent funders,

232
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,630
markets they took place in or around
market towns of food exporting areas where

233
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,440
the local poor witnessed commercial
dealers buying up supplies at prices which

234
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:34,870
they couldn't afford in order
to ship the grain elsewhere.

235
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,800
And they occurred in areas that such
dealers passed through on their way to

236
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:43,810
major urban markets in particular,

237
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:45,010
one finds a lot of food,

238
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,490
uh,

239
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,790
food rioting in the market
catchment area of London,

240
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,240
in the southeast and in the South
West around the great city of Bristol.

241
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,410
Similarly to a lesser degree
around knowledge in East Anglia.

242
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,560
So these actions were aimed at
rectifying quite specific forms of local

243
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,483
grievance,

244
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,760
a sense amongst local populations that
they were being exploited by middlemen in

245
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:18,041
the grain trade and abused where
there was no such grievance.

246
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,440
The poor seems simply to have tightened
their belts in bad years or even in some

247
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:25,790
parts of the north and far west.

248
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,860
To have starved quietly,

249
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,040
and those of them who did take action
usually did it in a fairly purposeful

250
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:34,880
manner,

251
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,160
focusing on achieving a specific end,

252
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,720
supplying their own needs at
prices that they could afford,

253
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,890
defending one could say
in the jargon there,

254
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:47,270
exchange entitlements.

255
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:50,330
Well,

256
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,163
similarly,

257
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,390
agrarian disturbances present the less
lurid picture than the one conjured up by

258
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:57,230
the word riot.

259
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:03,320
They certainly often involved large crowds
of people who had assembled together

260
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,620
to prevent an enclosure or to reverse
it or to prevent the drainage of Finland

261
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,420
or to reverse it and so forth.

262
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,370
Knocking down hedges and fences,

263
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,770
blocking drainage works and so forth,

264
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,350
but they were also relatively orderly.

265
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:24,700
Surprisingly often agrarian
riots were announced in advance.

266
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,850
They were even sometimes preceded by
meetings in the local manner court or in

267
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:35,840
the church at which the tenants
would agree upon their action.

268
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,641
In one village,

269
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:38,211
for example,

270
00:16:38,211 --> 00:16:39,110
called Righton,

271
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,711
r y,

272
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:39,951
t,

273
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:40,101
O,

274
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:45,101
n up in the northeast of England in 1,607
the manor court actually required all

275
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:52,391
tenants to turn up with a spade or an
ax in order to take down an enclosure to

276
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,500
which they objected.

277
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:59,000
They even laid it down in
the manner court as a bylaw,

278
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,480
that any tenant who failed to turn
up to take part would be fine.

279
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:03,314
Six pens.

280
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:10,820
Sometimes these actions were initiated
having been agreed upon by a public

281
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,654
signal.

282
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,730
Quite often the tolling
of the church bells,

283
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,260
they frequently involve the
gathering of whole communities,

284
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,573
men,

285
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,090
women,

286
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,230
and children together.

287
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,220
Sometimes they were led by local notables.

288
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,130
Sometimes the minister of the
parish might be the leader.

289
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:32,870
Sometimes they were led by parish or
memorial officers or members of the

290
00:17:32,871 --> 00:17:33,830
memorial jury.

291
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,170
Uh,

292
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:40,170
sometimes they even enjoyed the tacit
support of sympathetic local gentleman who

293
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:44,420
might themselves be losing out
from a particular end closure.

294
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,660
And we're content to encourage some action
against it even though they took part

295
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,210
themselves.

296
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:51,990
Uh,

297
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,990
one of the reasons that Oliver Cromwell
was so popular in eastern England in the

298
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:01,350
Fed lands that he came from
was the fact that in 1628,

299
00:18:01,351 --> 00:18:03,750
he had defended the rioters in the fens,

300
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,853
in parliament,

301
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,610
uh,

302
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:06,450
against the,

303
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,590
uh,

304
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,710
innovations that they
were protesting against.

305
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:15,270
He was known as the Lord of the
fence for his popularity in the area.

306
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,030
It didn't hurt when he later
recruited his regiments.

307
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:18,864
There.

308
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,260
Riots often involved a
strong element of ritual.

309
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:31,470
Frequently they involve the ritual
removal of a fence or a hedge.

310
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Sometimes those who pulled down fences
or hedges did it two at a time to avoid

311
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:43,140
the legal definition of a riot as an
illegal act committed by three or more

312
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:43,974
persons.

313
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:49,610
Sometimes the youth or the women of
the community were to the fore in this

314
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:54,030
action in order to
evade severe punishment.

315
00:18:54,031 --> 00:18:56,520
It was thought that they
would be held less culpable.

316
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,980
Sometimes hedges were pulled
down by men dressed as women.

317
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,360
And this transvestite element
in the ritual of writing is,

318
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,770
it's quite fascinating.

319
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,970
It perhaps symbolize a
world turned upside down.

320
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,210
Now,

321
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:15,780
no one could have deceived themselves
that these were actually women.

322
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,010
Um,

323
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,600
they had beards for a start,

324
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:19,560
but,

325
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,130
um,

326
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:20,641
they,

327
00:19:20,641 --> 00:19:21,000
um,

328
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,833
dressed as women,

329
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,200
sometimes perhaps symbolizing
a world turned upside down.

330
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,140
Fences and hedges once they were destroyed
was sometimes saw an up and burned or

331
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:32,850
even ritually buried.

332
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,870
Sometimes the land returned into tillage
was ritually plowed to symbolize it's

333
00:19:40,951 --> 00:19:45,951
return to the memorial
community or sometimes where
it was common pasture which

334
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:47,160
was being defended.

335
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:52,080
Animals were put back onto it by the
villages in order to symbolize their

336
00:19:52,081 --> 00:19:55,020
reclamation of the common pasture,

337
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:00,630
and quite often all of this
might be accompanied by a
rather festive atmosphere.

338
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:06,750
Cakes and Ale were frequently
prepared to be enjoyed afterwards,

339
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,090
often around a bonfire.

340
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,520
Music sometimes accompanied the
proceeding they might be dancing in the

341
00:20:14,521 --> 00:20:15,300
fenlands.

342
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,680
They enjoyed a game which was
known as fenland football.

343
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,240
This was the original form of football
in which large crowds of young men simply

344
00:20:24,241 --> 00:20:25,500
chased across the countryside,

345
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:29,430
kicking an inflated pig's
bladder in the fenland.

346
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,470
When they got together
for fenland football,

347
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,070
they kicked it across the countryside
and destroyed every drainage ditch that

348
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:37,650
they passed in the course
of chasing the ball.

349
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:44,510
It's interesting also that these actions
often took place upon festival days.

350
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:51,830
The rising in the Midlands in 1,607
started on May Day Shrove Tuesday in

351
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:53,711
February.

352
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,750
It was often a popular date.

353
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,240
It was a time known for village games,

354
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:02,890
which involved rituals of inversion
turning the world upside down for a day.

355
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,610
Another popular occasion
was relegation day,

356
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,900
the day on which people perambulator
the boundaries of the parish to note the

357
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:11,734
parish boundaries.

358
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:13,840
And that's something I would I return to.

359
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,053
And again,

360
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,480
agrarian risings of this kind very
rarely involved violence against people.

361
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,610
The crowds might appear very threatening.

362
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,150
There were rarely any
injuries to individuals.

363
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,583
Indeed,

364
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,800
those against whom the crowd were rioting
or protesting very often kept out of

365
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:36,604
the way.

366
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,473
Okay.

367
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,350
So what we're dealing with,

368
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:41,461
uh,

369
00:21:41,461 --> 00:21:46,461
occasions which were often very highly
targeted and very purposeful affairs

370
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:54,470
rather than outbreaks of anarchy
and unrestrained violence,

371
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,460
it's equally evident that they were
expressive of a kind of moral order,

372
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:07,980
which involved not just defense of the
material interests of the community,

373
00:22:07,981 --> 00:22:09,270
important as that was,

374
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,500
but expressed also a set of values.

375
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:19,070
What eep Thompson in a famous phrase
described as the moral economy of the

376
00:22:19,591 --> 00:22:20,424
crowd,

377
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:26,150
by which he meant a popular consensus
about the nature of legitimate and

378
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,750
illegitimate practices.

379
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,780
It economic life involving notions
of the proper behavior expected from

380
00:22:33,271 --> 00:22:38,271
different sections of the community and
asserting notions of certain popular

381
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,070
rights in the economic sphere.

382
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,380
Rioters do indeed very often seem to
have been infused with a strong sense of

383
00:22:50,081 --> 00:22:52,570
the rectitude of the act.

384
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,540
They were sustained in that
by certain legitimizing ideas

385
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,320
as one might expect in
agrarian disturbances.

386
00:23:04,321 --> 00:23:08,220
The vital legitimizing
idea was that of custom.

387
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:10,530
As you know,

388
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,910
in any individual manner,

389
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,240
custom constituted a kind of local lived
in an environment of norms and usages,

390
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,320
a collection of rights
which people believe to have
existed time out of mind to

391
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:29,010
which the memory of no man is
to the contrary in the phrase,

392
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,710
they often used time out of mind

393
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:38,660
and to that extent custom provided a
powerful legitimating rhetoric for actions

394
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,380
of this kind.

395
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,551
For example,

396
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:46,220
in 1630 when the tenants of one manner
in the southwest of England defended

397
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:48,740
their claim to pasture
rights in the forests,

398
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:54,790
they were able to produce 10 witnesses
whose average age was 78 quite

399
00:23:56,031 --> 00:24:01,031
extraordinarily old people for this
period who testified to the existence of

400
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:06,230
their customs in the woodlands during
their own long lives and in those of their

401
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:10,430
fathers and their grandfathers as they
had been told when they were children.

402
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:16,250
But in the changing circumstances of
the 16th and early 17th centuries,

403
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:21,730
custom had become not only a set of
long established rights and practices,

404
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,060
but also in a time of change,

405
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:31,510
a potential arena of conflict
between landlords and tenants

406
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:37,880
if the tenants were trying to defend
what they took to be the antiquity and

407
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:41,630
reasonableness of customs which
protected their interests.

408
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:47,170
Many landlords were anxious to explode
those claims or to persuade people or to

409
00:24:48,981 --> 00:24:52,850
pressurize people into removing customs,

410
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:58,030
which inhibited what they saw
as improvement of their estates.

411
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,120
With that kind of conflict of interests.

412
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,130
When push came to shove,

413
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:10,030
the notion of the sanctity and wisdom
of custom strengthened the arm of those

414
00:25:11,901 --> 00:25:16,040
who tried to resist claims
against local customs,

415
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,810
which were detrimental to their interests.

416
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,740
In the case of enclosure,

417
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,220
they saw themselves also as resisting
a kind of innovation which had been

418
00:25:27,831 --> 00:25:32,240
declared illegal by various statutes
throughout the 16th century.

419
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,860
The laws against enclosure,

420
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:34,251
in fact,

421
00:25:34,251 --> 00:25:39,251
we were appealed in 1624 but the fact
that enclosure had for long been declared

422
00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:44,381
illegal by parliament was remembered and
that again gave a sense of legitimacy

423
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:49,700
and some rioters could even
claim a higher authority.

424
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,650
As I mentioned.

425
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,280
Um,

426
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,910
very often end closure riots
took place on relegation day.

427
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:02,560
That was the day when traditionally the
older members of the village community

428
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:07,970
gathered together with some of the
youngest members in particular young boys,

429
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:11,090
to walk the boundaries of the parish,

430
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:13,280
to beat the bounds as it was called.

431
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:19,870
The Church of England even had a special
homily for relegation day and it had

432
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:21,890
some significant texts.

433
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:27,280
One of them was Deuteronomy 27 17
cursed be he that removes his neighbors

434
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,580
landmark and other was
proverbs 2128 removed,

435
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:38,981
not the ancient landmark which thy fathers
have set the rituals of walking the

436
00:26:39,951 --> 00:26:41,330
boundaries of the parish.

437
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,490
We're all about such landmarks.

438
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,740
They were all about such boundaries,

439
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,160
such common territories and their sanctity
and they tried to impress upon the

440
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:55,860
young boys who were part of the
procession where exactly the boundaries,

441
00:26:55,861 --> 00:26:58,170
where there were various
rituals involved in this.

442
00:26:58,590 --> 00:26:59,640
It's a boundary involved,

443
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:04,440
a stream and one of the boys might be
thrown in the street to help him remember

444
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,423
where it was.

445
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,650
It was common if there were boundaries,

446
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:12,210
stones to get one of the boys to touch
the stone with his finger after which the

447
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:15,720
finger was twisted by one of the
elder men to give him a sharp pain,

448
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:20,721
to remind him one village practice sitting
little boys on the stones with their

449
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:22,524
bare bottoms.

450
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:28,440
They sometimes even struck a child at
particular boundary spots so that they

451
00:27:28,441 --> 00:27:30,180
would remember the place.

452
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,560
It was all part of the ritual.

453
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:38,690
If such occasions sometimes ended with
purposeful attacks upon new fangled

454
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:40,080
boundaries,

455
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,080
which had been erected in the form of
enclosure and which include excluded local

456
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:48,210
inhabitants from formerly common land,

457
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:54,110
then they may very well have had a sense
of divine approval for what they did in

458
00:27:54,721 --> 00:27:56,250
defending their boundaries.

459
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:58,850
Yeah.

460
00:27:58,850 --> 00:27:59,451
Ask for food.

461
00:27:59,451 --> 00:28:00,020
Rioters,

462
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:04,280
they had a strong enough sense of their
own rights to have food available at

463
00:28:04,281 --> 00:28:05,930
reasonable prices.

464
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:11,990
When she was asked what had motivated
her to take part in the stopping of a

465
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:16,991
grain shipment in 1629 one woman
from Essex said it was the quota,

466
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:23,470
the cry of the country and my own want
the cry of the country and my own want

467
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:31,530
green rioters could also claim with some
justification to be merely enforcing

468
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:32,563
the law.

469
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,320
They could see themselves as engaging
in a kind of mass citizen's arrest of

470
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,070
grain dealers who were
breaching market regulations.

471
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,120
Or they could see themselves
as enforcing the regulations,

472
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:50,810
supposed to be put into
effect in times of scarcity,

473
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,750
which the local magistrates
should have enforced.

474
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,820
And frequently grain riots broke out
where the magistrates had been slow to do

475
00:28:58,821 --> 00:28:59,654
so.

476
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:06,430
So then writing crowds had an empowering
sense of the rectitude of their

477
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:09,234
actions,

478
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:16,420
but of course they weren't simply
disinterested upholders of custom and law.

479
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,840
They will also defending their own
interests and in that endeavor,

480
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:28,450
riot was a tactic in a kind of
negotiation with local authorities.

481
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,230
Yeah,

482
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:36,230
very often food riots were preceded
by petitioning petitioning the local

483
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:42,591
magistrates to act to relieve distress
and to put into operation scarcity

484
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,020
regulations.

485
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:49,830
It was commonly the case as I've already
observed that such riots came after

486
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:55,381
weeks of deteriorating
circumstances during which
the local magistrates had been

487
00:29:55,841 --> 00:29:57,640
slow to act.

488
00:29:58,990 --> 00:29:59,381
Hence,

489
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:02,650
you could see rights
as being in some sense,

490
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,120
a kind of petitioning
in strength and indeed

491
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,380
agrarian riots were
often in a similar way,

492
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,440
a particular stage in a process
of dispute and negotiation

493
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,240
that might include,

494
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:23,080
for example,

495
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,140
initial appeals to people who had set
in motion and closure schemes to desist

496
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,330
and give them up.

497
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:33,880
The appeal might come
from the local minister.

498
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,940
It might come from
sympathetic local gentleman.

499
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,070
It might come from the
women of the parish.

500
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,080
It might come from the memorial jury.

501
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,571
If that failed,

502
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:47,830
then there were a number of informal
sanctions which could be taken to try to

503
00:30:47,831 --> 00:30:52,330
put moral pressure upon those
who were engaged in an enclosure.

504
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,950
So for example,

505
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,820
in 1616 and a village
called over competent,

506
00:30:57,821 --> 00:31:00,970
which is endorse it
down in the south west,

507
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,690
a local and closing landlord who's called
Andrew Abington found a paper stuck on

508
00:31:08,441 --> 00:31:11,350
the church door when he
came to church one Sunday.

509
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,620
The paper read here be Andrew
Abington's commandments and it followed,

510
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,800
thou shall do no right,

511
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,580
thou shalt catch what Thou canst.

512
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,970
Thou shalt pay no man,

513
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:31,840
thou shall bear false witness
against our neighbors.

514
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:37,860
Thou shalt denies I known hand that
is deny responsibility and shortly

515
00:31:38,711 --> 00:31:40,960
afterwards and do Abingdon Commandments.

516
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,640
Having embarrassed him at the church
door had been set to music and were being

517
00:31:45,641 --> 00:31:49,510
sung around the local ale houses
as an effort to humiliate him.

518
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,061
Or again,

519
00:31:52,061 --> 00:31:53,740
that could be anonymous stretch.

520
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,520
One landlord in Warrick share in 1,607
received an anonymous letter threatening

521
00:32:00,101 --> 00:32:04,330
that action would be taken if he proceeded
with the enclosure and the letter was

522
00:32:04,331 --> 00:32:05,140
signed,

523
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:09,610
Thomas on hedge or Thomas unhedged or

524
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:17,160
another form of action frequently
taken was to initiate lawsuits.

525
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,530
Sometimes tenants would get together and
pool their resources in a common fund

526
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,580
to bring a case at narrow
forest in Somerset,

527
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:27,450
in the West country.

528
00:32:27,451 --> 00:32:28,284
For example,

529
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,750
tenants anxious to defend the woodlands,

530
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:36,170
put their purses together as it was put
on the advice of the sympathetic steward

531
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:40,700
of another local gentleman who gave
them that advice after an open meeting.

532
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,530
And then with that common purpose,

533
00:32:43,531 --> 00:32:46,670
they hired a lawyer to bring a case
to try to prevent the enclosure.

534
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,210
When the riots came,

535
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:56,290
it was often also a deliberate tactic to
get the case heard in an authoritative

536
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,030
central court,

537
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,490
especially the court of Star
Chamber meeting in Westminster.

538
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:09,890
The Court of Star Chamber is one of the
highest courts in the land was staffed

539
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:15,070
with counselors who are often reasonably
sympathetic to the interests of the

540
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:19,130
local talent tree and who might um,

541
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:24,220
further their case or forced arbitration
in the interests of preserving public

542
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,273
order.

543
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,820
A riot which could provoke a
landlord to bring a case in.

544
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:33,110
Star Chamber was an excellent way
of having local grievances heard,

545
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:38,410
be thought before and authoritative
forum and had the additional advantage of

546
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:42,860
getting it done at the expense of
the landlord who brought the case.

547
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:49,810
So there's a tactical element in many
enclosure riots and that's of course an

548
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,430
important reason for
their relative restraint.

549
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:00,830
They were away of calling the
authorities attention to grievances,

550
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,500
a way of putting pressure on the
authorities to act and to remedy these

551
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:08,840
discontents.

552
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,440
And surprisingly often it worked.

553
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:18,910
Magistrates did put emergency
dearth regulations into
operation in the aftermath

554
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:20,180
of foot rights,

555
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:25,930
punishments of food riots where usually
relatively few and relatively light or

556
00:34:28,221 --> 00:34:29,054
again,

557
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:34,270
star chamber or other central courts
quite frequently ordered the settlement of

558
00:34:34,701 --> 00:34:38,270
particular disputes by a
process of arbitration.

559
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:44,230
And sometimes indeed they even found for
the tenants and for bad the planned in

560
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:45,104
closure,

561
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:51,370
but if action on the part of local
people was not restrained in that way,

562
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,740
it could be a very different story.

563
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:55,940
Uh,

564
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,810
at modern on the coast of
Essex in 1629 for example,

565
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,610
there were two foot rights.

566
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,310
The first of them ended in the
authorities taking action to put scarcity

567
00:35:07,311 --> 00:35:12,311
regulations into effect and punishing
very few people and punishing mode.

568
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,640
I'll need likely when a
second riot took place,

569
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,590
the authorities lost their patients.

570
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:23,000
A special commission was
sent down from Westminster,

571
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,950
which tried those involved as ringleaders
in the riots and hanged four of them,

572
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,510
including the leader of the
modern riots and Carter,

573
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,810
who was known to her followers,

574
00:35:33,811 --> 00:35:38,811
US Captain Anne or again in Midlands in
1,607 the spread of writing against him,

575
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:47,481
closure from parish to parish
was eventually deemed by
the authorities to be so

576
00:35:48,001 --> 00:35:51,930
threatening that they defined
it as treasonable rebellion.

577
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,680
Martial law was declared and the rising
was put down with another crop of

578
00:35:59,281 --> 00:36:00,150
executions,

579
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,520
including the execution of the leader.

580
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,750
John Reynolds known to his
followers as Captain Pouch.

581
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,920
He got that name because he had a
leather pouch in which he claimed to have

582
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:15,921
authority from the king to oppose
and closures when he was taken.

583
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,410
It was founded as pouch
contained his lunch,

584
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,420
some bread and cheese

585
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:23,970
into,

586
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:27,760
interestingly in the new Oxford
Dictionary of national biography,

587
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:32,761
you'll find both and Carter and Captain
Pouch included amongst the dignitaries

588
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:35,910
of national history,

589
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:40,980
the our sense of the past is broad
and wide enough to include people who

590
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,020
previously would have had no place.

591
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:47,460
Well that kind of outcome,

592
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:53,030
if things were deemed to have gone too
far could very sharply remind the common

593
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:58,461
people only to graphically of who ruled
in 16th and 17th century England and

594
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:05,751
that kind of flat repression of
discontent was usually a sign that the

595
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:09,900
authorities had become nervous.

596
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,530
And it raises a further point,

597
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,940
the usual focus in the literature upon
the relative order and the rationality

598
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:26,990
and the tactical good sense of popular
protest and on the usual moderation of

599
00:37:28,921 --> 00:37:31,440
response on the part of the authorities.

600
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,390
All of this is true and yet it runs the
risk of making it all seem a little bit

601
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:37,224
too neat.

602
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,000
A little bit too orderly.

603
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:44,820
I think we have to remember also that
there was a good deal of danger in all of

604
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:45,930
this activity.

605
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:48,870
Sometimes quite serious danger.

606
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:50,380
Well,

607
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:55,380
mustn't forget that the participants in
many of these actions were very anxious

608
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:58,830
and sometimes very angry.

609
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:05,030
We mustn't forget that sometimes what
began as a specific localized limited

610
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,360
protest could escalate.

611
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,440
The outstanding example is cats rebellion
in 1549 which began as an enclosure

612
00:38:15,451 --> 00:38:20,451
riot and ended of course with open
rebellion and indeed a pitched battle that

613
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:25,620
was very exceptional.

614
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:26,843
Nonetheless,

615
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,370
that possibility did exist.

616
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:36,080
The point is that as a tactic of protest
and as a of negotiation with rulers,

617
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,940
riot could be a rather
dangerous game of brinkmanship.

618
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,770
The authorities for their
part had to try to contain it.

619
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,170
They would expect it to respond.

620
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:55,060
They had to retain their authority and
their credibility by responding in the

621
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:56,050
right kind of way.

622
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,200
The crowd for its part
often pushed and menaced,

623
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,620
but it had to avoid going too far.

624
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,360
If it was not to provoke
pretty severe retaliation.

625
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:16,390
Act of insubordination had to be tricked
out with the appearance of ultimate

626
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:17,770
deference to authority.

627
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,820
The responses of concession
and conciliation,

628
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:27,090
which the authorities made had to retain
the appearance of gracious magnanimity

629
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:30,820
magnanimity on the part of rulers,

630
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,130
concerned rulers.

631
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,950
That was the best way to save their face.

632
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,660
It seems to be the case
that for the most part,

633
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,180
this delicate line was held,

634
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:48,970
which is in a way a tribute on the
one hand to the skill with which the

635
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:52,570
leadership of the crowds
conducted their actions.

636
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,100
And on the other hand,

637
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:58,770
the skill with which many of the
magistrates tried to diffuse what we're,

638
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:02,530
what we're potentially
very explosive situations.

639
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:08,950
But of course that doesn't necessarily
mean that the protesters were sincere in

640
00:40:08,951 --> 00:40:10,420
the postures of deference,

641
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,560
which they might adopt in the face of
authority when they negotiated with them.

642
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:20,370
And it certainly doesn't mean that popular
protest was as some historians have

643
00:40:21,011 --> 00:40:21,844
argued,

644
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,190
essentially unpolitical.

645
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,710
When people describe these
actions as unpolitical,

646
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,700
what they seem to mean is that they
involved no challenge to the authority of

647
00:40:36,941 --> 00:40:37,774
the state

648
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:44,370
and that they were not indicative of any
revolutionary attempt to overthrow the

649
00:40:46,481 --> 00:40:48,160
established social order.

650
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:50,591
Well,

651
00:40:50,591 --> 00:40:51,670
of course they didn't.

652
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,040
Even the most determined of protesters
had no alternative model of the social

653
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:02,590
and political order to appeal to.

654
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,610
There are no conceptions of equal rights.

655
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,800
There are no conceptions of democracy.

656
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,290
They had to work within the structures
of power and authority in a hierarchical

657
00:41:14,291 --> 00:41:16,240
society as they found them.

658
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,240
Their objectives were necessarily limited,

659
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:25,030
but that doesn't mean that
their objectives are not
political in the sense that

660
00:41:25,031 --> 00:41:30,031
they were attempting to exert some
influence on how power was exercised,

661
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:35,990
influence on how power was exercised
within their local communities.

662
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:40,070
These forms of popular protest,

663
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:44,810
one could say in that sense
where quintessentially political

664
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:51,310
in the sense that they advanced claims
by local people to be considered,

665
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,870
that they advanced claims
to certain rights to eat,

666
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,520
to enjoy the common

667
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:00,801
rights,

668
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:05,300
which they were very aware of even in
a social system that permitted them.

669
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:08,690
No formal political voice.

670
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,980
They could still have some say in defining
the terms of their subordinate place

671
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:20,560
in society and they could
achieve limited ends in doing so.

672
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,690
That matters a great deal.

673
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,880
It matters a great deal
because it prevented their
complete alienation from the

674
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:33,881
existing social order and encouraged
them to seek justice where they felt

675
00:42:34,341 --> 00:42:39,341
aggrieved rather than simply exacting
from time to time a desperate and bloody

676
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:44,810
revenge and that mattered.

677
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:49,580
It could matter a great deal in particular
when the country fell into political

678
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:52,340
crisis in the 1640s

679
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,870
and finally one last point.

680
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:03,550
The historians who write about popular
protests very often have towards the end

681
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:08,390
of their studies are
somewhat Lgi Eric Tone.

682
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:11,780
That's because in the long run,

683
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,730
the defenders of the
customary agrarian order lost.

684
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,270
They lost because the
world that they was trying,

685
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,800
they were trying to defend,

686
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:25,640
was gradually dissolving all around them.

687
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,390
By the late 17th and early 18th centuries,

688
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:34,420
the resistance of memorial communities
to agrarian change was very largely over

689
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:39,080
because such memorial communities
hardly existed anymore.

690
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:45,370
Communities of tenants with a collective
interest in the customs of the manner

691
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,310
had gradually given
way to a rural society.

692
00:43:49,311 --> 00:43:50,960
Consisting of landlords,

693
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:56,230
large scale commercial farmers
and landless agricultural
neighbors who possessed

694
00:43:56,781 --> 00:43:58,850
very few rights to defend,

695
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,320
but if that was the case,

696
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:07,820
the tradition of protest established
in the 16th and 17th centuries did not

697
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,290
entirely die.

698
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:12,230
Grain rights certainly continued.

699
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:17,950
They faded out only in the 19th century
when greater agricultural productivity

700
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,200
and modern railway transportation.

701
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,340
Finally,

702
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:27,580
I endowed and alleviated the inequalities
of supply which had once provoked

703
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:29,510
those local actions.

704
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,940
That's for the defense of custom.

705
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:34,771
One could say,

706
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:37,950
I think that aspect of it were
transferred into another sphere.

707
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:43,560
Customer might be in
retreat in rural England,

708
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:47,610
but in the emerging world
of industrial England,

709
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:50,070
a new world of custom was being born.

710
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:55,770
It was being born amongst a skilled
journeymen workers of the urban trades

711
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,840
amongst rural weavers,

712
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:02,550
amongst coal miners and semen
in the growing merchant navy.

713
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:04,320
In all of these fears,

714
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,280
new customs,

715
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:10,310
the customs of the trade were being
established and they involved rather like

716
00:45:12,431 --> 00:45:14,040
the older agrarian customs,

717
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:18,360
certain established
expectations and practices,

718
00:45:18,870 --> 00:45:21,630
expectations regarding fair wages,

719
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,730
decent working conditions,

720
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:28,620
the proper relationship which should
exist between master and employee.

721
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:35,390
These people increasingly numerous in
the 17th century were the products of an

722
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:37,680
emergent capitalist market economy.

723
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,131
They were,

724
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:38,964
it's children.

725
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,130
They didn't oppose it as such,

726
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:46,530
but they tried to place their
own limitations on the demands,

727
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,680
which it made upon them
as best they could,

728
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,910
defending their own place
within it structures.

729
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:55,801
I'm speaking,

730
00:45:55,801 --> 00:45:56,191
of course,

731
00:45:56,191 --> 00:45:56,820
of the earth,

732
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,910
the emergence of the earliest
forms of Labor Organization,

733
00:45:59,911 --> 00:46:04,911
which you find emerging
amongst the journeyman and
manufacturing workers of the

734
00:46:05,701 --> 00:46:08,640
industrial districts from
the late 17th century.

735
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:11,430
The context had changed,

736
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
but the essence of the tradition could
be said to have continued in new ways for

737
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:18,390
new times.

738
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,140
The age of the manor was ending,

739
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,180
but the age of organized
labor was just beginning.
