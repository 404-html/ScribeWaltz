1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:02,480
Okay,

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,360
let's get started.

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:04,523
Um,

4
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,890
when I was at school
that we were often told,

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,820
um,

6
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,910
that one of the great things about
British history was that the country had

7
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:16,911
never been successfully invaded by a
foreign power since 10 66 when William the

8
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:22,410
conqueror and the Normans
conquered the Saxon Kingdom.

9
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,410
And this was part of the
national story as we got it.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,940
It was a great deal of emphasis upon
successfully resisting foreign powers,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,900
Spanish armada,

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,070
Napoleon,

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:32,903
Hitler,

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,073
whatever.

15
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,860
Um,

16
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,490
so no,

17
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:40,200
no successful foreign invasion since
10 66 and this makes a good story,

18
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,960
but unfortunately it's not actually true.

19
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,070
Uh,

20
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,070
Britain was very successfully
invaded in November,

21
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,610
1688 by a largely Dutch army under
William of Orange Stat holder of the

22
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:57,084
Netherlands.

23
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,720
But that of course didn't count.

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,040
The whole events of 1688 had been
successfully repackaged as the essential

25
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:13,191
prelude to the English revolution part
to the glorious revolution of 1688 taken

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,990
in the classic Whig interpretation
of national history as a fundamental

27
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:23,003
watershed.

28
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,230
Before 1688,

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,560
the country had been beset with chronic
political instability and indeed social

30
00:01:30,631 --> 00:01:31,464
conflict.

31
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,780
60 and 88 cleared the way.

32
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,330
It cleared the way for the establishment
of a stable constitutional monarchy,

33
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,720
cleared the way for political liberty.

34
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,540
It cleared the way for religious
toleration and cultural pluralism,

35
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,690
a triumph of weak principles in that
respect and security of property and

36
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:59,571
growing economic opulence
and the formation of the
United Kingdom by the Union

37
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,040
of England and Scotland.

38
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,120
And finally the successful assertion of
national power internationally and the

39
00:02:08,401 --> 00:02:11,100
growth of an overseas empire.

40
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:12,691
Well,

41
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:16,230
these are some of the key elements
classically stressed from the 18th century

42
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:18,450
onwards in wig historiography.

43
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,030
It's a bit of a myth,

44
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,970
a particular rather self
serving interpretation of
the national passed with the

45
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:31,110
strong ideological message
about what it is to be British,

46
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,640
but like all historic
graphical myths of that kind,

47
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:37,020
it did have a kernel of truth,

48
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,340
even if it airbrushed out an awful lot
of the real complexities of the story and

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,230
tended to represent as
being almost inevitable,

50
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,120
a set of outcomes,

51
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:53,490
which were in fact far more complex,

52
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,960
far more hesitant,

53
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,650
far more messy than
was usually recognized,

54
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,900
but still be that as it may.

55
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,180
These are the processes that we need
to consider in the final days of this

56
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:07,264
course.

57
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,700
Well,

58
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,600
as you remember,

59
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,830
by 60 and 88 king James the second had
succeeded in undermining the initial

60
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:24,270
strength of his position when he came to
the crown by utterly alienating what's

61
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:29,800
usually referred to as the Tori Anglican
majority in the political political

62
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:30,634
nation.

63
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,970
People upon whom Charles a second had
counted when he faced down the wig

64
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:40,210
opposition in the exclusion
crisis of 1678 to 81

65
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,430
and at the same time as
he alienated those people,

66
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,700
James had failed to win the trust and
support of the Protestant dissenters,

67
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,940
the low church Anglicans who had been
the backbone of the wig and exclusionist

68
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:58,843
caused

69
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,160
the extent of this general
alienation from the king.

70
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,280
And his policies was of course revealed
in the fact that some of the leaders of

71
00:04:08,711 --> 00:04:09,491
the political nation,

72
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:14,491
we're willing to actively
support intervention by a
foreign power in 1688 indeed

73
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:18,460
to invite it in that
famous letter to William,

74
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:22,080
the third and even more including James,

75
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:27,081
the second zone army were willing at
least to acquiesce in the face of Williams

76
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,153
intervention.

77
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,110
They sat on their hands

78
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,871
to this extent.

79
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:39,250
One could say that the revolution
of 1688 was in different ways,

80
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:43,000
both a wig and a Tori revolution.

81
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,140
It was in part an elite coup d'etat.

82
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,230
It was impart a country revolution.

83
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,800
It merged a range of political opinion
in opposition to James in opposition to

84
00:04:56,441 --> 00:05:00,700
the specter of popery and arbitrary power

85
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,480
and the political
settlement as it emerged,

86
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,110
reflected that composite
character of the revolution.

87
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,530
On the 22nd of January,

88
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:16,531
he's 60 and 89 a convention parliament
met to begin working out the settlement.

89
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,060
It had its estimated 319 members of
broadly wig sympathy and 232 abroadly

90
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:26,921
broadly,

91
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:30,280
Tori sympathy plus the House of Lords,

92
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:36,130
but the debates as they went on seem to
have become largely dominated by those

93
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,160
of the middle ground who managed to
hold the minorities of extremists,

94
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,650
both political persuasions in check.

95
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,030
It seems to have been one of those rabbit
instructive situations in history when

96
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:51,820
the center is tough and holds from

97
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,880
the conventions,

98
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,180
formal definition of the
situation reflected that it
resolved and I'm quoting,

99
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,400
it resolved almost unanimously that King
James the second having attempted to

100
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:12,311
subvert the constitution of the kingdom
by breaking the contract between king

101
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,160
and people and by the advice of Jesuits
and other wicked persons having violated

102
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:25,361
the fundamental laws and having
withdrawn himself out of this kingdom has

103
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,390
abdicated the government and that
the throne is thereby vacant.

104
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,170
That's what they resolved and
no carefully and those words,

105
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:41,171
it's another masterpiece of ambiguity
comparable to the communion service in the

106
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:45,620
Anglican prayer book of
1559 which you'll remember,

107
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,230
they say that James broke the
contract between king and people.

108
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:52,940
That's Whig ideology,

109
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,440
the notion of a contract,

110
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,240
but he also withdrew
himself and abdicated,

111
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:04,430
so he hadn't actually been
deposed for his offenses.

112
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,980
That's an appeal to Tory sympathy.

113
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:11,981
They didn't believe in resistance to a
divinely appointed and anointed king,

114
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,640
so he'd abdicated as for
the Jesuits and so forth.

115
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:16,761
Well,

116
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:18,050
everyone could agree on that

117
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,690
and in all of this,

118
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:25,691
of course the status of the baby Prince
James was conveniently forgotten.

119
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,160
Now this kind of interpret
it your own way attitude.

120
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:36,161
Also suffused a lot of the rest of the
settlement as it unfolded in 1589 and 50

121
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:42,491
90 William was not content
to be simply a regent,

122
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,990
but he and Mary shared the crown until
her death in 60 94 he was king in effect,

123
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,500
but he wasn't an elected king.

124
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,920
He held the crown in right of his
wife who was a legitimate Stuart air,

125
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,970
the Protestant daughter of games a
second by his first marriage and it was

126
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:07,250
agreed that Mary's youngest sister,

127
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,330
Princess Anne,

128
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:13,870
would be the next air ahead of any
children that William and Mary themselves

129
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,973
might have.

130
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,840
Again,

131
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,550
all very odd.

132
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:25,730
The convention also drew up a declaration
of rights later passed into law as the

133
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:26,630
bill of rights.

134
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,500
It was clear on some matters which
found almost universal ascent,

135
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,800
but it was also cautious and
ambiguous in other respects.

136
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,200
The power of the monarch,

137
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:36,831
for example,

138
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:40,640
to suspend the laws was
declared to be illegal,

139
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,120
but the dispensing par of the monitor
traditional dispensing par was illegal

140
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:51,730
only as it have been exercised of late
I II as it had been exercised by James

141
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:57,521
the second parliaments should be called
frequently and should be freely elected,

142
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,650
but as yet there were no specific
measures to ensure that that would happen.

143
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,730
Roman Catholics were to be
excluded from the crown,

144
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,950
but as yet there was no specific provision
to ensure that that would be the case

145
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,050
and above all,

146
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,780
the status of the whole
document was rather obscure.

147
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,940
It looked rather like a
contract with the new Monnox,

148
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,950
but in fact the offer of the crown to
William and Mary was not made conditional

149
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:27,300
upon accepting it.

150
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,970
The offer of the crown was actually
made on the 13th of February before the

151
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:37,971
declaration of Rights had been presented
to William and Mary and they hadn't

152
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:41,550
formally accepted it before they were
proclaimed monarchs the next day.

153
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,710
So 1689 saw a series of measures intended
to advance the transfer of power to

154
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:54,054
William and Mary,

155
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,510
and that was rapidly consolidated
with other acts of parliament,

156
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,620
which again reflect the coalition of
interests involved in the revolution.

157
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,230
They passed a mutiny act that laid down
that no standing army would be permitted

158
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:10,560
in peacetime unless
authorized by parliament.

159
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,430
They voted income to
the crown by taxation,

160
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,140
but the sums which were voted were
well known to be inadequate for even

161
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,030
peacetime administration,

162
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,260
let alone wartime.

163
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:28,070
And so parliament would always be needed
in order to grant additional necessary

164
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:29,004
supply.

165
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,380
They pass a toleration act.

166
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,130
Protestant dissenters were allowed to
worship publicly and by the end of 50 90

167
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:41,190
some 9,000 dissenting meeting
houses had been opened,

168
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:46,260
but they were still not
accorded full civil rights.

169
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:50,340
The Church of England remained
the legally established church.

170
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:55,380
The test acts was still there to exclude
nonmembers of the Church of England

171
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,300
from holding public office,

172
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,790
but Protestant dissenters were allowed
to worship openly and meanwhile,

173
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:03,780
Roman Catholics,

174
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,880
Unitarians and Jews were
permitted to worship in private.

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,770
They were tolerated officially

176
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,673
altogether.

177
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,740
The settlement of 60 88 and nine
constituted a kind of pragmatic compromise

178
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:25,350
designed obviously enough to appeal
to as many people as possible and to

179
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:29,220
alienate as few as possible from
the revolutionary settlement.

180
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,050
John Moral has put it,

181
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:31,351
well,

182
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:36,351
he calls it a centrist compromise
and a constitutional blur.

183
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,620
And as with Elizabeth and religious
settlement of 1559 it was full of

184
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:48,510
inconsistencies and it remained to be
seen just how they would work it out in

185
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:49,344
practice,

186
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,010
how it would be worked out by political
groups who had somewhat different

187
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,460
interpretations of just
what it actually meant,

188
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,980
but worked out.

189
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:00,843
It was,

190
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:04,390
and in the course of
the next 25 years or so,

191
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,140
that involved a significant refashioning
of the state as a result and the

192
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:17,161
emergence by 1714 of a British
state of a shape and structure,

193
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:22,360
which no one had quite anticipated in 1688

194
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,490
well that British state,

195
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,850
what's shaped partly by
political principles.

196
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,930
It was shaped partly by political and
religious prejudices and partly also by

197
00:12:38,771 --> 00:12:42,430
the constraining force of
immediate circumstances.

198
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,800
And if those circumstances,

199
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:46,090
that dominant circumstance,

200
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,943
it was war,

201
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,250
the modern British state,

202
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:50,021
it could be sad,

203
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:53,110
was forged under the stresses of war.

204
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,480
William of Orange hadn't intervened in
1688 out of his deep personal concern for

205
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,630
England's religion and liberties.

206
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:10,600
His intervention was part and parcel
of his life's mission of containing the

207
00:13:10,601 --> 00:13:15,601
threatened had Yemeni of
the French monarchy of Louis
the 14th and in particular

208
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:18,520
the threat it poses to his own country,

209
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:23,580
the Netherlands and the price
of Williams intervention was war

210
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:26,741
war.

211
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:31,630
First of all to defend the revolutionary
settlement against Jacobite risings

212
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,630
Jacobites being supporters of James
Jacobite risings in Scotland in 1689 to 90

213
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:43,710
then to oust James the second from
Ireland where he'd landed with an army in

214
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:47,440
1689 to 91 culminating in
the battle of the boy in it,

215
00:13:47,441 --> 00:13:50,230
which James was defeated
and led back to France.

216
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Then war in the Netherlands against Louis
the 14th between 60 and 88 and 1697 to

217
00:13:59,021 --> 00:14:02,710
contain the French who were
James's principled supporters.

218
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:08,400
And then again after William the thirds
death in 1,702 renewed war between 1702

219
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:15,721
and 1713 to defeat the renewed
menace of French hegemony,

220
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,970
which included French recognition
of the claims of James.

221
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The second's son James had died
in 1,701 his son and heir James.

222
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:33,631
The third to those who supported him was
known as the pretender to the crowns of

223
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:36,190
England and Scotland.

224
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,770
13 years old when his father died.

225
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,420
So then between 1688 and 1713 we have
a whole generation of major wars being

226
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,710
fought on land and sea,

227
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,550
mostly against the French.

228
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,300
Given its commitment until the revolution
the political nation represented in

229
00:15:00,761 --> 00:15:05,761
parliament was willing though very
reluctant to recognize the need for these

230
00:15:07,301 --> 00:15:08,134
wars,

231
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,900
but at the same time parliament was
acutely sensitive to the danger that they

232
00:15:13,901 --> 00:15:16,750
might lead to a buildup of royal power,

233
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:18,790
which might threaten its own position,

234
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,470
might raise again that
specter of arbitrary power.

235
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,090
Okay.

236
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:30,800
Out of the interaction of that necessity
to fight the wars and that anxiety

237
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,000
about where they might lead
their eventually emerged.

238
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,920
What was on the one hand,

239
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,640
a far more powerful state apparatus.

240
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:46,010
It's been described famously by John
Brewer as the fiscal military state,

241
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,600
which emerges at this time
and yet on the other hand,

242
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,990
it was a more powerful state apparatus
which remained very firmly under

243
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,100
parliamentary control

244
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,390
and the key to the whole
process as you'll be aware,

245
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:03,710
it was finance,

246
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,970
but to understand that we have to step
back first a little bit in time and look

247
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:11,960
at what's known as the
financial revolution.

248
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,953
Yeah.

249
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,993
Now,

250
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,983
as you know,

251
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,580
by the standards of the day,

252
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,740
England was a relatively rich country
by the late 17th century and getting

253
00:16:23,741 --> 00:16:24,574
richer

254
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,110
earlier in the century.

255
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:27,501
However,

256
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:32,501
governments had rarely succeeded in
tapping that wealth effectively for their

257
00:16:32,661 --> 00:16:33,860
own purposes.

258
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:39,730
The late 17th and early 18th centuries
in the so called financial revolution saw

259
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,830
a transformation of the fiscal capacity
of the state that is its ability to

260
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:50,621
raise money for its
purposes and consequently a
transformation of its capacity

261
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,720
for effective action.

262
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,190
This was the outcome of developments
which are in the words of one recent

263
00:16:58,191 --> 00:17:03,191
historian of the financial revolution
transformed the willingness rather than

264
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:08,840
the ability of the English
people to pay high taxes,

265
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,280
lend large sums and above all repos Greg
trust in the financial institutions of

266
00:17:17,031 --> 00:17:18,410
their parliamentary government.

267
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:20,811
I tend,

268
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:21,410
we Rosevear,

269
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,243
I'm quoting

270
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:29,340
parliamentary government and the trust
which it could inspire was perhaps indeed

271
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,550
the key to this whole development

272
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,041
on the Charles.

273
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,240
The second parliaments,

274
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:41,050
ultimate control of the public
purse was of course not in doubt,

275
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,761
but as you know,

276
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:47,710
suspicion of the crown's policies could
mean that parliament was unwilling to

277
00:17:47,711 --> 00:17:48,640
grant supply.

278
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,700
Indeed.

279
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,900
In 1672 the situation in royal
finances had become so bad.

280
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:00,170
The crown became so overstretched as a
debtor that it led to what's known as the

281
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:05,571
stop of the Exchequer in which Charles
the second postponed repayments of his

282
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:09,120
debts to private lenders.

283
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,430
Many London bankers
were completely ruined.

284
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,750
As a result,

285
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,410
it was a very severe blow to the car.

286
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,040
The crown's credit and its
ability to raise money.

287
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,200
Well after 60 and 88 that kind
of situation was transformed,

288
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,890
transformed in less than 10 years in the
face of the need to raise money for the

289
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:34,620
wars fought to defend the
revolutionary settlement.

290
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,490
It's a long and complex story,

291
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,820
but the essence of it all is quite nicely
contained in a statement made by Lord

292
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,570
Macaulay and his history of all this
written back in 1848 McCourty wrote from a

293
00:18:52,411 --> 00:18:55,020
period of immemorial antiquity,

294
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,510
it has been the practice of every
English government took contract debts.

295
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,160
What the revolution introduced was the
practice of honestly paying them back.

296
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,320
Parliament was now fully in control,

297
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,480
not only of grant of supply,

298
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,370
but of its expenditure.

299
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,430
Annual estimates were made of need.

300
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,500
Supply was voted.

301
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,730
The accounts what audited by
parliamentary commissioners.

302
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,600
Revenue was now regarded as the public
revenue rather than the monarchs revenue

303
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,760
and from 60 98 even the ordinary day
to day expenses of the crown were

304
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,830
controlled by an annual grant,

305
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,840
so called civil list.

306
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:47,460
The money paid for running the day to
day business of the monarchy as still

307
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:48,294
happens,

308
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:54,410
parliaments sanctioned a whole series
of devices to raise money for the wall.

309
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,770
In 60 90 at voted a land tax,

310
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:03,570
a quite heavy tax on landowners which
brought in a reliable annual income.

311
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:08,820
Loans were raised on the security
of parliamentary taxation.

312
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,610
Longer term borrowing was achieved by
means of the sale of annuities to the

313
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:19,611
public with the regular payment of
those annuities secured by parliamentary

314
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:21,144
taxation.

315
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,590
They tried out lotteries as a way of
raising money again with parliaments

316
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:30,591
sanction in 1694 the Bank
of England was charted.

317
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:37,430
Lenders were brought to subscribe to a
1.2 million pound loan with the interest

318
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,650
and the eventual repayment of the
capital guaranteed from taxation.

319
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:48,400
The Bank of England was not a
central bank in modern sense,

320
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,640
but it was a vehicle devised to raise
money for the needs of the state.

321
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,680
There was also the development of a market
in various forms of state securities

322
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:01,750
is new state securities
which were being issued.

323
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,320
They could be sold on to third parties
and it was at the core of the emergence

324
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,100
of dealings in stocks,

325
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,530
the beginnings of the
London Stock Exchange.

326
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,540
All of this was initiated in a piecemeal
and a rather improvised manner.

327
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,870
Year by year.

328
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:24,100
They dreamed up something new as a
way of raising the money they needed.

329
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,190
But gradually by the early 18th century,

330
00:21:27,191 --> 00:21:32,191
it had coalesced into a
system and fundamental to the
whole emerging edifice was

331
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,530
an effective tax system,

332
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,630
which made possible the servicing
of a growing public debt.

333
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,680
Initially the land tax quite heavy,

334
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,610
about 20% on landed income
in the richest counties,

335
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,060
and then increasingly
the use of the exercise,

336
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,950
which was indirect taxes collected by
a growing corpus of public officials,

337
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,160
excise men as they were known
and as a system developed,

338
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,510
there was a growth of confidence
in the financial probity.

339
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,580
And reliability of the state and that
growing confidence transformed people's

340
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:16,540
willingness to lend their
money to the government.

341
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:20,770
Public revenues increased massively

342
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:26,950
by 1700 it's been estimated at about 9%
of national income was being taken in

343
00:22:26,951 --> 00:22:31,951
taxation and by the same year about a
third of the revenue raised by the state

344
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,300
was being used to fund the debts.

345
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:40,770
By 1714 the national debt had
risen to 48 million pounds,

346
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:43,180
a massive son by the standards of the day,

347
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,730
most of it funded by parliamentary
pledges to pay the interest and eventually

348
00:22:48,731 --> 00:22:49,564
the principal

349
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,510
in 1717 after the end of the
war of the Spanish succession,

350
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,880
a variety of sinking funds were
established to pay off parts of the debt,

351
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:06,930
but it was generally recognized that
a public debt of some size reliably

352
00:23:07,391 --> 00:23:12,220
serviced in the way I've described
would be a permanent fact of life.

353
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,323
Thereafter.

354
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:15,731
In short,

355
00:23:15,731 --> 00:23:20,731
what they done in the financial revolution
was to create gradually a stable

356
00:23:21,011 --> 00:23:26,011
system of public credit
based upon parliamentary
taxation and with it a regime

357
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,680
which has been described as
having the political support,

358
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,170
the administrative capacity,

359
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,620
and the fiscal base required to accumulate
and service a perpetual national

360
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,443
debt.

361
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,130
So in the years after 60 98 the fiscal
capacity of the state was rapidly and

362
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:53,750
massively transformed.

363
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:59,690
John Brewer calls this a fiscal military
state because so much of the enhanced

364
00:23:59,691 --> 00:24:02,210
public revenue was spent on war.

365
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:09,130
Military expenditure as a proportion
of national income was about 2% at the

366
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:15,311
death of charter second in 1685 by 1700
it was 4% in 1710 at the height of the

367
00:24:18,411 --> 00:24:19,700
war of the Spanish succession,

368
00:24:19,701 --> 00:24:24,701
it peaked at over 14% and then it settled
down after piece came in 1714 at about

369
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:31,880
5% even in peace time,

370
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:35,090
mostly as a result of
the regular expenditure,

371
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,860
which was maintained maintaining the
Royal Navy as a permanent military

372
00:24:39,861 --> 00:24:40,694
presence.

373
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,291
Now,

374
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:47,291
all of this could have been potentially
destabilizing and there were times in

375
00:24:48,831 --> 00:24:52,580
the 60 nineties as they went from
year to year trying to raise money,

376
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,590
that the whole thing sometimes teetered
on the edge of potential collapse.

377
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,910
There was a real risk in 60 96 that they
wouldn't be able to raise enough money,

378
00:25:01,911 --> 00:25:02,481
for example,

379
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:03,314
to pay the army,

380
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,070
but they managed to sustain it.

381
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,400
They improvise their way
through and eventually,

382
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:11,031
as I said,

383
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:15,290
it coalesced into a system which provided
the underpinning for the emergence of

384
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,780
England as a significant military par,

385
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,420
a significant world power,

386
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:28,400
but if parliament was willing to provide
the resources which made possible that

387
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:33,401
kind of growth in the power of the
state parliament also exacted a price.

388
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:38,060
It exacted a price politically.

389
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:44,720
As John Brewer shows the prevalence
suspicion of central government amongst

390
00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:49,721
parliamentarians meant that they
exerted themselves to try to shape this

391
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,120
emergent state operators in ways that
would accord with their own preferences,

392
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,100
their so called country attitudes.

393
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,020
That suspicion of central government,

394
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,910
the need for annual parliamentary
supply meant that parliament became a

395
00:26:07,731 --> 00:26:10,280
permanent part of the
government of the country.

396
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,060
They had to have parliamentary
sessions every single year.

397
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,510
No one had anticipated
that it just happened.

398
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,980
It was necessary.

399
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:24,980
The money which was granted to the
government by these parliaments was very

400
00:26:24,981 --> 00:26:29,840
carefully monitored according
to the system of appropriation,

401
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,760
the principle of appropriation,

402
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:37,490
that's to say parliamentary grants could
be used only for the purposes for which

403
00:26:37,491 --> 00:26:38,720
they had been granted.

404
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,503
Therefore,

405
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,560
policy had to be in a accord with
parliaments wishes to meet parliaments,

406
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:48,743
approve

407
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:54,330
royal ministers might
be chosen by the crown,

408
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,860
but again,

409
00:26:55,860 --> 00:27:00,860
they needed to be men who could command
a support of a majority in the House of

410
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,620
Commons.

411
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,020
If they had no majority
in the House of Commons,

412
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,910
they weren't able to achieve anything.

413
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,090
They weren't able to get
the supply that they needed

414
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,810
and in other more specific ways,

415
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,430
as brewer puts it,

416
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,880
fiscal control put the bite into
the bark of country politics.

417
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:24,240
Sometimes they would
tack on to Revenue Bills,

418
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,470
a place act.

419
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:30,120
That was an act which attempted to exclude
government officials from the House

420
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:34,980
of Commons in order to preserve the
independence of parliament in 60 94

421
00:27:34,981 --> 00:27:35,320
Williams.

422
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,320
The third was forced to accept a new and
strengthened triennial act under which

423
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,990
parliament should be not only
called every three years,

424
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,680
but should not sit longer than
three years without new elections,

425
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,150
so they had to have
elections every three years,

426
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:59,360
a very significant curtailment of the
royal prerogative to call and then to

427
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:00,690
dissolve parliament.

428
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,230
When the king chose William
resisted it strongly,

429
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,320
but he had to give way in the end by 1700
the relationship between the ministers

430
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,480
in the royal government,

431
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:17,900
those who sat in the cabinet and
parliament had become the crucial axis of

432
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:26,030
political life and the struggle of those
ministers to establish and to maintain

433
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,190
a working majority in parliament.

434
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:34,190
Above all in the House of Commons was
giving rise to an increasingly vigorous

435
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:38,460
brand of organized party
politics in parliament.

436
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,770
The old abusive labels wig and Tori,

437
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,010
which as you know,

438
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:49,860
had first appeared to hurl against
your enemies in the exclusion crisis.

439
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:55,370
These were now revived and perpetuated
to describe different groupings,

440
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,481
groupings,

441
00:28:57,481 --> 00:29:01,350
which had different interpretations
of the meaning of the revolution and

442
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:05,880
differences of view about
how the revolutionary
settlement should be developed

443
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,100
by 1700.

444
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:11,940
The wigs and the Tories were
fairly organized groups.

445
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,910
They had their own favorite
meeting places in London.

446
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:16,830
They had their own newspapers,

447
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,070
they had their own national followings.

448
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:26,540
The adversarial politics of Whigs and
Tories influenced political life at the

449
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:31,140
level of the city at the
level of county politics.

450
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:36,980
It erupted periodically in the vigorous
contests of the many general elections,

451
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,770
which were held between 60 and 90 and 17,

452
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:42,230
15.

453
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:46,900
There were 10 general elections in those
years in which it's estimated something

454
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:51,100
like a quarter of the adult male
population exercise their votes and the

455
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:53,200
election campaigns were full of competing,

456
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:53,630
uh,

457
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,430
of,

458
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:55,263
um,

459
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:00,750
competition for seats in which the Whigs
and Tories organized their supporters.

460
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,800
These alignments were even such that in
the city of York where they had assembly

461
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:10,450
rooms were polite society met to
hold balls and other occasions,

462
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:11,500
concerts and so forth.

463
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,830
There was one assembly room for
the wigs and one for the Tories.

464
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:22,050
But if Whigs and Tories fought furiously
for dominance in both parliament and in

465
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:24,880
local politics,

466
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:30,570
there were also vital areas in
which they were fundamentally at one

467
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,880
and that was revealed in 1,701 when the
death of Princess Anne's only child,

468
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:46,260
the ultimate heir to the throne called
into question the future succession of

469
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:47,164
the crown.

470
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:54,270
This precipitated the so called
act of settlement of 1,701

471
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,030
it's known as the act of settlement,

472
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,850
but the actual title of the
act is quite significant.

473
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:05,910
It was actually called and act for the
further limitation of the crown and

474
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:10,270
better securing the rights of the subject.

475
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:17,430
This act which obtain support from
both sides politically passed over 57

476
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,720
possible claimants to the crown on the
grounds that they were Roman Catholics

477
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:30,990
and it fixed the succession on
the electors safier of Hanover,

478
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:36,270
ruler of a small north German principality
who was descended from King James.

479
00:31:36,281 --> 00:31:41,281
The first safier of Hanover and her heirs
were chosen as the nearest Protestant

480
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,073
successes.

481
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:50,650
The act also required that future Monica
should be communicated to the Church of

482
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:51,483
England.

483
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,550
It forbade their marriage
to Roman Catholics.

484
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,070
It restricted the movements of the Monique
outside the kingdom could not leave

485
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:01,240
the kingdom without permission.

486
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,010
And in addition,

487
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,910
it made Royal Privy Council is
more accountable to parliament,

488
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,060
restricted the election of place,

489
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:14,350
men from the government to the House
of Commons and declared that in future

490
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:19,650
judges in the law courts should enjoy
their tenure during good behavior and not

491
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:22,210
merely at the will of the Monique.

492
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,700
So a specific contingency.

493
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,240
The problem over the succession gave
rise to a far reaching set of statutory

494
00:32:30,881 --> 00:32:32,800
restrictions on the crown's actions,

495
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,980
which found widespread support

496
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,321
in some.

497
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:44,321
Then by the time Queen Anne came to the
throne in 1702 with the prospect of the

498
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:46,100
future,

499
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,540
Hannah Varian succession,

500
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:51,790
which actually eventually took
place in 1714 when Electra Sufi,

501
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:53,930
his son George became king.

502
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,090
With all of that,

503
00:32:56,090 --> 00:33:00,230
it can be said that some of the
fundamental political issues which had so

504
00:33:00,231 --> 00:33:02,480
disturbed the 17th century,

505
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:07,750
we're close to being resolved with
general acceptance of those resolutions.

506
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:14,710
The issue of the security
of the Protestant religion
and of the toleration of

507
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,340
religious dissenters had been resolved.

508
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,240
The issue of parliament's role and its
permanence in the constitution had been

509
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:26,834
resolved.

510
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,480
The issue of the royal prerogative in
matters of state and how far it could be

511
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:37,481
controlled or reduced the problem
of effective government finance.

512
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,200
The problem of how to contain differences
of political principle without those

513
00:33:46,101 --> 00:33:50,870
partners and differences leading to the
breakdown of government or to civil war

514
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,900
had been resolved with party politics.

515
00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:00,610
The structures and practices of the
English state had been refashioned in a

516
00:34:01,191 --> 00:34:06,191
manner which both enhance the power of
the state and at the same time contained

517
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,820
the part of the state in ways which
would be conducive to safe guarding the

518
00:34:13,251 --> 00:34:14,450
liberties of the subject.

519
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,171
Well,

520
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:20,450
one final element remains

521
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:27,160
from 1,707 this emergent
state was not just an English,

522
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:33,070
but a British state with
the constitutional union
in May 1,707 of England and

523
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:36,224
Scotland,

524
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:41,650
Ireland remained technically a separate
kingdom until 1,801 the one ruled by a

525
00:34:44,061 --> 00:34:45,980
Protestant landed elite.

526
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,440
Now in Scotland,

527
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:57,430
much of the kingdom and particularly
lowland Scotland and some parts of the

528
00:34:57,921 --> 00:34:58,520
highlands,

529
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,010
those parts of the Western
highlands of Scotland,

530
00:35:01,011 --> 00:35:02,870
which were dominated by the clan Campbell,

531
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:07,100
who were both Protestants
and wigs in politics,

532
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:12,790
much of Scotland then had
welcomed the revolution of 1688

533
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:19,220
and rebellions by some of the Jacobite
clans of Highland Scotland where swiftly

534
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,350
put down in 60 90

535
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:28,130
but in the years that followed if the 60
nineties witness to kind of resurgence

536
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:31,100
of Scotland's political independence,

537
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:37,300
it was also a propound profoundly
traumatic decade for the Scotts.

538
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,930
Scotland remained a
relatively poor country,

539
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,120
magnificent landscape,

540
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,890
but somewhat barren.

541
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:53,060
It was largely a subsistence economy in
the rural area areas and it was a very

542
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:54,690
fragile one.

543
00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:00,830
In 60 95 to 99 Scotland's suffered
dreadful famine known as the Ileus of King

544
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:04,830
William.

545
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:09,830
It's possible that as much as 13% of
the population of Scotland died in those

546
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:10,470
years,

547
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:15,470
and indeed much more in the most marginal
Highland areas in Highland Aberdeen.

548
00:36:16,211 --> 00:36:17,730
Shia up here,

549
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,440
the,

550
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:18,960
um,

551
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,420
Highland areas of northeastern Scotland,

552
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,940
it's estimated that perhaps a third of
the population died in the 60 nineties.

553
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,920
Scotland had relatively
little manufacturing industry.

554
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:33,030
It was little developed.

555
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:38,330
The most important sector
was the manufacturer of
linen on Tayside up here and

556
00:36:39,301 --> 00:36:42,240
over near Glasgow in the West.

557
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,793
Um,

558
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,120
and this was an industry which
was principally dependent
upon selling that linen

559
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,980
to English markets.

560
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,610
Overseas trade was also
relatively limited.

561
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,030
Uh,

562
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:59,030
Scotland was excluded from England's
colonial trade as a separate kingdom and

563
00:37:01,651 --> 00:37:06,651
efforts made by some Scott's in the 60
nineties to try to establish a colonial,

564
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:07,650
um,

565
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:12,390
foothold of their own when they attempted
to establish a colony in Panama,

566
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:17,070
the Darien scheme in 1595 to 99.

567
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,451
Unfortunately,

568
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:21,630
those efforts proved to
be a disastrous failure,

569
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:27,380
not least because the English government
refused to help a venture which

570
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:33,110
antagonized Spain by attempting to
establish a Scottish colonial presence in

571
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:36,420
territories regarded as
part of the Spanish empire.

572
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,873
Well,

573
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:44,040
all of these unhappy events provided the
political and economic context of the

574
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,960
union of 1,707

575
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:51,420
the Scots were extremely
conscious of course,

576
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:55,830
of their distinctive national
identity and history.

577
00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:00,030
They were anxious to preserve
then national integrity.

578
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,400
In the 60 nineties the Scottish parliament
was enjoying a greater independence

579
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,560
from the crown than it had ever done.

580
00:38:07,561 --> 00:38:08,730
So here's a two,

581
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,240
but economically,

582
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,480
the most dynamic sectors
of the Scottish economy,

583
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,580
we're heavily dependent upon England,

584
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:23,840
and some Scots were also attracted to
the possibility of obtaining greater

585
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:28,941
access to English markets
and participation as equals
in English colonial trade.

586
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:33,743
Meanwhile,

587
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:39,500
the English government was interested in
a closer union with Scotland for quite

588
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:40,510
different reasons,

589
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:43,060
for largely political reasons.

590
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:49,620
In 1,701 when the act of settlement
was past fixing the succession in the

591
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,860
Hanoverian line,

592
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:56,490
the Scottish parliament did not at first
follow England's lead in recognizing

593
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,070
the Hanoverian succession.

594
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,750
This raised in the early
years of the 18th century,

595
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,720
a potentially dangerous situation.

596
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:13,980
What if the Scottish parliament decided
to recognize a Stewart succession

597
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:19,600
decided to vest their
crown in the old line,

598
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:23,170
the Stewart line after Queen Anne's death.

599
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,143
If that happened,

600
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,810
it could potentially provide
a major security risk.

601
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,880
It could return to a situation in which
the two kingdoms which had been joined

602
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:38,470
only in the person of their
monarchs might fully separate.

603
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:43,000
That might pose a new threat
to England from the north,

604
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,820
especially if the Scots had a
steward crown allied to the French.

605
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,940
The English government therefore began
to put on pressure for a union which

606
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:59,941
would remove that threat and they were
willing to use economic leverage to try

607
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:01,294
to do so.

608
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:06,390
In 1,705 the English parliament passed
the alien acts which excluded the Scots

609
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:12,720
from English markets unless they commenced
negotiations for a possible union.

610
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,330
And on the other hand,

611
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,410
it held out the prospect of economic
advantages for Scotland if they were

612
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:21,244
willing to do so.

613
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,340
Now in Scotland,

614
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:29,341
the issue was very passionately debated
both in parliament and in the streets of

615
00:40:30,911 --> 00:40:31,744
Edinburgh,

616
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,880
but in those debates,

617
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:38,910
the economic advantages of union soon
came well to the fore as one opponent of

618
00:40:40,631 --> 00:40:41,410
the union,

619
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:46,410
Alexander Fletcher of sole tool and put
it the economic issues where the bait

620
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,370
that covers the hook

621
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:51,550
and in the event

622
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,200
that carried the day with those of the
Scottish elite in Scotland's parliament

623
00:40:58,211 --> 00:41:03,211
who ended up making the decision in
1,707 after protracted negotiations or

624
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:09,541
Treaty of union was at last agreed there
would be a single United Kingdom of

625
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:15,010
Great Britain with a single flag.

626
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,210
The Union Jack,

627
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,350
you'll see lovingly drawn on
the bottom of your handout,

628
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:23,020
the St George Flag of England,

629
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,400
the Saint Andrew's flag of Scotland,

630
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:29,401
and how they merged together into the
union jack flag now familiar to us on the

631
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:34,160
tops of mini cars and
on swimming costumes.

632
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:41,680
The hanoverian succession to the
United Throne was recognized.

633
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,640
The Scots would join a single parliament
for the United Kingdom meeting in

634
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:49,514
Westminster.

635
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:54,350
16 members would be sent to the House
of Lords 45 to the House of Commons.

636
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,510
In rough proportion to population.

637
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,750
The Scottish legal system,

638
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:00,530
however,

639
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,260
would retain its full
jurisdictional independence.

640
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,360
The Scottish church,

641
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,510
the cook would also retain its
independence as a Presbyterian church,

642
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:17,950
but 15 of the 25 articles of the
Treaty of union concerned economic

643
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,243
arrangements,

644
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,630
the Scots would be granted
full access to English trade,

645
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:30,370
lower taxes would be levied in Scotland
because of the relative economic poverty

646
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,550
of Scotland as compared to England.

647
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,570
Scotland's industries would be protected.

648
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:44,770
Substantial compensation would be paid
to those Scots who had lost heavily

649
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:51,160
through their investment in the Darien
adventure of the 60 nineties and so on.

650
00:42:53,751 --> 00:42:58,751
The 1st of May 1,707 Scotland's parliament
dissolve itself not to meet again

651
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:06,580
until the year 1999 when it was reinstated
as part of the current constitutional

652
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,330
reconfiguration of the United Kingdom.

653
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,680
So the union had taken place.

654
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:20,660
Was it one might ask
a union of absorption,

655
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,770
a union in which Scotland was
to be dominated by England,

656
00:43:23,771 --> 00:43:24,920
a union of absorption,

657
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,070
or was it to be a union of fusion,

658
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,720
one of cooperation rather than domination?

659
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:38,240
Many Scots at the time feared
that it would be the former

660
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:40,940
in the long run.

661
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,790
I think it turned out to
be more of the latter.

662
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:49,820
Scott's certainly proved to have a quite
disproportionately large role almost

663
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:52,730
from the beginning of the union in
the running of the British empire,

664
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,713
for example,

665
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,240
but in the early 18th century,

666
00:43:56,241 --> 00:43:57,860
it was not yet quite either.

667
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:04,010
England was not actually much interested
in dominating Scotland beyond the

668
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:09,011
question of security and indeed Scottish
affairs remained largely in the hands

669
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,110
of Scott's themselves.

670
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,150
Conversely,

671
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:18,590
it took a while before Scotland was
able to fully exploit the economic

672
00:44:18,591 --> 00:44:20,030
advantages of union.

673
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:25,310
Though by the 1750s they were
indeed doing so very successfully.

674
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:29,450
The emergence of Glasgow is one of
the major Atlantic ports is one of the

675
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,580
biggest success stories
of that part of the union.

676
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:35,551
The union.

677
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:40,551
Then you one could say confirm neither
the fears nor initially the full hopes of

678
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:43,380
the Scots who had agreed to it,

679
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,050
but from the English point of view,

680
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:51,320
it had resolved a pressing
security problem and it
completed the refashioning of

681
00:44:52,591 --> 00:44:53,424
the state,

682
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:58,580
which had been introduced by the
revolution of 1688 culturally,

683
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:04,970
there was an England and Scotland
and Wales as there still is,

684
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,560
but pipe politically.

685
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,540
By 1714 there was what Jonathan Swift

686
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:18,390
described as that crazy
double bottomed realm,

687
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,733
Great Britain

688
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:21,630
and crazy.

689
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:26,630
It was in many ways a monarchy which
was actually run by a parliament,

690
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:34,670
truly a monarchical republic in which
the king after 1,701 actually had fewer

691
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:37,680
powers.

692
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,890
Then we'll later granted two
presidents of the United States,

693
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:43,800
a confessional state,

694
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:49,850
and yet a confessional state which
actually had to established religions.

695
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,750
The Church of England in England,

696
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:57,140
the Presbyterian Church of Scotland in
Scotland and which by 1714 was headed by

697
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:02,340
a king who was actually a German Lutheran,

698
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:08,250
but was an Anglican when he was in
England and a Presbyterian when he was in

699
00:46:08,251 --> 00:46:09,084
Scotland,

700
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,650
and meanwhile practicing
greater religious freedom.

701
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,230
Dan was tolerated by any other state,

702
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:17,610
saves the Netherlands,

703
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,460
an offshore island,

704
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:23,790
deeply hostile to foreign involvement,

705
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,460
deeply hostile to militarism,

706
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,493
and yet,

707
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,850
which was playing a key role in
destroying the threat of Louis,

708
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:34,140
the 14th monarchy,

709
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,500
and which had emerged as
a great military power.

710
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,460
It was all very confusing,

711
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,003
but there it was.

712
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,940
They had finally muddled through
to something that worked.
