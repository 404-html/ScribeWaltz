1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,000
Right?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,290
So this is just B,

3
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:04,441
two,

4
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:09,441
five one and this morning I want simply
to introduce the class and to explain,

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:10,570
uh,

6
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,510
what it might offer to you.

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,883
Um,

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:15,961
first of all,

9
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:17,580
it's obviously an outline course.

10
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:19,500
It deals with a large period of history,

11
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:20,460
uh,

12
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:20,971
200,

13
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:25,971
250 years covering what I described
in the title as early modern England.

14
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:27,900
Um,

15
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,900
well that's a label that may or
may not mean very much to you.

16
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:33,871
Uh,

17
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:38,871
I could have called the course tutor and
Stuart England and indeed that term is

18
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:41,910
used in the subtitle.

19
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,540
It is about England in the reigns of
the tutor and Stuart monarchs running

20
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:53,370
roughly from the 1480s to the 1710s.

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,110
Um,

22
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,130
but to call it that might suggest that
the course is structured around the

23
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:01,920
rulers and that like so much history,

24
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:04,410
the focus is very much on the top.

25
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,240
Well,

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,850
in part it certainly is.

27
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,100
Um,

28
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,970
in introducing the political narrative,

29
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,490
which will form part of
the core of the course,

30
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,940
I'll certainly be looking at the lives
and the times of the great figures who

31
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:24,840
gave their names to the age
and the faces on the coins,

32
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,123
you might say.

33
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,030
Um,

34
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,570
the notorious Henry the eighth and his,

35
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:31,110
uh,

36
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,570
six unfortunate wives,

37
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,350
um,

38
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,660
who are always difficult to
remember in the right order.

39
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:37,111
And Lucy,

40
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:37,570
you have a,

41
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:39,660
a helpful phrase for this.

42
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,523
Yeah.

43
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:43,830
Okay.

44
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,663
Divorced,

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,541
divorced,

46
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:46,200
beheaded,

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,010
died,

48
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:47,670
divorced,

49
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,503
beheaded,

50
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,920
survived the lucky one.

51
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,510
Um,

52
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,350
Henry the eighth,

53
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,483
um,

54
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:58,550
the stunning and a rather perplexing
Queen Elizabeth the first Gloriana good

55
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:02,100
queen best the Virgin Queen.

56
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,090
Whether you imagine her as a
Cate Blanchett or is Judi Dench,

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,000
uh,

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,440
she,

59
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,790
she still has the glamour,

60
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:10,770
uh,

61
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,770
a woman who announced to
her people earlier in her
reign that she would not make

62
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:18,750
windows into men's souls.

63
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,910
She would not make
windows into men's souls.

64
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,100
And she's continued to resist the
efforts of most historians to try to make

65
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:27,960
windows into hers.

66
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,160
And then there's the four Stuart kings,

67
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,880
James the first described at the time
as the wisest fool in Christendom.

68
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,250
A man who after an adventurous
youth as king of Scotland,

69
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:42,420
became King of England,

70
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,620
and it was said,

71
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,250
treated every day thereafter
as if it were Christmas Day.

72
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:49,183
Um,

73
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:49,651
Charles,

74
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:54,651
the first his son whose
policies precipitated civil
war in the mid 17th century

75
00:02:55,171 --> 00:03:00,171
and who was eventually put on trial
and executed by his own people in 1649,

76
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,973
um,

77
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,810
his son Charles the second restored to
the throne after 10 years of Republican

78
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:08,644
government,

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,590
Charles known as the Merrie monarch,

80
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,260
a man who was energetic
principally in his pleasures.

81
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,810
I'm famous for having innumerable
mistresses and a 14 illegitimate children.

82
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,540
Uh,

83
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,690
never don't know.

84
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,090
No legitimate children at all.

85
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,320
I'm never happier than when swanning
around St James's park with one of his

86
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:32,720
mistresses and Hispaniola,

87
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,180
um,

88
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,840
the,

89
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,501
you know,

90
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:37,000
the King Charles Spaniel,

91
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,270
nice little black and white
spaniel named after him of course.

92
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,350
Um,

93
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,861
and,

94
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:41,960
uh,

95
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,180
the king looked rather like a King
Charles Spaniel when he had his wig on.

96
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,420
The nice curly is as it were.

97
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,111
And,

98
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:50,740
uh,

99
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,850
and uh,

100
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,170
he had nice Brown eyes too.

101
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,173
Okay.

102
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,661
And then,

103
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:56,050
uh,

104
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,310
his brother James the second former Duke
of York came to the throne and after

105
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:04,000
three years was driven from it in the
second English revolution of the 17th

106
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:04,834
century,

107
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:09,580
driven into exile later known as the
king over the water by those who remained

108
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,810
loyal to him.

109
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,040
Well,

110
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,040
it's been said that two of the Stuart
kings were politically astute but morally

111
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:22,411
defective and to a virtuous men whose
political ineptitude cost them the throne.

112
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,280
To Paraphrase Oscar Wilde,

113
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:32,281
we could say this remarkable dynasty
that to lose the throne once could be

114
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:35,710
considered a misfortune,

115
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,750
but to lose it twice,

116
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,710
suggest a certain amount
of political ineptitude.

117
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,330
Well,

118
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,330
you will hear and read about all of these
people and the many others who shaped

119
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:55,980
England's public destiny and
political destiny in this period.

120
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,431
Uh,

121
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:58,540
and others too.

122
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,250
And today's September the third,

123
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,980
which reminds me of a Oliver Cromwell,

124
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,460
he was born and died
on September the third,

125
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,660
and also fought his two greatest
battles on September the third,

126
00:05:10,661 --> 00:05:12,400
which is probably no coincidence.

127
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:13,420
It was his lucky day.

128
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,640
The Great Puritan General,

129
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,040
the Lord Protector of
the English Republic.

130
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,280
Between 1653 and 1658 a man described
as a man of agonies and exaltations.

131
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,150
They're quite extraordinary figure and
idealist in some ways ahead of his time

132
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,410
on religious toleration,

133
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:33,244
for example,

134
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,490
in other ways tainted by the bigotry of
his age and historically perhaps more

135
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:43,300
loved and more hated than almost
any other figure in British history.

136
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,440
So there are other great ones,

137
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,690
but there's also a much more to it,

138
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,260
uh,

139
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,530
than can be approached by
focusing on such figures alone.

140
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,450
And if about a third of the lecture
course is devoted to the political

141
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,700
narratives and the,

142
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,400
and understanding how they unfolded,

143
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,240
the rest is devoted to other aspects
of the period to its religious history,

144
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,530
to its social history,

145
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:13,850
aspects of its economy,

146
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,490
aspects of the culture of the time.

147
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:17,990
Uh,

148
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,820
these are matters which might sometimes
have been vitally influenced by the

149
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:24,080
decisions of rulers,

150
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,360
but they also developed in their own
independent ways and they obviously

151
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:32,960
involved a far larger cast of characters.

152
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,250
So this course is very much about the
common people to and their experience of

153
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:43,790
the age as well as about
those who ruled them.

154
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,390
So like one of the Great Hollywood epics,

155
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,370
we have a cast of millions.

156
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,650
That's why I'm using the more capacious,

157
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,950
if Vega label early modern England,

158
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:02,510
by which I mean simply the broad period
between the end of the 15th and the

159
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:03,860
middle of the 18th century,

160
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,430
which saw the laying down of what were
to become the essential characteristics

161
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,370
of modern Britain in government,

162
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,151
in religion,

163
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:16,940
in economy and social structure,

164
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,583
in culture,

165
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,440
in political values.

166
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,540
So I'm inviting you then to take a journey
of the imagination through two and a

167
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:30,080
half centuries.

168
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,840
But you might say that was
an awfully long time ago.

169
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,870
This is the kind of
history that's long dead,

170
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,510
that's drowned in time.

171
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,050
Why should you concern yourselves with
the distant past so remote from your own

172
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,220
contemporary experience?

173
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,520
Why bother with England or Britain?

174
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,373
Why does it matter?

175
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:56,961
Well,

176
00:07:56,961 --> 00:08:01,370
I'd say there are at least three good
reasons for exploring deep history

177
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,663
and

178
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,960
in a way that takes us way beyond the
immediacy of a more familiar historical

179
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:12,374
world.

180
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,760
First of all,

181
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,880
because to do so is
imaginatively enriching.

182
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,440
Uh,

183
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,210
it involves rediscovering the lost
world and that takes imagination.

184
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,551
Secondly,

185
00:08:25,551 --> 00:08:28,340
because it's also
intellectually demanding.

186
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,110
All history of course involves us in a
fairly rigorous intellectual discipline.

187
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,980
We have to develop
arguments about causation,

188
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,530
about why things happened
the way they did.

189
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,560
And we do that by establishing a dialogue
between the questions that we want to

190
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:53,561
ask and the evidence which
the past has left to us.

191
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:55,591
Well,

192
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:59,880
my point is simply that that can be
a peculiarly and throwing exercise,

193
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,270
four periods of the distant past for
which the evidence is often ambiguous or

194
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,020
difficult or partial,

195
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,400
um,

196
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,400
in which it's produced by unfamiliar
institutions in which people are thinking

197
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:19,950
with unfamiliar casts of mind.

198
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,790
And we have to try to think ourselves
into those minds to understand what was

199
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:28,470
happening in their own terms,

200
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,930
informing our causal arguments that
can stretch you imaginatively and

201
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:34,764
intellectually.

202
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,531
And thirdly,

203
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:41,730
and perhaps most importantly
because it creates meaning.

204
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,650
It helps us to understand ourselves in
time in a deeper way by exposing 21st

205
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:55,851
century attitudes and values and
experiences to a much deeper comparative

206
00:09:57,661 --> 00:09:58,650
context.

207
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,400
Looking at the distant
past can alert us to the,

208
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,520
to the sheer otherness of the past,

209
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:11,330
to the reality of deep and fundamental
change in the course of four or five

210
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:17,931
centuries and to the provisional and
contingent and temporary nature of so much

211
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:22,830
that we take for granted today,

212
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,410
as well as the family resemblances,

213
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,850
which can still be found.

214
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,490
That's an exercise which can be
enormously provocative and stimulating a

215
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:37,491
challenge that helps us understand
better our own place in time.

216
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,101
Right.

217
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:41,281
Well,

218
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:45,930
the story of early modern England has
got a good deal to offer in all of these

219
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,160
respects.

220
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,340
It can certainly capture the imagination.

221
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,850
This was a time of great events.

222
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,200
The reformation,

223
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,960
the civil wars of the 17th century,

224
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,780
the foundations of the
first British empire.

225
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,310
It was a time of great personalities,

226
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,040
the rulers that I've already mentioned,

227
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,220
but also it was the age
of Shakespeare of Milton.

228
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,940
The time of the diarist Samuel Peeps,

229
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,830
the Protel Democrat,

230
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:17,970
John Lilburn,

231
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,770
the early feminist writer,

232
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,930
Mary astral and so on,

233
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:22,764
could go on.

234
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,920
It was a time of great
processes as well as events,

235
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,930
longer term processes,

236
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,600
great changes in the
structures of society,

237
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,820
in economic development,

238
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,710
in political culture,

239
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,280
in the growth of literacy
and print culture.

240
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,880
And it's also the period when almost
for the first time in British history,

241
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,530
we have the evidence surviving
that enables us to get
to grips with the mass of

242
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:57,400
the population and to explore the
everyday dynamics of their lives,

243
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,110
their relationships,

244
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,210
their emotional palettes.

245
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:06,720
You might say it's only from about the
early 16th century that the sources

246
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:11,560
survive in large quantities that enabled
imaginative historians to approach the

247
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:13,900
questions like how long do people live,

248
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,640
um,

249
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,960
how subject worthy to early death
from diseases like the plague.

250
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,040
Uh,

251
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,360
what age did they get married?

252
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,310
Who tells their marriage partners?

253
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:26,770
What was the quality of
their family relationships,

254
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,360
how many people could read,

255
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,670
and what did they read if they could read,

256
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,780
um,

257
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,280
how do people make their livings?

258
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,590
And how did the economy change?

259
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,360
What were the levels of crime and violence
and how well were they controlled,

260
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,820
and a host of other questions which are
not previously accessible because we

261
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:50,971
don't have adequate sources so one can
begin to get a sense of the rest of the

262
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:52,330
population.

263
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:57,330
And to give you just one
particular example round
about 1900 box of papers with

264
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,460
founding the sellers of
Worcester College Oxford,

265
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:05,461
and they turned out to be the papers of
the secretary of the Council of Oliver

266
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,970
Cromwell's army and included a verbatim
shorthand account of debates which had

267
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:17,770
taken place in 1647 at the end of the
civil war when the council of the army

268
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:22,510
debated the settlement of the
kingdom in the aftermath of the war.

269
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,950
One of the extraordinary things about
this verbatim account is that you hear the

270
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:28,870
voices of the common soldiers.

271
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,940
One of them who's representing a cavalry
regiment keeps interrupting the debate.

272
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,200
He keeps saying,

273
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,560
what is the soldier fought for all this
time uses the phrase again and again,

274
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,120
what does the soldier fought for?

275
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:46,330
And it's thrilling because you hear for
the first time the voice of the common

276
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:50,770
people erupting into the
councils of the nation.

277
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:51,940
Well,

278
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,740
that's symbolizes in a sense what the
available documents enabled people to do

279
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,930
from the 16th century onwards.

280
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,273
Secondly,

281
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,940
looking at early modern England
can engage the intellect.

282
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:10,660
The historical literature
is exceptionally rich.

283
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,680
It's very large,

284
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:16,570
created by generations of historians
from all over the English speaking world

285
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,770
and quite a few of the most significant
of them were well yell scholars.

286
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,600
This literature has produced many of the
classic works of historical writing in

287
00:14:28,811 --> 00:14:33,811
the English language and it's also
proved to be restless and innovative and

288
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:36,220
rather argumentative.

289
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,630
All of the recent movements in historical
research and writing are represented

290
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,360
amongst its practitioners,

291
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:50,230
mainstream political and
constitutional history,

292
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,380
gender history,

293
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,600
the new social history,

294
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,110
the new cultural history
influenced by critical theory,

295
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,900
what people now describe as
the new political history,

296
00:14:59,901 --> 00:15:04,901
which tries to reintegrate
social and political development.

297
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,630
All of this is represented and much more.

298
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,050
Um,

299
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:11,030
since the 1960s in particular,

300
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,430
it's been one of the most
vigorous of historical traditions.

301
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,490
There's plenty there to
engage the intellect,

302
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:22,370
whatever it is that you happen
to be most interested in.

303
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:26,480
And thirdly,

304
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,000
it helps to understand ourselves in time.

305
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,101
Of course,

306
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:34,070
all periods of history do that,

307
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:39,740
but the events of the early modern
period have a peculiar resonance,

308
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,550
the events and processes
of these centuries or have
more than merely historical

309
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,130
interest if you're concerned with the
institutions of representative government

310
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,810
and how they came into
being for the first time.

311
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,230
If you're concerned with the
notion of the rule of law,

312
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,050
if you're concerned with the structures
and dynamics of a capitalist market

313
00:16:06,051 --> 00:16:06,884
economy,

314
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,350
if you're interested in concepts of
individual liberty and collective

315
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:17,351
responsibility or with the excesses of
religious fanaticism or with innumerable

316
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,870
social and cultural attitudes which
continue to echo in our own relationships

317
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,250
and in our own time,

318
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,890
if we only know how to recognize them.

319
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,860
I mean if you're concerned
that the language itself,

320
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,020
then early modern England has
got a great deal to say to you.

321
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,940
It's because of these issues are so alive
in the literature of the period that

322
00:16:43,941 --> 00:16:45,560
the literature is so rich.

323
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:50,930
And it's for that reason also that it's
very much an international literature.

324
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:55,430
These issues concerned scholars
from all over the world.

325
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,770
And as a further dimension to that too,

326
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,390
which is that a great deal of what
happened in 16th and 17th century England

327
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,370
later impacted upon a much wider world.

328
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:13,510
The history of early modern England
is by extension very much a part,

329
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:16,640
not only of British history,

330
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:20,360
but also of American and Canadian
Australian and New Zealand history.

331
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,470
It's got things to say about
the history of India and Africa.

332
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,500
Some of the things that happened in this
period left their fingerprints all over

333
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:33,170
the world in all kinds of ways.

334
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,220
I mean,

335
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,053
they,

336
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,380
it certainly left its fingerprints
on new haven to come close to home.

337
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:40,723
Um,

338
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,260
if you look around the town,

339
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:42,561
I mean,

340
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,670
you look at the churches,

341
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,050
the episcopal,

342
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,490
Presbyterian,

343
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,860
congregational baptists,

344
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,183
Quakers,

345
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:54,330
all of his religious traditions have
their origins in 16th and 17th century

346
00:17:54,331 --> 00:17:55,164
England.

347
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,650
Or if you look at the street
names running out of Broadway,

348
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:00,360
we have golf,

349
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,540
Wally and Dixwell streets.

350
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,620
Um,

351
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:09,390
all three of them named after three of
the man who signed the death warrant of

352
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:14,391
King Charles the first in 1649
and later hid out in new haven,

353
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,800
which was a radically puritan colony,

354
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,730
which gave them asylum after
the return of the king.

355
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,020
Uh,

356
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,200
our suburb of Hamden is
named after John Hamdan,

357
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:30,201
who in 1637 stood up against the policies
of King Charles the first and tried to

358
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:34,410
fight him in a landmark legal case.

359
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,030
And if you start turning to
other place names in Connecticut,

360
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:40,620
I mean just gets ridiculous.

361
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,663
Um,

362
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,410
I mean we have new London.

363
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:43,960
Okay.

364
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,793
As Old London,

365
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:45,661
uh,

366
00:18:45,661 --> 00:18:48,660
we have no which or Norridge
as it's pronounced in England.

367
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:49,494
It's up there.

368
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,020
A new haven itself is down here.

369
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,211
Uh,

370
00:18:54,211 --> 00:18:57,130
we have Litchfield that's over there now.

371
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:57,983
We have Durham,

372
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,093
she was up there.

373
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,950
Now we have Stanford was there,

374
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,093
but

375
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:04,290
uh,

376
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,123
we have Greenwich,

377
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:05,963
which is over here,

378
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,550
same place names.

379
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:13,910
They're just in a different configuration
and in a sense that that's symbolic of

380
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:21,681
the relationship between British and
early modern in a America early American

381
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,323
history,

382
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,220
same names,

383
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,360
different configuration,

384
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,710
slightly different meanings.

385
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,710
So in a sense,

386
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,920
a good deal of this is American history
by extension and of consequence to

387
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:40,440
everyone who's become
involved in America's story
over the last two and a half

388
00:19:40,441 --> 00:19:41,274
centuries

389
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,190
to explore it is to explore
part of your own identity.

390
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,281
Right?

391
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:50,461
Well,

392
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:53,940
this course is intended to provide
an introduction to all of this.

393
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:54,960
Um,

394
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,860
it's up to date.

395
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:02,030
It's also intended to be very
inclusive in its range and contents.

396
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,860
We will run through from the late 15th
century to the early 18th century.

397
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,850
We look at the momentous
changes and innovations,

398
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:16,851
which took place in 1500 England
was very much a personal Monaco.

399
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,210
The king really ruled by 1700.

400
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:25,770
It's a constitutional monarchy in which
the center of political life was a

401
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:30,771
permanently sitting elected parliament
and it's become not simply the kingdom of

402
00:20:31,561 --> 00:20:31,861
England,

403
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:33,870
but the United Kingdom of England,

404
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,650
Scotland,

405
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,483
Wales,

406
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,660
and Ireland

407
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:43,430
in 1500 England was part of Catholic
Christendom practicing a very lively and

408
00:20:45,481 --> 00:20:48,640
vital form of late medieval Catholicism.

409
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:53,910
By 1700 the country was aggressively
Protestant with an established church of

410
00:20:54,731 --> 00:20:55,091
England,

411
00:20:55,091 --> 00:21:00,091
which could no longer contain all the
varieties of Protestant denominations,

412
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,460
which had emerged leading to the granting
finally of religious toleration in the

413
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:10,531
late 17th century by 1500 in 1500 it was
largely a localized economy of peasant

414
00:21:13,001 --> 00:21:14,710
families and urban craftsman.

415
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,090
By 1700 it was a highly
commercialized market economy,

416
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,290
capitalistic,

417
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:25,290
instructure and engaged in
trade with a much larger world,

418
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,320
especially with the east and with the
Atlantic in 1500 it's a world of rural

419
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:36,310
communities and small towns
with only one significant city,

420
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,400
London by 1700 it was the most
rapidly urbanizing country in Europe.

421
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,660
London had become the biggest city
in Europe and the kind of prototype

422
00:21:46,661 --> 00:21:50,410
metropolis in 1700 London was
regarded as a kind of shock city.

423
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,700
The way people thought about
New York in the mid 20th century

424
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,500
in 1500 most people were illiterate
by 1700 literacy was widespread.

425
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,810
There was a vigorous print culture
including the first English language

426
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:09,811
newspapers and so one could go on and
on pointing the contrast between the

427
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,320
beginning and the end of the period.

428
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:16,830
The story of these and other massive
transformations used to be told as a kind

429
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:23,161
of triumphalist story and unfolding of
British destiny what people refer to as

430
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:26,290
the Whig interpretation of history.

431
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,800
Very nationalistic take on
the history of this period.

432
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,360
It traced the growth from the
16th century of political liberty,

433
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:35,800
religious freedom,

434
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:41,340
economic opulence and world power
as a kind of steady upward ascent.

435
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:48,040
Sometimes it had to be hard fought against
the forces of tyranny or superstition

436
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:49,060
or backwardness,

437
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,540
but in a sense it was portrayed as being
almost preordained the kind of English

438
00:22:55,211 --> 00:22:56,740
version of manifest destiny.

439
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:58,961
Well,

440
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:02,440
since the 1950s the perspective
has changed massively.

441
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,900
Britain's place in the world has changed.

442
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,330
People think about its
history differently.

443
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,270
New Forms of history have been pioneered,

444
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,240
other voices or now heard,

445
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,720
especially the voices of the losers in
these processes or the people who only

446
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:21,490
had a subordinate place in,

447
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:22,390
um,

448
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,350
these achievements.

449
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,413
As a result,

450
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,900
we've now got a less one sided and in
many ways a more mature historiography.

451
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:38,290
We've got over the old tendency to Strut
and swagger about Britain's historical

452
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,040
road.

453
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:44,040
The changes of the 16th and 17th centuries
now seem very far from preordained.

454
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,940
I'd to say the less one sided perspective
reveals the losses as well as the

455
00:23:49,941 --> 00:23:50,774
gains,

456
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,741
the failures,

457
00:23:51,741 --> 00:23:54,740
and the crimes as well
as the achievements.

458
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:55,431
The point is,

459
00:23:55,431 --> 00:24:00,431
it's all part of the story and
it's all available to be studied.

460
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:03,410
Well,

461
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,480
let's look briefly at the syllabus.

462
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,490
It's roughly chronological.

463
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,650
There's a timeline running
through the whole thing.

464
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,030
Um,

465
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,520
but as it develops,

466
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,960
there are overlaps.

467
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,190
Um,

468
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,980
I planned it as a kind of building
up of layers of knowledge,

469
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,560
each one acting as a kind of
stepping stone to the next.

470
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:30,770
In the earliest lectures,

471
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:35,330
lectures two to six I'll concentrate on
trying to establish some of the contexts

472
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,700
of society,

473
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,310
economy and government as they
were in the early 16th century.

474
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,120
I'd be looking at the
household at local communities,

475
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,400
at people's social and economic roles
and relationships at the structures of

476
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:56,330
power and authority as they
were at the time of kings,

477
00:24:56,331 --> 00:25:01,331
Henry the seventh and Henry the eighth
roughly between the 1480s and the 1540s

478
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,950
that's to establish the context
because as has been said,

479
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,120
the discipline of history is
essentially a discipline of context.

480
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,860
Facts acquire their meaning only
when one understands the context,

481
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,560
which helps us to grasp their meaning.

482
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,110
So we'll set up the context.

483
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:26,111
Then from lecture seven we move into
the tracing of change lecture seven and

484
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:32,360
eight we'll look at the impact of
the reformation and the opening up of

485
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:37,361
religious divisions between the 1530s
and the 1550s in lecture nine we'll pause

486
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:43,190
to look at some of the problems which
were produced by the massive population

487
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:48,191
growth which began in the 16th century
and the economic stirring which that

488
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:53,330
produced in Lexus 10 and 11 I
look at the England of Elizabeth,

489
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:58,331
the first focusing on the problems in
religion and in a government policy faced

490
00:26:01,551 --> 00:26:02,384
by the queen,

491
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,070
the struggle for stability and the
immensely insecure environment which she

492
00:26:07,071 --> 00:26:07,904
inherited.

493
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,860
And then in lectures 12 and 13 I'll
go on to look at some of the principal

494
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:17,861
features of social change under Elizabeth
and the early Stuart's looking at

495
00:26:19,071 --> 00:26:24,071
roughly the 1580s through to the 1630s
a period of major transition in society

496
00:26:26,721 --> 00:26:27,554
and economy,

497
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:29,540
uh,

498
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,330
lectures 14 to 17.

499
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,780
We'll look at various aspects of social
and cultural change in the same period.

500
00:26:35,781 --> 00:26:38,750
The later lizard beaten
early Stewart period.

501
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,440
I look at the witch craze of that time.

502
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,090
I look at crime and disorder,

503
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,920
a popular protest and rebellion
and at literacy and education.

504
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:59,100
Then in lectures 18 to 19 we'll come to
the religious and political tensions of

505
00:26:59,121 --> 00:27:00,560
the early 17th century,

506
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:01,850
uh,

507
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:06,850
which eventually exploded in 1642 into
the civil wars we're trying to look at in

508
00:27:08,451 --> 00:27:13,451
lectures 20 and 21 and the establishment
after the execution of King Charles,

509
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:16,790
the first of the English republic,

510
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,130
which lasted until 1660.

511
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,710
Okay,

512
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,491
that's a 22.

513
00:27:22,491 --> 00:27:27,491
We'll look at the restored monarchy after
1660 tracing it up to the revolution

514
00:27:27,951 --> 00:27:29,060
of 1688.

515
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,260
Uh,

516
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,130
that's your 23.

517
00:27:31,131 --> 00:27:34,400
We'll look at the rapid economic
development of the late 17th century,

518
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:39,650
which provided the resources
to back the matter,

519
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:44,651
our treat in lecture 24 which was the
creation of a new state structure and the

520
00:27:45,321 --> 00:27:49,220
emergence of Britain as a
significant world power.

521
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,860
So that's the rough timeline.

522
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,740
Those are the issues
which will be covered.

523
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,090
Obviously the course has an
essentially narrative structure,

524
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,200
but it's also very much
an analytical narrative.

525
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,330
It's about trying to understand how all
of these changes intersected with each

526
00:28:08,331 --> 00:28:09,164
other,

527
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,830
how they influenced each other over time.

528
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,610
And I suppose that's
what really interests me.

529
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:21,200
Trying to grasp the wholeness of
the process of historical change,

530
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,030
how it all fits together.

531
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,950
And that's the best reason for doing
an outline course of this kind did,

532
00:28:27,951 --> 00:28:30,590
enables you to see these
developments in the round,

533
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,240
all the different aspects,

534
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,040
how they intersect.

535
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:40,140
Now the readings which is
suggested on the syllabus,

536
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:40,620
um,

537
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:45,090
will help you hopefully to do all of that.

538
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,670
They've been chosen quite carefully.

539
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:51,330
The three textbooks are available
from the Yale Bookstore.

540
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:57,650
The cost packet of additional selections
from various books and articles is

541
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,320
available from Dakar
print down on Whitney.

542
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:02,323
Um,

543
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,700
the address is given on the syllabus and
the phone number and all of these works

544
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:11,430
are also on reserve in
the library in Sterling,

545
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,560
the reading runs at about a
hundred to 150 pages a week.

546
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:19,371
Now,

547
00:29:19,371 --> 00:29:21,710
some of the readings you'll
find are quite demanding,

548
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:24,380
but I make no apologies for that.

549
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:25,400
Um,

550
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,050
you can say it's a mark of respect for
the capabilities of the students that I'm

551
00:29:30,051 --> 00:29:33,440
setting some pretty
challenging stuff at times.

552
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,230
But if you follow the
readings as we go through,

553
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:41,030
you should build up a coherent grasp
of the whole period in its different

554
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:46,050
aspects and be introduced to the work
of some of the best historians currently

555
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,040
writing about it.

556
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:49,841
In a sense.

557
00:29:49,841 --> 00:29:51,670
It's a course in good lucid,

558
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,070
robust historical pros,

559
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,350
the readings and the lectures.

560
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:03,100
Together we'll provide the basis
for the section discussions,

561
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:03,610
um,

562
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:08,610
which will tend to develop an add to
the lecture themes rather than simply

563
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,540
repeating to them,

564
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,740
repeating them.

565
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,573
And um,

566
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,200
two of the sections will be,

567
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,860
um,

568
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:19,860
visits to the British art center to look
at some of the visible evidence there.

569
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,100
Um,

570
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:25,600
those visits have to be on a Friday
morning and they are optional.

571
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,150
They're not part of the
examinable nature of the course,

572
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,320
but they're there.

573
00:30:29,321 --> 00:30:30,220
If you're interested in,

574
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:32,950
we'd like to go along okay.

575
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,480
Within the sense of the whole period,

576
00:30:37,481 --> 00:30:38,920
which I hope you'll develop.

577
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:39,650
Um,

578
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:39,930
you'll,

579
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:42,820
you will be asked to do two
pieces of more detailed work,

580
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:48,060
a shorter paper of about five pages
and a longer one of about 10 pages.

581
00:30:50,471 --> 00:30:51,730
The first due in week seven,

582
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,400
the second you in week 14.

583
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,550
This should give you an opportunity
to develop personal interests.

584
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,630
Um,

585
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,710
you can have a completely
free choice of topic.

586
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:11,190
You can write your papers about any
aspect of the period that you find

587
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:15,070
interesting and you want
to pursue more deeply.

588
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,360
Um,

589
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,260
I'll give out,

590
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,153
um,

591
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,660
in a couple of weeks' time,

592
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:23,440
a list of topics that might interest you.

593
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,490
Um,

594
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:29,290
but feel free to bring forward
suggestions if your own,

595
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,280
um,

596
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,810
that you'd like to investigate.

597
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:32,800
Um,

598
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,640
or things you might pick up from lectures
that you want to take further and so

599
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:37,474
forth.

600
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,960
I also see a longer bibliography
which will help to prepare,

601
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,470
uh,

602
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,580
for those papers.

603
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:43,630
Um,

604
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:47,740
and which will also include material
if you'd like to look at the history of

605
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,480
Scotland or Ireland or Wales.

606
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,560
Um,

607
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,420
then there'll be material there on,

608
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:52,840
on,

609
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,200
on,

610
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,250
on their developments.

611
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:57,850
Also all you need to do about the papers,

612
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,600
um,

613
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,600
is to consult with me or with the
teaching fellows to get advice on the best

614
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:07,020
reading,

615
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,240
uh,

616
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,550
for researching the papers and,

617
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,463
um,

618
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,323
uh,

619
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,370
subject to that.

620
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,373
Um,

621
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,850
you have a free hand,

622
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
whether that's some of the classical
issues of the period or whether it's other

623
00:32:21,131 --> 00:32:24,370
things that you simply have to have
happened to have an interest in.

624
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:29,230
Last year someone was interested in public
health and ended up doing work on the

625
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:31,090
plague in early public health measures.

626
00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:31,924
For example,

627
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,410
um,

628
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:36,100
we had a person also who was
interested in pregnancy and childbirth.

629
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:36,450
Well,

630
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:36,850
you know,

631
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,683
you can do that.

632
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,710
There's a literature on it and so forth.

633
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,720
Whatever it happens to be,

634
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,830
the overall assessment will be,

635
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,700
um,

636
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,600
15% for participation and discussion.

637
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,660
20% for the short paper,

638
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,690
40% for the long paper,

639
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:00,050
and 25% for the final exam,

640
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,540
which will be an examine,

641
00:33:02,541 --> 00:33:07,541
which you'll be required to write two
essays from quite a large choice of about

642
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:12,980
20 topics covering the whole range.

643
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,571
Okay.

644
00:33:16,571 --> 00:33:17,400
Finally,

645
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:17,890
um,

646
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:18,940
let me introduce,

647
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,540
um,

648
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,040
the teaching fellows.

649
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,023
Um,

650
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:22,990
uh,

651
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,010
we have Courtney Thomas,

652
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,343
uh,

653
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:30,640
and Lucy Kaufman and Justin Gary Vij.

654
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:33,903
Um,

655
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,070
all of us will be available to assist you.

656
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:37,383
Um,

657
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,530
in section discussions,

658
00:33:38,531 --> 00:33:38,951
of course,

659
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:43,951
we shed the old seven sections with
a quite a wide spread of times,

660
00:33:44,291 --> 00:33:46,660
which hopefully will cater
for everyone who's interested.

661
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,040
Uh,

662
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,730
and,

663
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:48,971
uh,

664
00:33:48,971 --> 00:33:51,460
we will it be available
of course in office hours,

665
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:51,970
uh,

666
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:55,600
teaching fellows will explain their
office hours when sections begin in third

667
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:56,360
week.

668
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:56,830
Um,

669
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:01,780
I'll be available usually on Tuesdays
between five and seven and on Thursdays

670
00:34:01,781 --> 00:34:04,900
between two and 4:00 PM,

671
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:05,790
uh,

672
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,790
in both cases,

673
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:08,920
right?

674
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,600
Other times by appointment.

675
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:11,651
And of course,

676
00:34:11,651 --> 00:34:14,710
we're all available by
email when necessary,

677
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:16,900
uh,

678
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,733
throughout.

679
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,041
Uh,

680
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:18,880
the basic,

681
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:19,210
uh,

682
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:21,580
teaching philosophy for
this course is quite simple.

683
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,020
First of all,

684
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,460
history should be challenging,

685
00:34:24,461 --> 00:34:25,690
but it can also be fun.

686
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,460
And secondly,

687
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,590
if students are going to do well,

688
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,270
they deserve attention.

689
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,550
So if you want it,

690
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,473
you can have it.

691
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,783
Okay.

692
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,070
So this is a terrific period to study.

693
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,800
It has a terrific literature to work on.

694
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:49,020
Yale has a long and distinguished
tradition in this field
and fabulous resources

695
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:50,040
for studying it.

696
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,520
In the libraries and the British arts
centre in the special collections.

697
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:59,310
My objective is simply to encourage you
to engage with this field and to use

698
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:04,670
these resources and to do well to
achieve your potential and to enjoy it.

699
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:12,030
I've been teaching and researching and
writing about this period for about 40

700
00:35:12,031 --> 00:35:12,864
years.

701
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,890
Um,

702
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:18,150
Courtney and Lucy and Justin
have been added less long.

703
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:19,800
Um,

704
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,660
but they know their stuff.

705
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,990
We have three teaching fellows
who really know their stuff.

706
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,670
They have their own special interests,

707
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,790
but they're very familiar
with the whole picture.

708
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:35,490
We are in a position to guide you and
help you get the most out of this course

709
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,620
and doubts in engaging in discussion
with you and in discussing your paper

710
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:41,850
topics and so forth.

711
00:35:41,851 --> 00:35:44,910
We will also learn from you
people new to the subject.

712
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:50,100
Always see things that one's missed no
matter how long one has been working on

713
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:50,820
it.

714
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,680
So we'll be happy to do all of that.

715
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,200
So if the course attracts you,

716
00:35:55,201 --> 00:36:00,201
take it and use it and use us to
develop your knowledge and your skills.

717
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,160
That's what we're here for.

718
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,730
And if anyone wants to ask
any particular questions,

719
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:07,260
just come on up at the end.

720
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:07,710
Okay.
