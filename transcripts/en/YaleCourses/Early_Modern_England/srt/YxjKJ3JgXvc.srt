1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:02,660
Right?

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:02,850
Well,

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,440
last time I was looking at the vitals,

4
00:00:06,441 --> 00:00:11,441
social distinctions that were recognized
in the 16th century and also how people

5
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,740
conceived of society as a whole.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,293
Um,

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,810
so today I want to come down to the other
end of the scale and look at the most

8
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:20,880
fundamental unit of society,

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:22,530
the household,

10
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,980
the unit in which most people spent their
lives and which govern most of their

11
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:29,940
daily activities.

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,640
So let's begin with some definitions.

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:33,660
Um,

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,400
the household can be defined in the first
instance as being a unit of residents.

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,293
Of course.

16
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,020
Uh,

17
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,120
but also as I indicated last time,

18
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:43,830
it was a unit of authority.

19
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,630
It's a group of people,

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,680
some related,

21
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:49,740
some unrelated living under the same roof,

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,070
under the authority of a household pen,

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,180
usually a man,

24
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,740
sometimes a widowed woman.

25
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:57,901
And in addition,

26
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:01,260
the household has been described
as a unit that was geared for work,

27
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,280
the work which was necessary to satisfy
its needs as a unit of production and of

28
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:12,180
consumption and of reproduction.

29
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,600
So all households had that much in common,

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,530
but they're very greatly in their size.

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,300
The composition and the complexity of
the relationships contained within them.

32
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:25,620
Uh,

33
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,510
if we go to the top of the social scale,

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,960
the households of the nobility and the
gentry could be very large institutions.

35
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:33,451
Indeed,

36
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:35,250
sometimes vast institutions,

37
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:36,050
uh,

38
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:40,620
they will organize to maintain not only
a noble family at an expected level of

39
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:41,640
magnificence,

40
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,020
and to be magnificent was one of the
qualities of a nobleman in contemporary

41
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:46,854
thought.

42
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,340
But also they were the centers
for administering landed estates.

43
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:53,220
They were the centers for
conducting local government.

44
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:53,971
They were,

45
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:57,540
the centers often have the
exercise of political power.

46
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:58,890
Uh,

47
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,890
to give just one example at Pontefract
castle in the more or less in the center

48
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:07,060
of the country in South Yorkshire Appear,

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,040
uh,

50
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:12,570
Pontefract castle was the home
of Lord Darcy and a list of his,

51
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:12,960
uh,

52
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,260
household as it was in 1521 survives.

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,770
There were 80 people in Darcy's household,

54
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:20,663
80,

55
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,470
his family members of his extended
family who lived with him,

56
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,581
his household,

57
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:29,520
and the state officers
he had living with him,

58
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,210
a bunch of young men who
were the sons of his clients,

59
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:37,380
amongst the local gentry and
numerous menial servants.

60
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,890
When he was called by Henry the eighth
to go to war against the Scots in 1523,

61
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,390
he took with him 23 young men who were
members of his household that is personal

62
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:49,920
guard wearing his livery.

63
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,230
So such people as Lord Dottie
had a style of life domain,

64
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:56,010
Tane,

65
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,220
which necessarily elaborated
their domestic established for us.

66
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,520
And these were the great
households of the age,

67
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,270
those of lesser people who are of course,

68
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,590
much smaller and much
less elaborate usually.

69
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,170
Basically they were
nuclear family households,

70
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,950
husband,

71
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,570
wife and children.

72
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,260
Rarely co-resident
relatives living with them.

73
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:23,350
And that's a matter of some significance.

74
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:23,800
Uh,

75
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,800
it reflects the common cultural assumption
that every newly married couples

76
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:33,831
should set up its own
independent household and
indeed that you should not marry

77
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,740
until he could do so.

78
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,220
You should not kill habit
with your relatives.

79
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:40,510
Well,

80
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,890
in many ways that sounds very modern,

81
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,930
but we mustn't forget that a large
minority of households in this period,

82
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,770
although their central
core was a nuclear family,

83
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,680
we're also much larger than average,

84
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,410
not because they had
kinsfolk living with them,

85
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,660
but because they came to include people
who were linked to the household,

86
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,370
not by blood or birth,

87
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,670
but by contract servants,

88
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,103
apprentices.

89
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,000
So if 16th century
households look familiar,

90
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,620
in some ways a large minority of
them were also very different,

91
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,900
and one could say,

92
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:20,680
um,

93
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,500
they different from modern households
in three essential respects.

94
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,450
They different structurally in that a
substantial number of them contained

95
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:32,590
people affiliated to the household by
contract the servants and apprentices.

96
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,640
They differed conceptually in that when
people talk about their family in this

97
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:39,940
period,

98
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,940
they meant not their immediate blood
relatives as we use the term they meant,

99
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,500
or members of their household.

100
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,530
Servants and apprentices were
regarded as members of their family.

101
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:51,880
They referred to them as family.

102
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,460
So there are different conceptually,

103
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:00,070
and they're also different functionally
because these people were usually taken

104
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:04,770
on for reasons which go beyond the
usual functions of a modern household.

105
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,040
Um,

106
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,900
whereas we tend to think of a household
as a unit of residents and consumption

107
00:05:10,901 --> 00:05:14,440
and child rearing and
provision of emotional support.

108
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,310
All of that is true in
the 16th century too,

109
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:22,780
but the household in the 16th century
also had more extensive functions,

110
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,060
which we don't associate
with the household today.

111
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,860
There were units of production,

112
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,500
they will farms,

113
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,850
they will work shops.

114
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,890
They were also places of education and
training where the young were trained in

115
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:39,490
particular tasks and that's what
I mean when I say they were,

116
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,030
they were geared for work for all
these larger range of functions,

117
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,420
right?

118
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,230
Well,

119
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,160
as working units and
as units of residents,

120
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,850
all households were also
spheres of interdependence,

121
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,210
their maintenance and their depended
on the contributions of all of their

122
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:00,044
members.

123
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,070
As we saw last time.

124
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,890
This was in its ideology,

125
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,480
a patriarchal society.

126
00:06:07,481 --> 00:06:08,314
Of course,

127
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,620
in the sense that authority
was conventionally located
in the persons of adult

128
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:19,291
males in general and adult male
householders in particular,

129
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,020
and these assumptions about
the structure of authority.

130
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:24,520
We're auto embodied in law.

131
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:28,600
Remember the law of property I mentioned
last time with regard to women,

132
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,900
but despite these constraints
of ideology and law,

133
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,960
women's role in the household
was of course indispensable.

134
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:39,660
And this was fully recognized.

135
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,960
It was the duty of the householder to
maintain his family by his Labor to

136
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,640
exercise his authority
in managing its affairs,

137
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,350
to play a part in training servants
and apprentices and so forth.

138
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,240
The duty of the mistress of the
household was generally summed up in a

139
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:58,410
contemporary word,

140
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,010
hustler,

141
00:06:59,010 --> 00:06:59,843
furry.

142
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:00,780
It's on your,

143
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,613
it's on your sheet,

144
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:03,070
who?

145
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,260
Swiffer or housewifery

146
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:10,400
and that it comprised the range of
activity very different from the modern

147
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:13,400
notion of the housewife or the homemaker.

148
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,020
It wasn't so focused on the maintenance
of the domestic environment.

149
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,030
How has it in this period,

150
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:20,960
it's very simple.

151
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:25,400
Most people seem to have lived in rooms
and houses with two or three rooms

152
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,050
and furnishing was exceedingly sparse.

153
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,430
When people died,

154
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:33,380
inventories of their goods were drawn up.

155
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,551
And from them,

156
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:37,250
we can learn every single
possession that they,

157
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,084
they had.

158
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:38,900
Um,

159
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,610
and it's striking how sparse domestic
interiors were in this period.

160
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:44,630
To give you one example,

161
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,630
a craftsman from Lincolnshire,

162
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,473
which is up here,

163
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:47,991
uh,

164
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:49,760
who died in 1540.

165
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:54,761
His inventory survives and he possessed
only 22 items in all 22 items.

166
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,750
And they were items connected with
the three basics of household life,

167
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,710
places to sleep,

168
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:08,330
places to sit and things
to eat with horn spoons,

169
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,290
wooden bowls,

170
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,120
22 items in all,

171
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,523
not untypical.

172
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:19,910
So housewifery as they understood it in
the 16th century was concerned not so

173
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:23,520
much with managing the domestic
environment as with managing the daily

174
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:26,400
consumption needs of the household.

175
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,950
Food preparation of course central,

176
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,880
but also making and mending clothes and
bedding and general provision for the

177
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:37,650
maintenance of the household.

178
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:38,971
In 15,

179
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:39,900
23,

180
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:41,410
a man called Antonio Fitzherbert,

181
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,060
uh,

182
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,060
wrote a book called the Book of husbandry
and unity describes a domestic tasks

183
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:48,750
of a rural woman.

184
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,680
Uh,

185
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,680
and what he describes as a myriad of
activities involving the self provisioning

186
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,390
of household at this time,

187
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,240
keeping the pigs and the
poultry running the dairy,

188
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,430
growing hemp and flax,

189
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,450
spinning it into yarn for
making the linen for the family,

190
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:06,870
uh,

191
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,250
preparing the wool clip,

192
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,980
laboring in the fields and
in the barn when needed.

193
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:16,370
And marketing women seem to have taken
care of most of the regular marketing of

194
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:18,130
the produce of the house,

195
00:09:18,131 --> 00:09:18,901
sold the eggs,

196
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:19,734
the poetry,

197
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,730
the pigs,

198
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,563
the grain,

199
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,020
uh,

200
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,650
and of course buying necessities
which couldn't be produced at home

201
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,610
in the households of urban
craftsmen and tradesmen.

202
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,970
Things were a little
differently organized.

203
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,750
Women were formerly excluded
from the apprenticeship,

204
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:38,970
which would enable them to
learn one of these trades,

205
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,650
but very often they learned
many aspects of it informally.

206
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,220
And the records reveal many glimpses of
women active in various aspects of their

207
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:50,820
husbands trades,

208
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,100
assisting their husbands as bakers and
butchers carrying water and sand for

209
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:58,170
husbands who are in the building trade,

210
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,380
buying raw materials on
their husband's behalf,

211
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,160
um,

212
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,010
selling the finished goods and so forth.

213
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,110
How do we know about things like this?

214
00:10:07,111 --> 00:10:07,770
Well,

215
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:12,750
lots of records that survive from the
many courts which govern many aspects of

216
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:13,584
local life.

217
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,693
Um,

218
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,130
give us a little glimpses
of what people are doing.

219
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,350
We know that that women in,

220
00:10:19,351 --> 00:10:19,651
in,

221
00:10:19,651 --> 00:10:20,640
in one city,

222
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:21,030
uh,

223
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,050
well in Norridge actually,

224
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:22,800
um,

225
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,250
might be down at the water side by in
wood for husbands who were carpenters

226
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:31,080
because on one occasion a fight broke out
and what they were doing happens to be

227
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:32,220
described in the records.

228
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,460
You get these kinds of glimpses
of people's activities.

229
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,870
The wives of laboring men were less able
to participate in the household based

230
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:46,350
production of a craftsman's family because
their households were not productive

231
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:46,711
units.

232
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:48,150
They went out to work for others.

233
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,520
But you also find these women engaged
in all kinds of wage labor to make their

234
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:55,890
contribution to the domestic budget.

235
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:00,870
They might do seasonal agricultural labor
that you might find them spinning for

236
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:01,471
wages,

237
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:03,450
producing the yarn for the cloth industry.

238
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,930
They took in sewing and knitting and
washing and all kinds of other activities

239
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,840
outside the home in the city of
Chester up here in the northwest,

240
00:11:12,841 --> 00:11:13,674
for example,

241
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,573
at the docks,

242
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,730
they had a crane which was
operated by a treadmill.

243
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:22,170
Someone had to stand inside of wheel
and tread it to make it turn to make the

244
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:23,004
crane operator,

245
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:23,670
uh,

246
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,800
who was inside the wheel women.

247
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,240
Um,

248
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,890
you also find many women engaged
in various forms of petty dealing.

249
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:32,790
Um,

250
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,300
one glimpse survives of a
woman called Rose Rose Hearst.

251
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,340
She lived in Mulder on the coast of
the county of Essex and we learned that

252
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,290
twice a week on market day,

253
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,340
she went 15 miles to the
county town to sell oysters.

254
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:49,770
I hope she had a pony.

255
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:54,370
So carrying a basket of ice
does 15 miles would be no joke,

256
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,310
but rose her soul dosages twice a week.

257
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,360
So overall women's tasks extended well
beyond the domestic sphere to include a

258
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:12,190
host of forms of self provisioning or
supplementary earning according to the

259
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:14,170
circumstances of different
kinds of household.

260
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:15,940
The mix would vary,

261
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,660
but the common characteristic of
that gender role was flexibility and

262
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:23,980
adaptability.

263
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,050
In what was expected of them.

264
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,220
Mary Pryor,

265
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,550
who's written an excellent article
on women's work in this period,

266
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,510
um,

267
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,141
sums it up.

268
00:12:32,141 --> 00:12:32,974
She says,

269
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,560
what men did was definite,

270
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,000
well defined and limited
to their craft or trade.

271
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,480
What women did was everything else

272
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,900
in a way that's slightly unfair to men.

273
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,220
They worked very hard too,

274
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,410
but it's essentially true.

275
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:52,721
Well,

276
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:55,360
this constant round of
duties of house were free,

277
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,170
were conducted in the
context of a further role.

278
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,450
Women's reproductive role,

279
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,580
which is worth dwelling on a little.

280
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,490
Most couples in this period got
married in their mid to late twenties.

281
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,180
They married relatively late when they
were ready to set up their own household.

282
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,410
Yeah,

283
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,590
historical demographers who
researched the parish registers,

284
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:21,890
which give us the details of people's
marriages and the baptisms of their

285
00:13:21,891 --> 00:13:23,060
children and so forth.

286
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:27,530
They've revealed that the average woman
could expect to have her first child

287
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,780
within 18 months of marriage

288
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:35,690
and she could then expect on average to
have another child at intervals of two

289
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:39,200
to three years for the
rest of her fertile life.

290
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,730
If you live that long,

291
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,730
think about it.

292
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,730
That means that the average woman in
16th century England was pregnant for a

293
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:54,011
quarter to a third of her entire adult
life and that they were constantly

294
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,260
besieged by the needs of small children.

295
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,840
These births being spaced across an
entire adult life meant that you know when

296
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,840
some children were teenagers and
ready to go out into service,

297
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,361
others,

298
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:08,300
this still toddlers and so forth,

299
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,610
constant demands of small children.

300
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,250
So it's not surprising that as Thomas
Tasha said in the mid 16th century

301
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:21,670
housewives affairs have never known end
housewives affairs have never non end

302
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,450
and despite their legal subordination,

303
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,960
it was of course on the performance of
these complex roles in adapt adapted to

304
00:14:33,231 --> 00:14:38,231
circumstances that women's standing
as individuals depended amongst their

305
00:14:38,271 --> 00:14:39,104
neighbors,

306
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,760
within their families and
from the performance of these
roles darkness that they

307
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:45,530
derive their self esteem

308
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,820
well in an agriculturally
dominated labor intensive,

309
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,380
low productivity,

310
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:59,240
pre mechanized and pre contraceptive age.

311
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,760
It could hardly be otherwise

312
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,340
and for the same reasons children
are expected to play their part to

313
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,070
only a small minority of children
would have formal schooling.

314
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:14,630
In the 16th century.

315
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,770
It's been estimated perhaps
10% in the early 16th century.

316
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Most children would learn their life
skills practically at home or a servants.

317
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,580
And they were expected to begin that and
to participate in the domestic economy

318
00:15:34,371 --> 00:15:36,560
as soon as they were able to do so.

319
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,440
That may sound exploitative,

320
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,110
but one mustn't exaggerate.

321
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,300
Such participation was an essential
part of their education for life and

322
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,740
children tended to be introduced
the tasks at an appropriate stage.

323
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:53,840
There's also plenty of
evidence of them playing,

324
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,110
but from the age of about seven or eight,

325
00:15:57,111 --> 00:16:01,730
you find them regularly engaged in
tasks that they were able to manage.

326
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,710
Herding sheep and cows,

327
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,340
reaping,

328
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,270
gathering fuel,

329
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,410
fetching and carrying,

330
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,000
picking fruit,

331
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,960
scaring birds in the fields and,

332
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:11,060
and so on and so forth.

333
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:11,720
Um,

334
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,720
there's a remarkable study by Barbara
Hanawalt of Ohio State University of,

335
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,623
um,

336
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,780
children children's working
activities in this period,

337
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:22,910
which is based on the records of coroners.

338
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:23,871
Uh,

339
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:26,150
when someone died an untimely death,

340
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,500
um,

341
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,350
it had to be investigated by
the coroner just as today.

342
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,580
They already had that system.

343
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:32,930
Um,

344
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,340
and the records of coroners,

345
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:35,174
which survive,

346
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:40,180
which deal with the deaths of children
reveal what they were doing at the time

347
00:16:40,311 --> 00:16:42,410
that they suffered an accident
leading to their death.

348
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,850
And so you can look at this and you have
their age and you can see what tasks

349
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:47,750
they were engaged in.

350
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:48,920
So for example,

351
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,150
you know,

352
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:53,570
a little boy is helping his father to
cut down a tree when the ax heads strikes

353
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:58,571
him and sadly he's killed or a little
girl is fetching water when she falls down

354
00:16:58,701 --> 00:17:01,940
a well and so on and so forth
from evidence like this.

355
00:17:01,941 --> 00:17:05,780
And imaginative historian can reconstruct
the way in which children will

356
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:08,900
gradually introduced
into their working life.

357
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:16,160
Sustained repetitive labor of the kind
we associate with exploitative child

358
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,860
labor was relatively
rare though it existed,

359
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:23,030
especially in the areas which were
heavily involved in the cloth trade.

360
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,680
That's where you find
children carding wools,

361
00:17:25,681 --> 00:17:27,620
spinning wool for long hours.

362
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,120
So the household in the 16th century,

363
00:17:32,121 --> 00:17:36,980
it was a unit geared for work and
its members roles varied according to

364
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:41,780
contemporary ideas and values
regarding the proper roles of men,

365
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,500
women,

366
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,333
and children.

367
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,500
So let's turn now to the priorities of
households and the strategies by which

368
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:52,200
they achieved them.

369
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,231
Well,

370
00:17:55,231 --> 00:17:56,070
the first priority,

371
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:58,080
obviously enough was survival.

372
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,710
That meant maintaining the flow of
resources on which the household dependent

373
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:08,580
today that would be your
salary in the 16th century.

374
00:18:08,581 --> 00:18:13,581
It meant various combinations of self
provisioning on the one hand and engaging

375
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:16,590
in markets on the other.

376
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,920
Most rural households were still heavily
weighted towards providing their own

377
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,810
basic subsistence.

378
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,700
It was still essentially a subsistence
economy of small producers relying

379
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:34,701
primarily on family labor and consuming
most of their produce in their own

380
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,933
houses.

381
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,020
Um,

382
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:41,070
of course that would vary
regionally and socially.

383
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,120
Um,

384
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,140
in most areas there was a minority of
those large yeoman farmers I mentioned

385
00:18:46,141 --> 00:18:46,974
last time.

386
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,670
They were attuned to supplying um,

387
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,880
medium to long distance markets
with agricultural produce,

388
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:55,830
provisioning the towns and so forth.

389
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:58,380
And they were producers
on a substantial scale,

390
00:18:58,410 --> 00:18:59,760
heavily engaged in marketing.

391
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:05,810
But it's been estimated by
the agricultural historian
Mark Overton that about

392
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,920
80% of English farming and the early 16th
century was actually oriented towards

393
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:13,710
the subsistence of the farm family itself.

394
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,250
And only a small part of
their produce being marketed.

395
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:19,531
Well,

396
00:19:19,531 --> 00:19:22,170
whether the flow of household
resources depended on,

397
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,350
on self provisioning or
on selling in the market,

398
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:30,120
it provided people with their living
and often quite a bare living.

399
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,763
Um,

400
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:36,740
Overton whom I mentioned has
also calculated the incomes.

401
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:37,051
It could be,

402
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,730
it could be expected by farmers.

403
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:43,850
In this period a big yeoman who had a
hundred acres of land growing wheat could

404
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,290
not only feed his family,

405
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,380
but would probably earn Overton,

406
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,880
reckons about 70 pounds a year.

407
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,540
Quite a substantial income
from his production.

408
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,800
Um,

409
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,670
on the other hand,

410
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,621
a small husband,

411
00:19:57,621 --> 00:20:02,621
men with only about 10 acres would
probably have only enough left to sell to

412
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:05,310
yield him two or three pounds a year.

413
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:09,600
So is an enormous difference in the
cash income that they could generate.

414
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,900
So for many of these families,

415
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:14,310
the smaller Husbandman,

416
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,380
they had a fairly narrow margin
and that was in normal times.

417
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,040
Um,

418
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,040
these estimates have to be transformed
when you get the event of a bad harvest.

419
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,180
Uh,

420
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,440
if the harvest failed,

421
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:29,820
a big farmer,

422
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,880
big yeoman farmer would still be
able to feed his family and prices,

423
00:20:32,881 --> 00:20:34,800
which shoot up because of shortages.

424
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,200
So he might still make
a considerable income,

425
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,750
but in such circumstances,

426
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,390
the small farmer might not be
able to feed his own family.

427
00:20:42,391 --> 00:20:44,010
He might fall behind on his rent,

428
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,700
he might have to buy grain in
the market at inflated prices.

429
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,490
It could be a disastrous circumstance.

430
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,220
And for landless wage earners,

431
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,630
it could be even harder.

432
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,980
They didn't produce their own food.

433
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,040
They would have to buy
it at very high prices.

434
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,420
Well,

435
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,210
bad years like that were relatively rare,

436
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,160
but they were unpredictable.

437
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,150
Um,

438
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,440
in the 1520s,

439
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:10,540
there were two very bad years like that.

440
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:11,350
Uh,

441
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,610
in the 1550s,

442
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,690
there were three,

443
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,040
there was another run,

444
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:18,190
a very bad harvest in the 50
nineties and so on could go on.

445
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,660
And it was one of the hazards of life.

446
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,100
One can understand why people sometimes
in the diaries that they left behind

447
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:28,000
them or looking anxiously at the
weather as the harvest approaches,

448
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,690
other sources of insecurity
could be equally unpredictable.

449
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,870
The high mortality rates of the
period could pose a real threat.

450
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:41,960
Uh,

451
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,770
the worst circumstances would
be the outbreak of an epidemic,

452
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,310
usually an epidemic of bubonic plague.

453
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:49,810
Uh,

454
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,790
when an epidemic hit a city,

455
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,350
as they periodically did,

456
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,680
you might get 20 or 30% of the entire
population dying within a period of

457
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:00,880
months.

458
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,450
Um,

459
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,740
the city of York,

460
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,710
the greatest city of the
north of England up here,

461
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,083
um,

462
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,010
York suffered no fewer than seven
epidemics of bubonic plague.

463
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,460
I'm between 40 and 85 and 15,

464
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:16,021
15.

465
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:21,021
So this was another hazard of life which
would periodically strike devastating

466
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,370
the households that were infected.

467
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,220
Besides epidemics,

468
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:30,250
though there was also the constant
threat of infectious diseases,

469
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:32,860
which nowadays would be
cleared up in a matter of days,

470
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,611
uh,

471
00:22:33,611 --> 00:22:34,900
with antibiotics.

472
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,100
Um,

473
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,730
this meant that death
rates were fairly high,

474
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,750
um,

475
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,800
for adults.

476
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,400
Um,

477
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,260
very few people live till 60.

478
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,453
Um,

479
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,190
and also you have the hazards
of death in child bed,

480
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:48,581
uh,

481
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:49,414
for women.

482
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:49,811
Uh,

483
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:51,370
and of course accidental deaths.

484
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:56,910
These threats could hit the
prosperous and the poor alike.

485
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,900
And the accident of death at a bad
moment in any household could prove

486
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:06,640
absolutely disastrous.

487
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,160
This was a period that
had no life insurance.

488
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:14,470
It was a period which had no pensions
for those who were left behind.

489
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:21,310
Average life expectation at birth in
the 16th century was actually about 33

490
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:22,900
that's average.

491
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,730
If you made it to 20,

492
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:26,320
you will probably live to their forties,

493
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,260
but most people died in
their forties or fifties.

494
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:32,823
Okay.

495
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,270
All of these somber realities add up to
an environment of risk for the household

496
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:40,240
threatening its viability and survival,

497
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:44,320
and that inevitably influenced
people's mentalities.

498
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,820
It's been suggested that people in this
period tended to value security and

499
00:23:49,821 --> 00:23:53,000
stability over change and growth.

500
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:54,590
There.

501
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,920
Economic Strategies in particular
were often very defensive,

502
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:58,491
uh,

503
00:23:58,491 --> 00:24:03,491
designed to minimize risks rather
than to maximize opportunities.

504
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,950
So their first priority was survival.

505
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,500
The second major priority was to
provide for the future well being of the

506
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:20,000
members of the household and their
future capacity if they were young,

507
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:24,380
to be able to form and sustain how cells
have their own when they reached the

508
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:25,370
appropriate age.

509
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,430
And in this process,

510
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,340
there are three crucial moments in the
life of the household as the putting

511
00:24:34,341 --> 00:24:36,740
forth of children into
the world as they put it.

512
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,250
There's marriage and the
arrangements associated with it,

513
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,480
and there was the transmission of
property to the new generation through

514
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:45,350
inheritance.

515
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,720
These are all aspects of the way in which
household would gradually dispersed.

516
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:56,540
Let's look first at the
aspect of dispersal involving
young people that they're

517
00:24:56,541 --> 00:25:01,220
leaving home to enter the
households of others as servants.

518
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:02,180
And as apprentices,

519
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,700
the institution of service was well
attuned to accommodating the needs of

520
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:14,960
different households at
any one point in time.

521
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:15,561
Uh,

522
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:16,400
some households,

523
00:25:16,401 --> 00:25:21,320
often the poorer ones would have children
who were coming to an age at which

524
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:23,420
they were capable of
a fuller working role,

525
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:27,410
but there wasn't really enough
to usefully employ them at home.

526
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,730
Their Labor wasn't needed.

527
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:30,650
Other households,

528
00:25:30,651 --> 00:25:30,981
however,

529
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:33,530
would require additional labor,

530
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:34,430
uh,

531
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,610
either temporarily because
the children were young,

532
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:42,611
too young to work or permanently because
their children had grown and left home.

533
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,330
Um,

534
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:45,920
if you look at the back of your handout,

535
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:48,260
you'll see a couple of,

536
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:48,890
um,

537
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,820
examples of 16th century households.

538
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,830
That's 16th century
handwriting at the bottom.

539
00:25:54,831 --> 00:25:56,990
This is from a census which was made.

540
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,453
Um,

541
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,360
these are the households of yeomen
farmers and you'll see that there are no

542
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,620
children in those households,

543
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,600
but there are lots of servants.

544
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,110
Some of them are described as husbandman
except that they're at their farm

545
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:12,140
workers living in the household
of these yeoman farmers.

546
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,700
And most of them,

547
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,563
as you'll see,

548
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,770
are pretty young.

549
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,560
They're in their late
teens or early twenties.

550
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:24,320
That's what 16th century households of
this particular type would have looked

551
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:25,154
like.

552
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,473
Well,

553
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,810
the basic logic of the system then
was the transfer of children from one

554
00:26:32,811 --> 00:26:33,920
household to another,

555
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,910
according to need.

556
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:35,960
Um,

557
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,880
but there was also more to it than that.

558
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:42,080
Service was also a way in which
young people learn skills.

559
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,880
It was a way which they gain experience.

560
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,070
And of course they earned a small wage,

561
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:48,900
which they can often save.

562
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,980
It also served to kind of redistribute
the young across an area from the village

563
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,730
in which they were born.

564
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:57,870
Um,

565
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:02,870
they would move from master to master
around the area in which they lived.

566
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:04,500
Um,

567
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,980
and they would become familiar with the
economic opportunities available to them

568
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,300
in their region.

569
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,380
Um,

570
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,890
gradually when they reached
sufficient age and maturity,

571
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:14,910
um,

572
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,160
getting a notion of where
they're much settled permanently,

573
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:19,250
Mary and set up their own household.

574
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,340
Um,

575
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:24,240
they would often be hired annually at
a servant's hiring fan has been a very

576
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:29,100
good study of a hiring fair done by a
woman called Ann Kussmaul who's written an

577
00:27:29,101 --> 00:27:31,950
excellent book on servants
and she shows how,

578
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,161
you know,

579
00:27:32,161 --> 00:27:36,840
you would have a little town where the
hiring fair was and servants who might be

580
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:43,660
placed in households scattered around
the area would come in to get hired and

581
00:27:44,211 --> 00:27:45,620
then they might be hired by a master,

582
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:50,621
which would take them out to the other
side of the particular catchment area of

583
00:27:51,441 --> 00:27:52,730
this hiring fair.

584
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,620
So as you're gave way to,

585
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:59,621
your servants would be whizzing backwards
and forwards around this area and she

586
00:27:59,781 --> 00:28:01,940
shows from year to year how that happened.

587
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,100
And then eventually they settled.

588
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:06,973
Okay.

589
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:07,630
Well,

590
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,750
a lot of this was relevant
to apprentices also.

591
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:14,820
But with the apprenticeship system of
course the advantages mechanism and the

592
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:16,990
skill training,

593
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:17,860
um,

594
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,140
aspect was much more prominent.

595
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,710
Families invested in the children
who went out as apprentices.

596
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:28,711
They paid a fee to their masters and they
expected that in future when they had

597
00:28:28,961 --> 00:28:30,010
finished their apprenticeship,

598
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,620
they would set up his
master craftsmen themselves.

599
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,900
So service and apprenticeship where the
conventional ways of preparing young

600
00:28:37,901 --> 00:28:42,901
people for the future assumption
of adult responsibilities.

601
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,780
And for most of them
that came with marriage,

602
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:51,610
marriage was the point at which they
were transformed into householders.

603
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,070
And like leaving home,

604
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:59,610
it was a point of transition at which
individual desires and individual

605
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:05,071
ambitions had to be reconciled with the
larger strategies of the households they

606
00:29:06,281 --> 00:29:06,550
built,

607
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,383
they belong to

608
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,240
the making of a marriage
was quite a complex process.

609
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,480
It's left a lot of records and quite,

610
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:16,840
uh,

611
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,770
quite a few excellent.

612
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:19,210
Studies have been done a bit.

613
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:24,930
It was really simply a matter of parents
arranging the marriages of the young

614
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,770
that was certainly known.

615
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:27,370
Uh,

616
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,850
parents were more than happy to present
potential candidates to their children.

617
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:34,780
And amongst the aristocracy
arrangement of matches,

618
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,351
uh,

619
00:29:35,351 --> 00:29:36,640
amongst their children,

620
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,530
um,

621
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,363
was very common.

622
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:39,460
Um,

623
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,730
these were families in which marriage
have great social and political

624
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:47,590
significance and it was too important
to leave to the young people themselves.

625
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,970
But in general,

626
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:53,710
young people were permitted a
considerable degree of personal choice in

627
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:57,040
selecting their marriage
partners provided they did.

628
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:01,900
So by choosing within a pool of
people who were considered acceptable,

629
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,810
that's to say a pool of eligible partners
of appropriate social and economic

630
00:30:07,811 --> 00:30:08,644
standing.

631
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,670
They had an ideal of parity
in marriage like married.

632
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,650
Like when they talk of a match,

633
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:19,800
they mean exactly that they're matching
social equals and whether the courts

634
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:23,860
ships were initiated by the young
people themselves or whether they were

635
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:28,861
responding to initiatives and suggestions
taken by their parents or their

636
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:29,763
guardians.

637
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,470
This,

638
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:35,170
the successful completion of a match
was subject to what one historian has

639
00:30:35,171 --> 00:30:37,750
called multilateral consent.

640
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,290
It's not a unilateral matter
for the young people alone.

641
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,350
It's not unilateral arrangement
by the parents alone.

642
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,750
It's a matter of multilateral consent.

643
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,800
That is to say the agreement and
support of all interested parties,

644
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,700
notably their parents,

645
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,560
but also their close kin.

646
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,570
Sometimes their brothers and sisters,

647
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,490
anyone who had an interest

648
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,580
that could see that that kind of
influence could sometimes be exerted quite

649
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:07,420
sensitively,

650
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,990
but sometimes it could be
asserted quite brutally.

651
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:11,441
Uh,

652
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:12,490
William Perkins,

653
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:14,170
the famous Puritan preacher,

654
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:14,720
uh,

655
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,640
advised one young woman who was worried
about the marriage that had been

656
00:31:18,641 --> 00:31:20,920
proposed to her by her father.

657
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:26,410
He advised her live virginity
is not line to dispose of.

658
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,200
In part it is my parents.

659
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,360
They father had a stroke in it.

660
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:36,390
They mother hath another they
kindred half a third fight,

661
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,320
not against all,

662
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,920
but be his whom they would have the,

663
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,313
well in that case,

664
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,810
all that's required of her is her consent,

665
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:49,360
but it may have been very unwilling

666
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,640
among families that had little or no
property agreement or the goodwill,

667
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,520
as they often put it of others,

668
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:03,280
was largely a matter
of simply moral force.

669
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,190
Young people from the poorer ranks had
a good deal more freedom of movement.

670
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:10,270
Um,

671
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:15,130
they provided for their own independence
largely from their own earnings and

672
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:16,300
their own savings.

673
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,350
Um,

674
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:19,690
and often it took them years to do so,

675
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,500
um,

676
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,580
but they were under less
pressure from their families.

677
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,630
Um,

678
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:30,630
one young woman who was preparing for her
eventual independence as a young woman

679
00:32:31,331 --> 00:32:33,340
called Isabel Fowler,

680
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,330
um,

681
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:38,050
who died unmarried around about 1550,

682
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,260
uh,

683
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,330
and whose goods were listed when she died.

684
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:42,231
Uh,

685
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:43,940
she was still a servant at the time.

686
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:49,330
She had a chest and in her chest she had
some clothes and some domestic utensils

687
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,820
and some bedding.

688
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:53,690
Uh,

689
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,710
her master was holding three pounds
of accumulated wages for her.

690
00:32:57,711 --> 00:32:59,330
He was kind of acting as a banker.

691
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,100
And in addition,

692
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:01,550
uh,

693
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,900
she had three cows,

694
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:03,591
uh,

695
00:33:03,591 --> 00:33:07,460
which are master was allowing
her to run a with his herd.

696
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:13,270
So Isabelle was clearly sort of getting
it together for a potential marriage.

697
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,833
Sadly,

698
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,213
she died.

699
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,173
She never made it,

700
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,210
but she would have been
a good catch if she had

701
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,740
well amongst people with property,

702
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:29,600
whether they were small farmers
or higher up to social scale.

703
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,020
The economic arrangements were
somewhat more complicated.

704
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,561
Uh,

705
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:35,480
one contemporary observers said,

706
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:38,330
young folk may come together for love,

707
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,370
but parents must cast how
they will live together.

708
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:45,860
The two families would provide,

709
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:46,460
um,

710
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,630
a conjugal fund.

711
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,700
The groom was expected.

712
00:33:49,701 --> 00:33:53,540
It was expected that his family would
help to provide a dwelling and a means of

713
00:33:53,541 --> 00:33:54,374
livelihood.

714
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,780
The bride would bring what
was called her portion,

715
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,990
her portion of goods or
money or perhaps even land,

716
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:00,770
uh,

717
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,750
with which our family would endow her.

718
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,360
These resources would be partly
accumulated by the young people,

719
00:34:08,361 --> 00:34:12,560
but depended crucially at this
social level upon parental help,

720
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,190
through either inheritance
or transfers of property.

721
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,250
And the sums involved could,

722
00:34:19,251 --> 00:34:19,491
could,

723
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:19,880
could,

724
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,290
could be quite substantial.

725
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,830
Um,

726
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,020
in 1500 for example,

727
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,320
one study shows that the portions which
were given to daughters of the gentry in

728
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:30,380
the county of Kent,

729
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:31,970
which is down here in the southeast,

730
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,373
um,

731
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:38,380
averaged around 280 pounds is quite a
lot of money in the early 16th century,

732
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,060
which these gentry families had
to find for their daughters.

733
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,020
Um,

734
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:46,730
villagers in the same county of
course provided a much lower sums,

735
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:50,570
but it could range up to 20 or 30 pounds.

736
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,430
But whatever the level settling these
matters involve some pretty hard

737
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:57,440
bargaining amongst the family's concerned.

738
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,480
There's a lot of evidence of the way
in which people calculated what their

739
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:03,980
families could afford,

740
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:09,220
how the families of the bride and groom
hammered it out and negotiated over the

741
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:14,291
portions and all of this of course had
its implications for the younger children

742
00:35:14,421 --> 00:35:15,200
in the family.

743
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,430
What would be left for them.

744
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,410
They had a say and they also needed to
calculate what the family could afford if

745
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,660
it was to remain itself
viable economically.

746
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,740
So it involved a lot of strategic thinking
when a marriage was proposed and if

747
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:32,600
all of that was successfully resolved,

748
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,730
the match would be concluded,

749
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:40,090
a new household would be established and
in doubt if not the denial of parental

750
00:35:42,061 --> 00:35:45,240
support could be catastrophic
for the marriage.

751
00:35:45,241 --> 00:35:49,080
Hopes of the young people concerned
if these things interests,

752
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,861
interests you.

753
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:52,560
I recommend in particular book
on the reading list by Diana.

754
00:35:52,561 --> 00:35:54,630
Real horror core trip and constraint.

755
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:57,440
It's a wonderful study of
16th century courtship,

756
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:05,340
well putting your children fourth as
adolescence and then matchmaking at the

757
00:36:05,711 --> 00:36:06,550
time of marriage.

758
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,630
We're also linked in different ways
to the question of inheritance,

759
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:14,320
the way in which resources were
transferred between the generations.

760
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:19,900
It's generally true to say that 16th
century English society and favored

761
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:25,080
primogeniture the lion's share going off
the family property going to the eldest

762
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:27,663
son.

763
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,900
But they also believe that an equitable
provision should be made for younger

764
00:36:31,901 --> 00:36:32,734
children.

765
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:37,060
They should receive some portion of
goods to help them into adult life.

766
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:37,901
Uh,

767
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:41,650
one to the lawyer said that in his view,

768
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:47,010
a good and natural loving father would
exercise care and providence to advance

769
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:54,210
every office children according to his
ability with a portion of living or

770
00:36:54,371 --> 00:36:55,300
substance.

771
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,990
And nor was it a matter for the father's
alone because if they laid down in

772
00:37:01,991 --> 00:37:02,740
their wills,

773
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:05,110
the division of their goods
amongst their children,

774
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:10,210
it's also very clear that the successful
completion of these family strategies

775
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:15,760
usually depended upon the sustaining of
the household economy after the father's

776
00:37:15,761 --> 00:37:17,740
death by their widows.

777
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:23,980
It was usual in people's wheels for the
widow to be named executor with full

778
00:37:23,981 --> 00:37:28,981
control of the family property until
either her death or the age of majority of

779
00:37:30,071 --> 00:37:31,330
the eldest son.

780
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:37,530
It was simply assumed that these women
had the experience and the capability to

781
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:40,150
do all that was required.

782
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:46,490
And that leads us to a final
aspect of the household.

783
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:50,480
The question of authority and power.

784
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:52,440
Yeah.

785
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,450
Within this structure of relationships.

786
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,420
Yeah.

787
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,420
All of the SEL strategies that I've
been talking about had a certain sort of

788
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,190
collective element.

789
00:38:06,191 --> 00:38:09,100
You could say the quality of jointness,

790
00:38:09,101 --> 00:38:12,160
the interests of the different
individuals intersect.

791
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:18,130
You'll have to accommodate the collective
interest of the household as a unit

792
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:23,460
with that of the individuals who comprised
it and had their own expectations and

793
00:38:24,311 --> 00:38:25,660
perhaps ambitions.

794
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,100
Yeah.

795
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:33,100
But one might well ask whether decision
making within households was truly

796
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,753
connective

797
00:38:36,210 --> 00:38:37,040
households,

798
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,300
uh,

799
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,830
like society in general.

800
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:43,360
What organized on a principle
of hierarchical differentiation,

801
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:48,760
people's duties and People's entitlements
were conceived of in accordance with

802
00:38:48,761 --> 00:38:51,220
their place within that hierarchy.

803
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,410
The household economy,

804
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,830
as we've seen involved into dependence,

805
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:57,401
itch,

806
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:57,881
involved,

807
00:38:57,881 --> 00:38:59,140
complementary effort,

808
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,310
but the contributions of members
will not necessarily of equal weight.

809
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:05,230
They weren't necessarily,

810
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,230
um,

811
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:09,430
of equal value in contemporary reviews.

812
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,893
Um,

813
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:16,080
one could say that in many ways the
house sold was in a sense a sphere of

814
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:20,290
altruism in which the interest of
others were taken into consideration.

815
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:21,940
But at the same time,

816
00:39:21,941 --> 00:39:26,680
there could be clashes of personality
and there could be competition over

817
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,580
resources.

818
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
The law and contemporary ideology left
no doubt about where ultimate authority

819
00:39:35,641 --> 00:39:37,470
lay in managing all of this.

820
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,960
It lay of course with the household head,

821
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:46,730
but it's equally apparent when one has
glimpses of households in action that the

822
00:39:47,671 --> 00:39:49,350
personal dynamics of the household,

823
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:54,240
we're often far more complex than that
stereotype we have to stereotype of

824
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,630
uncontested patriarchal domination.

825
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:02,250
The reality turns out to
be far more very a gated.

826
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:08,640
The fact that women were subordinated
as a sex didn't preclude recognition of

827
00:40:08,641 --> 00:40:09,690
their competence.

828
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,260
It didn't preclude
recognition of their judgment.

829
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,290
Such qualities were expected of them,

830
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,530
and they were daily displayed in
the conduct of household affairs.

831
00:40:19,531 --> 00:40:22,290
As we've seen accordingly,

832
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,380
you find any evidence that wives were
very often far from being the silent

833
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,980
spectators of the decisions that were
made regarding their family's wellbeing.

834
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:38,090
The evidence of matchmaking shows that
they had a very real voice in either

835
00:40:38,401 --> 00:40:43,401
negotiating the terms of the
marriages of their children or in um,

836
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:43,831
uh,

837
00:40:43,831 --> 00:40:47,550
opposing or approving
particular candidates.

838
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:48,750
Um,

839
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:53,250
the evidence we have regarding the making
of people's wills shows that women are

840
00:40:53,251 --> 00:40:58,251
often heavily involved advising their
husbands on the terms of their wills and

841
00:40:58,681 --> 00:40:59,850
sometimes indeed,

842
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:00,420
uh,

843
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,320
disputing them.

844
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,430
They were the ones who would ultimately
have to administer and execute that was

845
00:41:05,431 --> 00:41:09,450
Wales and they had a voice in their
making and they appear elsewhere making

846
00:41:09,451 --> 00:41:12,210
their voices heard and
indeed being listened to

847
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,740
outside the context of the household.

848
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:21,180
Most women could of course
exercise little public authority,

849
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:27,230
but within it they clearly had a
recognized role and that recognized real

850
00:41:27,421 --> 00:41:32,421
conferred certain rights and certain
entitlements and be for turbot in the book

851
00:41:34,611 --> 00:41:39,611
of husbandry advised that both wife and
husband should from time to time make

852
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,520
what he called reckonings
with one another.

853
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,830
He was thinking of their
economic activities,

854
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:48,020
but they should make reckonings of their,

855
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,360
their activities with one another.

856
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:55,420
And he went on for if one of them
should use to deceive the other,

857
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:02,230
he deceived with himself and is not likely
to thrive and therefore they must be

858
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:06,230
true each to other.

859
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:12,910
That's just one statement of an
ideal of mutuality within marriage,

860
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,710
within the management of the household,

861
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:20,840
which of course found it's immediate
expression every day in the day to day

862
00:42:20,841 --> 00:42:25,841
activities of households
that sin certainly didn't
transform them into spheres

863
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:30,050
of equality of course,

864
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,600
but it could and did involve the
development of working relationships,

865
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:40,660
of mutual support and mutual respect
in the pursuit of priorities that were

866
00:42:42,621 --> 00:42:43,760
essentially shared.

867
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,083
So in short,

868
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:49,340
the household was certainly
a sphere of power.

869
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,070
It was certainly a sphere of authority,

870
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:57,610
but it was one in which the exercise was
also constantly influenced by the play

871
00:43:00,081 --> 00:43:03,200
of the individual personalities
of those involved.

872
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,270
And I think if,

873
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:08,330
if one wants to work on
this kind of problem,

874
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:13,331
what needs to be sensitive to the
balance between these various elements?

875
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:18,620
So to conclude,

876
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,753
um,

877
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:25,190
society and economy in the early
modern period has been described by one

878
00:43:25,191 --> 00:43:25,701
historian,

879
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:29,240
David Ralston as a culture of households.

880
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,590
In a landscape.

881
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:37,750
The household was certainly fundamental
and it was fundamental to both

882
00:43:39,231 --> 00:43:44,210
continuity and change in the
social history of the period.

883
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:49,730
A lot of the characteristics that I've
been describing endured throughout the

884
00:43:49,731 --> 00:43:52,580
whole of the 16th and 17th centuries,

885
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,690
but some aspects of
household life did change.

886
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,500
They changed with changing circumstances.

887
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:06,190
Some of the changes which took place in
this period in a variety of spheres in

888
00:44:06,191 --> 00:44:07,100
the economy,

889
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,810
in population,

890
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,600
in social structure,

891
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:16,010
in culture had their influence
upon household relationships.

892
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,930
Some of them threatened the
viability of household economy,

893
00:44:19,931 --> 00:44:22,130
some aspects of economic
and population change.

894
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:23,113
For example,

895
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:27,170
some changes provided new opportunities,

896
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:30,680
new opportunities for the
consumption of household goods,

897
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,860
new opportunities for the education of
children and other things which we'll see

898
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,760
in due course in later lectures

899
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,093
in general.

900
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:46,200
One could also say that the course of
change in this period and the outcomes of

901
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:51,201
change crucially involved the responses
to changing circumstances of thousands

902
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:59,360
of households and all of their
members had a hand in those responses.

903
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:07,310
It was never just a matter of impersonal
social forces acting upon households,

904
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:13,050
individuals and families
made their decisions,

905
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,740
adapted their strategies in
accordance with their values,

906
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:21,660
in accordance with their priorities
in meeting the various changes of the

907
00:45:21,661 --> 00:45:22,494
period.

908
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:25,560
And thinking about that way is helpful,

909
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:26,573
I think,

910
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:27,390
um,

911
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:29,850
because when we think about it that way,

912
00:45:29,851 --> 00:45:33,390
we can give some of the abstractions
and generalizations about the great

913
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:36,240
processes that took place
in the early modern period.

914
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:40,590
Something of a human face at
the level of the household.

915
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:42,290
And in many ways it,

916
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:47,570
it's the capacity of
historians to recapture the
shifting expressions on those

917
00:45:49,171 --> 00:45:50,004
faces,

918
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:53,040
which makes these things worth studying.

919
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:55,740
Okay.

920
00:45:55,740 --> 00:46:00,240
Well next time I'll go on to look at
various kinds of communities and their

921
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,300
institutions and patterns
of relationships.
