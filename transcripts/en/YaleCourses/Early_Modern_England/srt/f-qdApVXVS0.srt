1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,880
Well last time,

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,550
looking at the household,

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:06,060
uh,

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,170
provided a point of entry to some of
the basic realities and priorities that

5
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:14,910
shake people's lives at the most
basic level in the 16th century,

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,470
but as is already apparent,

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,300
I hope,

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:19,581
uh,

9
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:22,110
these households of course
it didn't live in isolation.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:22,891
Uh,

11
00:00:22,891 --> 00:00:23,880
on the contrary,

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,300
every family was conducting its affairs
in the context of a larger landscape of

13
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,910
social institutions and relationships.

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,110
And what I want to do this week and
concluding this sort of contextual

15
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:41,730
introduction is to talk about some of
these connections that bound people

16
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:43,770
together and bound the country together.

17
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:44,840
Um,

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,820
and I'll start by looking at some of
the more localized institutions and

19
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:48,690
relationships,

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:50,663
um,

21
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:54,630
those which bound them together
into local communities.

22
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,900
But as soon as I use that word,

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,441
uh,

24
00:00:58,441 --> 00:00:59,280
community,

25
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,241
uh,

26
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:03,540
I have to pause because
it's a very loaded term.

27
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,450
It's use,

28
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,230
tends to beg and important
question about society.

29
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:11,064
And the period,

30
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,970
uh,

31
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,870
puts simply,

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,170
uh,

33
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,880
people in 16th century England didn't
live in entities called communities.

34
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:18,630
Uh,

35
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,800
they lived in places they
described as manners or parishes,

36
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,020
villages or townships.

37
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,530
They very rarely used the
term community at all.

38
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,100
When we talk about communities,

39
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:33,120
as we often do,

40
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,630
we're actually introducing a concept
which is largely a construct of

41
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,250
sociologists and historians.

42
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,040
And more than that,

43
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,310
we're also implying something about the
nature and the quality of the social

44
00:01:49,891 --> 00:01:54,030
relationships that existed in the
manners and parishes and villages and

45
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,550
townships of the distant past.

46
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,430
Um,

47
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,430
the very word community
carries a great deal of warmth.

48
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,920
It's a good word to coopt in the cause of,

49
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,050
of any argument.

50
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,860
Uh,

51
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,860
as we see constantly in political life,

52
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:14,580
uh,

53
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,580
it vibrates with a certain moral resonance
and when that term gets adopted by

54
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:21,900
historians and sociologists,

55
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,460
it often also invokes a certain
nostalgia about the past.

56
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,290
Uh,

57
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,120
community always seems
to be just out of reach,

58
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,690
something that belongs to a generation
or two ago just over the hill in decline

59
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:39,840
or under threat.

60
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,290
It's sort of the before
of which we are the,

61
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,530
after a tantalizing,

62
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,340
warmly attractive feature
of a world we have lost.

63
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:53,430
And that shouldn't surprise us.

64
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,313
Um,

65
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,690
the very term community
has as very old roots,

66
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:03,020
a derived from the and meaning
literally the quality of being at one.

67
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,860
But the concept as it was developed by
19th and 20th century sociologists was

68
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:16,081
often used by them as a point of reference
from which to examine and often to

69
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:21,910
judge the rapid social changes
taking place at that time.

70
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:28,050
So the traditional or the folk community
was very commonly envisaged by the

71
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:34,351
founders of the social sciences as being
almost everything that modern European

72
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:37,690
and American society was ceasing to be.

73
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,383
It's rural,

74
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:42,370
it's small scale,

75
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,650
it's economically simple.

76
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:50,430
It's introverted and deeply rooted and
warm and personal and homogeneous in

77
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:54,610
values and stable

78
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,710
embodying indeed one could say some of
the traditions of pastoral literature.

79
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,630
I don't know if you know Thomas Grays,

80
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:05,860
18th century poem,

81
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:09,760
the allergy in a country churchyard um,

82
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,400
but it's a good example of
that kind of literature.

83
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:17,260
Gray envisaged what he called the rude
forefathers of the hamlet buried in the

84
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,133
churchyard.

85
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,380
He described them as having bent
themselves to useful toil and homely.

86
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:28,381
Joy's far from the madding crowd living
in a cool sequestered veil of life.

87
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,480
These are all phrases from the poem,

88
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,300
many of which have become widely used.

89
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,340
Okay.

90
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,690
Well it's easy to appreciate
why historians exposed
to that long tradition of

91
00:04:40,691 --> 00:04:45,691
thinking about small communities in the
past or sometimes app to imagine the

92
00:04:46,121 --> 00:04:51,121
past and to assume certain things
about the quality of life in the past,

93
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,250
in those morally loaded terms.

94
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,600
Um,

95
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,070
to one historian for example,

96
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,820
the late 15th and early 16th
century village was like,

97
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,910
he described it as a family embracing
and composed of many families.

98
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:06,970
Uh,

99
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,160
another describes how to quote him.

100
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,730
The unchanging traditional life of the
patent system flowed on an uninterrupted,

101
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,550
like a deep underground river.

102
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,980
It had flowed dust for a thousand
years and it would continue to flow for

103
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:25,120
another 200.

104
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,641
In contrast,

105
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:31,090
you get some historians who react
violently against what they see as a

106
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:35,740
sentimentalism action of
these rural communities.

107
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,880
One in particular has described
the to the village as being,

108
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,743
to quote him,

109
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,620
a place filled with malice and hatred.

110
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,420
It's only unifying bond being the
occasional episode of mass hysteria,

111
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:53,980
which temporarily bound together the
majority in order to Harry and persecute

112
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:54,830
the local witch.

113
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,040
So that's how he sees,

114
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,150
but both of these positions
derived from a concept,

115
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,290
the concept of community,

116
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:07,880
which is so emotionally powerful that
it tends to seduce some scholars into a

117
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,080
kind of sentimentality.

118
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,100
And on the other hand it enrages others
into an equally distorted cynicism about

119
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:16,880
human relations.

120
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,250
Some have suggested that it might be
better if we just stopped talking about

121
00:06:22,251 --> 00:06:23,360
communities all together,

122
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,410
but to do that would surely be to throw
out the baby with the bath water because

123
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:31,640
the concept of community,

124
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,800
it's very hard to do without.

125
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:39,970
It does describe a certain aspect of
social relationships in local society,

126
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,790
which is not just a nostalgic myth.

127
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:50,030
Certain intensity of connectedness
amongst people focused on their local

128
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:51,260
institutions,

129
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,980
certain qualities of
recognition of one another,

130
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:59,981
of reciprocity in relationships with one
another of mutuality of identification

131
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,420
of obligation.

132
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,690
As historians,

133
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,020
we mustn't assume uncritically
that particular settlements
or localities in the

134
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:15,020
past work communities in the
classical sense with all the positive

135
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:18,230
characteristics traditionally
believed to go along with them.

136
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,030
Community isn't a thing or a place,

137
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,250
it's a quality of living.

138
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,140
It varies.

139
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,060
It's not always present.

140
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,970
Waxes and wanes over time.

141
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,220
It's subject to change.

142
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,540
It exists in different
forms and it doesn't simply,

143
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,580
of course belongs to the past.

144
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,660
It's a perennial aspect
of the human situation.

145
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,690
But if you want to
consider it in the past,

146
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,360
then we can best do so by trying to
carefully reconstruct the actual ties,

147
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,190
institutional and personal,

148
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,960
that linked people together,

149
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,550
the ties through which they
mapped out their social worlds,

150
00:08:00,551 --> 00:08:01,384
so to speak,

151
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,120
the ties through which they made
it legible and understandable.

152
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,283
Well,

153
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:13,880
such relationships and the
institutions that embodied them.

154
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,630
Uh,

155
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,630
it could be thought of as the connective
tissue of society at the most basic

156
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:22,100
level and they would have many kinds

157
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,910
somewhere relationships of authority.

158
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,760
We've already encountered these in
a social audit imagined in terms of

159
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:36,850
hierarchical ties of
obligation and differentiation

160
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,310
in rural society.

161
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,510
More broadly,

162
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,800
the basic defining relationship
was a relationship of authority,

163
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,670
the relationship of Lordship and tenancy.

164
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,530
You can imagine the 16th century
England as being like a myriad of small

165
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:56,364
settlements.

166
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,560
Most of them have less than 500
people scattered over a landscape of

167
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:05,550
considerable diversity in
the early 16th century.

168
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:07,890
That landscape hadn't even been mapped.

169
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:08,800
A,

170
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,290
the first county maps,

171
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:15,000
which county by county
attempted to survey and map,

172
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:15,990
um,

173
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,940
England were actually produced
by Christopher Saxton in 1576.

174
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:21,770
Uh,

175
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,640
it was such an important publication,

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,810
um,

177
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,720
that as the maps were
pulled from the press,

178
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,380
some of them were taken
still wet to Elizabeth,

179
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:32,460
the first chief minister,

180
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:33,121
Lord Burley.

181
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:37,380
He saw the political potential of having
accurate maps of the country for the

182
00:09:37,381 --> 00:09:38,160
first time,

183
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,540
but in the early 16th century,

184
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,310
they didn't yet exist.

185
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,343
Nonetheless,

186
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,560
the landscape was mapped and structured
in another sense by the realities of

187
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,153
Lordship,

188
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,060
the possession of the land and the
authority over tenants that went with it.

189
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,260
So late medieval,

190
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,010
early 16th century social organization
was inscribed on the land through Lord

191
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:08,234
ship.

192
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,910
And the characteristic unit of Lordship
was what they called the manor,

193
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,400
a unit of land under the
authority of the Lord.

194
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,510
Some lords held on your single manner,

195
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,760
the petty gentleman of the countryside,

196
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,210
some of them held many a one for example,

197
00:10:27,211 --> 00:10:28,200
Lord Barkley,

198
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,330
which was spelled Berkeley
as in our college,

199
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,100
pronounced Barkley in England.

200
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,140
Lord Barkley owned so much
of the county of Gloucester.

201
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:35,500
Sure.

202
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Down here that he was described by one
contemporary as being empowered into the

203
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:42,120
soil of that county.

204
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,660
But whatever the case,

205
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,770
whether their landholdings,

206
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,090
we're small or great,

207
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,080
the fact of Lordship over manners was
fundamental to the structure of local

208
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:52,914
society.

209
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,600
The people who cultivated the land
usually did so as tenants of such memorial

210
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,940
lords and the forms in terms of their
tendencies determined their relationship

211
00:11:04,951 --> 00:11:08,040
to their lords and in many respects
their relationships to one another.

212
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,430
Now these forms of tenancy
work were many and varied.

213
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,570
Um,

214
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,190
but there was some general patterns.

215
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,260
The terminology is a little tricky.

216
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,510
So I've put all the
definitions on your handout.

217
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,410
You probably got more definitions of
16th century land ownership and land

218
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:27,050
holding,

219
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:27,630
um,

220
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,980
then you will ever need,

221
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,710
but they're down there in case
you ever want to refer to them.

222
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,413
Basically,

223
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,020
each manor was divided into what was
described as the domain land and what was

224
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,290
tenant land.

225
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,530
If you look at your handout,

226
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:42,720
um,

227
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,370
there's a map there of the
manner of Laxton in Nottingham.

228
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:46,710
Sure.

229
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,710
That's almost right in the center of
England and you'll see on one side at the

230
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,650
the domain land in the
village and then around it,

231
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,540
the great fields of the manner in
which the tenants held their land,

232
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,130
the domain and the tenant land

233
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,730
domain land in the middle ages had
been mostly cultivated by surf labor.

234
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,760
That's to say the Labor of tenants who
were not free and who held their land

235
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:20,011
from the Lord in return for Labor Service
on his land by 1500 serfdom had died

236
00:12:21,911 --> 00:12:23,800
out in most parts of England.

237
00:12:23,801 --> 00:12:26,710
It died out in the course of the
late 14th and 15th centuries.

238
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:30,220
Still left to some extent
over in parts of East Anglia,

239
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:35,460
but it was mostly gone by 1500 the domain
land tended to be let out by lords in

240
00:12:37,811 --> 00:12:38,650
large units,

241
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,760
two yeomen farmers.

242
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,210
As for the tenant land,

243
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,600
some of it was held by freehold,

244
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,780
probably about a fifth overall.

245
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,080
A freeholder owned his land.

246
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,880
He could leave it in his will,

247
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:55,743
he could sell it,

248
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:01,470
but he owed the duty of recognition of
Lordship to the Lord of the manor and had

249
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:06,310
to pay a small annual sum
to recognize such lordship.

250
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,411
Most tenants,

251
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:08,710
however,

252
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,760
held their land by what was
described as customary tenure.

253
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,230
That's to say the land was granted up
to them in the court of the manner which

254
00:13:19,721 --> 00:13:21,250
would meet two or three times a year.

255
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:26,350
And they held it on terms according to
the custom of the manner according to the

256
00:13:26,351 --> 00:13:27,880
custom of the manner.

257
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,370
That's a phrase that's often used.

258
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,790
The custom of the manor
laid down their terms.

259
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,830
These customary tenants were
usually described as copy holders.

260
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,200
They held their land according to a copy
of an entry in the records of the Manor

261
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:44,201
Court,

262
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:45,910
which was given to them as a record.

263
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,270
Sometimes if you go back through
the deeds of a very old house,

264
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:50,380
um,

265
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:54,880
you will find by the time you get
back to 16th and 15th century deeds,

266
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,440
a little strip of parchment,

267
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,820
which is actually a copy of the original
grant of the land on which that house

268
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:02,620
is built.

269
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,970
To a copy holder.

270
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,673
Okay.

271
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,710
Copy holders paid a down payment
to their lord called a fine.

272
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,180
They paid an annual rent.

273
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,570
They might hold their land
for a period of years,

274
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:18,070
like a modern lease or they might
hold it for a period of lives.

275
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,690
That was a customary form by which you
would take land for the life of yourself,

276
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,670
your wife and your eldest child.

277
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:30,220
The terms on which they held their land
might be fixed according to the custom

278
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:31,054
of the manner,

279
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:35,080
in which case they were usually very
fortunate or they might be arbitrary.

280
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,850
That's to say they could be changed.

281
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,290
So Lord ship and the relationship
between Lords and tenants was a defining

282
00:14:43,301 --> 00:14:45,250
relationship in any rural community.

283
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,500
It created a local map of
rights and obligations.

284
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:56,650
The particular pattern represented usually
a particular local working out of a

285
00:14:57,621 --> 00:15:01,940
kind of accommodation between the power
of the Lord and what his tenants had

286
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:06,350
been able to win with him when
from him or negotiate with him.

287
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,280
Um,

288
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,120
and those terms were enshrined
in their local custom.

289
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:18,980
So given those realities custom
and the notion of custom,

290
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:23,990
not surprisingly is another
key word of the period,

291
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:25,400
a very important notion,

292
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,190
custom,

293
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:33,190
a word they use constantly was an
accumulation of rules and accumulation of

294
00:15:34,671 --> 00:15:39,671
rules about what was considered to be
right and proper in a particular place and

295
00:15:40,401 --> 00:15:44,030
the correct procedures for
maintaining and enforcing those rules.

296
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,680
Custom laid down,

297
00:15:45,681 --> 00:15:46,640
as I've already said,

298
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:49,850
the respective rights of the Lord
and the tenant over the land.

299
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,130
It also laid down the rules for the
use of the common grazing land of the

300
00:15:55,131 --> 00:15:55,964
manner.

301
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:00,350
It laid down the rules for the settlement
of disputes if they arose between the

302
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:02,870
tenants of the manner or
between tenants and their Lord.

303
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:09,010
It's been described as a
lived in an environment of
expectations which had grown

304
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:11,840
up slowly over time.

305
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:14,571
Generally,

306
00:16:14,571 --> 00:16:19,571
people tend to to argue when there was
any dispute that customs had existed.

307
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,310
Time out of mind of man.

308
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,870
It's another phrase that's often used.

309
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:29,140
Customer had govern their rules and that
locality time out of mind of man and

310
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,590
when there was a dispute,

311
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:35,720
they usually recruited the oldest tenants
they could find in order to pronounce

312
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,830
on what they had known throughout their
60 or 70 years of life and what they'd

313
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:42,920
heard from their fathers or
their grandfathers and so on,

314
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,850
to confirm the customs in practice.

315
00:16:46,851 --> 00:16:47,391
In fact,

316
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:48,680
custom could be changed.

317
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:54,230
It was subject to gradual modification
over time if all the tenants consented

318
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,460
and it was malleable in accordance
with changing circumstances.

319
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,730
Nevertheless,

320
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,480
it carried this aura of antiquity,

321
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:11,990
so at any one time the operative customer
in a particular place was the outcome

322
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:16,991
of a kind of adjustment amongst the
tenants and between the tenants and the

323
00:17:17,301 --> 00:17:18,134
Lord.

324
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,300
To this extent,

325
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:25,570
custom was seen as being essentially
the property of the tenant community.

326
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,240
It presupposed a community of interest
amongst them and it set the pattern of

327
00:17:31,971 --> 00:17:36,971
expectations that provided the criteria
for judging their relationships with one

328
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:40,310
another and their
relationships with their Lord.

329
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:45,170
Was that relationship with the Lord
equitable and legitimate according to

330
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:46,004
customer,

331
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,050
the word they often use was reasonable.

332
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,410
Was it reasonable?

333
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,070
Was it maintaining customer
or on the other hand,

334
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,220
was it becoming oppressive
or exploitative?

335
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,680
And as a result of all of this
in times of economic stress,

336
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,620
such as where to come
later in the 16th century,

337
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,950
custom could very often become a field
of contest in which lords and tenants

338
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,880
states competing claims about what
the customs were or should be.

339
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,740
And this was very often to happen in the
latest 16th and 17th centuries as we'll

340
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:24,741
see when we come to consider peasant
rebellion and popular protest in this

341
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:26,784
period.

342
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:29,400
Very often it revolves around custom.

343
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,793
Okay,

344
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,970
well let's turn now to another
aspect of the tenant community.

345
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,940
The community of neighbors.

346
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,150
If custom was one key
word in rural society,

347
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,300
neighborliness was emphatically another.

348
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,330
Neighborliness was recognized as being
a critically important social virtue.

349
00:18:56,331 --> 00:19:01,331
And the word is constantly used
as a kind of norm of good conduct.

350
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:06,800
It was of course based on
residents near one another.

351
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,000
Um,

352
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,680
the very word neighbor derives
from an Anglo Saxon word,

353
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,730
Neha Gabor,

354
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,800
which means near dweller,

355
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,510
literally near dweller.

356
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,373
Okay.

357
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,770
Neighborliness was based upon residents
then and it was conducted and developed

358
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,820
through frequent interaction.

359
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,980
Amongst those who live near one another.

360
00:19:29,981 --> 00:19:34,210
And then mutual recognition of obligations
to one another of certain kinds.

361
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,461
In part,

362
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:39,550
it was created by the institutions
and the customs of the manor,

363
00:19:39,551 --> 00:19:44,140
which fostered a sense of place and a
sense of identity associated with that

364
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,130
particular place.

365
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,600
For example,

366
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,200
the Manor Court served as an
instrument of self regulation,

367
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:56,010
especially in the Organization
of agriculture within the manner.

368
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,290
If you look at the other
side of the handout,

369
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,540
you'll see um,

370
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,460
the portrayal by the surveyor of Laxton

371
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:10,410
of one of the fields and
look at how those fields are.

372
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,740
The field is divided up
into little strips of land.

373
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,290
Each one is numbered.

374
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,590
Each one of which has numbered the,

375
00:20:20,591 --> 00:20:20,890
uh,

376
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,940
tenants held their lands scattered
in strips across the field.

377
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,320
The numbers are there so that the surveyor
could put down which pieces of land

378
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:31,690
were held by particular
tenants in his survey book.

379
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,660
And they're at the edge of the
field is an area of common land,

380
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,870
which was used by all the tenants
for grazing their animals.

381
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,140
The surveyor has portrayed very sheep
grazing on it to particularly beautiful

382
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:46,451
map.

383
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:49,990
This map of which was done
in the early 17th century.

384
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:52,990
Well that kind of arrangement,

385
00:20:52,991 --> 00:20:55,660
that kind of scattering
of land around the field.

386
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:56,530
Um,

387
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:01,530
that sharing of common
grazing land inevitably meant
that there had to be a good

388
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:07,261
deal of cooperative organization
of agriculture in such a place.

389
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,270
And the amount of court provided
the opportunities to pass bylaws,

390
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,800
which enabled people to draw up the
rules for their cooperative agriculture

391
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,390
bylaws were described in one contemporary,

392
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:22,960
uh,

393
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,290
law book as being made
for the common profit.

394
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,240
And with the ascent of all,

395
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:33,160
ideally you should have unanimity about
what they were and they're governed not

396
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:34,390
only cooperative agriculture,

397
00:21:34,391 --> 00:21:39,190
but also the mediation of disputes
which arose and if necessary,

398
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:41,590
the punishment of recalcitrant people.

399
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,520
The aim as one man a
court book describes it,

400
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:50,521
was that I'm quoting it all should concur
in the keeping of good neighborhood,

401
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,320
one with another in tilling,

402
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,693
in laboring,

403
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,570
in sewing,

404
00:21:55,570 --> 00:22:00,570
in sharing in pasturing and all other
things pertaining to good and thrifty

405
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,133
neighborhood.

406
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:04,510
Okay.

407
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,380
That was the ideal.

408
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:06,701
Of course,

409
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:11,020
it wasn't simply a happy world of
peasant cooperation in any manner.

410
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,340
The bigger tenants,

411
00:22:12,341 --> 00:22:14,950
the ones who held the most
slant tended to dominate.

412
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,090
There were plenty of
disputes and arguments,

413
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:23,890
but the constant stress that they
placed on the value of neighborhood,

414
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,220
the constant appeals that were made to
that ideal was certainly part and parcel

415
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:33,340
of ensuring that these
arguments got resolved.

416
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:39,690
One historian of this period has
described community as being in one sense

417
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,280
belonging to the same argument and to the
institutions which help to resolve it.

418
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,500
There was a very strong expectation that
ultimately people would conform to a

419
00:22:50,501 --> 00:22:55,501
system which was ruled by custom in the
interest of ensuring the sustainability

420
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:01,740
of the agriculture of the community
as a whole and a subsistence of its

421
00:23:02,801 --> 00:23:04,030
component households.

422
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:07,360
Well,

423
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,690
so much for the immediate economic
dimension of neighborhood,

424
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,340
but in addition,

425
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,350
neighborhood involved of course,

426
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:19,351
much more than simply engaging in
that kind of communal agriculture.

427
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,620
And in fact there was some areas of
the country where that kind of communal

428
00:23:23,621 --> 00:23:28,150
agriculture was much less significant
already in the 16th century.

429
00:23:28,151 --> 00:23:32,410
There was some counties in which land
wasn't held in great open fields like at

430
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,244
Laxton.

431
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:33,790
Um,

432
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,240
but it was already divided up into the
kinds of fields we associated with the

433
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:38,500
English landscape today.

434
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,370
Uh,

435
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,800
enclosed with hedges and ditches.

436
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:46,220
Each farmer owning a certain
number of fields or holding,

437
00:23:46,221 --> 00:23:50,630
but as a tenant a certain number of fields
and farming them according to his own

438
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,583
wishes.

439
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:51,981
Uh,

440
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:56,981
that kind of agriculture
and closed agriculture was
already widely practiced in

441
00:23:57,861 --> 00:24:02,780
Kent in parts of the north of England
and in some parts of eastern England in

442
00:24:02,781 --> 00:24:04,940
the counties of Suffolk and Essex,

443
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:05,803
for example,

444
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,250
long established there.

445
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,760
And it was to become the norm
throughout the whole country.

446
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,130
Uh,

447
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,050
as we will see.

448
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:17,710
So the economic structure of the manner
of neighborhood was of less significance

449
00:24:18,711 --> 00:24:19,670
in such places,

450
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,260
but everywhere.

451
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,500
Neighborliness also found it's
expression in other forms.

452
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,450
One form very important form
was the ecclesiastical parish.

453
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:35,450
England was divided up not only
into units of Lordship the manner,

454
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:41,180
but also into about 10,000
ecclesiastical parishes,

455
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,040
which provided an additional unit of
identity expressed through people's

456
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,140
collective worship in their parish,

457
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:48,974
church

458
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,000
duties to one's neighbor.

459
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:54,560
We're of course,

460
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,470
a central element in Christian teaching.

461
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,870
They implied a certain
universal moral obligation.

462
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,650
Children were asked when they
were taught the church catechism,

463
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:06,950
you know,

464
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,030
who is my neighbor?

465
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,310
Everyone was your neighbor.

466
00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:12,890
Not only those who lived by you,

467
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:17,980
a universal moral obligation and they
were taught also that the second part of

468
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:20,030
the 10 Commandments,

469
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,860
four to 10 involved
duties to one's neighbor.

470
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,430
The second table with duties to one's
neighbor just as the first table,

471
00:25:28,431 --> 00:25:30,800
the first few word duties to God.

472
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:36,920
The church taught that one should
love one's neighbor as oneself,

473
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,430
which was of course exceedingly
hard to do sometimes,

474
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:45,230
but the duty to try was
reinforced in many ways.

475
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,480
At the ritual of the mass.

476
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:52,990
The kiss of peace was part of the ritual
which expressed symbolically being

477
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,330
integrity with your neighbors.

478
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,700
Those who were known to be out of charity
with their neighbors could actually be

479
00:26:01,701 --> 00:26:06,701
excluded from church services
and in particular from the
communion service until

480
00:26:09,831 --> 00:26:11,240
they had reconciled themselves,

481
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,690
reentered charity with their neighbors
and were then allowed to take communion.

482
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,250
The parish also stimulated
neighborly sentiments in other ways.

483
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:28,010
The 15th and the early 16th centuries saw
a remarkable flowering of what's being

484
00:26:28,011 --> 00:26:30,200
described as parish communalism,

485
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,270
a whole world of activity
centered on the church.

486
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:39,320
It involved the rebuilding and
beautification of many churches,

487
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,990
some of the most beautiful
parish churches surviving today.

488
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,410
We'll actually reconstructed in this
period period of relative prosperity in

489
00:26:46,411 --> 00:26:50,280
which parishioners invested
in their parish churches.

490
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:54,300
It was a period of the founding
of many parish religious guilts.

491
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,460
These were associations of parishioners
sometimes are drawn from the entire

492
00:26:59,461 --> 00:27:00,240
community,

493
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,340
sometimes particular sections,

494
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:03,780
associations for the women,

495
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,840
associations for the young associations
for those associated with particular

496
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:14,040
manners and so forth who
maintained altars in the parish.

497
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:19,041
Church maintained candles on those alters
had patron saints and owed duties to

498
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,233
one another.

499
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,770
They prayed for one another.

500
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,450
They looked after one another.

501
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,440
It was also a period which saw a flowering
of elaborate ritual and festive life.

502
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:35,870
A great many of the traditional seasonal
festivals which are recorded in early

503
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:41,460
16th century England had actually
emerged in the course of this relatively

504
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:42,240
prosperous,

505
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,740
late medieval period.

506
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,010
If this kind of aspect of traditional
popular culture interests you,

507
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:49,980
there's a wonderful book on
the subject by Ronald Hutton,

508
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:50,460
uh,

509
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,100
called the rise and fall of merry England,

510
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,770
which he goes into a great deal
of detail on these matters.

511
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,330
So whatever the framework,

512
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:04,770
whether we're talking about the manner
or the parish or just living close to one

513
00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:09,771
another neighborhood found expression
and it found expression also of course in

514
00:28:10,621 --> 00:28:13,980
persistent face to face daily contact.

515
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,000
The neighborhood was a primary group.

516
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,240
People knew each other exceedingly well.

517
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,890
They knew one another's
business exceedingly well as
it was often revealed when

518
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:30,891
they were called upon to give evidence
in court how cells interpenetrated one

519
00:28:31,351 --> 00:28:33,150
another in all kinds of ways,

520
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,770
assisting one another,

521
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,330
borrowing from one another,

522
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,530
lending to one another,

523
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,770
and a host of small
scaled buying and selling.

524
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:45,600
You get constant glimpses
of these interactions in
the records that survive to

525
00:28:45,601 --> 00:28:46,000
us.

526
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,833
Uh,

527
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,880
one I recently saw,

528
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:48,714
for example,

529
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,380
uh,

530
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,060
involved a woman who described how on one
day she went around to her neighbor to

531
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:58,140
borrow a bowl of flour because she'd run
out and couldn't get any at the mill.

532
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,891
On another day,

533
00:28:58,891 --> 00:29:03,720
she went round to see her neighbor to
get some burning coals from her fire so

534
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:06,060
that she could start her
own fire more easily.

535
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,860
This kind of constant little
small change of daily interaction.

536
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,073
Um,

537
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,010
we know about these things because,

538
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:14,730
um,

539
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,470
she happened to notice on her visits
that her neighbor was a little over

540
00:29:18,471 --> 00:29:19,860
friendly with her lodger,

541
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,940
which resulted in an adultery case in the
church courts and these little details

542
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:27,210
of their relationship both
positive and negative,

543
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:27,720
uh,

544
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:27,871
uh,

545
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:28,704
revealed.

546
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:34,310
You find neighbors involved in
arbitrating corals in childminding,

547
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,800
in visiting one another when
sick in giving one another
advice in gossiping with

548
00:29:39,901 --> 00:29:42,730
one another in reproving one another.

549
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,470
It's all well documented,

550
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,370
involved in what another one
another's business to an extent,

551
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:53,260
which would be very unfamiliar today.

552
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:59,580
It all adds up to a tangled web
of interpersonal obligation.

553
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:01,300
Uh,

554
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,290
Christopher Dyer,

555
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,730
who has written a wonderful book about
part of the West Midlands over here on

556
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:07,870
the border with whales,

557
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:14,250
did one study of the wheels of 15 families
in a village in that region between

558
00:30:15,251 --> 00:30:15,641
15,

559
00:30:15,641 --> 00:30:17,140
13 and 1540.

560
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,170
He found that if the 15 families,

561
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,440
some of them were linked to as many as
seven of the others buy ties of debt and

562
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:28,660
credit of God,

563
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,490
parenthood of witnessing,

564
00:30:30,491 --> 00:30:34,390
one of those wills of leaving
things to one another in their wills

565
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,170
all adding up as he describes
it to a close web of friendship,

566
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:44,380
of mutual regard and a
shared responsibility.

567
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,600
And those are just the relationships which
happen to have left recorded evidence

568
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,950
for historians to see.

569
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:52,781
Well,

570
00:30:52,781 --> 00:30:57,781
drawing on these ties could be
crucial at times of particular need.

571
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,680
This is a period which lacks,

572
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:03,700
as I've said before,

573
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,760
any form of life insurance or other forms
of insurance neighbors could provide a

574
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:11,680
kind of social insurance.

575
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,960
You find them backing one another up.

576
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:14,861
For example,

577
00:31:14,861 --> 00:31:16,270
when a couple of where to be married,

578
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,790
it was common for the
neighborhood to gather,

579
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:22,750
to hold a bride Ale Ale would be brewed,

580
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,070
people would come along,

581
00:31:24,071 --> 00:31:28,090
they would pay for the AOL and the
proceeds would be given to the new couple.

582
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,780
You also get help ales
when someone was in need.

583
00:31:31,781 --> 00:31:32,614
And another way,

584
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:33,370
uh,

585
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:35,530
one diary from the late 16th century,

586
00:31:35,531 --> 00:31:36,364
for example,

587
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:41,430
describes how a help Ale was organized
for a widow whose cow had died to provide

588
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:43,450
her with a new animal,

589
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,120
which was important to have family economy

590
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,170
because these tides could
be so supportive at best.

591
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,810
There was a strong imperative amongst
people to maintain what they described as

592
00:31:58,811 --> 00:32:03,670
their credit to maintain their credit
in the neighborhood by which they meant

593
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,370
their reputation in general,

594
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,710
their reputation for reliability,

595
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,210
for honesty,

596
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,620
for good conduct.

597
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,150
It involves much more than simply a sort
of credit rating in a financial sense.

598
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,460
As we're familiar with it today.

599
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,213
It was a form,

600
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,910
as I've said,

601
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:26,910
of social insurance in an insecure
world and the price of good credit,

602
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,380
the price of that element
of security was conformity,

603
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,460
conformity to the standards
of the neighborhood.

604
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,383
So

605
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,720
ties of neighborhood was something
which one could also extend from the

606
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:51,860
countryside into urban communities
and the town of folks done,

607
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:54,530
which is down here on
the south coast in Kent,

608
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,640
for example,

609
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,570
one young woman who had been recently
married and was coming to the town with

610
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:00,860
her husband for the first time,

611
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,890
found that in the street
where they were going to live,

612
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,650
the neighbors were
gathered when she arrived,

613
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:10,340
they called out where is she that
would be our neighbor and drank to her.

614
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,860
They had a barrel of
beer ready to welcome.

615
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,000
It matters in towns too often
at the level of the street,

616
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,930
but Tom's also had
distinctive institutions,

617
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:22,550
which you wouldn't find
in the countryside.

618
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:29,830
Most towns had a very strong sense of
identity as autonomous self governing

619
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,263
communities,

620
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,380
especially those of them which
actually had a charter from the king,

621
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,320
which laid down their rights of self,

622
00:33:38,321 --> 00:33:39,154
government,

623
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,520
those which are chartered,

624
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,413
Boris,

625
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:46,910
the core members of these communities
where the citizens who held the freedom of

626
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:51,911
the city and as free men of the city
were enabled to participate in civic

627
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:55,064
government.

628
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,270
So in the city of York,

629
00:33:56,271 --> 00:33:57,104
for example,

630
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,220
up here in the north,

631
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:03,610
about half the male household heads of
the city had the status of Freeman and we

632
00:34:04,201 --> 00:34:08,030
were able to participate in the city's
political institutions in the city of

633
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,620
[inaudible] here in the east.

634
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,530
It was about a third of
the male household heads

635
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,290
citizenship.

636
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:20,480
What's usually contingent on having
served an apprenticeship in a craft or

637
00:34:20,481 --> 00:34:21,314
trade,

638
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:24,650
having served it to its end,

639
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,370
become a member of a
craft fellowship or guilt,

640
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,600
and consequently being admitted to the
full freedom of the city and the great

641
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:39,800
men in the political life of the cities
where usually the chief officers of

642
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:42,080
those craft fellowships or guilt,

643
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,850
especially the most powerful ones,

644
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:49,100
guilds varied the number.

645
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:49,760
Um,

646
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,040
the city of York had 64.

647
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,050
They're much smaller.

648
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:56,870
City of Carlisle over here in
the northwest only had eight.

649
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,950
It all depended on the size and
complexity of the urban economy,

650
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,440
but their functions were
essentially the same.

651
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:07,130
They regulated particular trades,

652
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:10,670
they govern the taking on of apprentices.

653
00:35:10,671 --> 00:35:13,010
How many apprentices could
be admitted to the trade.

654
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,630
They tried to keep nonmembers of the
guild out of practicing the trade.

655
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,240
Such people were usually
described as foreigners.

656
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:25,190
Those were not members of the guild and
we're trying to get in on its particular

657
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:26,024
activity.

658
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,210
They control the business
practices of masters.

659
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:33,380
They laid down the rules for good business
practice and they controlled labor

660
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:34,870
relations and labors,

661
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:35,670
but uh,

662
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,790
and wages between masters and
those who worked for them.

663
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:40,981
But in addition,

664
00:35:40,981 --> 00:35:44,550
the guild's had a host of
social and religious functions.

665
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,310
Members of the guild,

666
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:51,330
we're under obligation to relieve other
members of the guild who fell sick.

667
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,820
They provided them with medical care.

668
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:59,190
They were under obligation
to leave members of the
guild who became unemployed.

669
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:05,250
They provided for widows and orphans from
charitable funds that they maintained.

670
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:11,270
It was obligatory for members of the
guild to attend one another's funerals and

671
00:36:11,761 --> 00:36:12,594
weddings.

672
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:18,300
They were obliged also to pray for the
souls of dead brothers and sisters of the

673
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:23,301
guild and they were obliged to attend
annual feastings and drinkings at which

674
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:29,390
members of the guild would assemble
to celebrate their common fraternity.

675
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:35,790
All of this fostered a very strong
sense of fraternity or brotherhood.

676
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,960
They constantly refer to one another
as brothers and sisters of the guild,

677
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:44,250
the sisters being the wives and
daughters of members of the guild,

678
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,350
and it created a strong sense of identity
both within a particular sector of

679
00:36:49,351 --> 00:36:54,351
urban economies and in the citizen body
as a whole and in citizen body as a

680
00:36:54,601 --> 00:36:54,841
whole.

681
00:36:54,841 --> 00:36:59,340
It would be periodically displayed in
processions on important feast days in

682
00:36:59,341 --> 00:37:02,490
which the members of the
guild arrayed in their livers.

683
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:07,730
The colors of their guilt gowns in
particular colors would parade in order

684
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,880
generally in order with their PR of their
precedents and importance within the

685
00:37:11,881 --> 00:37:12,714
city.

686
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:16,890
When Queen Elizabeth the first made her
first entry into the city of London in

687
00:37:16,891 --> 00:37:18,450
1559 for example,

688
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:23,690
the streets were lined by the city guilds
or in their liver is to greet the new

689
00:37:23,821 --> 00:37:24,654
queen.

690
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:28,643
Finally,

691
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,890
the fraternity and the Brotherhood,

692
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:36,891
which was much stressed by the guilds
and the friendship which was fostered

693
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,450
amongst neighbors ideally

694
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,750
could both be just described as being
extensions into social relations of the

695
00:37:45,751 --> 00:37:47,640
idiom of kinship.

696
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:54,180
Friend was often used in a sense
we use it a personal friend,

697
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,060
but it also in the 16th
century meant a relative.

698
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:58,231
Uh,

699
00:37:58,231 --> 00:38:00,570
it's still used in that
sense in parts of Ireland.

700
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:05,160
Today a friend was commonly a cousin
and brother in law and so forth.

701
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:12,530
Brotherhood and fraternity obviously
involve comparison to a bond of kinship

702
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,590
when one turns to actual kinship,

703
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,680
be it by birth or be it by marriage.

704
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:23,220
That was of course another bond
that held together local society,

705
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:28,470
the Gentry of the countryside where
much linked together within particular

706
00:38:28,471 --> 00:38:29,304
counties,

707
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:29,521
uh,

708
00:38:29,521 --> 00:38:31,160
by intermarriage.

709
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,433
Um,

710
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:37,580
a close social network can often be
uncovered amongst gentry families who not

711
00:38:39,071 --> 00:38:41,500
only lived within easy
reach of one another,

712
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:44,600
but also sometimes formed
through their marriage alliances,

713
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:47,950
political alignments within
the politics of their counties.

714
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:51,580
And you get the same sort of
thing going on in the cities too,

715
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,990
especially amongst the elite of
the cities in the city of Coventry,

716
00:38:55,991 --> 00:39:00,550
which is the greatest city of the
Midlands at this time in Coventry,

717
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,570
uh,

718
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:06,310
there were 24 men who served the
sheriff of the city between 15,

719
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:08,470
17 and 1547.

720
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,810
On closer examination.

721
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:13,660
It turns out the six of
them were either fathers,

722
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:17,050
sons or brothers of others
who served a sheriff.

723
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:22,500
Nine of them were interlinked by
marriage into one another's families and

724
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:25,930
another four were
interlinked buy ties of God.

725
00:39:25,931 --> 00:39:26,764
Parenthood.

726
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,120
They'd acted as godparents one another's
children establishing a bond of a

727
00:39:31,121 --> 00:39:32,590
fictive kinship.

728
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,680
And more generally,

729
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,950
as you know from the
reading for this week,

730
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:43,570
the extent to which people in any given
settlement were actually related to one

731
00:39:43,571 --> 00:39:44,310
another.

732
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:44,530
Uh,

733
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,363
was limited.

734
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,930
People moved around a good deal
more than used to be thought.

735
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,900
In most rural communities,

736
00:39:52,901 --> 00:39:56,350
one finds little knots of
people related to one another,

737
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:00,910
but within the context of a larger
neighborhood of unrelated people,

738
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,480
and beyond that there would
be a scattering of kin
over a significantly larger

739
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:07,564
area.

740
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:09,910
Nevertheless,

741
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:13,960
if it wasn't the case that most village
communities were heavily interrelated,

742
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,650
those close kin scattered around over
what can be described as a social area

743
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,720
around a particular settlement undoubtedly
possessed quite a strong sense of

744
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,220
obligation to assist one another

745
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,820
and across even larger areas.

746
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:36,060
Once kin could form a broad resource
of people who could be called upon with

747
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:39,130
some expectation of a positive response.

748
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,290
If you hope to apprentice one of your
sons when nearby city for example,

749
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,640
one of the best ways of doing that was
to activate kid and living there who

750
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:52,540
could help to prepare the way by finding
a master to whom the boy could be

751
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:57,070
apprenticed can also help one another in
finding suitable marriage partners and

752
00:40:57,071 --> 00:40:57,904
so forth.

753
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,910
So ship

754
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:07,770
was also one of the bonds which tied
together social areas into communities.

755
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:14,080
To give just a small petty example of
the way in which kinship could come,

756
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:14,923
could function.

757
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:20,370
We have the record from the 1550s of no
lady called Christian Hatton in her old

758
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:24,940
age when she was unable to
take care of herself fully,

759
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:30,450
she was cared for intern by kinsmen who
lived in a number of settlements within

760
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,160
walking distance of one another.

761
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,110
They shared the responsibility
and periodically she walked
between the different

762
00:41:39,111 --> 00:41:43,820
households where she was going to live
for a few months at a time taking with

763
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:45,440
her her two cows.

764
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:46,460
She had two cats,

765
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,710
they were called Brownie

766
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:55,270
and Phil Pail Pale was
presumably a very good milker.

767
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:01,660
W We know about these arrangements
about Christian happen and her two cows

768
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,950
because after her death,

769
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:08,300
the relatives who had been helping her
fell out over who was going to get the

770
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:09,134
cows.

771
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,910
And so by this little
accident of human frailty,

772
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,350
a Brownie and filled pale have
entered the pages of history.

773
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,213
So,

774
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,263
uh,

775
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,620
let's pull all this together.

776
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:28,460
It's been said that in late
medieval and early modern society,

777
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:32,900
the most fundamental of all bonds
was that of mutual obligation.

778
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,510
That's what I've been talking about.

779
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:39,860
Obviously we've been looking at
the realities of those bonds,

780
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,870
the institutions and the relationships
that I've been surveying provided the

781
00:42:44,871 --> 00:42:49,670
basic coordinates of people's
identities beyond the household.

782
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:54,440
They bound them together into
networks of relationships,

783
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:56,300
in guilds,

784
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,171
in manners,

785
00:42:57,171 --> 00:42:59,180
amongst neighbors amongst kinsmen,

786
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,340
which provided those
coordinates of identity.

787
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:11,470
Those ties were mostly local and
they gave a strong flavor of local

788
00:43:12,051 --> 00:43:16,160
particularity to the society
and the culture of the time,

789
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,950
a particularity of place,

790
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,010
a particularity of custom in that place,

791
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:24,350
a particularity of known faces.

792
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:29,410
And those with whom you regularly
interacted a particularity of assumptions

793
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:34,960
about shared values and proper
behavior in such a context.

794
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:41,200
People's everyday dealings were very
closely bound up with these direct face to

795
00:43:42,351 --> 00:43:44,690
face personal relationships.

796
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:45,890
They were rarely anonymous.

797
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:47,990
Indeed.

798
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:48,410
Uh,

799
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:53,410
they can be said to have taken on a
very strong moral character implicitly.

800
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:59,120
Sometimes explicitly people were
expected to meet their obligations.

801
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:02,900
They would enjoy to live in
charity with one another.

802
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:05,690
They were reproved if
they failed to do so.

803
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:06,801
In many ways,

804
00:44:06,801 --> 00:44:11,801
it's a very attractive ideal and has
some features which clearly bear out some

805
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,030
of the assumptions of the
sociological notions of community.

806
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,810
But one should also never forget that.

807
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,030
It could also be very demanding,

808
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,250
very restrictive,

809
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,480
very excluding as well as including,

810
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,910
and it was something which certainly
couldn't be taken for granted.

811
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,270
Community insofar as it existed,

812
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:39,180
was always threatened
with potential conflict.

813
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,130
It had to be worked at.

814
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,820
It has been described as being a form of
constantly negotiated community amongst

815
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,370
a set of well known people.

816
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:52,351
Well,

817
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,720
that's a very important
aspect of the world.

818
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,100
I'm trying to introduce to you.

819
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:00,480
We should certainly never
sentimentalize it if it is attractive.

820
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:03,240
In some ways it could be very demanding,

821
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,650
very restrictive.

822
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,730
It wasn't an idyllic premodern world.

823
00:45:08,731 --> 00:45:10,020
There was plenty of conflict.

824
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,460
There was personal rivalry,

825
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,130
and of course there were
differences of power,

826
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,531
but at the same time,

827
00:45:16,531 --> 00:45:20,940
it was a world that gave priority to the
needs of these collectivities as well

828
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:23,190
as to those of individual households.

829
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:28,140
And the restraining bonds
of these interpersonal
obligations could have a very

830
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:33,141
powerful influence on how people
conducted themselves and could have a very

831
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:38,451
powerful influence on how they understood
and perceived and responded to various

832
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:44,580
of the changes which were to come in the
course of the 16th and 17th centuries.

833
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:46,830
Okay,

834
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:47,663
I'll leave it there.

835
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:52,670
And next time I'll go on to look at urban
society more fully and the network of

836
00:45:53,941 --> 00:45:56,760
connections which bound
together the kingdom as a whole.
