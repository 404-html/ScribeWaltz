1
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:02,041
Right.
Well,

2
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:06,360
today I wanted to talk about changes
in education and the growth of popular

3
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:10,170
literacy in the 16th and
early 17th centuries. Uh,

4
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:15,000
one of the most important sets of changes
which were going on in the reign of

5
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:19,560
Elizabeth and the under the
early Stuart's. Okay. To
begin with a little context,

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,340
uh, looking back at the
late medieval period, uh,

7
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,410
it's been said of late medieval England
that at that time all education was

8
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:34,311
technical and vocational directed to
some particular occupation or function.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,570
And the formal schooling that we tend to
think of when we use the term education

10
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,190
was really only part of that.
Uh,

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,150
if one thinks of education more broadly
in terms of the transmission of a

12
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,570
culture and it's skills
and values and so on,

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,880
then of course that was a much larger
thing than simply formal schooling.

14
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,860
And it involved not only schools
but the church, the household,

15
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,700
many ways in which people were
instructed for their roles in life.

16
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,750
So one can't say that medieval England
was in any way an uneducated society.

17
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,960
It was educated insofar as it
needed certain kinds of training.

18
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,740
But it was a relatively
unschooled society.

19
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,210
Very few children attended
any kind of formal school,

20
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,470
probably less than 10%
in the late 15th century.

21
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,260
Formal schooling was reserved then
for specific occupations at that time,

22
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,450
clergyman,
those who are going to be lawyers,

23
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,860
some merchants who might need skills
of reading and writing or even foreign

24
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:53,070
languages, um, some craftsman and so on.

25
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,870
It was certainly not simply a clerical
monopoly as sometimes people think.

26
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,423
Nonetheless,

27
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,820
it was restricted in its scope and
tailored to quite specific occupational

28
00:02:05,911 --> 00:02:06,744
needs.

29
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:11,070
Now at the turn of the 16th century,

30
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:16,071
that situation began to change and by the
late 16th century it was changing very

31
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:21,950
rapidly and new enthusiasm emerged in
this period for formal schooling at all

32
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:26,400
levels. Uh, why should that be so?

33
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,830
Well that seemed to have been two main
cultural influences on that development

34
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,570
affecting different parts of society.
First of all,

35
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:41,520
there was the influence of renaissance
humanism affecting mainly the social

36
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:45,960
elite. Um, when we speak of
humanism in the 16th century,

37
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:50,961
we mean not the a rationalist secular
system of morality that one thinks of

38
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:55,190
today when using that term,
rather,

39
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:59,620
the term is used to describe what
people at the time referred to as new

40
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,663
learning,

41
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,080
the new learning which had emerged in
the 15th century and was sweeping all

42
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:07,870
before it in the early 16th century,

43
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,990
championed by scholars like Erasmus of
Rotterdam or in England, John College,

44
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:16,300
the Dean of St Paul's
Cathedral or Sir Thomas Moore

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,510
in educational terms,

46
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:24,570
humanism essentially involved
the study of ancient languages,

47
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,460
Latin, certainly increasingly
Greek, occasionally also Hebrew

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,250
and the philosophy,

49
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,880
the literature and the history produced
by the writers of classical antiquity.

50
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:45,270
So it's a process of recovering more
fully the works of classical antiquity and

51
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:47,920
making them more available
to a larger audience.

52
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,410
And all of this was for a purpose.

53
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,760
It was believed by humanist scholars
that classical education combined with

54
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:58,150
Christian morality,

55
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,150
morality would be a way of reviving virtue
in public life and creating order and

56
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:10,531
harmony in the Commonwealth would be a
way of training virtuous princes and util

57
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,550
subjects. That was essentially
the humanist ideal. In a way.

58
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:20,230
They were trying to get back to the
notion of an educated aristocracy,

59
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:23,490
which had certainly been the
case in the Roman Empire. Um,

60
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,150
the aristocracy of late medieval England
of course, was largely a military one,

61
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,760
but they wanted them to be scholars too,

62
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,260
just as the great figures of
classical antiquity had been.

63
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,170
And this was to prove up
profoundly influential ideal.

64
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:46,090
It was transmitted to the English league,
probably via the court

65
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,730
and also by a number of influential books,
which were widely read amongst them.

66
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,530
One of them was a translation of an
Italian Work Castiglioni his book,

67
00:04:56,531 --> 00:05:01,531
the court here originally written in the
1520s and published in England in 1561.

68
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,000
Uh, another, these titles
are on your handout.

69
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,520
Another was a book by Sir Thomas Elliot,

70
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:14,790
who was a member of Henry the eighth
secretary at a in 1537 he published a book

71
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,280
called the governor,
the book named the governor,

72
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:23,590
which proved to be a great popularizer
of humanist educational ideals.

73
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,770
A Elliot, for example, laid down
a model of the ideal education,

74
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,320
which suggested the children should
be taught Latin by the age of seven,

75
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,080
between seven and 14,

76
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,110
they would read Latin classics and
begin to learn Greek between 14 and 17.

77
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,290
They would be trained in
logic, in rhetoric, in history,

78
00:05:47,291 --> 00:05:51,220
and in poetry between 17 and 21,

79
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:55,660
they would move on to philosophy and
ethics, particularly the works of Plato,

80
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:59,520
which were particularly valued by
the humanists. And at the age of 21,

81
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,010
they would begin studying law and
meanwhile they would also have physical

82
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:06,830
training,
Horseman Ship Sports,

83
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,930
the military arts and dancing.
Dancing was considered very important.

84
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:15,500
It taught grace and poise and they
considered that to be an important

85
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,620
accomplishment. Uh, well this is a,

86
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:20,630
a demanding model of education,

87
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,990
which seems ridiculously
demanding these days to think.

88
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:27,410
So until I first read the Yale
distributional requirements.

89
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,900
So in a sense, we are in the
tradition. The third work,

90
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:36,480
which was very influential, was
written by Roger, asked them, uh,

91
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,260
another man close to the court in 1570.

92
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,340
It was in fact inspired by a dinner
table conversation about education,

93
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:48,170
which you had with William
sessile, Elizabeth's principal
secretary, and ask him,

94
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:53,260
put it down in writing in the schoolmaster
published in 1570 he described it as

95
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:59,261
being specially purposed for the private
bringing up of youth in gentleman's and

96
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,920
nobleman houses focusing on classical
learning and sound religion.

97
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,111
Okay,

98
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:11,090
so renaissance humanism was one model
aimed in particular at the social elite.

99
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,550
A second cultural influence of great
importance was of course the Protestant

100
00:07:16,551 --> 00:07:17,384
reformation.

101
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,640
The notion that learning
and sound religion should
go together was present from

102
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,000
the beginning of course,

103
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,600
but the triumph of Protestantism in the
reformation gave an even greater edge to

104
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:35,090
the advocacy of education for two reasons.

105
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,950
First of all,

106
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,460
they wanted to educate the clergy better
to provide a better educated clergy who

107
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:46,820
would be not only administrators
at the sacraments,

108
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,010
but at teaching pastorate,

109
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:54,550
theologically aware preachers
and catechized as educators
of the people in the

110
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,190
new church.
Secondly,

111
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,700
they also believed that education was a
vital aid to the salvation of the common

112
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:05,174
people.

113
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,530
Protestantism after all was very
much a religion of the book.

114
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,900
And in their view,

115
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,380
full appreciation of God's will require
the ability to read it in the scriptures

116
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,580
or ideally,

117
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,390
hence there was an emphasis on schooling
and on basic literacy for essentially

118
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:27,950
religious purposes.

119
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:33,730
And that in a sense extends the
educational drive of the period beyond the

120
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:38,150
social elite to the population at large.

121
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:43,130
This is an educational ideal of
much broader social relevance.

122
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:51,320
So the educational imperative
then involved too ideological
or cultural elements,

123
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,260
humanist ideals of virtuous rulers,

124
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,030
Protestant ideals of a godly pastorate,

125
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,870
and a godly people of
more universal relevance.

126
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,350
Both promoted formal education as a
means of social and cultural change.

127
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,540
And that's an altogether new significance
for the institutions of schooling.

128
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:17,550
They envisage social and cultural
change as a result. And meanwhile,

129
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:20,430
of course,
as background to all of this,

130
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,520
there was the process of
head of economic expansion,

131
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,960
which I've already described,

132
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:30,530
enhancing in various ways the desirability
of basic schooling for various

133
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:35,490
commercial purposes.
So what was the response?

134
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:43,110
One response was the
gradual transformation of
the education of the social

135
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:46,200
elite, the upper gentry in
particular. And the aristocracy,

136
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:52,910
the 16th century essentially saw the
transition from a pattern of people being

137
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:58,080
educated in great noble households
by tutors or household chaplains

138
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,970
to an ideal in which people
first of all attended schools,

139
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,710
grammar schools in particular,

140
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:10,250
and then moved on to the
universities of Oxford and Cambridge,

141
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,970
the ancient universities,

142
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,160
and then sometimes also to
the inns of court in London,

143
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,730
which were very much like
Oxford or Cambridge colleges,

144
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:22,890
but devoted to the study of the law.

145
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,340
Sometimes referred to as
England's third university.

146
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,490
Though they were essentially a
separate set of institutions.

147
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,470
Well,

148
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:36,470
the universities and the Inns of court
got this role in elite education pretty

149
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:39,720
much by default

150
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:47,140
in the 1530s various humanist advisers
on education still thought of the

151
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:52,200
universities. There's primarily
a place for training clergyman.

152
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,320
They wanted the foundation of a
new academy for the social elite,

153
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,350
which should ideally be
located near the capitol,

154
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,160
but such schemes came to nothing.

155
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,530
And by the mid 16th century
members of the social elite,

156
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,800
we'll be getting to follow earlier
precedents of some of their number by

157
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:18,801
attending the universities and sometimes
going on to the inns of court by the

158
00:11:20,641 --> 00:11:21,630
late 16th century.

159
00:11:21,631 --> 00:11:25,890
That trickle of gentlemen and noblemen
into the universities and the INS had

160
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:29,580
become a stream and soon it
was something of a flood.

161
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,200
Many of the buildings in
Oxford and Cambridge colleges,

162
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,400
which survived to this day,

163
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:40,401
we actually erected at this time to
expand the provision for these larger

164
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:45,660
numbers of students and indeed a number
of new colleges were founded in this

165
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:47,130
period for the same reason.

166
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,900
There was a massive expansion in
the numbers of students at both the

167
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:56,380
universities and the ends. In
fact, by the early 17th century,

168
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,790
the numbers of students in
these institutions was at
the highest that it was to

169
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:05,770
be again before the 19th century faded
a little in the late 17th and 18th

170
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:08,530
centuries and then rose again later on.

171
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,600
All of this meant a very significant
change in the social composition of Oxford

172
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:19,390
and Cambridge colleges.
And if you look at your handout,

173
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:23,770
the set of tables that are there,
you'll see in table one,

174
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:28,120
the social competition of a
number of Cambridge colleges.

175
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:31,820
These are the undergraduates
and you'll see that, um,

176
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:38,070
by the late 16th and 17th centuries to
which these figures refer the College

177
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,560
Emmanuel College had 63% of
its students of gentry birth.

178
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,820
Kings college had 58% of gentry birth
and Jesus and Saint John's just less than

179
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,170
50%.

180
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,720
This was the general trend and it was
pretty much the same story at Oxford.

181
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,001
Well,

182
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:06,001
the university has had to
adapt to educating these
new types of students and a

183
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:08,800
new pattern sooner emerged.

184
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,130
Many of these gentry students,
um,

185
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,940
lived in their colleges as what
were known as fellow commoners.

186
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,370
They ate with the master and fellows
of the college on the high table rather

187
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:25,000
than down in the body of the
hall with more Plebeian students.

188
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,530
They were also very rarely involved
in actually taking a degree.

189
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Most of them pursued that
studies privately with
tutors who were appointed by

190
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:40,330
their parents within particular
colleges to oversee their education,

191
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,370
to look after their moral welfare.

192
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,270
And they were paid directly
by the parents to do this.

193
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,770
It's the origins of the Oxford and
Cambridge tutorial system at this time.

194
00:13:50,771 --> 00:13:55,000
In fact, many of these students
even slept in their tutors rooms.

195
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,840
There would be a number of little
trickle beds they were called.

196
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,530
They could be pushed in to the,

197
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:05,380
to the wall and pulled out at night where
these students would sleep with their

198
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:07,990
master of their tutor
in his room next door

199
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,570
instead of the usual formal
course of the university,

200
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:17,830
which included rhetoric and logic and
philosophy leading to the bachelor's

201
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:22,110
degree tutors usually devised
for their students. Um,

202
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:27,210
more modern courses. They included
subjects like history, literature,

203
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,870
a geography,
modern divinity and modern philosophy.

204
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,840
Um, some of them prepared special
reading lists for their students. Uh,

205
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,510
some of them even prepared for their
students. Digests of key quotations,

206
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,380
sort of 16th century
handouts. You could say, um,

207
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,370
key quotes from the classics that you
could drop into your conversation and they

208
00:14:48,371 --> 00:14:52,130
would help their students
memorize in that way.

209
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:58,760
Um, we have an account of education at
Cambridge in the early 17th century from a

210
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:03,110
student called Simmons dues.
Uh, who kept a diary. Um,

211
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:07,870
his name is there, uh, on your,
on your handout a between 16,

212
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,040
17 and 16,

213
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:13,760
19 Simmons Jews was a student at
St John's College in Cambridge.

214
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,740
And there we learn,

215
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:20,770
he studied logic and ethics and moral
philosophy and history with his tutor,

216
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,170
Richard Holdsworth,
who was a well known puritan divine.

217
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:28,850
He also went to a few of the university
lectures, though not terribly many.

218
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,010
He practiced his letter style
in English and in Latin.

219
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:37,160
It was very important to
learn to write a letter. Well,

220
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,470
he went to sermons in the churches of
the city and he discussed modern theology

221
00:15:42,471 --> 00:15:46,720
with his tutor and he kept the
theological commonplace book. Um,

222
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,760
he was being trained in Calvinist theology
and he rounded the whole thing off

223
00:15:52,341 --> 00:15:57,341
with what he described as
my often conversing with
learned men of other colleges

224
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,520
and the prime young students of mine own.

225
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,270
Now all of this was in accordance with
the desires of gentry parents to have an

226
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:13,271
education which was suitable for
learners and polished gentleman of the

227
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:19,100
Renaissance Ideal Richard Holdsworth
with as tutor put it well, uh,

228
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:21,890
in a letter describing
one of his students,

229
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:25,580
he was recruiting someone
else to tutor the boy. Uh,

230
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:30,610
and he described the boys'
fathers desires as follows.

231
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,480
His father means not to have
him a scholar by profession,

232
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:41,140
but only to be seasoned with the
varnish of learning and piety.

233
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:44,330
And that pretty much sums
up what they were aiming at.

234
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,400
His father means him not to have him
a scholar by profession, God forbid,

235
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,180
but only to be seasoned with the
varnish of learning and piety.

236
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:02,770
The inns of court down in London adapted
far less to the needs of new students.

237
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,520
Um, students got no special help.
There was no tutorial system.

238
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,560
They simply had to read law books to
attend the courts to see how it was done,

239
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,920
to attend formal exercises in the
ends where they would plead cases,

240
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:21,320
practice sort of mock hearings.

241
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,860
English common law at this time was
considered quite appallingly difficult.

242
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,230
It hadn't really been systematized at all.

243
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,550
It's been described by one
legal historian as a formless,

244
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,640
confused jumble of undigested particulars
successfully resisting all efforts at

245
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:46,550
simplification or systematic statement.
You just had to learn it all.

246
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:52,290
Students who tried do so
seriously found it quite awful.

247
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,251
In fact,

248
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:56,940
Simmons Jews who went down for a further
two years at the ends of court after he

249
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:58,020
finished at Cambridge,

250
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,330
described as two years at the ends of
court as amongst the unhappiest days of my

251
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:07,290
life. Those are you planning
legal careers. Bear this in mind.

252
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,350
I'm the historian of the Inns of court.

253
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:15,351
Wilford pressed reckons that the average
gentleman attending the ins probably

254
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:19,080
didn't learn all that much of the law.

255
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,060
Nevertheless,

256
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:25,410
the ends were considered very important
as sort of finishing schools in a sense

257
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,000
centers for all kinds of
informal learning. After all,

258
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:31,410
they were located in London,

259
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,980
just in between the city of London and
the royal capital of Westminster where

260
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:39,981
the courts met and they expose students
to all the things which were available

261
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:43,830
in the metropolis.
They attended plays.

262
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,890
They went to sermons at
the churches of the city.

263
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,580
They hung out in the taverns and so forth.
Um,

264
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,170
one student who came from Dorset
down in the southwest, uh,

265
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,940
a man with the wonderful
name William Freak, uh,

266
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:04,020
who attended the, at the ends
of court in the early 1620s, um,

267
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,100
has left behind,
uh,

268
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,110
a list of the books he bought during
his years in London at the ends.

269
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:14,820
And it's very interesting. He, um,
he bought many religious works,

270
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:19,560
many devotional books, um, but he
also bought books on physionomy,

271
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,660
on Arithmetic, uh, on travel.
He bought history books.

272
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,220
Uh, he bought popular romances
and he was interested in drama.

273
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:32,220
He owned a copy,
an early copy of Shakespeare's Othello,

274
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,610
but amongst all the books he
bought while he was in London,

275
00:19:35,611 --> 00:19:39,240
he only bought one law book.
And a significantly,

276
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:42,120
it was a classic little turn on 10 years.

277
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:45,630
The classic outline of land tenure law,

278
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,470
which would very much the kind of thing
a gentleman like William Freak would

279
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:53,010
need to know when he returned
to his family's are states.

280
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:01,230
Now, of course not all of the gentry
did all of this, but nonetheless,

281
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:03,000
many of them did some of it.

282
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,480
And it led to a significant transformation
of the educational experience of the

283
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:14,310
social elite. Um, to give
some figures on that,

284
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,950
in 1563

285
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,600
of the members of parliament in that year,

286
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,690
only 26% had attended
university by 1540 16,

287
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:32,430
40 to 50% at 10 attended university.

288
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:33,830
Uh,

289
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,830
or even better if one looks
at the justices of the peace
serving in six counties

290
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:45,920
in 1562 only 5% of them had attended
a university by 1636 in the same six

291
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:51,010
counties,
it was 62%.

292
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,940
So a real transformation in
the educational experience
of these vital members of

293
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:04,060
the political nation.
Right.

294
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:04,181
Well,

295
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:09,181
a second consequence of these changes
was a transformation in the educational

296
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:12,160
level of the English clergy.

297
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,490
Don't forget that the university still
remained the major centers for training

298
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,473
clergyman.

299
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,860
Around 50% of university students were
still nonmembers of the gentry and most

300
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:31,210
of them actually came from clerical
families or so called Plebeian.

301
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,240
Families are in non gentlemen and
frequently they were intending clerical

302
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,403
careers.

303
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,900
They tended to do the full scale
traditional university course leading to a

304
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:47,110
bachelor's degree and
perhaps to a master's degree

305
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,430
and their numbers were rising also.

306
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,890
And the rising numbers of these
clerical recruits produced a general

307
00:21:56,891 --> 00:22:01,891
transformation in the educational levels
of the parish clergy by the 1630s after

308
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:08,221
two generations of this largely graduate
clergy was established in much of

309
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,580
England. There are some
figures on your, uh,

310
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:17,581
on your handout from the diocese of
Wooster large diocese in the West Midlands

311
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:23,340
in the diocese of Wooster in 1580 only
23% of the clergy were graduates by 1640.

312
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,720
It was 84% and that was pretty much the
same story as could be found in other

313
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:33,550
diocese at this time.

314
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,670
Yeah.

315
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:40,170
So the second effect is the transformation
of the educational level of the

316
00:22:40,171 --> 00:22:41,004
clergy.

317
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,610
A third response was the
general proliferation of
schooling opportunities for

318
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,284
the common people.

319
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,590
Okay.

320
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:56,540
The 16th and early 17th centuries
where a great age of school foundation,

321
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:00,230
there were many,
many new foundations,

322
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,350
notable amongst them where the
founding of endowed grammar schools,

323
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:10,750
many of the principals, schools, uh,

324
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,910
in English cities carry
the name King Edward,

325
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:18,911
the sixth school or some other name
linking them to this period of major

326
00:23:21,231 --> 00:23:24,170
educational expansion and
founding of grammar schools.

327
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:26,330
In the mid to late 16th century,

328
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,910
there were often founded with
money donated by merchants,

329
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,860
by leading members of the clergy,

330
00:23:33,861 --> 00:23:37,040
by members of the gentry
from particular areas.

331
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:42,430
And the motivation was often a
mixture of religious seal and regional

332
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,083
patriotism.

333
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:49,870
For in the county of Lancashire up
up in the northwest here in 1480,

334
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,660
there were only three endowed schools.
By 1540,

335
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,200
they were 12 by 1600.
There were 28.

336
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,330
By 1640, there were 50 endowed
grammar schools. Indeed by that date,

337
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,130
every major town and some,
uh,

338
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,920
relatively insignificant ones in
that county had a grammar school.

339
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:18,320
Two thirds of the money that was donated
for School Foundation in Lancashire

340
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:19,760
came from London,

341
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:25,420
came from merchants and lawyers and
others of Lancashire origin who usually at

342
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:31,070
that death left part of the money they'd
made to found a school back in their

343
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:35,810
home county to help boys like
themselves to get a start.

344
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:40,250
That's the regional patriotism
element in what was going on.

345
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,110
Usually the endowed grammar schools
offered a variety of types of schooling.

346
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,830
The education which they offered,
uh,

347
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,930
was in part classical education as
the grammar school name implies,

348
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,640
preparing people for the universities,

349
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,610
but usually they also catered
for the needs of others. Also,

350
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:02,600
they had what was described
as the vernacular side
where the teacher was mostly

351
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:07,601
in English and they often had a petit
section as it was called a petit section,

352
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,340
which would focus on the
three r's, reading, writing,

353
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:17,840
and arithmetic or while for ours, really
reading, writing, arithmetic and religion.

354
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:20,510
Yeah.

355
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:23,420
In addition to the
endowed grammar schools,

356
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:27,830
there was schools which
were known as petty schools.

357
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,640
These were not usually
endowed foundations.

358
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,410
They sprang up and died away when a,

359
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:38,090
according to whether or not there was a
particular school or master who opened

360
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:40,110
them and ran them for awhile.
Um,

361
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,280
but they became increasingly
common all over the kingdom.

362
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,970
Peci schools taught basic literacy,

363
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,970
often accompanied by a
little bit of arithmetic.

364
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,950
Okay.

365
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,330
By the early 17th century,

366
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,360
most country towns in England
had a grammar school and
several petty schools and

367
00:26:00,511 --> 00:26:01,344
in addition,

368
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:05,670
Peci schools were increasingly
common in many villages,

369
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,830
not unusual for them to be
kept by local clergyman. Uh,

370
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:13,860
very often the teaching taking place in
the church porch, weather permitting,

371
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,610
all in all. Then we have a
transformation of elite education.

372
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:23,740
We have a transformation of clerical
education and a vast increase in the

373
00:26:23,741 --> 00:26:28,741
schooling available to the common
people of town and country.

374
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,480
All of this was a very
considerable achievement,

375
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:39,310
but at the same time, it's important to
grasp that there was some limits to it.

376
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:43,650
Historians are spoken of an educational
revolution taking place in this period

377
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:46,200
and I think that is in
many ways justified,

378
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:51,201
but it also inevitably had its limits
and those limits were most clear when one

379
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:56,370
looks at the differences of social
rank and gender as one might expect.

380
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:02,640
If the periods are real expansion of
educational opportunity access to it was

381
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,660
almost inevitably socially circumscribed.
The inns of court,

382
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:08,520
we're very much elite institutions.

383
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:12,360
90% of the students were of gentry origin,

384
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,930
the universities as we've seen what also
dominated by the gentry and the 50% or

385
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:21,330
so of students who were of Plebeian birth.

386
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,200
We're not drawn from the poor
plebeian just meant non gentry.

387
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:28,800
They will usually the sons
of clergymen of merchants,

388
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:32,340
the urban elite professional
people and so forth

389
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:36,990
and the reasons for this are obvious
enough that kind of education.

390
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,130
It was very costly.

391
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,770
Children from relatively humble
families could sometimes make it to the

392
00:27:43,771 --> 00:27:48,090
university if they had a patron who
would help them pay some of the fees for

393
00:27:48,091 --> 00:27:48,540
them.

394
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:52,860
Sometimes talented children was spotted
by local clergymen are gentlemen who

395
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:55,560
would help them on their way,
find them a scholarship.

396
00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:01,320
It was also possible to work your way
through by acting as a servant for the

397
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:02,670
gentry students.

398
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:06,750
Students who did that were
known as server tours or sizes.

399
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,191
Interestingly,

400
00:28:08,191 --> 00:28:13,191
a study done of them shows that servitors
and sizes working their way through

401
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,660
almost invariably graduated.

402
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,860
Whereas the gentleman they
served of course very rarely did.

403
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,261
Nevertheless,

404
00:28:22,261 --> 00:28:25,710
it's obviously the case that university
education and education at the Inns of

405
00:28:25,711 --> 00:28:29,160
court was heavily monopolized
by the upper reaches of society.

406
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:35,130
The same was true to a lesser
extent in the grammar schools.

407
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,040
The sons of the gentry might attend.

408
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,020
Most of the other students
were the children of the
clergy and the professional

409
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:50,130
and craftspeople of the towns with a
few sons of yeomen farmers from the

410
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:50,731
countryside.

411
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:55,731
Attending the problems inhibiting the
attendance of children at these schools

412
00:28:56,191 --> 00:28:58,050
was first of all the costs,

413
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:02,400
fees boarding in the town
where the school was,

414
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,170
but also perhaps even more
importantly perceived need.

415
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,360
This kind of grammar school education
was regarded as appropriate only for

416
00:29:12,361 --> 00:29:17,361
people who would be going on to enter
the professions or trade at a fairly high

417
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,390
level.

418
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:23,100
It wasn't deemed appropriate for farmers'
sons to get that level of education.

419
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,640
When one gets to the petit schools,

420
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:31,670
they were much more open and the evidence
suggests a much wider intake in local

421
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:36,690
society. Nevertheless, there
were still inhibitions.

422
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,780
Fees still needed to be paid,
even if they were small.

423
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:44,920
You had to supply your own books and
paper and pens and some families couldn't

424
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:46,240
afford this kind of thing.

425
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:52,800
There was also the problem of conflict
with the Labor needs of farm families.

426
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,890
Children will often put to school at
the age of five or six per taken away at

427
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:03,220
the age of seven when they were able
to play a more productive role in the

428
00:30:03,221 --> 00:30:04,570
family economy.

429
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:10,180
So sometimes their working lives had
begun before they'd had the opportunity to

430
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:12,340
gain much learning.
Uh,

431
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:15,310
one 17th century autobiography
described how his,

432
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,640
his brothers attended school
in some of the winter months,

433
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:25,000
but we're busy on the farm for most of
the rest of the year. And as he said,

434
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,130
what they learned when
they attended school,

435
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,420
they soon forgot he was kept at school
by his father constantly because his

436
00:30:31,421 --> 00:30:36,000
father intended to put him into
trade. And so he, he, he gained, uh,

437
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,510
a pretty sound education.

438
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:42,150
Well,

439
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:47,150
the relative failure of the mass of the
population to participate beyond the

440
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:48,690
level of the petty school,

441
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,770
if that is fairly strikingly brought out,

442
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:57,150
when we look at the available figures
that historians have put together on the

443
00:30:57,151 --> 00:30:59,160
subject of levels of literacy.

444
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,000
Okay,

445
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,781
you might well ask,

446
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:06,781
how on earth can we measure literacy
in such a distant period of the past?

447
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,021
Well,

448
00:31:08,021 --> 00:31:13,021
the usual way of doing that is to get
large samples of people putting their

449
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:18,970
names to documents and to distinguish
between those who could write their names,

450
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:22,930
who could sign their names,
and those who simply made a mark.

451
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,570
If you look at the
illustration on your handout,

452
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:31,290
that's a petition signed by
a lot of people whose names
are there at the bottom.

453
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,350
And you'll see, for example,
on the lefthand side,

454
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,270
a scribe has written in the
names followed by his mark.

455
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,430
And on the left of that,

456
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:46,660
you have the marks of the
various people concerned.

457
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,760
On the other side of the sheet,

458
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:52,270
there are a number of examples of people
who had successfully signed their names.

459
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,910
So it's possible to get large samples
of evidence of whether people could or

460
00:31:59,911 --> 00:32:01,380
could not sign their names.

461
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,930
One might be skeptical about how
meaningful that is after all,

462
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:10,500
one could learn to sign one's name,
even if one was in other ways,

463
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,880
scarcely literate.

464
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,860
But that was very unlikely in this period
to be unable to sign your name was not

465
00:32:16,861 --> 00:32:21,270
a great social embarrassment for
most members of the population. Um,

466
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:25,980
it wasn't something they would need
to try to avoid. Uh, and again,

467
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:31,070
the schooling practice of the time was
the children only began to learn to write

468
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:35,900
once they'd become proficient readers.
So if you've got,

469
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:41,090
if you had proceeded with writing father
enough to able to handle a quill pen

470
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:42,920
well enough to sign your name,

471
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:46,700
the likelihood is that you
were a proficient reader.

472
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,880
Now this may leave out of the count.

473
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:55,300
Some people who perhaps could read
reasonably but had not learned to write.

474
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,250
And indeed, if you look at
the bottom of that petition,

475
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,720
you'll notice one man's mark,
which is clearly an initial letter.

476
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,420
It's clearly an art.
He was called Richard.

477
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:10,690
One wonders whether Richard could in
fact Reid and could handle a pen well

478
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:13,940
enough to make the initial
letter of his name,

479
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,790
but historically do this kind of work,
a very strict,

480
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,830
either you sign your name or you don't.

481
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,800
They know that these
figures are not perfect,

482
00:33:21,801 --> 00:33:26,801
but it's a clear differentiation and
we can compare different areas and

483
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:29,330
different social groups.
So that's how they do it.

484
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,440
What are the results?
Well,

485
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:39,280
in the year 1642 massive numbers of
people were required to put their name to

486
00:33:39,471 --> 00:33:40,810
the so called protestation,

487
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,870
both at the beginning of the English
civil wars studying the returns of the

488
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:46,850
Prato station oath,
which survive.

489
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:52,330
David Cressey found that something like
70% of the adult men who signed that

490
00:33:53,481 --> 00:33:58,100
document were unable to sign their names.
30% signed,

491
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,590
70% made their mark,

492
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,510
but he also found that it varied
enormously from place to place.

493
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:08,240
Some places when 90% literate,

494
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:11,450
some places where less than 50% literate,

495
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:17,330
and he also found that towns were
very much more literary than villages.

496
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:23,230
That gives us the broad picture of what
had emerged by the mid 17th century.

497
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:30,610
Other studies have looked at the
literacy of different social groups in

498
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:35,960
particular areas of the country and
some of the figures they've produced or

499
00:34:35,961 --> 00:34:40,160
they're in tables two and
three on your handout,

500
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:47,140
they tend to bring out vividly how
there's a hierarchy of literacy and

501
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,043
illiteracy.

502
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,980
These figures are giving the percentages
of people who made their mark who

503
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:53,720
couldn't sign their name.

504
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,630
Table Two is a rural area of Essex and
Hartford shirts and east of London.

505
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:04,640
Table three is the city of London
and the county of Middlesex,

506
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:08,060
which was urbanized,
so that's an urban sample.

507
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,470
There's a hierarchy in both countries,
side and town.

508
00:35:12,471 --> 00:35:17,210
As you move down the social scale,
Yeoman in the countryside,

509
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,640
only 33% can't sign.

510
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,780
If one moves down to
laborers in the countryside,

511
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,910
100% can't sign,

512
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,220
but look at the differences between town
and country tradesmen and craftsmen and

513
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:35,570
in rural sample, 42% can't
sign, so more than half can,

514
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,330
but if one moves to the city,

515
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,200
only 28% can't sign much high levels
of ability to sign even laborers in the

516
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:52,650
city where only 78% illiterate.

517
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,490
So some laboring men in the
city could sign their names.

518
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:59,383
Okay.

519
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:04,730
What this indicates in general studies
of this kind is that in the course of the

520
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:07,710
latest 16th and 17th centuries,

521
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:12,880
illiteracy amongst the social elite was
completely wiped out to just eradicate

522
00:36:12,881 --> 00:36:17,340
it amongst the middling kind of people,
yeoman farmers,

523
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:21,990
tradesmen and craftsman.
Illiteracy was drastically reduced.

524
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,460
Many of these people can read and
write by the early 17th century.

525
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:31,610
If you move further down the social
scale amongst husbandman and laborers,

526
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,960
there's much less change.
Nonetheless.

527
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,760
Some of these people also were
beginning to be able to read and write.

528
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,080
It's not surprising that there's a
hierarchy of illiteracy and a society

529
00:36:43,081 --> 00:36:44,610
structured as this one was.

530
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,890
One could say that the hierarchy of
illiteracy faithfully mirrors the social

531
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,280
order.
Nonetheless,

532
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,660
significant inroads have been
made even low in the social scale.

533
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,670
That's turned out to another
form of differentiation,

534
00:37:02,671 --> 00:37:04,740
not between social rank
but between gender.

535
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:12,220
The education of girls was of course
also influenced by their social rank,

536
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,420
but at all social levels,

537
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:19,450
there was a major problem of the
perceived need to educate women

538
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,470
amongst the gentry.
By the late 16th century,

539
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:29,471
it was already widely accepted that
gentle women should be taught to read and

540
00:37:30,051 --> 00:37:34,820
write, to sing, to play
instruments, to dance,

541
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,980
to so perhaps even acquire a
little knowledge of French.

542
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,640
And this education would
be conducted privately.

543
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,220
They weren't usually sent to school,

544
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:49,040
which was considered too
risky to their virtue.

545
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:53,330
They would be educated at home
by their mothers, by governesses,

546
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,630
by the Lady of a household if
they were in honorable service,

547
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,950
in a great household,

548
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,000
perhaps by the domestic
trapline of such a household.

549
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,380
In the early 17th century,

550
00:38:05,381 --> 00:38:08,470
there was a little change with the
founding of some girls boarding schools,

551
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,210
usually in the London area,

552
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:13,600
but they were few and extremely expensive.

553
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:18,250
So the kind of education the gentle
women were getting was restricted in its

554
00:38:18,251 --> 00:38:19,030
scope.

555
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:24,030
Though there are a number of rare examples
of individual girls who got a much

556
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:28,660
fuller education including
classical learning. Um,

557
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:32,140
one example is a Lucy Hutchinson,

558
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,560
a young woman who tells us in memoir,

559
00:38:35,561 --> 00:38:38,770
she wrote a of her husband's career,
uh,

560
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:43,000
tells us that her father believed that
there was no reason why a young woman

561
00:38:43,001 --> 00:38:45,460
should not receive the same
education as young men.

562
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,850
So there were people who had views
of that kind. Even at this time,

563
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,740
though it was comparatively rare.
Girls have lower social rank,

564
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,230
got most of their education for life,

565
00:38:56,231 --> 00:39:00,880
either from their mothers or as
servants in the tasks of housewifery.

566
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:06,460
A few of them attended
school though very few.

567
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:09,700
They might attend a petty
school if their parents wished,

568
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,110
but there was absolutely no question
of them going to a grammar school or

569
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:18,490
acquiring classical education.
The universities, of course,

570
00:39:18,491 --> 00:39:20,200
we're closed to women.

571
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:26,800
The general lack of perceived need
for girls' schooling is shown in the

572
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:29,350
invariably high illiteracy
figures for women.

573
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,050
If you look at the figures on the handout,
again,

574
00:39:32,051 --> 00:39:33,910
you'll see that in the rural area,

575
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:39,090
women were 95% unable
to sign and in the city,

576
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,660
76%

577
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:47,220
these figures may possibly exaggerate
female illiteracy because it was women

578
00:39:47,801 --> 00:39:52,180
above all who were most likely to
be taught to read, but not to write,

579
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,640
taught to read for religious reasons,

580
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,820
but it wasn't considered
necessary to teach them to write,

581
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,770
so the figures for women may be
exaggerated. Nonetheless, overall,

582
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:07,870
girls of the middling sought might
stand a chance of learning to read and

583
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,550
possibly to write,

584
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:14,560
but below that level there
was almost total exclusion.

585
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,380
Well,
to draw towards a conclusion,

586
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,600
what was the overall significance
of all of this educational change?

587
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,420
Well,
with all reservations,

588
00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,260
I think these developments
are very significant indeed.

589
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,910
The transformation of the education
of the social elite is arguably a very

590
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:43,911
significant step towards the growth of
a homogeneous national culture amongst

591
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,700
the ruling class created by a highly
standardized pattern of education in which

592
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,720
many of them,
if not most of of them participated.

593
00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:00,000
These were people who were still
very much at home in that country,

594
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,410
their province,

595
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:05,820
they frequently spoke still
with strong regional accents.

596
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:09,690
So Walter Raleigh was said to have a
particularly strong west country accent,

597
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,280
which was noted at the court.

598
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:17,180
But also these people were experiencing
the assimilation and the capacity to

599
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:23,961
manipulate a generalized system of
cultural standards and values conveyed to

600
00:41:25,471 --> 00:41:28,560
them through the classical
learning they were acquiring.

601
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,250
And when one reads their letters on paper,

602
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:34,580
they're remarkably homogeneous.

603
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,480
There's a common range of
reference that they allude to. Um,

604
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,740
it's pointed out in one
recent study of, uh, uh,

605
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,430
a pamphlet written by a country magistrate
on the subject of witchcraft that the

606
00:41:46,431 --> 00:41:50,540
classical illusions, which he casually
throws out and the biblical references,

607
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,700
which he casually throws out
in the course of the pamphlet,

608
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:56,630
he simply assumes that his readers
amongst fellow magistrates will know what

609
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:57,464
he's talking about.

610
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:02,660
They belonged to a common cultural
world based on the classics,

611
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:06,710
the Bible, certain forms of
Protestant theology and law.

612
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:09,860
Again,

613
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,040
the transformation of the education of
the level level of the clergy is surely

614
00:42:13,041 --> 00:42:14,000
very significant.

615
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:19,490
Most parishes by 1640 had what you
could reasonably call a kind of resident

616
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:20,324
intellectual.

617
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:27,170
It's a development full of potential
implications for the penetration of the

618
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:30,590
countryside by the cultural
values of the university.

619
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,060
Through the contacts between
these clergyman and those
whom they served in their

620
00:42:35,061 --> 00:42:39,400
parishes,
lowering the social scale.

621
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,070
The achievement may see much more limited,

622
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,380
but I think one should
think about it positively.

623
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:50,860
A certain threshold had been
crossed in every parish.

624
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,920
There were at least some
of the common people.

625
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:59,100
Certainly those of middle rank and some
of those even below that who could read,

626
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:05,520
who could write literacy was now something
that people would encounter much more

627
00:43:07,061 --> 00:43:09,070
frequently in many contexts of life.

628
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:12,640
Something they would
use for many purposes.

629
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,400
To give perhaps a silly example,

630
00:43:15,401 --> 00:43:20,401
I once worked on a village in the north
of England near Newcastle on time where

631
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,930
in the late 16th century,

632
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,280
every will survive in for that village
was written by the local clergyman.

633
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,790
He was the only one who can do it.

634
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:33,160
The wreck chords of the village even
reveal that on one occasion a man who was

635
00:43:33,161 --> 00:43:33,641
dying,

636
00:43:33,641 --> 00:43:38,641
who hadn't made his well send urgently
for the clergyman and they couldn't find

637
00:43:38,891 --> 00:43:40,030
him because he'd gone fishing.

638
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,350
A little girl was sent running down the
river to find him and bring him back.

639
00:43:44,351 --> 00:43:49,150
He came back too late.
The man had died with his dying breath.

640
00:43:49,151 --> 00:43:53,530
He had told what he wanted, his goods,
how he wanted his goods to be distributed,

641
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:58,000
and we know the story because those who
heard his dying wishes had to go to the

642
00:43:58,001 --> 00:44:02,380
court and declare on oath what his wishes
were because there was no one to write

643
00:44:02,381 --> 00:44:07,060
them down in the same village
by the early 17th century,

644
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:12,670
there are so many people capable of
writing a will that one loses track of the

645
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:15,820
numbers of people who are acting as
scribes for their neighbors. You know,

646
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:19,570
1520 in different decades who
are capable of writing. Well,

647
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:24,750
that's the change which is taking
place even in obscure country parishes.

648
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:26,860
Even in such places,

649
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:31,890
the crossing of the literacy threshold
had opened up possibilities which simply

650
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,060
had not existed in the past.

651
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:41,390
If one thinks of late 15th century society
as one of heavily restricted literacy

652
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,960
restricted to certain social
and occupational groups.

653
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:51,720
By the early 17th century,
we have fairly widespread literacy,

654
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:54,060
uh,
partially literate society,

655
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,360
which was well on the
road to mass literacy.

656
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,020
And if you look at the
final chart on your handout,

657
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:06,380
there's the longterm decline of illiteracy
right through to 1900 and you can see

658
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:12,360
that the period we're dealing with is a
significant step forward in that process.

659
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:18,950
Now of course it was a very long road
right through to the 19th century.

660
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:23,700
Illiteracy remained closely
related to the social hierarchy,

661
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:28,830
but there was continuous advance
from the 16th century onwards.

662
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,020
By the early 18th century,

663
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:36,050
England was already probably the most
literate nation in Europe and still slowly

664
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:40,290
improving outside Europe.

665
00:45:40,291 --> 00:45:43,530
The most literate society
of the time was New England,

666
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,760
a colonial society,
which had a disproportionate,

667
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:53,590
a disproportionate number of literate
people amongst those who emigrated here.

668
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,611
And as a result,

669
00:45:56,611 --> 00:46:00,210
the opportunities for a more widespread
participation in the growing literate

670
00:46:00,211 --> 00:46:04,620
culture of the period was
expanding ideas and opinions,

671
00:46:04,621 --> 00:46:06,780
which were first voiced in elite circles.

672
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:11,781
Could sometimes find their way down
to permeate many areas of the social

673
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:15,990
structure,
like Sherry seeping down through a trifle.

674
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:22,260
That's not to say that many
people of humble place,

675
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:27,270
we're rushing to read the more high flown
products of the English renaissance.

676
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,560
Some of them did.

677
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:34,580
Some people who began reading simple
things became conspicuously literate and

678
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:38,850
Hungary for books and went on
to read whatever they could get,

679
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,820
but there was also for more,

680
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:46,500
for those who didn't have such ambitions
are growing popular print culture,

681
00:46:46,501 --> 00:46:47,970
which catered directly for them.

682
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:51,780
This period sees the birth
of the tap book literature,

683
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:56,840
Cheap Penny [inaudible] penny printed
works aimed at a mass market by the 1660s

684
00:46:59,911 --> 00:47:04,911
the most popular form of such a cheap
books almanacs were being produced on a

685
00:47:05,011 --> 00:47:07,140
vast scale in London.

686
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:12,140
400,000 [inaudible] a year were printed
in the 1660s aimed at the mass market

687
00:47:14,101 --> 00:47:19,101
and they contained all kinds
of information as well as
calendars for people to

688
00:47:19,321 --> 00:47:20,154
use.

689
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,510
Most readers of this stuff would not
have been members of elite society,

690
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,560
but they did have access to some of
the issues and ideas of their day.

691
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:35,310
Such chapbooks enjoyed massive sales
and they formed also a kind of bridge

692
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,880
between elite society and
the mass of the population.

693
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,860
One of the great collections of them,

694
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:46,420
which survived was put together by
Samuel Peeps, secretary to the navy,

695
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,690
a member of the highest
level bureaucracy of his day.

696
00:47:49,691 --> 00:47:53,360
But he enjoyed the cheap literature
as well. What does the learner,

697
00:47:53,361 --> 00:47:58,330
it works that he had in his library
and it could be red also of course by

698
00:47:58,331 --> 00:48:00,970
members of the middling and lower orders.

699
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:05,980
It must have had its impact on the
common stock of images and symbols and

700
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:10,981
understandings and simple
information of rich and poor alike.

701
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,180
And it fostered a popular literacy
which could be turned to other uses.

702
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,720
If you take the chapbook romances with
their tales of knights and giants and so

703
00:48:22,301 --> 00:48:26,860
forth with were being published in the
17th century and you marry them together

704
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,710
with religion,
with the Bible,

705
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:33,460
what you end up with is John
Bunyan's pilgrim's progress.

706
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,210
He was someone who was steeped
in this popular literature.

707
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:42,430
He wrote Pilgrim's progress in order to
provide, uh, a religious adventure story,

708
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:47,590
which turned out to be the second most
important book ever published in English.

709
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:50,381
To conclude then,

710
00:48:50,381 --> 00:48:54,250
whether or not we want to talk about an
educational revolution in this period,

711
00:48:54,610 --> 00:48:59,610
the educational changes did constitute
a very significant break with the past,

712
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,330
however limited,
however circumscribed by class or gender,

713
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:09,720
they did open up new areas of
potential in society and culture.

714
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:16,170
Something momentous was gradually
happening across the late 16th and 17th

715
00:49:17,531 --> 00:49:18,364
centuries.

716
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:22,930
Something which I think one can
reasonably say without exaggeration,

717
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:27,850
was one of the great transforming
processes of the early modern period.

718
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:33,940
Okay. Right. Well,

719
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:38,110
next time I'll take up the
political narrative again.

720
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:43,450
Turning to the religious problems and
political problems of the early 17th

721
00:49:43,451 --> 00:49:43,960
century.
