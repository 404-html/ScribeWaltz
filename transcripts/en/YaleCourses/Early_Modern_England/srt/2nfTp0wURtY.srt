1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:01,711
Well,

2
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:06,711
today we turned to politics and the
structures of power under the early tutors

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,150
on the 22nd of August, 1485, uh,

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,520
Henry tutor who was then
the Earl of Richmond,

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,510
defeated and killed King Richard the
third at the battle of Bosworth field,

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,411
a battlefield,

7
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:25,440
which is located in central England
and the county of Leicestershire,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,750
and was crowned upon the
battlefield with the crown,

9
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:35,751
which was found in the king's tent
and became king as Henry the seventh.

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,720
Now, in fact, his claim to the
throne was somewhat weak. Uh,

11
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:46,380
he was descended, uh, on
his father's side, uh,

12
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:49,350
from the widow of King Henry the fifth,

13
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,640
who had married Henry's
grandfather after the king's death.

14
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,240
Um, but that didn't establish
a direct claim to the throne.

15
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,870
His claim came principally through
his mother, lady Margaret Beaufort,

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,610
who was a descendant of the 14th
century King Edward. The third,

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,100
nevertheless,
week,

18
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:13,101
though his claim was Henry was the last
of the claimants of the Land Castilian

19
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:14,363
House.

20
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,910
And he took the throne on the
behalf of that particular group in,

21
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:24,510
uh, English politics,
which I'll explain later

22
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,340
in the 24 years following
his seizure of the throne.

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,280
He made it his business, first
of all to hang onto it. Uh,

24
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,360
secondly, to assert his authority
as best he could. And thirdly,

25
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:44,361
to pass on the crown to his son Henry
the eighth who succeeded him in 1,509 and

26
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:51,360
by doing so,
he founded a new dentisty,

27
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,310
the tutor dentisty.

28
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,640
Well today I want to look at some of
the early stages of that dynasty and in

29
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:04,020
particular to introduce the structures
of political power and authority as they

30
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:09,021
were exercised under Henry the seventh
and in the early part of the reign of

31
00:02:09,031 --> 00:02:11,790
Henry the eighth.
And by doing so,

32
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,820
to show how they managed to establish
and consolidate the new regime.

33
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,310
Now by power,

34
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:25,311
of course I'm in that I'm concerned with
the capacity to secure compliance and

35
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:32,190
obedience on the part of others.
By authority,

36
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,470
I mean legitimate power,

37
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,980
those forms of power and it's
manifestations which were deemed by most,

38
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:45,090
if not all people to be legitimate,
to be binding,

39
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,210
to put you under obligation to obey.

40
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,210
There are many sources of such
power and authority, economic,

41
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,380
ideological, political,
military and so forth.

42
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,580
And to a considerable degree as we'll see,

43
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:05,020
they all overlapped and
reinforced one another,

44
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,700
but taken together,

45
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:11,730
they comprised the polity of the
time as contemporaries described it,

46
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:17,770
the polity, a system of
established government and rule.

47
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,880
Now,
in approaching this kind of subject,

48
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:26,910
it's currently fashionable
amongst political historians
of this period to speak

49
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:30,890
of the need for what they call
a new political history, uh,

50
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,340
as distinct from the old
constitutional history. Uh,

51
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,510
it's a central theme in John Guys Book,

52
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:42,250
the Tudor Monarchy from which several
of our key readings are taken.

53
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,150
By this people mean a political history,

54
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:50,980
which is less narrowly focused upon
the development of the institutions of

55
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:51,814
government.

56
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:57,310
That was for a long time the really
central concern of historians of this

57
00:03:57,311 --> 00:04:00,940
period. They were very focused on the
development of particular institutions.

58
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,900
Instead,
now people are recommending a concern.

59
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:09,901
Instead with the changing context
and dynamics of political life and in

60
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:14,770
particular the social and
ideological context of politics?

61
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,810
Well, I'm very sympathetic
to that shift of perspective.

62
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,290
Uh, I can still remember
only too well, uh,

63
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:28,060
the old constitutional history
in its heyday as a student.

64
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,380
I sat sometimes at the feet of
the great professor Gr Elton,

65
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,450
who was famous for declaring that in
getting to grips with the structures of

66
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:41,320
government, it was essential that
students should learn to be bored.

67
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,190
And,
uh,

68
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,640
when he could deliver a whole lecture
on one of the seals used intuitive

69
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:52,150
government and the purposes for which
the seal was employed and so forth,

70
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,870
he was a man who sometimes
practiced what he preached.

71
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,190
But even if the approach has
changed somewhat over the years,

72
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:08,050
it's still essential that we do get to
grips with the institutions through which

73
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:09,820
government authority was exercised.

74
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,420
They provided the forum for political
competition and they shaped the way that

75
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,180
that political competition was conducted.

76
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,940
So historians today are very much
concerned with political culture.

77
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,750
I've offered a definition
of that on your handout,

78
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,430
but political culture involves also
institutions. They're part of it.

79
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:37,660
So we'll start by running over some
of the aspects of the institutional

80
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:42,661
structure under the early tutors and then
look at political society and then at

81
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:49,410
how political society could be animated
and controlled and the authority of

82
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:55,441
government sustained by the effective use
of all of these institutions under the

83
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:57,394
early.

84
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,390
Now the essential points about some of
these institutions are laid out on your

85
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:03,224
handout.

86
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:08,210
So I'll just click march through some
of them to briefly introduce them.

87
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,610
Right.
Well,

88
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:15,440
in 1500 England was already a very
old and by the standards of the day,

89
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,690
uh, quite intensively and
uniformly governed monarchy.

90
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,950
It had existed as a single monarchy
for six to 700 years already.

91
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,640
The origins of its high
degree of centralization
probably go back to the late

92
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:35,690
Saxon kings,

93
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,610
but in particular to the
time of the Norman Conquest
of the 11th century and its

94
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:43,850
consequences.
But that's not our business today.

95
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,130
Suffice to say that by 1500,

96
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,260
many of the central institutions of royal
government were very old and had been

97
00:06:51,261 --> 00:06:56,261
established by the initiatives of medieval
kings and reflected the relationships

98
00:06:56,631 --> 00:07:01,631
which they had hammered out over
time with their subjects above all,

99
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:04,940
with their most powerful subjects,
the nobility,

100
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,110
those who serve the king but could also
on occasion oppose him and had done so

101
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,530
many times in the past.

102
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,410
The king was of course at the
very center of the polity.

103
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,610
He was described by one 16th
century constitutional writer, uh,

104
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,030
so Thomas Smith as being the life,

105
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,330
the head and the authority of all things
that be done in this realm of England,

106
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:42,410
the principal functions of the king where
seem to be those of keeping the peace

107
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:43,580
and defending the realm,

108
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,360
maintaining the law and the administration
of Justice and upholding the church,

109
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,470
a relatively limited set of functions
compared to modern government.

110
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,120
And to achieve those ends.
The king enjoyed a variety of palace.

111
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:04,340
He enjoyed what were thought of as is
ordinary powers exercise within the

112
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:07,940
framework of the law.
But in time of emergency,

113
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,630
he might also exercise
residual absolute powers,

114
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,770
which could go beyond the
normal boundaries of the law.

115
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,170
Well,

116
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:23,170
English kings already had a very high
notion of their dignity and their

117
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,080
sovereign authority.
Um,

118
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:31,150
from the 14th century onwards there they
very often represented in the coinage.

119
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,230
Uh, they're represented wearing what's
known as the imperial crown. That's a,

120
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,100
a crown
which is enclosed at the top,

121
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,740
usually with a cross
and enclosed crown.

122
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,800
It was meant to symbolize the fact that
they recognized no authority higher than

123
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:54,020
themselves,
save God alone.

124
00:08:55,030 --> 00:09:00,030
And though the authority of the pope
was exercise within the kingdom over the

125
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:05,790
church agreements which had been reached
and statutes which had been passed in

126
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,840
the 14th century, meant that in practice,
in making appointments and the church,

127
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,110
the pope usually acted on the advice.

128
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,630
And in consultation with the king,

129
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,600
they didn't override his authority.

130
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,130
So a monarchy of considerable dignity
claiming a sovereignty represented in the

131
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:27,900
imperial crown,

132
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,090
but high as the king's dignity was England
was also as one contemporary jurist.

133
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,910
John Fortescue put it,
uh, dominium political ed.

134
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,390
Regardless
the phrases there on your handout,

135
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,440
which meant that Royal
Authority was supreme.

136
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,180
That's the regardless part,

137
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,810
but it was also sustained and restrained
by certain political expectations.

138
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,880
Certain constitutional institutions.

139
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,140
First kings were expected to take advice.

140
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:15,890
They were expected to be guided by
council by the Council of the leading

141
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:18,180
subjects.

142
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:23,370
They ruled with the advice
of a variety of councils.

143
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,900
Occasionally a great council of the
leading nobility could be called,

144
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:32,160
especially when advice and support
was needed in the making of some major

145
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:32,994
decision.

146
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:36,960
Henry the seventh called such councils
have is leading nobleman on a number of

147
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:37,794
occasions,

148
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:42,150
more usually for day
to day administration.

149
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:47,460
The king was advised by a smaller council
which attended his person on a day to

150
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:51,180
day basis and handle the
executive business of government.

151
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,600
Some of its members were great,
no woman,

152
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,250
but very often their position in the
council was one which was largely on a

153
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,134
rubric.

154
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,460
They tended on the whole to profit
their advice to the king informally and

155
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:13,140
occasionally when they were in
attendance at court. For the most part.

156
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:13,951
For example,
Henry,

157
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:18,951
the seventh day to day council consisted
in its principal members not of the

158
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:23,790
great nobles of the Kingdom,
but have great members of the church.

159
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,650
Notably Cardinal John Morton,

160
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:29,310
who was one of his closest advisors
in the early stages of his rule,

161
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,470
and in addition,

162
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,220
a number of lawyers and
professional administrators,

163
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:38,460
those who are sometimes
described as men of business,

164
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,450
the nucleus of a kind
of royal bureaucracy.

165
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,880
So the king was expected to take counsel.
In addition,

166
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,280
he was restrained by the law.

167
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,900
The common law of England described as
common because it extended over the whole

168
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,671
realm.

169
00:11:57,671 --> 00:12:02,170
The king's writ ran
everywhere in legal matters.

170
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,240
The common law had grown up over
centuries by custom and by precedent.

171
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:12,760
It was administered in the king's name
or legal writs began with the kings

172
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:15,760
title.
It was administered in his name,

173
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,250
though under normal circumstances,

174
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,540
he was expected to operate within
the constraints of the law,

175
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,660
the administration of the law,
the provision of justice,

176
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,760
and the redress of grievances.

177
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:36,180
The means of settling disputes peacefully
was one of the principal functions of

178
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:37,174
royal government.

179
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:43,830
Occasionally the king might
still sit himself in judgment.

180
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,600
One of the courts which became most
feared under Henry the seventh was the

181
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,550
king's Court of Star Chamber,

182
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,970
which met in a chamber of
the Palace of Westminster,

183
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:58,690
which happened to be decorated on the
roof with stars, the Star Chamber.

184
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,750
It was effectively the king's council
sitting as a law court and the king might

185
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,450
on occasion be personally present,

186
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,220
but for the most part the principal
law courts operated outside the royal

187
00:13:12,221 --> 00:13:13,054
household.

188
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:17,830
They sat permanently in Westminster
in Westminster Hall that still stands

189
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,870
besides beside the houses of parliament
and they were staffed by role justices,

190
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,690
the names of the principal quarter.
On your handout,

191
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:30,340
there was a court of Kings bench, which
dealt principally with criminal matters,

192
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,170
the court of common pleas,

193
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,440
which dealt principally with civil cases
and the chancery the court of the Lord

194
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:38,944
Chancellor.

195
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:44,650
That court was a little unusual in
that it was not a common law court.

196
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,380
It was a court of Equity Equity.

197
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:52,120
That meant that in cases where the
common law didn't provide a remedy,

198
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:58,320
principles of natural justice might be
administered by the chancellor and for

199
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:00,280
that reason,

200
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,600
the chancellor was sometimes described
as being the conscience of the king could

201
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:08,920
provide a remedy based on natural
justice when the common law did not.

202
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,750
Okay.
In addition to the central courts,

203
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,020
the king also exercise
justice by commission.

204
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,360
Twice a year,

205
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:24,420
royal judges left West Westminster and
went out to ride to literally ride six

206
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:31,380
circuits going from county town to county
town where they heard cases arising,

207
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,860
civil cases and criminal cases
arising in the provinces.

208
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,230
Those were the assize courts,

209
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,940
the riding of circuits by royal justices,
and in addition,

210
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,780
the king exercise justice through the
commission of the piece in each county,

211
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:53,960
some leading gentlemen were appointed
justices of the peace commission to deal

212
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,400
with crimes,

213
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:59,750
usually petty crimes and other
administrative matters arising.

214
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,940
They met in a court called quarter
sessions because it met four times a year.

215
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,003
Yeah,

216
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,040
counsel and law came together in
another great institution that must be

217
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:19,270
mentioned. Parliament, the
periodic meeting of the king,

218
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,101
the nobility,

219
00:15:21,101 --> 00:15:26,101
who had the right to sit in the House
of Lords and representatives of the

220
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,443
Commons of the kingdom.

221
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:34,500
The House of Lords consisted
of the leading lay and
church nobility of the realm

222
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,000
summoned by a personal writ to
attend in 15, 10. For example,

223
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:43,450
when parliament met, there
were 100 of them, 50 laymen,

224
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,640
50 great men of the church.

225
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:51,660
The House of Commons consisted of a
gathering of two representatives for each

226
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:53,704
county.

227
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:59,190
They were known as the knights of the
Shi'a and two representatives from each

228
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:04,360
city, which had the parliamentary
franchise. They were known as buttresses.

229
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,400
The city of London,
uh,

230
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,120
provided an exception if had
four members because of its size.

231
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,820
Now,
theoretically,

232
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:18,600
the members who came for the counties
were elected by free holders who had land

233
00:16:19,481 --> 00:16:22,930
to the value of 40 shillings.
Though in fact,

234
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:25,690
contested elections were very rare.
Generally,

235
00:16:25,691 --> 00:16:29,650
the elite of the counties
would get together in twos
from amongst their numbers

236
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,910
who would represent them.
They were selected rather than elected.

237
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,260
The urban franchise might
vary in some cities.

238
00:16:38,261 --> 00:16:41,350
All householders had the vote in others.

239
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,330
The choice of a member for parliament was
restricted to a small oligarchy of the

240
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:47,380
leading citizens.

241
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:56,690
Parliament then represented the whole
realm and it had two great functions long

242
00:16:57,661 --> 00:16:59,940
established.
First of all,

243
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:04,710
only parliament could
make statutes new laws,

244
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,480
which could override or
modify common law custom,

245
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,960
so the legislative sovereignty
of the realm lay in parliament.

246
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,680
We had the king,
the Lords and the Commons acted together.

247
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,250
Bill's proposing new laws were presented.

248
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,640
They were red and debated in each of the
houses before being passed and passed

249
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,450
onto the king for his consent or his veto.
Now,

250
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:37,500
if all that sounds rather familiar,
this is where it comes from.

251
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,120
Secondly,
parliament could grant taxes,

252
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,290
which from the 14th century required
the consent of the House of Commons.

253
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,320
It was essential that the Commons gave
their consent to any tax bill passing

254
00:17:51,421 --> 00:17:54,690
through parliament.
Okay,

255
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,040
one last word on institutions
and that concerns finance.

256
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,120
The king was expected to live off his own.

257
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,910
That's the phrase they
use to live off his own.

258
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:12,680
That meant he was expected to live on
the revenues of the Royal Land Holdings.

259
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,150
The customs do use and other dues which
were due to him as feudal overlord of

260
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:23,151
the kingdom and for all normal purposes
that should provide for all his

261
00:18:23,521 --> 00:18:24,450
expenses.

262
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,790
The collection and the disbursement
of royal revenues was handled by an

263
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:32,220
institution called the
Exchequer at Westminster

264
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:38,160
at least that was so in theory since
some late medieval kings took to handling

265
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:42,810
financial business in a more intimate
setting within their own household.

266
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,220
This was known as chamber finance because
they would deal with these matters in

267
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:49,800
the king's own lodgings or chamber.

268
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,630
Henry the seventh who was a notorious
workaholic and also extremely tight in

269
00:18:56,821 --> 00:19:00,750
financial matters,
actually personally went over,

270
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:06,050
checked and initialed every page of the
chamber accounts to check his financial

271
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,120
situation.
Reliance on taxation was rare.

272
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:17,400
Taxes would be voted by parliament for
extraordinary circumstances and would

273
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:21,990
then be collected and returned to
the exchequer. So for the most part,

274
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:23,130
the king lives of his own.

275
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:27,330
Periodically taxes would be
granted for special reasons.

276
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,603
Okay.

277
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,230
That's a quick run through some of the
principal institutions of day to day

278
00:19:34,231 --> 00:19:37,860
administration of royal government.
But of course,

279
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:40,590
administration is not
synonymous with government.

280
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,440
If you want to understand
the structures of power,

281
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:48,441
we need to look beyond this to the larger
political society within which these

282
00:19:49,111 --> 00:19:53,970
institutions function or
sometimes failed to function.

283
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,260
Obviously the Monique stood at the
head of the structure of power.

284
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:07,880
This is still an age of personal monarchy
and the personalities of individual

285
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:12,910
Monnox colored and gave a particular
texture to particular reigns.

286
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,000
Henry the seventh.

287
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,710
It was a man who seems by all accounts
of him to have been of a cold,

288
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,750
somewhat detached,
calculative suspicious temperament.

289
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,510
His son Henry the eighth in
contrast, it was energetic, uh,

290
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,980
muscular vein, a mixture of large, yes,

291
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:42,810
on the one hand, uh, but prone to
bursts of terrifying wrath, uh,

292
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:47,170
on the other and the personalities of
different kings gave something of the

293
00:20:47,171 --> 00:20:51,730
flavor to their range. Henry
the seventh. So for example,

294
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:55,630
it was only 28 when he won
the crown at boss with field.

295
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,140
It was only 52 when he died.
And yet it's been said,

296
00:20:59,141 --> 00:21:01,060
we never think of him as a young man.

297
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,130
His personality was such that one
doesn't think of him that way.

298
00:21:06,131 --> 00:21:10,570
In contrast to his flamboyant son,
the young Henry the eighth,

299
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:17,580
the various institutions of government
of course embodied the authority of the

300
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:20,160
Monique.
They gave stability and continuity,

301
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:24,540
but the actual exercise of power and
the maintenance of the authority of

302
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:29,541
government depended very much upon the
personality of the king and the way in

303
00:21:30,571 --> 00:21:34,470
which the Kings interacted with
various important groups of people,

304
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,680
communities of interest within the realm.

305
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:43,110
By 1500, they're already existed. A,

306
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,120
a relatively broad political society which
was involved in government in one way

307
00:21:48,421 --> 00:21:52,720
or another. Most ranks of society
down to the, the principal,

308
00:21:52,721 --> 00:21:57,721
citizens of the towns or even the leaders
of village society were involved in

309
00:21:58,021 --> 00:22:01,260
government in one way or another.
Uh,

310
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,940
except perhaps the very poor who were
described by Sir Thomas Smith as being

311
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,660
born to be ruled and not to rule others.

312
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:15,470
But of course if many people participated
in one way or another in the exercise

313
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:16,740
of royal power,

314
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,730
some people mattered a
great deal more than others.

315
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,800
And those who mattered most word,
of course,

316
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:27,660
the nobility and the gentry
and their counterparts,

317
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,310
the leaders of the church,

318
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,630
and the crucial relationship within the
whole structure of authority was that

319
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:38,631
between the king and his central officers
and those members of the social elites

320
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,860
who governed the localities,

321
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,580
it was those elites who constituted
deep political nation proper.

322
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,520
And when historians of this period
talk about the political nation,

323
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:53,370
it's primarily those people
they're talking about.

324
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:55,840
Okay.

325
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,080
Then our ability were absolutely
vital into very obvious ways,

326
00:23:00,081 --> 00:23:04,130
which were interconnected.
First of all,

327
00:23:04,131 --> 00:23:08,180
by virtue of their enormous
landed possessions,

328
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:12,020
they were the natural
rulers of the provinces.

329
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:17,770
Social Power and political
power in the realm intersected

330
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,850
the Percy family,

331
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:27,060
the earls of Northumberland
held absolutely vast lands
in the north of England

332
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:31,600
alongside the Scottish border where they
had the responsibility of defending the

333
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:36,580
border against the Scots.
Indeed, they still hold them. Uh,

334
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,720
the,
um,

335
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,490
they've virtually ruled that part of the
north from their principal castles at

336
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:46,450
Anik and walk with both of which still,
um,

337
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,200
if you've seen a Harry Potter
film, you've Seen Anna Cassell. Um,

338
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,330
it was used to shoot, uh,
parts of those movies.

339
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,980
The Percys were based there and it was
said with only a little exaggeration that

340
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:01,700
in that part of the kingdom
they knew no prince but a Percy.

341
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,693
Secondly,

342
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:10,210
the powers of Lordship which
were conferred by these
great estates translated

343
00:24:11,061 --> 00:24:15,800
into military power.
The king had no standing army.

344
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,510
Henry the seventh was unusual in that
he had a small group of royal guards

345
00:24:20,511 --> 00:24:23,390
permanently available,
the Yeoman of the guard.

346
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:28,400
Otherwise though there was no
standing army in time of war,

347
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:33,401
the king relied upon the nobility coming
in to support him with their armed

348
00:24:33,531 --> 00:24:38,531
retainers and servants and each great
Lord had his affinity as it was called,

349
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:42,710
his affinity of retainers.

350
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,520
Men bound to his service by ties of
personal loyalty and often by formal

351
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:55,060
contract they wore his badge or his livery
and they were expected to follow him

352
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,200
when called upon people as humble as
farm tenants in some parts of the kingdom

353
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,670
still had to keep a horse and arms as
part of the conditions of holding their

354
00:25:07,671 --> 00:25:12,560
farms from the gentry and nobility
in the north, for example.

355
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,940
That was commonly the case and when
called upon by the earls of Northumberland

356
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:20,570
or the earls of Westmoreland who
dominated what's now the lake district,

357
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:25,040
they would come in,
especially for service on the border.

358
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,680
To give one example of the importance of
the military power of nobility in 1536

359
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:37,310
at the outbreak of the rebellion against
the reformation known as the pilgrimage

360
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:39,890
of grace, the Earl of Sros, Bree,

361
00:25:39,891 --> 00:25:44,891
who was based in the North Midlands was
able to mobilize no fewer than 3000 men

362
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:52,010
in only six days.
The rebellion had broken out in Yorkshire.

363
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:53,300
Sros was here.

364
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,010
The fact that he could mobilize 3000
men so quickly was absolutely crucial

365
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,670
because he was able to
move north and too hot.

366
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:06,790
The rebel advance to shadow the rebels
until a larger royal force could be

367
00:26:07,581 --> 00:26:08,414
mustered.

368
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:14,080
In contrast to his friend
and former companion in arms,

369
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,640
Lord Darcy based in South Yorkshire,

370
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:19,460
sympathize with the
rebels and failed to move.

371
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:24,470
He sat on his hands for a while and
then eventually joined the rebels.

372
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,350
He should have been mustering
his troops to stop them.

373
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,230
That's why such men were crucial.

374
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:35,600
Darcy didn't act because he was out of
sympathy with royal policy in religion.

375
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,820
Shrosbree acted and say
today such men were vital.

376
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,650
Have you said all of this?
I must be careful not to exaggerate.

377
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,430
The nobility were rich and powerful,

378
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:56,790
but they didn't have fully independent
jurisdictions of their own where the

379
00:26:56,791 --> 00:26:58,410
king's authority didn't run.

380
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,630
Some of the great nobility of continental
Europe enjoyed that kind of par.

381
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,850
So did some of those of Scotland
in this period in England.

382
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:10,950
Such jurisdictions had
existed in the past,

383
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:14,880
but they had mostly gradually fallen
into the crowns hand and been retained.

384
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,513
As a result,

385
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:23,420
English nobles depended ultimately for
their power upon grants of royal office.

386
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,620
Their local authority was
granted to them by the king

387
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:34,650
king ad with the fourth who
ruled between 1461 and 1483,

388
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:35,491
uh,

389
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:40,491
had ruled very largely by parceling
out spheres of influence to the great

390
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,143
nobility.

391
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,560
His system of government
has been described as being
somewhat like the mob in

392
00:27:46,561 --> 00:27:51,561
the way that each of the great nobles
had his Quasar independent sphere of

393
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:56,310
influence,
but that was an anomalous situation.

394
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,230
For the most part.

395
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:02,730
The nobles depended upon Royal
Authority formally granted.

396
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:08,320
Nevertheless,
they still mattered a great deal.

397
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,420
Maintaining authority over
them was absolutely vital.

398
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,340
In the middle of the 15th century.

399
00:28:16,341 --> 00:28:21,341
King Henry the sixth had failed
to do so leading first of all,

400
00:28:21,681 --> 00:28:26,681
to rival and factionalism amongst his
nobles and eventually to a bid by one of

401
00:28:29,151 --> 00:28:30,410
them,
the Duke of York,

402
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:35,650
to overthrow him because your cat arrival
claim to the throne that led to the on

403
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:38,840
and off civil wars,

404
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:43,841
which ran between 1450 and 1485 usually
described as the wars of the roses.

405
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,453
Okay.

406
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,650
Now,
the feuding

407
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:54,180
of the 15th century wars of the roses
had taken out a number of exceptionally

408
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,670
overmighty subjects amongst an ability,

409
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,130
but in the reign of Henry the seventh
there was still a dozen or so who really

410
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:07,870
mattered and not just in the
north or along the Welsh borders,

411
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,640
which were areas of insecurity,

412
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:14,050
but in the very heart of the kingdom
in East Anglia, the Dukes of Norfolk,

413
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:19,110
the Howard's were paramount in Kent Lord
Burger Veni was paramount in the west,

414
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,560
the Marquess of Exeter, the
Courtney family. What paramount.

415
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,030
Okay.

416
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,340
They still nurtured that
affinities of retainers.

417
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:33,380
They still enjoyed great prestige as
regional leaders and they still adhere to

418
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:38,381
an aristocratic code that
certainly stressed loyalty,

419
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,650
honor and service to king,
but nonetheless,

420
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,420
they could be very haughty,
very touchy.

421
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,420
They assumed their right to rule.

422
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,680
They assume they're right to be consulted
and they could be very dangerous

423
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:55,900
indeed if they were slighted.

424
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,920
No two of the king was
ever likely to forget that.

425
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:02,950
In 1485 at the battle of Bosworth,

426
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:05,320
the Stanley's William Stanley,

427
00:30:05,321 --> 00:30:10,120
Lord Darby and his brother Thomas Stanley
brought their forces and then sat on

428
00:30:10,121 --> 00:30:15,121
the hill waiting to see which way
the battle between the claimant,

429
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:17,530
Henry Tudor and King Richard.

430
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:22,531
The third would go when they decided
that it looked like today was gaining the

431
00:30:22,661 --> 00:30:23,494
upper hand.

432
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:28,530
They joined in on his side
leading ultimately to the
death of Richard the third

433
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:32,080
and the desperate last charge
to try to break through.

434
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,540
That's what had happened on the
day that Henry came to the throne.

435
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,770
He was unlikely to forget that in
his dealings with his nobility.

436
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,020
So then how did the early tutors handle
their relationships with the various

437
00:30:47,021 --> 00:30:50,950
institutions and groups on whom the
effectiveness of their rule dependent?

438
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,240
I think one can suggest four ways.

439
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,950
They did it by propaganda,
by patronage,

440
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,810
by consultation,

441
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:07,500
and when necessary by simple
coercion to ps two C's.

442
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:12,550
Propaganda, patronage,
consultation and coercion.

443
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:20,140
At this point in time, propaganda was
perhaps the least important of the four,

444
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,640
but it was not insignificant.

445
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:28,020
Great stress was laid in
royal proclamations and
ceremonial and symbolism upon

446
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:34,651
the divine nature of royal authority on
the fact that the king was ordained by

447
00:31:35,591 --> 00:31:40,591
God and his subjects had a religious
duty of obedience and we the seventh was

448
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:46,270
very careful early in his reign to
obtain the recognition of the pope.

449
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:52,330
He further bolstered his claim to the
crown by marrying the daughter of his

450
00:31:52,331 --> 00:31:56,830
predecessor, King Edward, the fourth
uniting the houses of Lancaster and York.

451
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:01,750
Through that marriage,
adding to his legitimacy

452
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:08,530
from the reign of Henry the
seventh onwards into the
reign of his son. The past.

453
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:13,560
The public memory of the past was to
some extent remodeled into an exaggerated

454
00:32:14,321 --> 00:32:19,321
picture of the horrors which had attended
the breakdown of royal authority in

455
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,190
the wars of the roses.

456
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:26,890
They elaborated the myth of Richard the
third as a kind of monster king. I mean,

457
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,200
true enough. He was no sweetie,
but he was not the cookie monster,

458
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:37,120
uh, portrayed. For example, in
Shakespeare's history plays, uh,

459
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:42,420
historians were commissioned to write
appropriate histories celebrating the

460
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,000
Tudor Dynasty.

461
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,510
Polydore Virgin Italian humanists was
brought in to write one history in Latin.

462
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:52,010
Edward Hall produced another history
in England and titled the Union of the

463
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,260
illustrious families
of Lancaster and York,

464
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,770
which sustained the tutors
claim to the throne.

465
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,560
Shakespeare's history plays of course,

466
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,700
reflect very much this tutor
interpretation of history.

467
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,220
The image of royalty was cultivated
in a kind of theater of majesty,

468
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,240
tight as he was with his finances.
Henry the seventh,

469
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:19,340
never forgot the importance of having
a magnificent court and sumptuous

470
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:23,750
clothing. The pageantry of
the court was magnificent.

471
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:28,490
Great tournaments were held,
great buildings were erected,

472
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,500
perhaps the greatest of which Henry the
Seventh Chapel at Westminster Abbey,

473
00:33:33,501 --> 00:33:36,440
where he's buried.
I'm still stands today.

474
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,940
Under the reign of Henry
the eighth portraiture,

475
00:33:40,941 --> 00:33:45,941
royal portraiture began to emerge
as a means of royal propaganda.

476
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:47,870
Um, Henry, the eighth doll was,

477
00:33:47,871 --> 00:33:52,871
had himself represented as something
more than human in the national portrait

478
00:33:53,511 --> 00:33:55,130
gallery in London.

479
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:59,810
You can see the cartoon which survives
of a great painting of Henry and the to

480
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,560
the line, which was once on
the walls of his palace, uh,

481
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,550
of Whitehall.
Um,

482
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:10,660
Henry himself is shown much larger than
life size dwarfing or those around him.

483
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,820
Uh,
he was indeed a big man,

484
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:18,090
but he's represented as
even larger than life. Um,

485
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:22,310
you're probably familiar with the
Holbein portraits of Henry, you know,

486
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,940
standing arms on hips,
Mac gigantic shoulders,

487
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:29,000
pat it out with his doublet.
Um,

488
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:33,830
that kind of image of the king is the
one that dominates our memory and it was

489
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:37,250
meant to dominate those
who saw his portraits.

490
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:39,100
It's an image.

491
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:43,310
It's so familiar to people in England
was actually used to sell potato chips.

492
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,280
Um, a few years ago there was a, uh,

493
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:51,100
a brand of potato chips. Uh, they
know locked. They're no longer sell.

494
00:34:51,101 --> 00:34:55,550
So this is not product placement,
uh, called tutor crisps.

495
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:56,780
We called crisps in England.

496
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:02,000
Henry the eighth on the packet glowering
out as you had your potato chips.

497
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,670
Of course he was a king,
known for his heart and eating

498
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,730
the Nobels themselves of course,
imitated all of this,

499
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,430
the theater of the great extended to them.

500
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:18,350
Take a look in the Yale Gallery of
British art where you'll see some of where

501
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:22,520
we'll go there later in the term to
look at some of the power portraits as

502
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:24,140
they're called,
the calm,

503
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,100
proud faces of these people
staring down from the walls.

504
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:34,460
Well, the main impact of portraiture and
so forth was on the members of the elite

505
00:35:34,461 --> 00:35:37,470
themselves. They were the ones who
are likely to see these paintings,

506
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,920
but for a larger audience
they were precessions.

507
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:44,640
They were riled progresses where the
king would travel around an area in a

508
00:35:44,641 --> 00:35:48,570
magnificent procession staying
in the houses of his principles,

509
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:53,571
subjects that were royal entries to
the city's accompanied by great ritual

510
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:55,830
pageants,

511
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:00,840
display and everywhere the
royal badge was displayed.

512
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,810
Jen, interesting topic, the,
the politics of display,

513
00:36:05,811 --> 00:36:09,950
the art and architecture of power and
great deals being written about it that

514
00:36:09,951 --> 00:36:12,950
interests you. Um, I can
recommend some reading.

515
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,301
Well,

516
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:20,301
the most significant then propaganda
of this type and in fact vitally

517
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:22,500
significant was the use of patronage,

518
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,500
the exercise of what they
called good Lord ship

519
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:32,090
that involved the conferring
or insignificant subjects
of honors and Prestige

520
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,660
and material benefits in
return for their loyal service.

521
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:41,850
After all, the interests of the king
and his great subjects were not opposed.

522
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,540
The system ideally could be
utilized to the advantage of both.

523
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,320
And so from Henry the seventh onwards,

524
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:53,160
the tutors were careful to
build up their own affinity,

525
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,320
their own loyal retainers,
royal lands,

526
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,820
we're used to this end.

527
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,510
Those who had shown their loyalty
and who are trusted would be granted

528
00:37:03,511 --> 00:37:06,360
stewardships of royal lands where
they would share in the profits,

529
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,410
favorable leases,
the constable ships of castles,

530
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,270
officers of profit,

531
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:18,000
and of course grants of local authority
which demonstrated the king's trust and

532
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:23,001
which conferred honor and power
within their localities of prominence.

533
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,150
Well, if this was not only to the
personal benefit of the individual noble,

534
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:35,570
but it also enabled such men to dispense
patronage themselves downwards to their

535
00:37:35,881 --> 00:37:38,550
own clients and retainers,

536
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:43,880
it enabled them to maintain their own
affinities and enhanced their standing.

537
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:51,180
The Tudor kings had no objection to
building up powerful man of this kind,

538
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,060
so long as they were loyal.

539
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,870
But ideally patronage
should be spread around.

540
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:05,290
It should be dispensed judiciously in a
way that would maximize the community of

541
00:38:05,421 --> 00:38:07,880
interest in obeying the crown.

542
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,910
Let's look now at consultation.

543
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:19,190
The royal court was the very
center of the patronage system.

544
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:25,210
Access to the king was vital and those
who can control access to the king.

545
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:31,270
We're in positions of real power
under the young Henry the eighth.

546
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:35,150
Um, the gentleman of the
Privy Chamber, his personal,

547
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,540
those who hunted and um,
uh,

548
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,710
engage in other sports with the king.
Um,

549
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:47,590
we're absolutely central figures
in gaining access to the king.

550
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,390
Um, a principal amongst them, the
groom of the stool and office,

551
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:54,910
which still exists in Henry's day.

552
00:38:54,911 --> 00:38:59,110
The groom of the stool literally looked
after the king's chamber pot and brought

553
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:01,450
it for him when it was needed.

554
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:06,720
These were people in an excellent position
to drop names into the king's ear,

555
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:12,370
but the court was also vital to the
business of consultation more broadly.

556
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:17,770
Any person of significance was expected
to visit the court from time to time.

557
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,520
And when they were there,
the king could be quite approachable.

558
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,730
Henry the seventh was quite
famously approachable.

559
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:28,690
He led people pop into the Privy
Chamber where he conducted business.

560
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,020
Henry the eighth was famously affable,

561
00:39:32,021 --> 00:39:36,190
something of a back slapping hearty
type when he was in a good mood.

562
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,080
Nobles in particular expected
that kind of personal access.

563
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,260
They're expected to be able to give
their counsel informally on matters of

564
00:39:44,261 --> 00:39:48,040
concern. They weren't part
of the regular executive,

565
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:50,440
their main duties layout
in their countries,

566
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,700
but they did expect a visit for part of
the year and have that kind of personal

567
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,850
contact more broadly.

568
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,560
The regular executive council was a point
of contact with these members of the

569
00:40:02,561 --> 00:40:05,740
political nation.
It received letters and dispatch them.

570
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,080
It expressed the king's gracious
stanks for good service.

571
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,080
It handled all kinds of business
brought to its attention.

572
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:20,050
And then of course there was parliament,
the greatest occasion of consultation,

573
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:25,240
the whole political nation
gathered in common action.

574
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:31,290
So Thomas Smith said that every
Englishman is intended to be there present

575
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:37,260
either in person or by attorney from
the prince to the lowest person,

576
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:43,330
and the consent of the parliament
is taken to be every man's consent.

577
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,301
The king,
however,

578
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:50,890
only called parliament when he
needed money or new laws or support.

579
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,720
Before 1529 the early tutors
called it only occasionally,

580
00:40:56,890 --> 00:41:01,890
but then from 1529 to 1559 in
the crisis of the reformation,

581
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,670
there were only eight years without
a parliamentary session and it grew

582
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:10,780
insignificance as a regular
part of the political process.

583
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,970
The Tudor kings usually got what
they wanted from parliament,

584
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,150
but they did it by managing it carefully.

585
00:41:19,151 --> 00:41:23,500
It's compliance could never be simply
taken for granted. It had to be managed,

586
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:25,480
and it was a genuine form of debate.

587
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:30,670
The speaker of the House of Commons who
control the agenda was granted at the

588
00:41:30,671 --> 00:41:35,300
beginning of each session the liberty
of free speech so that he could speak

589
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,980
openly to the king.

590
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:43,120
And by 1547 that liberty had been extended
to every member of parliament within

591
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:46,580
the precincts of the
meetings of parliament.

592
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:51,940
They could address any issue openly
for the good of the Prince and the

593
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:56,750
Commonwealth. And these members in
their turn got what they wanted.

594
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,580
Government bills might be amended in
the light of their local experience,

595
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:06,850
and a great deal of private legislation
intended for particular localities was

596
00:42:07,401 --> 00:42:08,234
passed.

597
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:14,050
So parliament as a place of consultation
was a very significant forum for the

598
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:19,190
resolution of potential conflict for
the presenting of royal policy and its

599
00:42:19,191 --> 00:42:21,260
explanation and justification.

600
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,900
The tutors used it very
carefully to achieve their
ends. In fact, on one occasion,

601
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:31,070
Henry the eighth flattered it by saying
that his royal dignity was never so high

602
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,920
as when he met with parliament

603
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:40,700
and the growing significance of this
institution is indicated by the anxiety of

604
00:42:40,701 --> 00:42:44,420
members of the governing
elite to serve as members.

605
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,430
But finally,
if propaganda,

606
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,880
the use of patronage and consultation
didn't succeed in welding together the

607
00:42:54,981 --> 00:42:59,600
interests of the crown and the political
nation there remained coercion.

608
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,500
What was described at the time as heavy
Lordship as distinct from good Lord

609
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:07,034
trip,

610
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:12,710
often evident under both Henry the
seventh and Henry the eighth as they

611
00:43:12,711 --> 00:43:15,770
established their authority
and their dentisty

612
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,740
when necessary,

613
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:23,600
they would bring to parliament and
rushed through acts of attainder.

614
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,500
Acts of attainder simply declared
particular individuals guilty of treason

615
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:35,330
depriving them of their
lands and their status.

616
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:39,410
They were often used
against rebellious nobles.

617
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:44,360
They could be reversed in the interests
of the heirs to those estates if they

618
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:48,770
behaved themselves, but they had
to prove themselves compliant.

619
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,490
Henry the seventh made frequent
use of acts of attainder.

620
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,580
He very cleverly data the beginning of
his reign to the day before the battle of

621
00:43:57,591 --> 00:43:59,810
Bosworth.
We've got parliament to agree to that.

622
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,810
That meant that everyone
who had opposed him,

623
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:06,560
even though they were actually fighting
for the person who was the king at the

624
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:07,394
time,

625
00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:12,910
was automatically a traitor and
their lands were forfeit clever.

626
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:18,170
It enabled him to greatly extend the
royal lands in one move and there was more

627
00:44:18,171 --> 00:44:23,171
of that to come acts of attainder where
also used against those who supported

628
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:26,800
pretenders to the throne who um,

629
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,770
were folk AI of um,

630
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,960
potential rebellions and actual rebellion
in 1487 against Henry the seventh

631
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:41,830
and we was the seventh was also willing
to use another coercive measure.

632
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:49,510
The placing of his and a bit of
nobility under Rick Cognizance,

633
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,070
Rick Cognizance bonds.
They were like a bail bond,

634
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,890
a bond illegal bond that nobles were
forced to enter into to be of good

635
00:44:58,891 --> 00:44:59,724
behavior.

636
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:05,030
Or if they failed to pay
enormous financial penalties,

637
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,840
they usually had to find the sureties
from amongst their kinsmen and supporters

638
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,100
for those bonds,

639
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:14,880
which meant that those people had an
interest in making sure that the Nobel man

640
00:45:14,881 --> 00:45:15,714
concerned,

641
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:20,730
complied and would lose out
themselves badly if he didn't.

642
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,090
These were used,
for example,

643
00:45:24,091 --> 00:45:28,340
against any nobleman who in
any way infringed the um,

644
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,590
requirements of new laws.
For example,

645
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:37,340
under Henry the seventh retaining the
retaining of an affinity of clients was a

646
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:42,180
regulated by license only.

647
00:45:42,181 --> 00:45:47,181
Those who are licensed to do so could
retain armed retainers and they were

648
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:52,110
forbidden from retaining any
member of the crown's own affinity.

649
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,880
You could owe loyalty to the king,

650
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:58,620
only anyone who infringed that was
likely to find himself hauled before the

651
00:45:58,621 --> 00:46:02,850
council and faced with the
recognitions bond Lord Berg of any,

652
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:07,910
the principal magnet and Kent was put
under a potential fine of 70,000 pounds,

653
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:13,950
a massive sum of money for
such failure to comply.

654
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,780
It wasn't actually executed,

655
00:46:15,781 --> 00:46:20,781
but it hung over his head like the sword
of Damocles anti complied in future.

656
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,570
And then there were the laws of treason.
In the 14th century,

657
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:32,610
the law of treason had been introduced
defining treason as acts against the

658
00:46:32,611 --> 00:46:37,611
king's person or his family or open
rebellion against his authority.

659
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,400
Under the early tutors,
the law of treason was extended.

660
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:46,950
By the time of Henry the eight it came
to include even treasonable words,

661
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,360
such as, for example, denying
the legitimacy of the kings.

662
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:56,610
Many marriages,
particularly dangerous individuals,

663
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,640
were ruthlessly eliminated under Henry
the seventh the young Earl of Warwick,

664
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,840
Edward Earl of Warwick,

665
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:08,841
who was the last potential claimant
to the Yorkist claim to the throne,

666
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:14,610
was imprisoned in the Tower of London
from childhood where he was kept until

667
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:18,660
1499 when in a moment
of danger to the throne,

668
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:22,350
Henry the seventh had him executed.
So William Stanley,

669
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:26,790
one of those who had supported
Henry at the battle of Bosworth,

670
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:32,870
fell under the king suspicion and was
taken out in 1497 under the young Henry,

671
00:47:33,611 --> 00:47:34,930
the eighth of presumptuous,

672
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:40,110
Edward Stafford drew Duke of Buckingham
was executed on trumped up charges in

673
00:47:40,811 --> 00:47:45,811
1521 his real crime was that he
had a distant claim to the throne.

674
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:52,810
Henry didn't yet have a male heir and
it was alleged that Buckingham had

675
00:47:52,811 --> 00:47:57,811
listened to prophecies that Henry never
would have a male heir and that he had

676
00:47:57,851 --> 00:48:00,190
made some resentful
statements against the king.

677
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,110
When this came to the king's knowledge,
bucking homes, days were numbered

678
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,650
like most nobles who fell under royal
displeasure of Buckingham died by the ax.

679
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,090
Less a folk were hung,

680
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,560
drawn and quartered and less
honorable means of execution.

681
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:25,000
It meant that they were hung by the
neck until they were not quite dead.

682
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:30,390
Disemboweled their bowels burned before
their eyes and then cut down their

683
00:48:32,171 --> 00:48:36,580
bodies cut into four quarters which
were dipped in pitch and send it to be

684
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:40,570
displayed at the gates of the
leading cities of the kingdom.

685
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:46,560
As an example to warn other potential
traitors and trial procedures in treason

686
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:52,660
trials could be extremely arbitrary.
The council could order a rest at will.

687
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:55,120
It could order the torture of suspects.

688
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:57,250
Torture wasn't normally
used in English law.

689
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,160
Defense counsel was denied.

690
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:06,450
Evidence could be fabricated to get
rid of unsuccessful losers in court.

691
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:09,460
Factional struggles the
very highest levels.

692
00:49:09,461 --> 00:49:13,360
Then political conflict was
played out to the death,

693
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,810
especially under Henry the eighth indeed,

694
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:21,430
one historian of Henry the eight has
said that in some parts of his reign,

695
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:24,790
his court had the atmosphere
of the Kremlin under Stalin.

696
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:30,360
With people going in constant fear of
arousing the king's displeasure so the

697
00:49:31,901 --> 00:49:34,630
crown could deliver large,
yes to the loyal.

698
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:39,930
It could consult with its leading subjects
but it could also brutally display

699
00:49:40,421 --> 00:49:41,254
it's wrath.

700
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,880
The Majesty which had displayed on the
one hand was counterbalanced by terror.

701
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:50,560
All of this adds up then
to a political culture,

702
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,390
a set of institutions of
government animated by certain
understandings and rules

703
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,960
and practices which
govern political conduct.

704
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:04,830
That unwritten consensus about how
things were done was very well understood

705
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,200
throughout political society and political
stability depended upon sharing power

706
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:14,740
in varying degrees at various levels of
the structure in accordance with these

707
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:15,730
understandings.

708
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:21,390
Effective rule was the outcome of the
use of considerable political skills by

709
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:26,881
the kings and their advisors within
this framework to bring about willing

710
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:32,441
obedience and participation of their
leading subjects and for the most part the

711
00:50:33,561 --> 00:50:37,400
early tutor kings proved
very able in achieving that,

712
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:40,820
in rebuilding the authority of the crown,

713
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:45,970
which had been so much shaken by the
civil wars of the 15th Century in

714
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:51,011
instilling habits of obedience in
reestablishing the latent power of the

715
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:56,360
monarchy and indeed in enhancing it.

716
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:58,910
Something that we'll discuss in section,

717
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:03,680
but finally change in government in the
16th century involved more than just

718
00:51:03,681 --> 00:51:05,210
reasserting royal authority.

719
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,960
It also came to involve something else,

720
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:14,000
the expansion of the very scope
and objectives of government.

721
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,410
And to understand that we need to
see its development in the context of

722
00:51:18,411 --> 00:51:19,700
processes of change,

723
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:24,940
which was scarcely on the agenda as
late as 1530 but which were very soon to

724
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:30,020
emerge.
And in the next few section lectures,

725
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:35,110
I'd be looking at those by examining
the most explosive of these new issues,

726
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:39,440
the issues of the succession
and the issue of religion.
