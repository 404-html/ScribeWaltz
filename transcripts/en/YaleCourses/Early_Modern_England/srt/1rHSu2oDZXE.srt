1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:01,591
Okay.

2
00:00:01,591 --> 00:00:01,890
Well,

3
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,870
in 1921,

4
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,280
a group of workman working in the
highway near the village of St Joseph,

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,990
which is here in Essex and east Anglia,

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,190
um,

7
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,080
discovered a skeleton.

8
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:17,590
Uh,

9
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:20,130
the first day it's all stayed
uncovered a modern crime,

10
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:22,350
but it was soon established
that it was very old.

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,910
And subsequently on the basis of both
documentary evidence and forensic

12
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:29,784
evidence,

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,240
they identified it as being probably
the remains of a woman named Ursula Kemp

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,210
who had been executed at St Seth and
buried in the highway rather than in

15
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:47,151
consecrated ground in the year 1582
and Ursula camps crime was the alleged

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,190
causing of death by witchcraft.

17
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,140
Now,

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,740
today,

19
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,740
obviously I'm going to talk
about witchcraft and perhaps
explain how it was that

20
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:05,460
people like Ursula camp
came to such an end.

21
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:07,770
First of all,

22
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,750
we need to start with a little context
by discussing the larger place of not

23
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:13,760
simply witchcraft,

24
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,700
a specific crime,

25
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:15,600
but magic,

26
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:16,230
uh,

27
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,680
within the popular culture
of early mornings island.

28
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,530
We could perhaps define that world of
magic as being essentially a body of

29
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:28,411
beliefs,

30
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:33,411
a large body of beliefs and practices
regarding supernatural power,

31
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,950
which stood outside the world of form of
religion and yet well widely known and

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,890
helped people to cope with their
anxieties and their insecurities.

33
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,090
It helped them to cope above all because
it involved various ritual means of

34
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:56,250
manipulating supernatural powers,

35
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,500
so as to ward off misfortune
or else to alleviate it.

36
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,690
This world of magic then
was was essentially a world
of trying to propitiate or

37
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:14,691
to manipulate unidentified supernatural
powers largely for the purposes of

38
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:17,670
protection and relief.

39
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,583
It wasn't,

40
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,300
and it's important to stress this,

41
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,880
it wasn't an alternative religion.

42
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,780
It was a whole mess of
supplementary beliefs and
practices been described by one

43
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:35,760
historian as the debris of many
different systems of thought.

44
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,330
It was regarded with some
suspicion by the church,

45
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,720
but it was not regarded
as a threat as such,

46
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,040
at least not initially.

47
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,660
One historian writing about popular
beliefs has put it splendidly.

48
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:51,410
I'm quoting from him names
James Are Belka beach.

49
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,030
It was a large loose,

50
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,920
pluralistic affair without
any clear unifying principle.

51
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,700
It encompassed superhuman
beings and forces,

52
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,300
witches and wise men and a mass of
low grade magical and superstitious

53
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:11,074
practices.

54
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,490
The whole was less than
the sum of its parts.

55
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,350
The whole was less than
the sum of its parts for,

56
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:23,320
it was not a cosmos to be
contemplated or worshiped,

57
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,800
but a treasury of separate and specific
resources to be used or applied in

58
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,690
concrete situations that
puts it extremely well.

59
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:38,770
These means of tapping
into supernatural par.

60
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,450
We're very widely known,

61
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,640
you could say they were part of the law
which was acquired by every child as

62
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:47,560
part of their education for life,

63
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,930
like learning to cross
the road as it were,

64
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:56,020
but the world of magic also had its
specialists and they were those who were

65
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,610
known as the cunning folk,

66
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,220
cunning men or wise women.

67
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,890
These individuals were those who were
known to have special knowledge over and

68
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:10,810
above the average knowledge of magical
practices and who are often believed to

69
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:13,600
have a special inherent power

70
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,330
often inherited.

71
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,670
It was thought to pass in the blood.

72
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,860
The coming folk who were pretty numerous.

73
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,450
One survey of known cutting folk in East
Anglia suggest that there was a known

74
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:30,010
cunning man or a wise woman,

75
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:30,590
uh,

76
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,260
within 10 miles of any village.

77
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:38,650
These people were appeal to vote
for a variety of specific purposes.

78
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,250
Um,

79
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,630
the first place they often will
appeal to for medical reasons.

80
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,760
Very often they had specialist
knowledge of Herb's,

81
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:53,380
which they would administer often
accompanied by spells to increase their

82
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,131
effectiveness.

83
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:58,060
The psychological effect of
the incantation going along
with what may well have

84
00:04:58,061 --> 00:05:00,910
been the practical effect of the Herb's.

85
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:03,170
They used Ursula Sheila Kemp for example.

86
00:05:03,171 --> 00:05:04,060
It was such a person,

87
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,310
she was known as a healer in her village.

88
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,020
She was good at curing arthritis.

89
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,883
Apparently

90
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:10,571
again,

91
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:14,080
they would appeal to for
the diagnosis of witchcraft.

92
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,560
If a person suspected that
they might've been bewitched,

93
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,880
they might go to the cunning folk
for the provision of counter magic.

94
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,980
They might help the victim to identify
who might have attacked them in this

95
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,550
awkward manner and
advise on counteraction.

96
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,180
Uh,

97
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,770
one of my favorite cutting men,

98
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,790
uh,

99
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,380
came from a town in the north of England,

100
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:38,260
stokes Lee and he was
called John Wrightson.

101
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,400
Uh,

102
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,400
and he was known as old rights and the
wise man of stoke sleep and people went

103
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:47,650
to him for help with their horses.

104
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,670
He was a horse leach.

105
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:53,350
He was very good at telling whether your
horse had been bewitched and knowing

106
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:55,030
how to take the appropriate
counter measures.

107
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,980
People went to the cunning folk also for
the recovery of lost or stolen goods.

108
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,300
And they went for advice and the telling
of fortunes and to this extent the wise

109
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:12,710
women and the cunning men were the popular
equivalent of the astrologers who had

110
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,410
a more elite clientele in this period.

111
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,940
So the cutting folk provided a variety
of real services and the best of them may

112
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:24,980
well have been quite skilled
therapists in their way.

113
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,880
One historian of medical practice in
this period says we ought to count them

114
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,940
amongst the medical practitioners
of the time they were cheap.

115
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,430
They were available and in
many ways quite knowledgeable.

116
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,883
However,

117
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:41,390
the church was pretty unhappy
about this kind of activity.

118
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,060
It didn't like popular magic.

119
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,110
The official teaching of the church
was that if a person suffered any

120
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:48,860
misfortune,

121
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,900
it must be the result
of divine providence.

122
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,920
It was either a test of your
faith or on the other hand,

123
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,440
it was a judgement on your sin.

124
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:02,510
The only proper response to his fortune
was to search one's own heart for the

125
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:06,320
possible causes of such
divine intervention to pray,

126
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,333
to repent,

127
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,661
to trust.

128
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:11,060
In God's providential purposes,

129
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:14,930
the church rejected
magical means of relief.

130
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,730
It accepted the possibility,

131
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,370
but it rejected the means.

132
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,570
God could not be commanded
by spells and incantations.

133
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,380
Therefore,

134
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,440
if there was any supernatural
response to such practices,

135
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,060
it must be from evil spirits.

136
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,380
And so given these beliefs,

137
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:38,650
we find the deeply pious of the period
searching their hearts for the sins which

138
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:44,030
had brought misfortune upon them and
sometimes finding quite extraordinary

139
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:44,601
answers.

140
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:45,860
You find it in their diaries.

141
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:46,460
For example,

142
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:46,971
for example,

143
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:47,420
the,

144
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,100
the diary of the Reverend Ralph Joslin,

145
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,170
a minister in the late 17th century
who were having lost a dearly loved

146
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,100
daughter,

147
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,130
searched his heart as to why
God should have done this,

148
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,840
why he should've taken her away and came
to the conclusion that it was because

149
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:07,070
he had neglected his clerical duties
because of his enthusiasm for playing

150
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:07,904
chess.

151
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,250
He had played chess too much.

152
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,350
God had taken his daughter.

153
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,160
That's the conclusion he came
to and he gave up playing chess.

154
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,650
This is a 17th century God,

155
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,680
not a nice modern user friendly God.

156
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,280
Little wonder then if these were the
official teachings of the church that the

157
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:31,820
greater part of the population preferred
to explain their misfortunes in terms

158
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:36,800
of just bad luck or their
neglect of protective magic
or perhaps the malevolence

159
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:38,780
of evil spirits and malicious neighbors.

160
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:41,661
Well,

161
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:46,661
this world of popular magic had long
existed and it was long to enjoy.

162
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,110
You can find much of it's still alive
and well deep into the 19th century

163
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,770
and it endured because in
various ways it helped,

164
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,680
but the problem of witchcraft
is altogether more distinctive.

165
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,400
That involved a specific kind of magic,

166
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,180
the causing of injury or death by
the malevolent and malicious use of

167
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:16,050
supernatural powers against
another or their property.

168
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:20,610
And that was the practice
which was known as Malefic Iom.

169
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:26,210
That's the Latin legal term which was
used for this [inaudible] magic and

170
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:31,830
concern with witchcraft in this way
had a quite distinct chronology.

171
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,060
The possibility of malevolent magic
had always been there of course,

172
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,300
but concern with it was undoubtedly at
an unusual height in the late 16th and

173
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,640
earlier 17th centuries.

174
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,440
And the key to why that was so is perhaps
to be found in what the historian of

175
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:52,980
the Spanish inquisition,

176
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:57,981
Henry Cayman has described as a peculiarly
horrible conjunction in European

177
00:09:58,741 --> 00:09:59,574
history.

178
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:00,540
I conjunction,

179
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,021
he says,

180
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:06,021
between popular superstition on the one
hand and ecclesiastical fantasy on the

181
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:08,370
other,

182
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,870
the fantasies of churchmen,

183
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:14,640
the popular superstitious element
doesn't need any further elaboration.

184
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:15,091
Of course,

185
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:19,320
it had always been the case that some
individuals were regarded as having this

186
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:22,140
special access to occult power,

187
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,290
the element of ecclesiastical fantasy.

188
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,213
However,

189
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,370
that was something that was
peculiar to western Christendom.

190
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,680
You don't find it in
the orthodox tradition,

191
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,440
and it was peculiar to the early modern
period emerging at the end of this 15th

192
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:42,441
century and growing in strength in the
16th essentially it involved the belief

193
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:49,700
that all witchcraft in fact
involved worship of the devil.

194
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,050
And as a result,

195
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,340
the elaboration of a stereotype
of the witch which portrayed,

196
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:58,200
which is not merely as

197
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,700
dabblers in magic or perpetrators
of mollifies against neighbors,

198
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,510
but as something much more
serious members of an organized,

199
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,840
diabolical and malevolent cult,

200
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,770
not just village wise
women or cutting men,

201
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,660
but enemies of God

202
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,700
throughout continental Europe
and indeed in Scotland.

203
00:11:29,701 --> 00:11:30,534
Also,

204
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:36,530
the result of these beliefs was that the
main driving force behind the spasmodic

205
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,130
witch hunts,

206
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:43,130
which can be found in the period was
probably religious zeal and the great with

207
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:44,701
chance,

208
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:46,920
which would be found
scattered across Europe,

209
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:52,580
died back only when the judges came to
doubt the reality of that stereotype of

210
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:59,281
the witch and came to doubt the notion
that witchcraft was an organized cult

211
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,610
threatening to Christian society,

212
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,360
one of the first legal
jurisdictions to make that decision.

213
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,610
That whole thing was
just a terrible error,

214
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,320
was in fact the Spanish inquisition when
doesn't usually associate the Spanish

215
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:16,270
inquisition with progressive movements.

216
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,770
But in 16,

217
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:18,071
10,

218
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,930
they were the first to abandoned,

219
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,620
to refuse to deal with cases of this kind.

220
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,191
Uh,

221
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,180
the French parliament,

222
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,050
uh,

223
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,570
again did so in 1640 some years later,

224
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,370
so it gradually died away.

225
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:33,910
But throughout both Catholic
and Protestant Europe,

226
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,153
for some time,

227
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,570
there was a unity in the war
against which is as enemies of God.

228
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:41,651
Well,

229
00:12:41,651 --> 00:12:44,680
how far was that pattern true of England?

230
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,190
The usual answer is that
it wasn't true of England.

231
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,800
And that was for several reasons.

232
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,530
First of all,

233
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,860
the authorities in England never
actually embraced the full ecclesiastical

234
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:05,500
stereotype of witchcraft as
evidence of a diet of membership,

235
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,970
of a diabolical cult.

236
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,280
Continental European ideas
about the nature of witchcraft
was certainly known in

237
00:13:12,281 --> 00:13:13,114
England.

238
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,330
Books from Europe were
read by the educated,

239
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,050
and these ideas were disseminated
by a number of English writers,

240
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,220
usually clergyman,

241
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:21,880
uh,

242
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:25,150
particularly from the
1580s or thereabouts.

243
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,420
Gradually such notions did seep into
popular beliefs and you begin to find them

244
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,720
at the popular level.

245
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:34,570
By the mid to late 17th century.

246
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,040
But nevertheless,

247
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:41,080
that notion of the nature of witchcraft
didn't have much influence on English

248
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,003
law,

249
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,410
which was never prosecuted
as a heresy in England.

250
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,920
The first act which was passed against
sit in 1542 made it a felony or any crime

251
00:13:53,921 --> 00:13:54,551
that was a felony,

252
00:13:54,551 --> 00:13:55,570
carried the death penalty,

253
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,610
made it a felony to practice
witchcraft for unlawful purposes,

254
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,000
but that act was only on the statute
book for five years and it was repealed.

255
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,310
After that there was actually
no law against witchcraft,

256
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,630
but nearly 20 years.

257
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,320
Then in 1563 there was a new act.

258
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,980
It was made a felony to
invoke evil spirits and to um,

259
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,470
if they were invoked to
cause the death of another,

260
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,650
then execution was the
punishment otherwise,

261
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,210
which is where to be imprisoned or put
in the pillory and face death only for a

262
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:29,050
second offense.

263
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,850
Then finally in 1,604 came a third act.

264
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,730
It elaborated on the 1563 act.

265
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:41,560
It made it a felony to be which anyone
too other than death or their injury

266
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,710
for lesser forms of sorcery,

267
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,370
people faced imprisonment and
death for a second defense,

268
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,100
but some elements of
continental European ideas.

269
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:55,070
We're beginning to creep in
at last into this third act.

270
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:55,963
For example,

271
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:00,770
it was made a felony to dig up dead
bodies for the purposes of practicing

272
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:01,963
witchcraft,

273
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,040
exactly why they were concerned with that.

274
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:04,761
They don't explain,

275
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:06,470
but that was one of
the clauses of the act.

276
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,740
It was also made a felony to consult
with or to feed an evil spirit for any

277
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:13,184
purpose.

278
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:19,510
So some elements of the notion of
dye diabolical pact and the like.

279
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:23,960
We're beginning to creep in,

280
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,480
but not all of the kind of
stereotype of witchcraft,

281
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:32,690
which was well known north of the border
in Scotland or in continental Europe.

282
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,220
Witchcraft remains seen as
not specifically diabolical,

283
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:41,870
but rather as Keith Thomas
puts it and antisocial crime,

284
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,190
very unusual one,

285
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:48,460
but an antisocial crime rather than a
form of heresy and that characteristic

286
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:54,550
that it's treated as a specific kind of
crime comes out in the trial evidence.

287
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,160
For example in English witchcraft trials,

288
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,290
it's very rare to find any reference to
making packs with the devil you get the

289
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,090
odd one in the 17th century,

290
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:10,091
but there few so no diabolical packs
really know which is sabots at which which

291
00:16:12,921 --> 00:16:17,921
is met and fisted danced
with the devil and so forth.

292
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:20,990
Very little sex with devils in English,

293
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,860
witchcraft trials.

294
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:24,710
So that was a prominent
feature in continental trials.

295
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:25,851
English,

296
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,290
which is didn't fly.

297
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,900
They didn't have much
fun at all really um,

298
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,711
English which has,

299
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:35,090
did however have pets.

300
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,530
They had imps and familiars
as they were known,

301
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,730
usually small animals and they seem to
have been part of popular beliefs in

302
00:16:43,731 --> 00:16:44,160
England,

303
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,440
which would have a familiar,

304
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,120
which could act on her behalf.

305
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:48,171
They'll steal a camp,

306
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:48,711
for example,

307
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:51,080
was alleged to have had four familiars,

308
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,490
two cats,

309
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,773
a toad,

310
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,390
which was called pigging and the lamb,

311
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,710
which was called Tiffin.

312
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:05,170
What the English trials focused on first
and foremost was simple [inaudible]

313
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,853
acts.

314
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:12,670
Other elements usually entered only in
a handful of notorious cause celebs,

315
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,750
which is we're always
condemned for malefic IA

316
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,530
and they were hanged rather than burn.

317
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,543
It was a crime,

318
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:23,563
not a heresy.

319
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,600
Secondly,

320
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,630
particular witchcraft prosecutions were
rarely instigated from above in England.

321
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,340
That's another important difference.

322
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,690
There is no evidence that the
authorities actually wanted a witch hunt.

323
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:42,370
One outstanding exception
to this generalization was
the activities in 1645 to

324
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:47,210
47 of a witch finder
called Matthew Hopkins,

325
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,550
who operated in East Anglia and
to all intents and purposes,

326
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:54,840
hired himself out as a consultant
for the discovery of witches.

327
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,760
That was an organized witch hunt from
which Matthew Hopkins personally profit.

328
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,640
But it's the only really outstanding
example of such an outbreak in the history

329
00:18:05,131 --> 00:18:06,240
of witchcraft in England.

330
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,960
It's made the subject of a
wonderful Vincent Price movie,

331
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:10,650
uh,

332
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,850
30 years or so ago,

333
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,960
which find a general,

334
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,130
which I do recommend.

335
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,720
It got nothing to do with the history,

336
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,010
but it's a great movie.

337
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,133
Okay,

338
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,800
so which craft prosecutions in
England tended not to come in?

339
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,390
These witch hunts would,

340
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:26,130
would bring hundreds of cases.

341
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:30,420
They didn't come in great waves with
the major exception of Matthew Hopkins's

342
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,403
activities.

343
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,000
They were sporadic.

344
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,260
They were occasional,

345
00:18:34,261 --> 00:18:36,990
they came up one or two
at a time and so forth.

346
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:38,731
In addition,

347
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:39,870
in English law,

348
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:45,230
torture was not used except in state
certain state trials when it was specially

349
00:18:46,021 --> 00:18:49,710
authorized by the Privy Council
in day to day trials taught,

350
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,371
he was not used.

351
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:54,930
Whereas it was routinely used in many
jurisdictions in continental Europe and

352
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:56,160
indeed in Scotland.

353
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,390
As a result,

354
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,940
people were not tortured into confessing.

355
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,310
As a result,

356
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:07,310
large numbers of people were
not implicated by people
under torture who named

357
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:09,204
names.

358
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,060
What you get in the witchcraft statistics
from the English courts is really a

359
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:20,061
lot of individual prosecutions brought
from below by the alleged victims of

360
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:25,770
witchcraft seeking redress in the
courts just like any other crime.

361
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,450
So there are some important differences
in the way all of this was handled in

362
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:31,284
the law.

363
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,280
Nevertheless,

364
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,660
England did share in the General European
preoccupation with witchcraft even

365
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:38,220
though to a lesser extent

366
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,610
just how far it shed is not fully known.

367
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,600
That's because the relevant legal records
don't survive for every area of the

368
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:49,434
country.

369
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,150
They survive pretty fully,

370
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,850
but the whole of the southeast
and for the county of Cheshire,

371
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,380
but for other parts of the country,

372
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:58,380
they tend to survive only
from the 17th century.

373
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,520
A point which is relatively late
in the history of this crime,

374
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,890
but where we do have the evidence,

375
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,410
one of the striking features is that the
trials appear to have been relatively

376
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:13,620
rare except for the home circuit,

377
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,000
the counties around London.

378
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,880
If you look at the a handout,

379
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,260
if you look at the two graphs,

380
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:26,810
graph a gives you the trials which
took place in different sized circuits

381
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:33,560
and the line at the top showing
the real spike is the home circuit.

382
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,790
You can see how there are vastly more
cases being heard in the whole home

383
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:43,260
circuit than in any other jurisdiction
for which we have the records.

384
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,950
The second spike is Matthew Hopkins
operating in 16 five but the first spike,

385
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:54,190
as you'll see it was in the later years
of Elizabeth and even within the home

386
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:54,730
circuit,

387
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:55,563
this area,

388
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,950
the cases came predominantly
from one part of it,

389
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,610
the county of Essex to the east of London.

390
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,520
If you look at the second graph graph,

391
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:07,810
be there,

392
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:12,811
you have the different counties of the
home circuit broken down and it's clear

393
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:18,061
enough that Essex is
absolutely outstanding in
terms of the numbers of cases

394
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:19,720
which came from that county.

395
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,470
To give you some actual figures in
the whole of the reign of Elizabeth,

396
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,920
the county of Hartfordshire,

397
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,410
which is just to the north of London,

398
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,790
quite a populous county produced
only 24 witchcraft cases.

399
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,530
The county of Sussex,

400
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,680
large county to the south of London
produced only 14 the county of Essex

401
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:50,310
produced 172 in fact between 50 and 60
and 1680 270 individuals were prosecuted

402
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:57,430
for witchcraft in Essex.

403
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,710
Whereas in comparison,

404
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:04,711
taking a county of similar
size and similar population
in the period between 50

405
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:09,871
and 80 and 1,709 only 34 were prosecuted
in the county of Cheshire for which we

406
00:22:12,011 --> 00:22:13,090
have good evidence.

407
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,470
So Cheshire 34 Essex 270

408
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,440
in general.

409
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,600
Most of the trials for which we have
evidence took place in the last quarter of

410
00:22:25,601 --> 00:22:29,710
the 16th century in the home
circuit and in Essex in particular,

411
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:35,010
they were at their peak between the
1570s and the early 1590s looking at the

412
00:22:36,911 --> 00:22:37,930
country as a whole,

413
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,660
trials become very rare everywhere.

414
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:45,690
After about 16 to 20 the numbers are
falling away after about 1620 with again,

415
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:51,040
the notable exception of the activities
of Matthew Hopkins in the mid to late

416
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,280
1640s which caused a new peak of
concern within a downward trend.

417
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,661
Well,

418
00:22:58,661 --> 00:22:59,770
that downward trend,

419
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:04,800
the decline of witchcraft cases after
around 1620 is something which historians

420
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:09,640
have found relatively easy to explain.

421
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:13,240
The decline can be
explained in number of ways.

422
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,613
First of all,

423
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:20,220
from at least the 1580s
some of the justices of the
peace and the assize judges

424
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:25,891
who had to handle these cases were
very worried about the difficulties of

425
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:28,180
proving witchcraft.

426
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,210
They weren't necessarily skeptical.

427
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,510
They frequently believe that
witchcraft was possible,

428
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,790
but how could you prove in law that
a particular individual was actually

429
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:42,880
responsible unless they confessed?

430
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,870
How could you prove that something was
caused by witchcraft rather than by

431
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,010
natural causes?

432
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:49,311
If,

433
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:49,911
for example,

434
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:51,560
someone died of a lingering illness

435
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,120
and even if it was witchcraft,

436
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,703
who did it,

437
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,940
so they were worried about the problem
of proof and they talked about it.

438
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,900
In witchcraft cases,

439
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:09,160
normal rules of evidence could
not apply and this bothered them.

440
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,140
Increasingly in the 17th century,

441
00:24:11,141 --> 00:24:15,370
lawyers who were worried about all of
this became very unwilling to entertain

442
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:15,911
cases.

443
00:24:15,911 --> 00:24:20,911
They tried to talk people
into not prosecuting or they
or they or they insisted

444
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,660
upon additional evidence if
a case was to go forward.

445
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,430
In addition from the early
17th century onwards,

446
00:24:30,431 --> 00:24:35,431
there seems to have been an actual decline
amongst educated people in belief in

447
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:38,320
the very possibility of witchcraft.

448
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,170
The conviction grew that it was a fantasy
which had been projected onto wretched

449
00:24:44,171 --> 00:24:46,600
people by hysterical neighbors.

450
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:52,770
The conviction grew that the accused did
not have the occultic powers that were

451
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:54,460
claimed,

452
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:58,420
even if they thought they
did so they were frauds.

453
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,640
And in the later 17th century there
was the growth of awareness of the

454
00:25:03,641 --> 00:25:05,410
mechanical philosophy of psoriasis.

455
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,440
Newton who regarded the university as
having been created by God and subjected

456
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,330
to laws which were immutable.

457
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:18,400
You could not tamper with God's natural
doors through using spells and the like.

458
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,900
Well all of this probably had its
influence in the course of the decline of

459
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:30,640
witchcraft prosecutions though initially
it's most likely that it was the legal

460
00:25:30,641 --> 00:25:31,240
concern,

461
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,540
the young willingness of some lawyers
and judges to handle these cases,

462
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:39,870
which was the main cause of the falling
off noticeable by the early 17th

463
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:41,554
century.

464
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,690
So in these various ways,

465
00:25:43,691 --> 00:25:48,691
one can perhaps satisfactorily explain
the decline of concern with witchcraft,

466
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,340
but we still have to explain the
16th century rise of concern.

467
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,130
And that turns out to
be much more difficult,

468
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:04,430
much more difficult because this seems
to have been genuine popular concern with

469
00:26:05,821 --> 00:26:07,650
cases coming up from below.

470
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,161
One calm,

471
00:26:09,161 --> 00:26:12,690
simply explain it in terms
of the activities of a
number of bishops are judges

472
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,870
the dominant explanation.

473
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,970
It was put forward some years ago by
Keith Thomas and Alan Mcfarlane and two of

474
00:26:22,971 --> 00:26:27,971
the pioneering works on this subject and
they explained the rise of witchcraft

475
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,920
prosecutions in terms of a detailed
examination of the circumstances of

476
00:26:33,921 --> 00:26:35,060
surviving cases,

477
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,410
which is we're usually women and
they were frequently elderly women,

478
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,840
which is where usually accused
of bewitching neighbors
within their own village,

479
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,990
not strangers or was
neighbors people they knew,

480
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:57,300
which is often poorer
than the alleged victims.

481
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:03,560
This suggested that the accusations were
therefore arising from tensions between

482
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:09,050
relatively marginal women in the village
community and better off neighbors who

483
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:11,430
might be men or women.

484
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,400
Then they looked at the known
circumstances of cases and the classic

485
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:19,800
circumstances were more
or less as follows.

486
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:24,990
A quarrel would occur between
neighbors ending in one of them,

487
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,480
the supposed which going away,

488
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:29,190
cursing or muttering.

489
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,340
The victim would then suffer
some form of personal misfortune.

490
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:41,070
The victim would then begin to entertain
suspicion that they'd been bewitched.

491
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,920
They would talk to other neighbors,

492
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:48,270
some of who might have similar suspicions
about the person they suspected.

493
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,980
A person would then be identified as a
possible which as a malevolent person in

494
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:56,100
the eyes of the village,

495
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:02,330
it's possible that some of those who were
so accused did practice magic and did

496
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,510
believe themselves to
have the power to harm.

497
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:12,120
And to some extent they may even have
used it as a form of begging with menace.

498
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,010
The corals between neighbors,

499
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:19,011
which initiated cases very often began
when someone was turned away having been

500
00:28:19,201 --> 00:28:22,170
begging or asking for
a favor of some kind.

501
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:27,840
It's possible that some of these marginal
women responded to being gradually

502
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:31,020
identified as witches by playing the part,

503
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,170
by scaring their neighbors as it were,

504
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,240
into meeting their needs.

505
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,230
That could go on for years and often did,

506
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:45,350
but eventually some incident serious
enough to trigger off an actual court

507
00:28:46,381 --> 00:28:47,730
prosecution would occur,

508
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,990
perhaps a death,

509
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,420
something of unusual seriousness.

510
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,340
When that happened,

511
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,440
someone would bring an accusation,

512
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,330
other neighbors would chime in.

513
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,300
There were lots of such accusations.

514
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:00,780
Um,

515
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,670
Alan McFarland founded in Essex.

516
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,660
There were,

517
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,950
there was an average of four
accusers for each accused week,

518
00:29:06,951 --> 00:29:09,570
so other people would chime
in with their suspicions.

519
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,810
Supplementary proofs might be looked for.

520
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,681
For example,

521
00:29:13,681 --> 00:29:18,681
the witches mark existence on the witches
body of a award or mo or other mark,

522
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:24,900
which seem to be insensitive to pain
and which was thought to be the place at

523
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:27,990
which the witches familiar
would feed on her blood.

524
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,940
If they found such a thing,

525
00:29:29,941 --> 00:29:33,270
it was considered additional proof
and the which might be found guilty

526
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,450
fine.

527
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:36,691
Well,

528
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:40,860
those do indeed seem to have been
what one can think of as the classic

529
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,910
circumstances though there were,

530
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,620
they were by no means unusual.

531
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,250
Witchcraft accusations could
arise in other contexts.

532
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,241
They could arise,

533
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:50,050
for example,

534
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:54,730
as a result of personal rivalries in local
politics and accusation of witchcraft

535
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:59,731
was something which was easy to throw
at another person in order to discredit

536
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:00,400
them.

537
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,080
So there are other circumstances.

538
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:03,250
Not all witches were women,

539
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,100
some were men though most
of the women and so on.

540
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,110
But these do appear to have
been the classic circumstances.

541
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:17,130
Why then should the late 16th and early
17th centuries have seen a peak of such

542
00:30:17,411 --> 00:30:22,411
accusations because surely one could
find such circumstances earlier and one

543
00:30:22,541 --> 00:30:23,500
could find them later.

544
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:27,460
Why was that the peak period of anxiety,

545
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,780
Thomason Mcfarland suggest first of all,

546
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:37,270
it was partly because of the loss of
the protective magic which had been

547
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:39,610
supplied by the medieval church.

548
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,740
The Church of England allowed the
belief in witchcraft to continue,

549
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:49,830
but it wouldn't offer ecclesiastical
means of counter magic and it forbade

550
00:30:51,611 --> 00:30:53,350
people to resort to them.

551
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,540
If that was the case,

552
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,510
then bringing a legal accusation,

553
00:30:59,030 --> 00:30:59,950
a trial,

554
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,080
and eventually seeking an execution
would be the only way out of the impasse.

555
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,940
A second part of the explanation is that
the reason for so many late 16th and

556
00:31:09,941 --> 00:31:14,800
early 17th century trials was that
because that period was one of unusual

557
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:18,970
tensions within village
society within neighborhoods,

558
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,801
it was a period,

559
00:31:20,801 --> 00:31:22,780
as we know of economic distress,

560
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:26,170
one which saw a declining
position for the poor,

561
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:29,120
especially perhaps the
elderly and marginal poured,

562
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,580
the widowed and so forth.

563
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:36,060
The poor laws had not yet been fully put
into effect to provide for such people,

564
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:41,620
neighbors who themselves were feeling
the pinch might be less willing to show

565
00:31:41,621 --> 00:31:42,454
charity,

566
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:43,810
less willing to help.

567
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,790
They might feel uncomfortable about that.

568
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,430
They might feel rather guilty about that.

569
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,770
That's my prey on their minds and
make them sensitive to misfortunes,

570
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:57,520
which they saw as the revenge of people
to whom they had refused charity.

571
00:31:57,730 --> 00:31:59,030
People who had perhaps custom

572
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:04,750
accusing such a person of witchcraft was
a way of severing their responsibility.

573
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:07,120
Assuaging their feeling of guilt,

574
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,240
transferring it to the accused,

575
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,433
which

576
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,433
well,

577
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,540
all of this is an ingenious explanation,

578
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:21,990
which may well hold a great deal of truth
and it's indeed widely accepted as an

579
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:27,460
account of a sociology and
psychology of accusations.

580
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,291
Recently,

581
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:34,291
that explanation of Thomas and Macfarlane
has been elaborated by more focus upon

582
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:37,480
the fact that most of those accused
of witchcraft would of course,

583
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:38,314
women.

584
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:43,700
The tensions within neighborhoods seem
to have come to focus upon punitive

585
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:45,260
action against women.

586
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,153
Above all,

587
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,113
why was that?

588
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:52,370
Thomas and Mcfarland suggest that it was
simply a product of the fact that most

589
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:57,410
of the economically marginal and most
of the agent in particular were indeed

590
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,483
poor women.

591
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,361
Some feminists.

592
00:33:00,361 --> 00:33:05,361
Writers see it as more sinister as
constituting an attack upon women who buy

593
00:33:07,521 --> 00:33:08,960
their social situation,

594
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:14,260
or perhaps they're aggressive
personalities stood outside
the normal controls of

595
00:33:14,931 --> 00:33:16,310
the patriarchal household.

596
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,220
It's an important issue,

597
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,890
but one has to pause.

598
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:26,150
I think before jumping to the conclusion
that witch hunting was in effect a form

599
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,980
of repression of women.

600
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:33,880
Certainly it was the case that the
Association of witchcraft with women's

601
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:34,760
specifically,

602
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:39,770
which was universal derived in large
part from fundamentally misogynistic

603
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,633
attitudes,

604
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,310
women were seen as being morally weaker,

605
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,760
as more prone to temptation as more
likely to use account means to revenge

606
00:33:49,671 --> 00:33:53,030
themselves upon their neighbors
spells where the weapons of the weak.

607
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:55,783
However,

608
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,680
witchcraft prosecutions,

609
00:33:57,681 --> 00:34:02,681
we're not simply a patriarchal drive
against marginal aggressive or troublesome

610
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,973
women.

611
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:07,340
The magistrates who
heard the cases were men,

612
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,270
but the accusers themselves
were very often other women.

613
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,220
The work of James Sharp reveals how
many of the suspicions that led to

614
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:21,200
accusations actually arose in the
female's spheres of village life.

615
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,870
They will often initiated by other women.

616
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,100
Women themselves felt threatened by
witchcraft and would deeply involved in

617
00:34:28,101 --> 00:34:30,800
identifying and accusing witches.

618
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,620
And on the other hand,

619
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,330
many of the juries,

620
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,010
universally male who heard these cases,

621
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,230
failed to believe them.

622
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:46,370
Many accused witches were
acquitted by male juries.

623
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,730
The gender element then is clearly there,

624
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,900
but it's complex.

625
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,880
It's paradoxical.

626
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,000
These issues remain far from resolved.

627
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,480
Um,

628
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,310
but they add further complexity.

629
00:34:58,311 --> 00:35:02,570
Do any discussion of the sociology
of witchcraft accusation.

630
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,700
There are a number of other problems also,

631
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,630
um,

632
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,220
to which I need to draw your attention.

633
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:14,990
Problems relating not so much to
the sociology of specific witchcraft

634
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:15,824
accusations,

635
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:19,280
but to the history of
witchcraft as a crime.

636
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:19,940
Um,

637
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,060
two questions in particular
arise in the English case.

638
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,290
First of all,

639
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,640
why would the witchcraft statutes
passed in the first place?

640
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,010
And secondly,

641
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,510
once they were past,

642
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:37,870
why did such an utterly disproportionate
number of the cases arise in the county

643
00:35:38,791 --> 00:35:39,624
of Essex?

644
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,710
Essex seems to be wholly
unusual so far as one can tell.

645
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,970
If there were neighborhood tensions
which were acute in the county of Essex

646
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,960
leading to such accusations,

647
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:57,000
why were there not such neighborhood
tensions in the counties of Kent or Sussex

648
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,140
or Hartfordshire,

649
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,130
all of which were places which had a great
deal in common with Essex in terms of

650
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:04,980
social structure and local
economy and so forth.

651
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,750
Why Essex?

652
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,431
Well,

653
00:36:08,431 --> 00:36:09,720
some brief suggestions.

654
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,880
First of all,

655
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,290
as regardless of the laws,

656
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:18,800
I think it's worth considering that
these laws were passed when they were

657
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,990
perhaps because of a
convergence of two things.

658
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,333
First of all,

659
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:28,050
both of the major witchcraft statutes in
England were passed at the beginning of

660
00:36:28,051 --> 00:36:29,160
new regimes.

661
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:32,040
One in Elizabeth second parliament,

662
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,160
one in the first parliament of King James,

663
00:36:35,161 --> 00:36:36,720
the sixth and first.

664
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,980
It makes one wonder whether there
was an element in this legislation of

665
00:36:40,981 --> 00:36:44,520
symbolism that acts on this subject.

666
00:36:44,521 --> 00:36:49,521
We're past perhaps as part of the
propaganda of a new regime that passing

667
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:56,781
statutes of this nature in a sense
conferred legitimacy on new regimes by

668
00:36:57,961 --> 00:37:02,961
showing their firms stance against a
particularly symbolically charged form of

669
00:37:04,141 --> 00:37:09,141
deviants to be opposed to witchcraft was
in a sense a declaration of legitimacy.

670
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:17,610
The acts may have had then a certain
symbolic function when they were passed

671
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,010
through parliament without
opposition so far as we can tell.

672
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,193
Secondly,

673
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,980
another element of the timing of the act
is the fact that there may have been an

674
00:37:25,981 --> 00:37:30,981
element of political
contingency specifically in
the form of suspected threats

675
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:38,240
to the person of demonic in 1561 two
years before the 1563 act was brought

676
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:40,464
forward.

677
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:45,570
A plot had been discovered in which
sorcery was allegedly being used against

678
00:37:45,571 --> 00:37:47,030
Elizabeth Williams.

679
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:50,340
Sessile was horrified to find when
the plot was uncovered that there was

680
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:52,560
actually nothing under
statute book forbidding it.

681
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:57,330
This may have been a contingent political
reason for moving ahead with the

682
00:37:57,331 --> 00:37:58,380
witchcraft statute.

683
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,380
It may have persuaded him to go along
with one or two of the bishops who were

684
00:38:02,381 --> 00:38:05,550
themselves interested in having
legislation on this issue.

685
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,490
That's an interpretation then which
might be particularly relevant to the

686
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:13,650
passage of the 1563 act.

687
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:18,980
Though the full details of its passage
through parliament remain unknown,

688
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:21,480
the documentation is too poor.

689
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,180
The act of 1,604 is a
lot clearer following the
acception of James the Sixth of

690
00:38:27,181 --> 00:38:29,160
Scotland as James the first of England.

691
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:34,860
He was a man with a profound
interest in witchcraft.

692
00:38:34,861 --> 00:38:36,970
He'd a book about it and
the subject in school.

693
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,440
He'd written a book about the subject in
Scotland following his act session and

694
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:43,000
the Union of Crowns.

695
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:47,410
The witchcraft statutes of both England
and Scotland were overhauled and revised

696
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,440
by a committee of judges and bishops.

697
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,530
This again may have been a symbolic act.

698
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:54,670
They decided to do it.

699
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,600
Then why?

700
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:59,680
Then it's a new regime and a
new act was passed in Scotland.

701
00:38:59,681 --> 00:39:00,514
At the same time,

702
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:06,370
it may have been helped along again
by the fact that in 1,604 there was a

703
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:07,660
particularly notorious,

704
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:09,850
which could have case in London itself,

705
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,300
which may have drawn attention
to the problem once again.

706
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,580
So what I'm suggesting is that these
acts of parliament were essentially

707
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:22,000
introduced as legitimizing symbols,

708
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:27,030
good and godly laws introduced
by good and godly regimes.

709
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:31,510
Yet there's no evidence that
the authorities that put
them on the statute book

710
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,790
actually wanted a witch hunt.

711
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:36,070
If they'd wanted one,

712
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,113
they could have had one,

713
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:38,763
but they didn't.

714
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:44,370
What they did was to make witchcraft
prosecutions possible in the royal courts.

715
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,500
And to that extent,

716
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:50,530
the political and ecclesiastical elite

717
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,470
had a bigger role in making possible the,

718
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:56,970
the,

719
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:57,880
the prosecutions,

720
00:39:57,881 --> 00:40:00,190
which took place then is often recognized.

721
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:06,250
So one can perhaps explain why the actual
put on the statute book and that kind

722
00:40:06,251 --> 00:40:07,084
of way,

723
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,730
but that still leaves
the problem of Essex.

724
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,460
Why Essex?

725
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:18,900
Is it possible that Essex as a local
society was peculiarly conscious of the

726
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:21,940
threat of witchcraft?

727
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:28,470
But why should that be so it's quite
clear that people might feel threatened by

728
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,930
malefic IOM in any part of England.

729
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,760
Why should they act against it so
much more in the county of Essex

730
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:43,500
and the only suggestion I can make on
that issue is that the use of the criminal

731
00:40:43,871 --> 00:40:48,871
law against which is had had
terrible publicity in Essex.

732
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:55,320
Essex was unusual in the sense that
it's sore three cause celebs three group

733
00:40:56,171 --> 00:40:57,004
trials.

734
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:02,070
They took place in 1566 only three
years after the passage of Elizabeth's

735
00:41:02,071 --> 00:41:07,071
statute in 1582 and in 1589 in each of
these cases and initial accusation was

736
00:41:11,831 --> 00:41:16,831
vigorously pursued by local justices
of the peace who happened to have a

737
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:20,590
particular personal
concern about witchcraft.

738
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,710
That meant that instead of just
one person going on trials,

739
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:28,711
small groups of women went on trial and
these trials were well publicized in

740
00:41:30,101 --> 00:41:34,070
pamphlets which were written about
them and which survive to this day.

741
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:36,950
You can read them on early
English books online.

742
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,720
All of this then may have given peculiar
publicity to witchcraft as a threat and

743
00:41:46,461 --> 00:41:49,010
what could be done about it when one does.

744
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:54,011
Then whether a number of particularly
scandalous local cases occurring in this

745
00:41:54,201 --> 00:41:59,201
county had the effect of heightening
anxiety about witchcraft within Essex,

746
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,240
enhancing the sense of threat,

747
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:06,230
which people felt making it
more intense than elsewhere.

748
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:12,010
And of course providing an object
lesson in how to deal with it.

749
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:19,090
So are we dealing then with a moral panic
breaking out within a particular local

750
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,203
society,

751
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:25,570
which subsequently died down in the
17th century until it was artificially

752
00:42:25,851 --> 00:42:29,120
revived again by the
activities of Matthew Hopkins,

753
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:32,240
to which find a general in 1645

754
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:35,973
yeah.

755
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:36,231
Well,

756
00:42:36,231 --> 00:42:39,620
Sheila camp incidentally was one of
the women tried in one of those group

757
00:42:39,621 --> 00:42:40,150
trials,

758
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,330
the one of 1582

759
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:47,780
so to conclude the whole issue
of the history of witchcraft,

760
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:52,930
why people were so concerned with it at
a particular point in time is clearly,

761
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,940
enormously complex.

762
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,700
But what I'm suggesting is that first,

763
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:04,930
the case of England was different to a
degree from what was going on elsewhere

764
00:43:05,811 --> 00:43:06,950
in Europe at the time.

765
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:12,800
There were no mass witch hunts to marry
popular superstition and ecclesiastical

766
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:16,760
fantasy and the way one found in
various parts of Europe and in Scotland,

767
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:17,871
Matthew Hopkins,

768
00:43:17,871 --> 00:43:18,704
excepted.

769
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,560
Secondly in England,

770
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:26,660
which craft prosecutions did come up
spontaneously from below and they probably

771
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:33,041
usually arose in pretty much the way
Thomas and Macfarlane and James Sharp have

772
00:43:34,521 --> 00:43:37,700
suggested as far as individual
cases were concerned,

773
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:41,870
though it was an accusation which could
also be used for malicious prosecution

774
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,550
and was so used.

775
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:46,250
But thirdly,

776
00:43:46,730 --> 00:43:51,730
these cases could only arise because of
the existence of laws which were perhaps

777
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:55,880
essentially symbolic and
contingent in their origins

778
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,540
and their once those laws existed.

779
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,553
Fourthly,

780
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:03,830
the cases arose only sporadically.

781
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:09,520
The sense we have of a
definite chronological pattern
in witchcraft prosecutions

782
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,330
is very heavily influenced,

783
00:44:11,331 --> 00:44:14,480
as you've seen by the case of Essex alone.

784
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:19,610
Essex does seem to have been
unique for very special reasons,

785
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,420
which we may never be able
to do more than to guess that

786
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,500
elsewhere in the country
cases a row sporadically,

787
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,730
occasionally,

788
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:34,230
no clear pattern beyond the fact that
they were more common in the late 16th

789
00:44:34,231 --> 00:44:35,670
century than later.

790
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:42,740
And finally there was no English witch
hunt because at the end of the day,

791
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:47,430
the authorities in both church
and state didn't want one.

792
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:53,270
They never felt sufficiently threatened
to instigate one against those.

793
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,110
They deemed the enemies.

794
00:44:55,530 --> 00:45:00,530
The potential for a witch hunt was there
and it long continued village tensions

795
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:02,880
hadn't faded.

796
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:08,490
The difference of the 17th century from
the latest 16th century was above all

797
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:12,870
that the judicial authorities not
only failed to seek a witch hunt,

798
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:18,350
but actually became active in suppressing
the accusations which were brought

799
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:19,763
before them.

800
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,950
So then I suspect that overall both
the rise and the fall of witchcraft

801
00:45:25,951 --> 00:45:30,951
prosecution is best explained by the
way in which the law first of all gave

802
00:45:31,141 --> 00:45:36,141
people and then later took away from them
the opportunity to settle a particular

803
00:45:37,051 --> 00:45:41,610
kind of personal conflict through the
use of the law and the prosecution of

804
00:45:41,611 --> 00:45:43,230
people to their deaths.

805
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,750
The beliefs behind all of that,

806
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,600
we're very ancient and the long continued,

807
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:52,680
but the history of witchcraft is very
much to do with the use of the criminal

808
00:45:52,681 --> 00:45:54,480
law in the way I've described.

809
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,650
The crucial issue was perhaps
that for a short while,

810
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,330
for two generations,

811
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:05,690
there was indeed a conjunction
of longstanding patterns
of popular belief with a

812
00:46:06,001 --> 00:46:11,001
shorter term enhancement of the anxieties
and the credulousness of the elite.

813
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:17,310
It was they who passed the laws that
made witchcraft trials possible.

814
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,430
They later repented of their folly.

815
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:23,910
They avoided the
enforcement of those laws,

816
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:28,350
and eventually in 1736 they repealed them.

817
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:33,620
But that of course was about
150 years too late for us.
