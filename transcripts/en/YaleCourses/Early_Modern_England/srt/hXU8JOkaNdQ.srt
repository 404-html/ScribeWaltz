1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:01,801
Okay.

2
00:00:01,801 --> 00:00:02,041
Well,

3
00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:03,240
in retrospect,

4
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,970
looking back from the
perspective of the 21st century,

5
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:13,971
the reign of Elizabeth the first tends
to Shimmer in the historical imagination.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:15,840
Uh,

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,580
she reigned for 45 years.

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,490
She restored political stability.

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,980
She settled the religious question,

10
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,360
at least for the time being.

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,840
She survived a powerful foreign enemy,

12
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:28,853
Spain.

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,460
And she presided in all of her iconic
splendor over a brilliant court and a

14
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,260
flowering of English literature.

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,060
And at the end of her
last parliament in 1,601,

16
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,700
the 68 year old queen
made her golden speech,

17
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,623
as it's called.

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,880
She told the members of the House of
Commons assembled before her that they may

19
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:55,410
have had mightier monarchs,

20
00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:01,130
but they'd had nun who had shown
greater care to defend them from peril,

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:02,963
dishonor,

22
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:03,930
tyranny,

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,980
and oppression.

24
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:10,730
And she expressed her confidence that
though God hath raised me high yet this,

25
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,980
I count the glory of my crown,

26
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,920
that I have reigned with your love.

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,500
And she invited each member of parliament
to come forward and kiss her hand

28
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,590
before they departed into their countries.

29
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:30,840
And so each member filed forward to
kiss the queen's hand before leaving her

30
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,040
probably knowing that they
would never see her again.

31
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,250
Well,

32
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,990
this is marvelous stuff
and she was great at it.

33
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,330
It's the theater of Majesty.

34
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:51,440
Generations of historians feel the urge
to bow their knees and kiss her hand

35
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:53,244
too.

36
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,630
And me too,

37
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,680
I confess it.

38
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,900
Um,

39
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,680
when the present Queen Elizabeth came
to the throne and I was a little boy at

40
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,150
primary school and our teacher,

41
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,530
Ms Cranston,

42
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,330
the lady who taught me to write,

43
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,673
uh,

44
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,150
told us all the stories about Elizabeth
the first and said that we should grow

45
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:14,010
up to be the new Elizabeth six,

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,460
which was a terrible psychological
burden to place on small children.

47
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,223
Okay.

48
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,190
That's how we tend to look
back on Elizabeth's reign.

49
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,080
But what we have to remember,

50
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,670
of course as historians and,

51
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:30,930
and it's hard to remember,

52
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,890
is that none of this was known in advance.

53
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,160
It's easy to forget the extent to which
her reign was fraught with crises and

54
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:42,324
danger,

55
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,550
especially in its early decades.

56
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,810
The role of her servants
in in some mounting those
dangers and the subtle shifts

57
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,180
which are long reign brought about in
government and in political culture and

58
00:02:56,491 --> 00:02:59,470
the sheer exhausting
struggle of so much of it.

59
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,100
And these are some of the things
that I want to talk about today.

60
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,880
When Elizabeth came to the
throne on the 17th of November,

61
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,210
1558,

62
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:15,210
it was another sign of people's continued
recognition of the legitimacy and the

63
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:18,130
authority of the tutor line.

64
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,390
Even her Catholic counselors
readily accepted her at session,

65
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,360
but the situation was far from stable,

66
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,060
far less stable than it had
been under Henry the eighth,

67
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:28,894
for example.

68
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,210
And that was evident in various ways,

69
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:31,960
uh,

70
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,960
not only in the risks posed by the
clear internal divisions in matters of

71
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:40,120
religion about which I talked last time,

72
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,930
but also an international
situation of considerable danger.

73
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,520
England as an ally of Spain
was at war with France,

74
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,020
the city of Cali,

75
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,380
the last English possession on the
French coast had just been lost.

76
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,260
Elizabeth cousin,

77
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,131
Mary,

78
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:58,090
Queen of Scots.

79
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:03,150
Then age only 16 was married to the
heir to the French thrown and she had a

80
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:08,740
claim to the English throne via her
grandmother and radiates sister.

81
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,750
That raised the possibility of a French
ambition of uniting both Scotland and

82
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:16,180
perhaps England to the French crown.

83
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,021
There was,

84
00:04:18,021 --> 00:04:22,750
at this time a French army in Scotland
supporting Mary's mother who was ruling

85
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:24,700
Scotland in her daughter's absence.

86
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,520
That posed a potential
threat from the north.

87
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:33,690
Spain was currently an ally because of
Mary's marriage to Philip the second,

88
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:38,980
but Spain was also the champion
of research in Catholicism
in Europe and closely

89
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:42,400
identified with Mary's Catholic
restoration in England.

90
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,500
So what my Phillip,

91
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:47,440
the second dude with
Elizabeth on the throne.

92
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,090
So the young queen needed advice,

93
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,490
she needed counsel and it's
the relationship between
Elizabeth and those who

94
00:04:57,491 --> 00:05:02,230
sought to counsel her that gives the
early and most decisive part of her reign.

95
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,690
It's distinctive political flavor

96
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,871
as a sister,

97
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:13,871
Mary had approached death late in 1558
the nucleus of Elizabeth to counsel was

98
00:05:14,051 --> 00:05:19,051
already forming and the central figure
amongst those who advised her was William

99
00:05:19,641 --> 00:05:22,720
sessile later Lord Burley.

100
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:24,431
Now.

101
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,410
Sessile was a somewhat older man.

102
00:05:26,411 --> 00:05:27,940
He was in his mid thirties.

103
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,110
He is nearly always represented in
television and film productions about

104
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:33,490
Elizabeth as an old man,

105
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:34,720
but he was in his mid thirties.

106
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:35,860
At the beginning of her reign.

107
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,640
He was to serve the queen
for no less than 40 years,

108
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,930
and he forged a very close and
remarkable partnership with her,

109
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:47,290
which was truly central
to the Elizabethan regime.

110
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,653
Traditionally,

111
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:54,690
he's portrayed as highly capable
but rather stayed rather dull,

112
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,800
perhaps unimaginative,

113
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,610
congenitally cautious,

114
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,290
a bureaucrat,

115
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,890
but as is increasingly appreciated,

116
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:05,600
this was far from being the whole man.

117
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,050
Certainly he was a very good servant
of the state and he was a judicious,

118
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,130
deliberative person and a
prodigious really hard worker.

119
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:16,750
Uh,

120
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,750
he left behind him,

121
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,100
masses of papers,

122
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,570
many of them in his own hand,

123
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:23,180
which to this day I've
never been fully explored.

124
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,400
He had the habit of working out decisions
which had to be taken by setting up

125
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:33,401
the pros and the cons on any question
in lists in his personal papers.

126
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,360
As he worked his way through,

127
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,990
he called this reasoning
by question upon a matter,

128
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:39,824
uncertain.

129
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,250
It was derived from the methods he'd
learned in his classical education,

130
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,110
but he wasn't simply the queen's
cautious plotting advisor.

131
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:53,111
He also had his own ideas and his own
ideals sessile and some of his closest

132
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:59,471
colleagues in Elizabeth's first council
where essentially Edwardians by which I

133
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:04,370
mean they'd cut their political
teeth in the reign of Edward,

134
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:06,740
the sixth as servants,

135
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,780
junior servants at that time of a regime
that was governed by a privy council in

136
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:14,870
the absence of an adult male ruler.

137
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,740
So sessile was the queen's man,

138
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,290
but he wasn't just the queen's man.

139
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,650
He had a very strong
sense of public service,

140
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:25,580
again,

141
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,260
derived in part from his
classical education and he
had a very strong sense of a

142
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:34,580
state which was independent
of the person of the Monique.

143
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:39,920
He also explicitly subscribed
to the view that in England,

144
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:42,860
sovereignty lay not in the crown alone,

145
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:46,130
but in the crown in parliament.

146
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,840
It was very keen on the notion that the
consent of the whole political nation,

147
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,860
Queen,

148
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,640
Lourdes,

149
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,640
and Commons in parliament
should be obtained for any
major political initiative,

150
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:04,490
strong sense then of
the state as an entity.

151
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,441
And secondly,

152
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:08,750
sessile and his colleagues
had an agenda of their own,

153
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,010
which was essentially the reestablishment
and preservation of the Protestant

154
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,903
state.

155
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,640
He wasn't a dogmatist in religion.

156
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:21,670
He was considerably less advanced
in his religious views towards,

157
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,580
uh,

158
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,770
Protestantism than some of his colleagues.

159
00:08:24,771 --> 00:08:25,491
But nonetheless,

160
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:28,340
he was a sincere adherent
of the reformation.

161
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:29,151
Uh,

162
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:30,830
indeed back in 1552,

163
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:34,910
some of the meetings about the second
Edwardian prayer book had been conducted

164
00:08:34,911 --> 00:08:35,810
in Settles House.

165
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,570
So the importance of
this ideological element,

166
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:46,070
this ideological undertone in the
politics of the early reign of Elizabeth

167
00:08:46,071 --> 00:08:47,510
mustn't be underestimated.

168
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,001
Okay.

169
00:08:50,001 --> 00:08:55,001
Then Elizabeth counselors had certain
ideas and certain purposes of their own to

170
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:58,470
be pursued in a very dangerous situation.

171
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:00,961
I finally,

172
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:05,610
they had certain assumptions also about
the new Monique and about the nature of

173
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,110
their relationship to her.

174
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,090
Obviously Elizabeth was a woman,

175
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,750
a young unmarried woman,

176
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:20,160
and in 1559 shortly after her ex session,

177
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,200
the Scottish reformer,

178
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,460
John Knox,

179
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,560
with quite appalling timing,

180
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,320
issued a book called the first blast
of the trumpet against the Monstrous

181
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,453
Regiment of women.

182
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,750
It was attack upon what he regarded as
the unnatural nature of free female rule,

183
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,950
the regimen of women.

184
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,810
This book was directed
against Elizabeth Sister Mary,

185
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:48,840
the first of England and
against Mary of Gears,

186
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,800
the mother of Mary,

187
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:50,521
Queen of Scots,

188
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:52,110
who was ruling Scotland as regent.

189
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,500
But by the time it came out,

190
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:00,620
it was deeply embarrassing because it
appeared when Mary had died and Elizabeth

191
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,160
was on the throne.

192
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,920
One of Elizabeth's Bishop's,

193
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:09,840
John Aylmer quickly was recruited to
answer it and he wrote a book called a

194
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:14,220
harbor for faithful and true
subjects to defend her rule,

195
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,740
but it was a very odd defense.

196
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,340
He maintained that Elizabeth's rule pose,

197
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:22,020
no threat since.

198
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:22,854
To quote him.

199
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,280
First it is not she that rules but
the laws and secondly she make us know

200
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:31,470
statutes or laws,

201
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,870
but in the honorable court of parliament.

202
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,830
Therefore what makes
you do wherein his peril

203
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:39,931
in salt.

204
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:40,291
In short,

205
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:44,640
what he's saying is that she would not
really rule government would be conducted

206
00:10:44,641 --> 00:10:47,430
in her name and by her royal authority,

207
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,760
but the general assumption was that she
would soon Mary appropriately and in the

208
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:57,030
meantime the Privy Council would assert
its role in running the country and

209
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,920
parliament would provide safeguards.

210
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,740
It's hard to imagine any of this
being written about a male ruler.

211
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:07,930
Well,

212
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:12,930
such expectations showed that Ayla
didn't really know Elizabeth and indeed

213
00:11:14,431 --> 00:11:18,060
perhaps even sessile didn't yet
fully appreciate her potential.

214
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,370
She had had a very long schooling in
caution and in the avoidance of danger,

215
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,760
but she was also in many respects,

216
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,560
very much her father's daughter.

217
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,340
She knew what it was to be a Monique.

218
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:41,630
She had an imperious temperament and
she was perfectly prepared to assert it

219
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,720
when she was crossed,

220
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,890
nor did she intend to allow
her sex two inhibitor.

221
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,910
In doing that

222
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,680
in 1566 at the age of 33
in to representations made
to her by a parliamentary

223
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:58,450
delegation over the succession.

224
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,420
She stated though I'd be a woman,

225
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:07,170
yet I have as good a carriage answerable
to my place as ever my father had.

226
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,540
I am your anointed queen.

227
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,590
I will never be
constrained to do anything.

228
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:20,340
I thank God I am endued with such
quality that if I were turned out of this

229
00:12:21,281 --> 00:12:22,960
realm in my petticoat,

230
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,530
I were able to live in
any place in Christendom.

231
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,970
She could play the gender
card to her own advantage.

232
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:32,740
And of course she was to do so many times,

233
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,560
most famously in her speech to her troops,

234
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,101
uh,

235
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:39,070
Tilbury during the
Spanish armada campaign.

236
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,850
I know I have the body of
a weak and feeble woman,

237
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,400
but I have the heart and stomach
of a king and a King of England.

238
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,150
When the statements like
this where repeatedly to
show she had a great sense of

239
00:12:55,151 --> 00:13:00,151
her own capability and a very strong
sense of her place as Monique and

240
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:06,040
assertions of this kind where most likely
to come when she felt that her royal

241
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:07,900
authority was being encroached upon.

242
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,320
She knew of course that
she ruled under the law,

243
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:20,230
but firstly she had no doubt
of her rights to the crown.

244
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,630
She was a Monique ordained by God
and anointed at her coronation.

245
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,813
Secondly,

246
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,760
she believed that in her person,

247
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:34,510
the imperial kingship of Henry
the eighth had been restored.

248
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,010
She did not regard her supreme
governorship of the Church of England as

249
00:13:39,011 --> 00:13:43,330
something which had been granted to her
by parliament rather it had been given

250
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:47,710
to her by God and confirmed
by parliamentary statute.

251
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,953
And thirdly,

252
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:54,990
she regarded certain matters of state
as she turned them as lying ultimately

253
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:58,570
within the sphere of
her prerogative power,

254
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,850
her sole power of decision,

255
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,020
the prerogative power,

256
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:07,230
things to be decided by her and notably
they included the crucial matter of

257
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:10,084
religion,

258
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:15,520
foreign policy and the succession
to the throne on these matters.

259
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,510
She would certainly live,

260
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,760
listen to advice and counsel,

261
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:23,860
but she alone had the last word and she
strongly believed that parliament in

262
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:27,400
particular had no business
in meddling in such matters

263
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,960
as she told that same parliamentary
delegation in 1566 when they pressured her

264
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,220
on the matter of the succession.

265
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,640
It is a strange thing that the
foot should direct the head in.

266
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:43,780
So weightier matter.

267
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,190
All of this considered a great deal then
would depend upon how the queen and her

268
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:56,360
counselors would get along in handling
the central issues of her reign.

269
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,760
And on the whole they
got along pretty well.

270
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,400
On a day to day basis,

271
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:08,600
the Privy Council ran the affairs of
government under the secretary ship,

272
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:11,630
first of sessile and then
as a Francis walls income,

273
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,290
Elizabeth would attend counsel frequently,

274
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,650
but on many days they were allowed
to simply proceed with administrative

275
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,484
matters.

276
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,380
Sessile was given a particularly free
hand in his efforts to address the

277
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,860
problems of the Commonwealth
in Economic and social affairs,

278
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:28,431
uh,

279
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:33,320
to plan legislation to be brought before
parliament intended to stabilize and

280
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,460
strengthen the nation.

281
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,410
Some of these things
I've touched on already,

282
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,310
but what about those
vital matters of state,

283
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,700
the really central issues as
far as the queen was concerned?

284
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:45,801
Well,

285
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:48,140
the first order of business
of course was religion,

286
00:15:48,141 --> 00:15:49,280
the religious settlement.

287
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:54,281
And as we saw last time
there was essential unanimity
between Elizabeth and her

288
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:58,820
counselors on that issue in shaping the
religious settlement and in getting it

289
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:01,130
through parliament does.

290
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:05,870
The queen's personality was to become
very evident in the way in which,

291
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,850
as I described last time,

292
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,300
she set the limits to the further reform,

293
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,860
which might proceed.

294
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,500
This use of foreign policy and of the
succession were much more fraught.

295
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:26,450
And here you've got a pattern repeatedly
of pressure being brought upon the

296
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:31,451
queen and of resistance on her part to
such pressure pressure on her to make

297
00:16:33,021 --> 00:16:33,561
decisions,

298
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:36,560
which are counselors believed
to be absolutely crucial.

299
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,420
And on her part,

300
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:43,450
a great unwillingness to take categorical
decisions which might prove to be

301
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,190
irreparable and which might prove
to have unforeseen consequences.

302
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:54,250
She was very anxious to avoid decisions
which might lead indirections,

303
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,090
which might prove disastrous.

304
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,740
So to look at foreign policy first of all,

305
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,610
early in the rain in April,

306
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:07,610
1559 the war with France was
ended by the treaty of Katto.

307
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:12,611
Can Bracey England suffer the
humiliation of losing Cali?

308
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:16,130
It's last French possession
once and for all,

309
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,760
but that could be blamed
upon Mary and Phillip.

310
00:17:19,761 --> 00:17:24,761
It had happened under Mary's rain and
there was the positive benefit of the

311
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:29,951
treaty that the peace treaty meant that
the other monarchs recognized Elizabeth

312
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,370
as Queen of England.

313
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,371
That's still left.

314
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:34,641
However,

315
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:35,810
the problem of Scotland,

316
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,830
Scotland was still being ruled as a
French protectorate by Mary of geese and

317
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:47,291
then in 1559 Mary Queen of Scots became
queen of France when her husband Francis

318
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,790
acceded to the French thrown

319
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:53,963
to sessile.

320
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,530
The best hope of achieving security
in this situation was to encourage

321
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:03,330
resistance to French domination in
Scotland to encourage in particularly the

322
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:07,860
resistance of the Scottish lords known
as the lords of the congregation who were

323
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:12,060
Protestants and who are engaged in
what was at that time still a largely

324
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:15,720
unsuccessful resistance
to French dominance.

325
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,850
Elizabeth was willing to go
so far as to act covertly.

326
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,650
In the Scottish situation,

327
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,980
even authorizing the smuggling back to
Scotland of the preacher John Knox in

328
00:18:28,891 --> 00:18:31,800
order to stiffen Scottish
Protestant resistance,

329
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,460
but she was exceedingly
reluctant to intervene openly
to help any rebels against

330
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,040
their true Monique.

331
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,411
This time,

332
00:18:43,411 --> 00:18:43,711
however,

333
00:18:43,711 --> 00:18:48,711
sessile managed to persuade her because
of the obvious threat and in 1560 some

334
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:52,980
English troops and ships was sent
to aid the Scottish covenanters.

335
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,860
They were not very successful militarily,

336
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,440
but in June,

337
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,440
1560 Mary of geese died and in July the
war in Scotland was brought to an end

338
00:19:04,021 --> 00:19:05,190
with the treaty of Edinburgh.

339
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,060
French troops were evacuated from Scotland
and the Protestant Lords took control

340
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,713
in Edinburgh,

341
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,820
so that one a breathing space,

342
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,550
but it was only a short breathing
space because in December,

343
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,470
1560 Francis the second of France,

344
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,390
the young king husband of Mary,

345
00:19:27,391 --> 00:19:32,220
Queen of Scots died leaving
Mary an 18 year old widow.

346
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,180
She returned to Scotland.

347
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,570
She accepted the Protestant settlement,

348
00:19:39,571 --> 00:19:42,780
which had taken place there
though she was herself a Catholic.

349
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,880
But she also made great show soon after
her return to Scotland of the fact that

350
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:51,060
she maintained a claim
to the English throne,

351
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,380
a claim to the succession.

352
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:55,290
And this made,

353
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:59,130
this situation became even worse
in the mid fifties and sixties.

354
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,331
First of all,

355
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:01,650
when Mary married,

356
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,690
she married Henry Lord Darnley,

357
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:07,390
who was also descended
from the same tutor,

358
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,850
grandmother as Mary,

359
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:13,851
Queen of Scots herself by
a second marriage that she
contracted and who also had

360
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:15,240
a distant claim to the throne.

361
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,133
They married.

362
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,970
And then in 1566,

363
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:18,804
they had a son,

364
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,453
James,

365
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,630
who was baptized,

366
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,960
a Catholic potential successor
to the English crown.

367
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,690
This time the situation was resolved
not by any English intervention,

368
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,530
but by Mary Queen of Scots
own errors of judgment.

369
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,830
By 1566,

370
00:20:37,831 --> 00:20:42,120
she had fallen out of love
disastrously with Lord Darnley.

371
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:42,900
Um,

372
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,120
he was a wastrel.

373
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,630
He was a rake.

374
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,741
Uh,

375
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:50,530
he deeply his exclusion from real power,

376
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,913
uh,

377
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,080
in a jealous rage.

378
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:57,520
He assisted in the murder of her
Secretary David Richo at one point.

379
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,670
And in 1567,

380
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:05,671
he was murdered by a group
of Scottish Lords acting.

381
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,933
Uh,

382
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,730
it was said with the covered,

383
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:10,540
uh,

384
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:10,751
uh,

385
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:15,430
assistance of Queen Mary
herself with Donnelly dead.

386
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,090
Uh,

387
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,780
Mary embarked upon an adulterous
affair with the Lord James Bothell,

388
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,070
rather romantic figure,

389
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,050
one of the lords of the
Scottish border area,

390
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:23,920
uh,

391
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,780
with whom she was in love,

392
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,070
uh,

393
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:28,210
and uh,

394
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,170
remained with him until he managed
to obtain a divorce from his wife.

395
00:21:32,171 --> 00:21:34,570
And they married in May 15,

396
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:35,404
67.

397
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,740
All of this was too much for
the lords of the congregation.

398
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,873
They rebelled.

399
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,460
In June,

400
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:42,461
1567,

401
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:47,461
Mary was forced to abdicate and the Earl
of Marie took power as regent for her

402
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,050
infant son James.

403
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,301
Yeah.

404
00:21:52,301 --> 00:21:56,860
Later Mary managed to escape from her
imprisonment in Loch Leven castle,

405
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,260
but having failed to re re to raise
adequate support to restore her to the

406
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:02,980
throne,

407
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,900
she was forced to flee to England.

408
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,030
She crossed the border and she appealed
to Elizabeth for help in restoring her

409
00:22:10,031 --> 00:22:10,864
to the throne.

410
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,410
This was highly embarrassing situation.

411
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,630
And in this situation,

412
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,630
Elizabeth and her counsel had
to act very circumspectly.

413
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:20,464
Indeed.

414
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,300
They didn't want to restore Mary Queen
of Scots to the Scottish throne because

415
00:22:25,301 --> 00:22:29,830
the Scottish power in Scotland was now
in the hands of friendly lords of the

416
00:22:29,831 --> 00:22:34,360
congregation who proceeded to bring
up the young James as a protestant.

417
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:40,890
They couldn't let Mary go to France
either if they allowed that she might in

418
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:45,760
France reassert her claim to the English
throne as well as the Scottish and

419
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:50,710
perhaps try to be restored to Scotland
and possibly to England with French

420
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:51,544
military aid.

421
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,740
Elizabeth offered to hear both sides of
the story and commissioners met to hear

422
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:01,870
the charges of murder and adultery,

423
00:23:01,871 --> 00:23:06,100
which will aid by the lords
of the congregation against
Mary and to hear Mary's

424
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,120
counter countercharges of treason and
rebellion against her Scottish subjects

425
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,440
and judiciously.

426
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,980
Elizabeth eventually determined that
the case had not been proved either way,

427
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,040
Scotland was neutralized.

428
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:28,390
It was to remain under the
rule of the Protestant regency,

429
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,090
but Mary could not be released.

430
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:32,283
Instead,

431
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:37,290
she was held in what was deemed
honorable imprisonment in a succession of

432
00:23:38,021 --> 00:23:38,950
English castles.

433
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,033
So

434
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,240
that brought a temporary
resolution to England's advantage,

435
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:52,580
but it also meant that Elizabeth was
saddled as what was described as a

436
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:57,581
permanent and lively danger in
the person of Mary Queen of Scots.

437
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,530
She was held in custody,

438
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,030
but as you know,

439
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:03,380
almost from the beginning,

440
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,920
Mary became the focus of plots against
Elizabeth indeed already by 1572 after

441
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:12,680
the first of these,

442
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,510
some members of parliament,

443
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,520
some members of Elizabeth's council,

444
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,740
including even some of the bishops,

445
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:23,690
were calling for Mary's head in
order to resolve this danger,

446
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,160
but Elizabeth wouldn't countenance that
she would not execute and anointed clean

447
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:33,890
when parliament asked her to do so,

448
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,070
she vetoed the bill,

449
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:40,460
which we've brought before her
with the words Lorenzo visa wrap.

450
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,320
The queen will think about it,

451
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,160
and she did for about 15 years.

452
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,030
She wouldn't execute him anointed queen,

453
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,870
nor would she quietly acceded
and Mary's assassination,

454
00:24:53,871 --> 00:24:56,720
which was also suggested to her
as a way out of the problem.

455
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,350
Some of her counselors simply despaired

456
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,590
and they were vigilant on her behalf,

457
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,240
especially Francis Walsingham,

458
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:06,860
the head of her intelligence service,

459
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,010
but as yet the queen would not budge.

460
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,430
She also refused to budge
on another vital matter,

461
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,080
the matter of the succession.

462
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,360
And here the tension at the very heart
of the regime is perhaps most clearly

463
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,223
revealed.

464
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,571
Initially,

465
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:27,111
of course,

466
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:32,111
people expected that Elizabeth would soon
Mary and that she would bear children,

467
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,350
bear and air.

468
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,130
In 1559 to 61,

469
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:39,770
various candidates were
being talked about,

470
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,050
Philip the second of Spain,

471
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,410
the former husband of her sister,

472
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:46,010
Mary offered his hand in marriage,

473
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:49,190
but that was diplomatically
and politely rejected.

474
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,240
Um,

475
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,590
there was talk of Lord Robert
Dudley as a possible husband,

476
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,000
but there were problems there.

477
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:56,841
First of all,

478
00:25:56,841 --> 00:26:00,350
he was already married and then in 1560,

479
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:04,160
when his wife was found dead at the foot
of the staircase in their country home,

480
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,600
there was much suspicion
that Dudley might,

481
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:10,730
might've had a hand in her
death in order to clear the way.

482
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,050
I think there's little question
that Elizabeth loved Robert Dudley,

483
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:18,770
but to marry him would have been
an active supreme political folly.

484
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,810
They're considered
Prince Ed Eric of Sweden,

485
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,240
but he was rumored to
be mentally unstable.

486
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,590
They considered the archduke
Charles of Australia,

487
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,040
but he was a Catholic and so it went on.

488
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,640
Nothing had come of all of this by
1562 and nor would Elizabeth name a

489
00:26:40,731 --> 00:26:41,564
successor.

490
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,560
In the meantime,

491
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:48,830
and then in 1562 she nearly
died of smallpox and the
fragility of the situation

492
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:54,960
was vividly demonstrated what
would happen if she were to die.

493
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,740
In 1563 when parliament met,

494
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:03,180
it almost immediately petitioned the
queen to Mary and to name a successor.

495
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,730
Both the House of Lords and the House of
Commons were involved and they were not

496
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:11,490
very discreet in approaching the queen.

497
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,600
The speaker of the House of Commons using
his privilege of free speech reminded

498
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:20,010
her of the history of Alexander the Great
and the disastrous consequences of his

499
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:22,050
failure to provide for a clear succession.

500
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,530
Almost certainly at this point,

501
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,220
the members of parliament were actually
being covered encouraged by William

502
00:27:29,221 --> 00:27:32,970
sessile and the Privy Council who wanted
pressure put upon the queen in this

503
00:27:32,971 --> 00:27:33,804
matter,

504
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,080
but she gave only evasive replies and
parliament eventually gave in and went

505
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:41,310
into recess without any definite result.

506
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:48,590
By the time they met again in 1566 the
situation was even worse because of Mary,

507
00:27:48,721 --> 00:27:52,920
Queen of Scots Marriage to Lord
Darnley and her pregnancy and again,

508
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,600
parliament was encouraged to raise
the matter and did so pretty bluntly.

509
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:03,560
They declared that they would not pass
any taxation bill unless she replied for

510
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:08,070
their petition of 1563 asking
her to name a successor.

511
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,920
That was why Elizabeth rebuked them in
the words I've already quoted to you for

512
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:15,930
encroaching on her sovereign rights.

513
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:19,020
Those he also promised that
he would indeed in good time.

514
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,910
Mary Jean tended to

515
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:27,770
when parliament pushed again by trying
to incorporate that verbal promise into

516
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:29,700
one of their money bills.

517
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,400
She rejected it angrily.

518
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,370
She told them they would not have dead,

519
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,260
have treat her to have treated,

520
00:28:37,261 --> 00:28:38,094
have father,

521
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,060
thus nor indeed would day it was right.

522
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:47,010
But under the pressures of the Times
there had been something of a shift in

523
00:28:47,011 --> 00:28:47,844
political life.

524
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:48,451
Uh,

525
00:28:48,451 --> 00:28:53,130
Steven Alford says in writing of Williams
successful and the Privy Council,

526
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:58,430
these were men who were redefining their
relationship with a Monique who refuses

527
00:28:59,101 --> 00:29:03,090
to play by the rules of
monarchy and name her successor.

528
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,990
The role of the council one could say
was shifting somewhat from that of being

529
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:15,080
merely an advisory and an executive body
to that of attempting to put political

530
00:29:15,301 --> 00:29:17,490
pressure on the queen herself.

531
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,660
And Parliament was taking something
of a novel role in calling openly for

532
00:29:23,821 --> 00:29:25,320
definite policies,

533
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:28,920
definite courses of action in matters.

534
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:33,950
The queen regarded as solely her own
prerogative and parliament was to do it

535
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:38,910
again very soon in 1572 when it called
for the head of Mary Queen of Scots.

536
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,520
So Francis Knowledge,

537
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:44,500
one of the council told the Queen in 1569,

538
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,640
it is not possible for Your Majesty's,

539
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:51,280
most faithful counselors
to govern your state well,

540
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:56,020
unless you will resolutely follow
their opinions in weighty matters.

541
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,400
There was a ring of compulsion in that
reflecting a rather unfamiliar set of

542
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:07,630
political assumptions about
the relationship between
the queen and her counsel.

543
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,730
As Patrick Collinson has put it.

544
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:14,620
There were citizens concealed within
subjects in Elizabethan England,

545
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,590
but whatever her,

546
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,491
his views,

547
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:22,630
the fact remained that
Elizabeth was all they had

548
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,050
and she was secure in that knowledge.

549
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:31,620
She knew they depended totally upon her
presence on the throne and she stood her

550
00:30:31,781 --> 00:30:36,220
ground putting them off with what
sessile in exasperation described us.

551
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,610
Answers am soulless to their pressures,

552
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,520
answers,

553
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,380
answer lists.

554
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:48,990
No one can really say when she decided
that she would never marry and perhaps

555
00:30:49,161 --> 00:30:51,790
she never actually consciously
took that decision.

556
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,810
Perhaps matters simply
drifted in that direction.

557
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:03,610
Eddie decisive action perhaps seemed
unacceptable at particular points in time

558
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,750
and gradually it emerged that
she would indeed never marry.

559
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:10,420
It's difficult to believe
that she was very serious.

560
00:31:10,421 --> 00:31:10,991
For example,

561
00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:15,991
about the marriage negotiations which
were conducted between 50 and 75 and 50

562
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,440
and 81 with the French Duke of balance on.

563
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,460
She was by that time in her late forties
and it's unlikely that she really took

564
00:31:24,461 --> 00:31:25,294
this seriously,

565
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:31,740
but if she conserved her freedom of
action by refusing to act on certain

566
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:33,220
critical matters,

567
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:38,140
that was also just prolonging what
seemed to many of her counselors to be a

568
00:31:38,141 --> 00:31:40,600
never ending situation of insecurity.

569
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:46,120
And that was especially the case as
England's relationship with Spain

570
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,540
deteriorated into one of permanent threat,

571
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:55,290
particularly after 1567 with the Dutch
Protestant revolt against Spanish rule in

572
00:31:55,901 --> 00:32:00,901
the Netherlands and the establishment
as a result of a very powerful Spanish

573
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,720
army.

574
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,620
Just across the narrow cs.

575
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,300
Again,

576
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,330
Elizabeth declined to act decisively.

577
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,790
There were many in her counsel who urged
her to intervene militarily in support

578
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:20,020
of the Dutch or later as the wars of
religion broke out in France to intervene

579
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:25,021
on behalf of the French Protestant cause
Robert Dudley now Earl of Leicester was

580
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:27,130
one of those who pressed her to do so,

581
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,840
so did a Francis Walsingham.

582
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:33,930
They were frustrated by her willingness
to countenance covert assistance to

583
00:32:35,381 --> 00:32:39,070
these rebels to count
him as an undeclared war.

584
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,150
Spain being pursued by Privet,

585
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,990
like Sir Francis Drake in the
Spanish American possessions,

586
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:50,710
but remaining unwilling or ways to
openly support any rebels against their

587
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:52,160
sovereign Monique.

588
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:55,521
Well,

589
00:32:55,521 --> 00:32:59,480
at this point we can pause briefly just
to consider another dimension of the

590
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:01,310
shifting structure of political life,

591
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,200
one that you'll already have
discussed or we'll discuss in section.

592
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:12,010
The way in which under Elizabeth local
government was gradually intensifying and

593
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:17,360
in increasingly direct relationship was
being built up between the Privy Council

594
00:33:17,361 --> 00:33:22,361
at the center and local justices of the
peace encouraging an extended form of

595
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:28,100
political participation amongst the
gentry elites of the English counties.

596
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,170
These were men as you know,

597
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:34,640
who were very conscious of their role as
local representatives of their counties

598
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,250
who pursued that road in
their correspondence with
the center in their petitions

599
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:45,110
and the questions they raised in their
attempts to modify and influence policy.

600
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,560
And they were men who are
also at the same time,

601
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,070
very conscious of their place in the lab,

602
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:53,810
the national structures
of government above all,

603
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:58,811
when they periodically came up to the
center to serve in parliament and indeed

604
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,970
demand for places in parliament,

605
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:02,541
uh,

606
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:06,320
was such that the number of members of
parliament was greatly increased under

607
00:34:06,321 --> 00:34:11,321
Elizabeth from 251 in 1547 to 370 by
the end of her reign representation was

608
00:34:14,421 --> 00:34:15,680
being extended.

609
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,580
These things you're discussing section,

610
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:24,410
but remember that they also represent
a further development of the nature of

611
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:27,620
political participation
under Elizabeth in the world,

612
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,980
outside Westminster and
in Westminster itself.

613
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:36,310
When those people came up to take part
in parliament or visited the court.

614
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,360
Well,

615
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:43,360
all of these various strands of the
situation came together in the mid 1580s.

616
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,850
In 1584,

617
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:48,411
William,

618
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:51,560
the silent leader of the
Dutch rebels was assassinated.

619
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:57,460
Spain looked like winning the war against
the Dutch under the Duke of Palmer,

620
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:58,850
a brilliant commander.

621
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,770
If that happened,

622
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:04,100
would England be next
on the Spanish agenda?

623
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:09,620
This together with the discovery of
the Throckmorton plot against Elizabeth

624
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,450
provoked in 1584 a movement
known as the bond of association,

625
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:21,880
the circulation and signing of a public
oath by members of the political nation

626
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:28,880
that they would undertake to revenge any
successful attempt against Elizabeth's

627
00:35:28,881 --> 00:35:29,714
life.

628
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,760
The bond of association was signed by
members of the Privy Council by members of

629
00:35:34,761 --> 00:35:36,620
an ability by the Gentry,

630
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,950
by many clergy,

631
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,450
by mayors of cities,

632
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,590
even in some counties right down to
the level of the leaders of parishes,

633
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,000
Yeoman farmers,

634
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,830
church wardens and so forth.

635
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:52,320
It had probably been designed by
sessile and so Francis Walsingham,

636
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,880
but it clearly found massive
spontaneous support nationwide

637
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:03,180
in 1584 they also brought
before parliament and passed
an act for the sec for

638
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:06,330
the surety of the Queen's
most royal person.

639
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,500
This legislated and obligation upon
the whole nation to take revenge and to

640
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:16,050
exclude from succession.

641
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,130
Anyone guilty of plotting
Elizabeth's death,

642
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:21,960
guess who that was aimed at.

643
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:29,210
Sessile was also secretly drawing up
contingency plans for what would happen if

644
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:31,410
the queen was assassinated.

645
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:37,130
He'd actually considered such things as
long before as 1563 but in the mid 1580s

646
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,600
he went into great detail.

647
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,660
If the queen was to
die or be assassinated,

648
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:46,650
all officers of the crown
were to remain in their posts.

649
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,990
That was a constitutional innovation.

650
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,910
A council of 30 was to be
chosen to govern the nation.

651
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:59,370
Parliament would then be called
to meet and to choose a successor.

652
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,411
In other words,

653
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:05,400
he was envisaging a kind of
emergency republic if necessary,

654
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:09,690
resulting in a parliamentary
choice of king.

655
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,361
It didn't happen,

656
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:13,194
of course,

657
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,600
but it's still quite extraordinary.

658
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,940
It shows just how far men like sessile.

659
00:37:18,941 --> 00:37:21,090
We're prepared to go if necessary,

660
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:26,430
in order to secure the Protestant
regime and national independence.

661
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,950
Other factors entered
the situation shortly.

662
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:38,150
In 1585 Elizabeth was forced at last to
accept the need for direct intervention

663
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:43,700
in the Netherlands to prevent the victory
of the Spanish army and English troops

664
00:37:44,641 --> 00:37:48,480
was sent under the Earl of Leicester too
stiff and the resistance of the Dutch

665
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:54,590
in 1586 following the clear implication
of Mary Queen of Scots in the Babington

666
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:55,860
plot to kill Elizabeth,

667
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,320
which may possibly have
involved entrapment.

668
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:02,340
Mary Queen of Scots was
at last sentence to death.

669
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,310
There's a bit signed her death warrant,

670
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:10,610
but then withheld it until the council
acted without her permission by

671
00:38:11,671 --> 00:38:15,240
dispatching the death warrant to
fathering gay castle where Mary Mary was

672
00:38:15,241 --> 00:38:16,680
promptly executed.

673
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,640
When the news came to London,

674
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,320
the queen was furious.

675
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,350
She threatened to have the secretary
of the council executed and she was

676
00:38:25,351 --> 00:38:26,280
probably serious,

677
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:31,590
but that Boyle had been lanced Mary's son,

678
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,510
James the sixth of Scotland,

679
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:38,050
now age 20 and beginning
to rule in his own right,

680
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,870
protested against his mother's execution.

681
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,633
But he got over it

682
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,220
knowing full well that being brought
up as a Protestant as he had been,

683
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:53,430
he was very likely to be the obvious
heir to the English throne in due course.

684
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,940
So the rain had reached its crisis point

685
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:04,270
and it had been surmounted by forms of
action on the part of central members of

686
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:05,290
the political nation,

687
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:10,270
which have led Patrick Cottonson to
describe all this as evidence of a kind of

688
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,880
monarchical republic as he puts it.

689
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:14,883
Of course,

690
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,560
that term is something of an exaggeration.

691
00:39:17,561 --> 00:39:21,400
It's being rather playful in putting
it forward for the sake of argument,

692
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:26,320
but it does make a very serious point
about the changing structures of political

693
00:39:26,321 --> 00:39:27,154
life

694
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:33,370
at about what the expanded increasingly
participating political nation was

695
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:38,941
capable of conceiving of and even of
doing their capacity to act in defense of

696
00:39:40,661 --> 00:39:45,661
the state that they wanted with
or without the queens consent.

697
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,730
The queen had stood her ground,

698
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:53,830
she retained the ultimate
power of decision but her
counselors had got what they

699
00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:54,664
wanted to,

700
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,860
the crucial decisions had been made
and who's to say that the delays which

701
00:39:59,861 --> 00:40:04,210
Elizabeth at forced upon them had done
a great deal to help in getting them

702
00:40:04,211 --> 00:40:06,010
right when they were finally made

703
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,180
and so for the moment had rested there.

704
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,540
The last years of the rain,

705
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:19,530
we're focused upon the war with Spain
and upon a United effort to sustain it,

706
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,620
which was a tremendously debilitating
effort given England's limited resources.

707
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:31,540
In 1588 the whole nation was mobilized
as a Spanish armada or approached the

708
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:35,150
English coast and the
defeat of the [inaudible],

709
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,040
the prevention of it's loading troops
from the Netherlands to land in England

710
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:46,450
and its eventual scattering as it made
its way back to Spain around the northern

711
00:40:46,451 --> 00:40:48,070
coast of Scotland and Ireland.

712
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:53,260
All of this was regarded as a providential
deliverance of England from this

713
00:40:53,261 --> 00:40:54,250
tremendous threat,

714
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,670
but that providential
deliverance as they saw it,

715
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:02,970
was followed by a hard slog through
the 50 nineties the durability,

716
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:09,510
the debilitating costs in treasure and
in men of maintaining an army in the

717
00:41:10,631 --> 00:41:11,464
Netherlands,

718
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:16,950
the costs of facing rebellion in Ireland
where the Earl of Tyrone rose against

719
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,660
Elizabethan Authority,

720
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:22,330
aided by Spanish expeditionary force,

721
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:23,440
which landed in Ireland.

722
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,350
As the war dragged on,

723
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,280
Elizabeth's older counselors
gradually died away.

724
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:36,480
Lester died in 1588 she wrote on the
last dispatch she'd received from him.

725
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,880
His last letter was it Jim died
in 50 90 sessile died in 1598

726
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:51,380
the 1590 [inaudible] saw the absolute
pinnacle of the cult of Elizabeth as a

727
00:41:51,741 --> 00:41:55,760
kind of national icon represented
in the great paintings,

728
00:41:55,761 --> 00:41:56,810
the white face,

729
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,130
the great elaborate wig,

730
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:00,620
the magnificent dressers and so forth.

731
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:07,120
But also that period saw heads gradually
turning away from the Asian Queen and

732
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:09,650
towards the assumed.

733
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:13,940
But as yet formally
undeclared successor James,

734
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:16,760
the sixth of Scotland called factions,

735
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:17,690
began forming,

736
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:23,630
jockeying for position for
when James was to succeed.

737
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,970
And when the Queen finally died
in 1,603 somewhat withdrawn.

738
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,150
Okay.

739
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:31,460
Set.

740
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,900
And perhaps that her age was over.

741
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:38,260
James entered joyfully upon the
inheritance for which he had to wait,

742
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,740
waited so long,

743
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:46,580
but it was to be a rather more complicated
inheritance than James appreciated as

744
00:42:46,581 --> 00:42:50,900
he wrote south from Edinburgh to
become not James the sixth of Scotland,

745
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:53,150
but James the first of England.

746
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:58,900
It was an inheritance which contained
many concealed ambiguities about the

747
00:42:59,001 --> 00:43:02,900
nature of the relationship between
the crown and the political nation.

748
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,920
About the way power had come to be
shared and exercised in a kingdom which

749
00:43:09,261 --> 00:43:11,990
remained highly centralized
under the monarchy,

750
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:16,760
but which also operated a political
system which was heavily consulted,

751
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:17,600
tentative,

752
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,300
and in many ways participatory

753
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,941
and an inheritance,

754
00:43:22,941 --> 00:43:27,941
which was also ambiguous with regard to
the purposes which the political nation

755
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,160
expected political power to serve.

756
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,350
If the monarchy was to
retain its legitimacy in the,

757
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,600
in the eyes of members
of the political nation.

758
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:43,460
Before long under the early Stuart's,

759
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:49,150
some people were beginning to remember
rather ruefully how much better things

760
00:43:49,671 --> 00:43:54,220
had been in the time of Queen Elizabeth
of blessing memory as they tend to,

761
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,103
to put it.

762
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,540
I will not make windows into men's souls.

763
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,230
I will never be
constrained to do anything.

764
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:07,410
I have the heart and stomach of a king.

765
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,980
I have reigned with your loves.

766
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:12,840
She had.
