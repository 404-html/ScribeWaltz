1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:02,070
Okay,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,870
well last time we looked at the early
tutors reestablishing the authority of the

3
00:00:06,871 --> 00:00:11,700
monarchy and now we turn towards what
was to prove one of the biggest problems

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,020
for most of the 16th century.

5
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:17,670
The question of the authority of the
church and of the nature of English

6
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:18,504
religion.

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:20,123
Um,

8
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,310
let's start by taking you
to a couple of places.

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,680
A few miles north of the city of
Cambridge in the Fed lands the flatlands

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,050
stretching up to towards the sea.

11
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:31,981
Uh,

12
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:34,440
there lies the small city of Ely,

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,130
which has one of the greatest
of English cathedrals in it.

14
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,330
Um,

15
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,420
Eley Cathedral dates
back to the 12th century.

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:42,931
And,

17
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:43,070
uh,

18
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,400
when you go there,

19
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,150
um,

20
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,150
the main nave of the Cathedral is
a magnificent Norman architecture,

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,000
uh,

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,020
but rather gloomy.

23
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,071
Um,

24
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:55,890
but at the bottom of the name there's a
little door which leads through to the

25
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:56,724
lady chapel.

26
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,950
And if you go through there,

27
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,120
you get struck almost
immediately by dazzling light.

28
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,630
You find yourself in a beautiful chapel,

29
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,510
late medieval chapel with vast windows

30
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,610
glazed in clear glass with the light
streaming through on a sunny day.

31
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:17,440
It's quite an astonishing contrast.

32
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,700
And it's only when your eyes get used to
light that you notice that in the stone

33
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:24,090
tracery of the windows,

34
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:27,840
there are niches where once statues stood,

35
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,720
some of them are still there with the
heads broken off for half the status.

36
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:36,180
You still there and here and there
in the white glass in the windows,

37
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:36,590
uh,

38
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,800
you see a little bit of stained glass
that they found and replaced in what were

39
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:44,280
once windows full of
stained glass pictures.

40
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:46,920
So that's Ely cathedral.

41
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,410
If we go a couple of hundred
miles north to North Yorkshire,

42
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:54,680
there's a little church there
called Saint Agatha's ease be,

43
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,160
it lies by the river,

44
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:57,510
not far from the town of Richmond,

45
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,190
which I was talking about last week.

46
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,570
Uh,

47
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,270
and at DSP there's a
tiny 12th century church,

48
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:04,170
Saint Agatha's.

49
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,583
Um,

50
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,230
the windows are very small.

51
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,100
Um,

52
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,470
and when you go in it's exceedingly dim.

53
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:11,911
But again,

54
00:02:11,911 --> 00:02:13,110
when your eyes adjust to the light,

55
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:16,770
you notice on the walls
faded war paintings,

56
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,550
which were probably put there
sometime early in the 13th century.

57
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,690
Um,

58
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,920
there's Adam and eve.

59
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,490
Uh,

60
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,690
there's the Nativity,

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,150
very nice nativity scene
with a very sweet donkey.

62
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,131
Uh,

63
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:31,620
and so the story continues
around the walls,

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,420
through the crucifixion
and the resurrection.

65
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,550
Um,

66
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,000
and in the spaces left
by the main paintings,

67
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,450
uh,

68
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,740
they're are little portrayals
of medieval peasants at work,

69
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,263
sewing,

70
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,580
plowing and so forth

71
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,410
and outside by the river
are the ruins of ease,

72
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:54,871
be happy,

73
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:57,630
which was quite near the
Church of Saint Agatha's.

74
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,853
Okay,

75
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,930
well we can use those two places to
symbolize the way that the Protestant

76
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:08,440
reformation has been presented in the
historiography of early modern England.

77
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,110
To some people it was,

78
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:11,860
as it were,

79
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,240
a flood of light

80
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,000
purifying,

81
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:16,991
racing,

82
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:18,070
invigorating,

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,233
liberating.

84
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,940
On the other hand,

85
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,410
other historians have greatest sympathy
for the religious culture represented by

86
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:31,411
those faded wall paintings in the church
at ECSB or the empty niches in the

87
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:39,421
windows at Ely cathedral or the ruined
monastery by the river east be Abby.

88
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,980
They have a greater sense of what was
lost of the destruction of a great deal of

89
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,270
beauty in the course of the
zeal of the reformation.

90
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,230
Well prior to the 1980s
one could say in general,

91
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:57,580
it was the first approach,

92
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:59,620
which tended to be the dominant tradition.

93
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,010
The reformation was generally
seen as being positive.

94
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,990
As Christopher Marshall puts it,

95
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:08,830
it had purpose and direction and
even a certain inevitability.

96
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,131
Nowadays,

97
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:14,500
the dominant trend is rather
in the other direction,

98
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:20,100
it tends to stress the destruction
of the older religious tradition.

99
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,581
A destruction,

100
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:24,520
which to quote marshe
again was regrettable,

101
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,100
undesired and undesirable.

102
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,591
So as a result,

103
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:34,270
we now have a much more two dimensional
historiography of the reformation.

104
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,530
And that's a good thing.

105
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,120
A history should involve
critical examination rather
than mere celebration or

106
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,270
self congratulation.

107
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,320
But if we have a more
two dimensional picture,

108
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:50,320
one which includes not only
the reformers and the victors,

109
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,410
but also those who resisted
and those who lost,

110
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,440
it's still not exactly even handed.

111
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,170
Historians inevitably
have their preferences.

112
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,900
They tend to lean one way or the other.

113
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:06,520
And this whole story is one which
still engages a good deal of passion.

114
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,010
Well,

115
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,410
today I want to start
approaching all of that.

116
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,040
Um,

117
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,040
by considering the nature of the old
religion and the state of the Prereq

118
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,161
Formation Church,

119
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:19,030
it's strengths,

120
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,410
it's weaknesses,

121
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,430
uh,

122
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,430
and those who were already there are
criticizing some of its features and that

123
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:33,781
will help us to begin consideration of
how it was possible in only a few years

124
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,780
to bring this great edifice crashing down

125
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,150
at the beginning of the 16th century.

126
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,330
The church was of course the greatest
corporate institution in the kingdom.

127
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,640
It was the English branch of a
great international institution,

128
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,880
which gave Western Europe it's identity
collectively as Catholic Christendom

129
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,220
the church in England,

130
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,170
because there wasn't a
church of England yet.

131
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:11,171
The church in England was organized
into two provinces with archbishops at

132
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:12,650
Canterbury and York.

133
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,140
And then there were 21 diocese,

134
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:16,550
each of them headed by a bishop.

135
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,000
And beneath that archdeacon
reason deaneries and so on,

136
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:25,001
down to somewhat more than 9,000
parishes at most local level,

137
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,320
each with its parish church.

138
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,360
And in addition,

139
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,980
scattered around the
landscape but particularly
concentrated in the parts of the

140
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:37,910
north and the West where the
great monasteries and nunneries,

141
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,361
uh,

142
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:40,640
some 750 of them in all

143
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,450
the clergy who staffed this institution.

144
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:49,520
We're a distinct est of the realm.

145
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:50,570
As you already know.

146
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:51,360
Uh,

147
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,240
attempts have been made
to estimate their numbers.

148
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,660
It's been estimated about 60,000 in all,

149
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,660
which would mean that the clergy
comprised about 4% of the entire national

150
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:05,510
population or since most of them were men,

151
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,260
something like 8% of the
entire male population,

152
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,050
very large presence.

153
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:17,450
Members of the clergy enjoyed a privileged
position before the law they were

154
00:07:17,451 --> 00:07:18,920
dealt with in the church courts.

155
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,090
In the first instance though,

156
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:24,110
they could sometimes be handed over
to the secular authorities if they had

157
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:29,111
committed crimes and they were supported
by a variety of fees and dues paid to

158
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,590
them.

159
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:35,590
And in particular tides by which people
gave a 10th of their income or produce

160
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,240
for the maintenance of the church.

161
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,370
And then of course there was a great
endowments given to the Church by Pius

162
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,880
members of the Laity.

163
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,950
So it was a great institution,

164
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,270
a wealthy institution,

165
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,820
the owner of a great deal
of land and property,

166
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,960
but also a collection of more than
9,000 small Christian communities

167
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,940
periodically United in their parish,

168
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:00,590
churches in worship,

169
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,420
in the practice of their religion,

170
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,010
and in considering the old
religion and it's nature,

171
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:12,011
we should perhaps start there with
the fundamentals of the nature and

172
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,660
characteristics of the old faith.

173
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,660
Well,

174
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,960
the central doctrines
can be covered briefly.

175
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,180
They were as follows.

176
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,510
Christ's sacrifice on the cross had made
salvation available to sinful humankind

177
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,920
through grace.

178
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,023
Divine favor,

179
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,850
access to grace,

180
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,230
the means of salvation was made available
through the church and through its

181
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,220
sacraments.

182
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Membership of the church was gained
through the sacrament of baptism,

183
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,370
usually in infancy,

184
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:47,204
of course,

185
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,260
and it was demonstrated by continued
participation in the sacraments,

186
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,980
especially the mass when elements of
bread and wine were consecrated and

187
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,330
transformed into the
body and blood of Christ.

188
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,760
Through the miracle of transubstantiation,

189
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,820
the Christian life involved
obedience to the 10 commandments,

190
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,190
avoidance of the seven deadly sins,

191
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,590
participation in the sacraments,

192
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,050
the doing of good works and prayer.

193
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,570
Given that all mankind was sinful,

194
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,040
believers will enjoy enjoined
to repent of their sins,

195
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,090
to confess them,

196
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,340
to perform penance for them.

197
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,470
And in return,

198
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,710
they were granted
absolution by the priest.

199
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,190
The church as a whole was conceived
of as a community of saints.

200
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,820
And so it was possible to
pray for the souls of others.

201
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:51,020
In addition to which the saints already
in heaven were believed to intercede

202
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:54,780
with God on behalf of living believers.

203
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,290
So petitionary prayers could
be addressed to saints.

204
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,811
And finally,

205
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:05,760
the expiation of sins committed in
life could continue after death.

206
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:09,270
When souls lingered in purgatory,

207
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,340
until they were purged of sin and
made fit for Heaven for heaven,

208
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:20,330
the living could ease the passage of the
dead through purgatory by their press.

209
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,420
Only those who fail to achieve salvation
by their rejection of the means of

210
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:32,010
grace would probably ultimately
suffer eternal torment in hell.

211
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,613
Okay.

212
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,450
Those are the basic beliefs

213
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,030
in its transmission of these central
beliefs and in its practices of worship.

214
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,060
The pre reformation church fostered
what's been described as a ritually and

215
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:52,221
visually rich religion and a society in
which the vast majority of people were

216
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:53,634
illiterate.

217
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,980
The decorations of the church,

218
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,420
the paintings on the wall,

219
00:10:57,421 --> 00:10:58,710
like those in Esb,

220
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,150
the images,

221
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,900
the carved images around
the walls or the altars,

222
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,660
the stained glass windows
with their pictures.

223
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,900
All of these were to a large extent the
books of the unlearned and often they

224
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:17,211
conveyed the essence of central Bible
stories like the progression from the

225
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:21,420
garden of Eden through to
the crucifixion and so forth.

226
00:11:21,421 --> 00:11:26,421
And he's B and they conveyed sometimes
the central doctrines of the faith in

227
00:11:26,851 --> 00:11:28,320
visual representations.

228
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,360
And outstanding example of this is a
15th century stained glass window which

229
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:38,361
survives still in a church near Exeter
in the West country call at a place

230
00:11:38,701 --> 00:11:40,050
called [inaudible].

231
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,770
They have interesting place
names in the West country.

232
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,770
Uh,

233
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,670
I haven't written it on the
board because the words too long,

234
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,320
but you'll find it on your handout.

235
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:50,310
Darlings can leave.

236
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,210
Um,

237
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,710
in the great window there,

238
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,560
they have portrayals up in seven
panels of each of the seven sacraments.

239
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,700
Each of those panels is also linked by
a red line in the glass to the wounds of

240
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:07,240
Christ on the cross.

241
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,580
And the message is quite clear.

242
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,530
Christ's sacrifice,

243
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,760
the flow of grace along the red
lines through the sacraments,

244
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,730
which the,

245
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,061
the,

246
00:12:17,061 --> 00:12:17,251
the,

247
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:17,561
the,

248
00:12:17,561 --> 00:12:21,610
the window represents the
congregation participating in,

249
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,663
or again,

250
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
most churches had an elaborately carved
rood screen which stood at the entrance

251
00:12:31,091 --> 00:12:33,130
to the chancel where the altar was,

252
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,120
uh,

253
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,650
with wooden statues above it.

254
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:36,783
Again,

255
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,200
a crucifix and Various Central Saints.

256
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,293
Um,

257
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,330
all there for observation and
veneration by the congregation.

258
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:48,550
Well,

259
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,870
numerous other images and pictures would
adorn the side chapels of the churches.

260
00:12:52,871 --> 00:12:56,770
They would be alters dedicated to
particular saints and so forth.

261
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,790
At indeed this devotion to the saints,

262
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:05,170
it was a particularly marked
characteristic of late
medieval popular religion.

263
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:11,910
Images and shrines and relics of the
saints were much venerated and much

264
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:13,984
visited.

265
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:14,261
Uh,

266
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:17,320
there were some very great
centers of pilgrimage.

267
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,340
Um,

268
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,590
in Canterbury Cathedral was
the shrine of Saint Thomas,

269
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,600
Rebecca to 12th century English.

270
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,890
St and Walsingham was a shrine
dedicated to the virgin.

271
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,530
A Durham was the shrine of Saint Cuthbert.

272
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,860
The Great Saxon Saint
of the north of England.

273
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,300
And so one could go on.

274
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:35,800
These were the great shrines,

275
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:41,250
but there were also many lesser localized
places which were visited by pilgrims

276
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:46,590
from the area round about and they would
make donations to beautify the images

277
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:51,580
at the alternate the saints
and to maintain their shrines.

278
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,721
For example,

279
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:53,830
down near Exeter,

280
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:54,460
again,

281
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,280
there was a local saint
called Saint Sidwell,

282
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,490
sid w,

283
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,680
e double l.

284
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,521
She was,

285
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:00,770
uh,

286
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:05,770
a Celtic Marta from the early days of
the church in Britain and record survive

287
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:10,120
of the gifts that people
made to St Sidwell.

288
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,380
Uh,

289
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,220
in Exeter.

290
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,450
Um,

291
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:17,140
one person gave her wedding
ring too since it will,

292
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,453
uh,

293
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:23,490
girdles were given to adorn the
statue rosary beads of fine quality.

294
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,050
We're given to be hung about the statue.

295
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:26,500
Uh,

296
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,150
there was money given for renewing
the gilding on since it will statue.

297
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,040
One person even gave money to buy
her a new pair of velvet slippers.

298
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,490
And in return,

299
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,630
people of course made petitionary
prayers to the saints.

300
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:48,070
You could borrow the girdles to
lay across a woman in childbirth,

301
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,630
which was thought to protect her.

302
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:51,891
Well,

303
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,980
obviously this was a system which
could offer a great deal of comfort,

304
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,740
but at the same time it could be
open to the risk of corruption.

305
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,900
It could obscure people's focus upon
the central doctrines of the faith and

306
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:10,901
substitute devotion to particular saints
cults and The Times Expectations of an

307
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:17,351
almost mechanical manipulation of the
powers of particular saints in response to

308
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:20,960
acts of veneration and donations.

309
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:22,820
Uh,

310
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,650
Erasmus of Rotterdam,

311
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:28,700
the great humanist scholar of the
early 16th century who taught at the

312
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,533
University of Cambridge for a while,

313
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:30,500
um,

314
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,570
was deeply critical of all this.

315
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:33,710
He wanted a simpler,

316
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:38,310
more Bible centered faith
and he joked in one of his,

317
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,770
one of his essays,

318
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,320
uh,

319
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,450
about how they were enough pieces of
the true cross or alleged pieces of the

320
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:48,050
true cross in churches in Europe
that if you've got them all together,

321
00:15:48,051 --> 00:15:49,400
you could build Noah's Ark.

322
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:55,510
So Erasmus was prepared to scoff
at all of this and he wasn't alone.

323
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,570
There was undoubtedly a,

324
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,410
an accretion of superstitious practices
around these forms of devotion,

325
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:08,300
which is scrupulous churchmen like
Erasmus found very hard to take.

326
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,790
And some of the saints who were venerated
but rather dubious provenance all over

327
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:14,331
the country.

328
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:19,331
There were holy wells and holy trees where
people would hang gifts and offerings

329
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:24,140
and make requests for assistance.

330
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:29,141
Many of these were very dubious origins
and probably had originated as Celtic

331
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,100
water spirits and tree spirits,

332
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:39,101
which had been gradually incorporated
into the local practice of Christianity in

333
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:40,640
the early Middle Ages.

334
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,520
And then of course there was a
whole business of the relics,

335
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,740
the Abbey of Barry Saint Edmonds,

336
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:48,980
which lies about halfway
between Cambridge and knowledge,

337
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,750
had quite a collection.

338
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,920
They had the clippings
from Saint Edmonds nails.

339
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:00,230
They had the coals with which Saint
Lawrence had been toasted to death.

340
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,311
They had,

341
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,144
so Thomas Tank,

342
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,890
Thomas of Canterbury's pen knife,

343
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,690
and one of his boots,

344
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,600
all of which were objects of veneration.

345
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,710
Well,

346
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:13,940
a lot of this was clearly very far
from being impeccably Christian.

347
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,090
It was the product of
the medieval churches,

348
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,890
toleration of what people
refer to as syncretism.

349
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,823
That's the word,

350
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,040
the blending together of
different religious traditions,

351
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,130
the Christianizing of
some older traditions like
those holy wells and sacred

352
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:32,150
trees and so forth.

353
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:39,010
And at times it could undoubtedly be
hard to draw the line between where

354
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:45,010
Christian devotion to the saints ended
and superstitious practices began.

355
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,750
Okay.

356
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,470
Well the older historiography tended to
lay a lot of emphasis on that kind of

357
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:53,190
thing,

358
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:58,190
stressing the corruption and degeneracy
of the old church and the compromised

359
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,560
nature of it's spirituality.

360
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,280
But more recently in the work of
historians like JJ scares brick and Damian

361
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,210
Duffy and Christopher,

362
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:10,020
hey,

363
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,600
all of whom are on our reading lists,

364
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,740
there's been a tendency to point out
instead the soundness of some of the core

365
00:18:20,161 --> 00:18:23,550
elements of worship and to
argue that whatever its faults,

366
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:29,060
the pre reformation religious system
was in fact hugely successful and hugely

367
00:18:29,971 --> 00:18:30,804
popular,

368
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,340
far from being a sort of rotten tree
ready to fall before the first blast of

369
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,120
reforming wind.

370
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:44,610
Christopher Haigh argues that late
medieval Catholic Christianity,

371
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,451
to quote him,

372
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:48,360
was not only secure in
early modern England,

373
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,660
but also luxuriant and energetic

374
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,960
and the strongest arguments in favor of
such views derived from the evidence of

375
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:03,050
energetic commitment to conventional
devotions at the lowest level,

376
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:05,310
at the level of the parish.

377
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:06,770
Um,

378
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,020
there,

379
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,410
there are three major sources of
such evidence which people draw upon.

380
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:11,370
Um,

381
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:12,203
first of all,

382
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,800
there are people's wills.

383
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,490
Most of them from the early 16th
century leave some bequest to religion.

384
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,333
Um,

385
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,070
the requests,

386
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,090
the bequest of money for services for
the beautification of churches and so

387
00:19:27,091 --> 00:19:27,730
forth.

388
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:27,990
Uh,

389
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:31,740
one of the most spectacular examples
as a man of mentioned before,

390
00:19:31,741 --> 00:19:36,741
the extremely wealthy Robert
Janice of the city of Norwich who,

391
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:37,920
um,

392
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,070
left when he died in the 1520s,

393
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,630
uh,

394
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,810
the greater part of his
fortune for religious purposes,

395
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:49,830
you'd have to 1400 pounds in all which
I was trying to translate into modern

396
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:50,580
money.

397
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,030
Um,

398
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,110
it's difficult to do that,

399
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:57,140
but five or $6 million perhaps left to
religious purposes in modern equivalent.

400
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,600
And there was a particular focus in
such pious bequests upon the endowing of

401
00:20:03,601 --> 00:20:06,540
prayers and masses for dead souls.

402
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:07,681
Robert Janice,

403
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:08,251
for example,

404
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:13,251
of his 1400 pounds laid down that 800
of it was to be spent on paying pre

405
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,480
priests to say prayers for his soul
and for all other Christian souls.

406
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,340
And in addition,

407
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,640
he provided 400 pounds,

408
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,970
a four masses,

409
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,740
which should be said for the same,

410
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:27,330
dedicated to the same purpose.

411
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:33,210
So pious bequests is one form of evidence
of this enthusiasm and involvement.

412
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,351
Secondly,

413
00:20:34,351 --> 00:20:35,580
there are church wardens,

414
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:36,031
accounts,

415
00:20:36,031 --> 00:20:40,590
the account books of parish churches which
sometimes survive and they reveal the

416
00:20:40,591 --> 00:20:45,591
substantial sums of money which people
raised and spent on their churches,

417
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,620
on the fabric of the church,

418
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,490
and it's rebuilding and
beautification and on its furnishings.

419
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,720
They spent far more on such purposes
than they ever paid in taxes or then they

420
00:20:57,941 --> 00:21:00,490
paid to them and oral lords in rents.

421
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,583
Thirdly,

422
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,450
there's the evidence of the activity of
religious guilts all over the country.

423
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:12,451
There were numerous fraternities or
gilts formed for religious purposes where

424
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:18,151
people would band together to maintain
an altar and to pray for the souls of

425
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,760
members of the guild,

426
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:25,090
both the living and
those who had passed on.

427
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,150
They also often had a
charitable functions,

428
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:30,640
poor relief and educational functions,

429
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,391
and they were very,

430
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:35,260
very many of these voluntary
fraternities and guilts,

431
00:21:35,261 --> 00:21:38,020
which people joined in
the city of London alone.

432
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,790
There were 81 religious fraternities
operating in the early years of the 16th

433
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,760
century in Norridge in 1500.

434
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:50,290
There were 21 and even much
smaller places could have them.

435
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,420
The tiny parish of more bath in Devon,

436
00:21:52,421 --> 00:21:54,250
which is to the north of Exeter,

437
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,140
was a place where they had
several guilds which would,

438
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,750
which were run by different
groups within the population.

439
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,830
It was a women's guild.

440
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:04,240
There was a young people's Guild,

441
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,290
um,

442
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:10,290
the peasants of the area dedicated some
of their sheep to the maintenance of

443
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:13,210
their gills and the members took
turns to look after those sheep.

444
00:22:13,211 --> 00:22:16,810
Are the profits went for the
maintenance of the guilds activities?

445
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,250
Well,

446
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,250
clearly there's a lot of evidence of
such activity and such investment in

447
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:24,640
traditional religion.

448
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,570
It was clearly prodigious and
participation was widespread.

449
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,470
You can't gain say that
the evidence is clear.

450
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:39,270
It supports such views as that of the
historian Richard Rex who argues that it's

451
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:45,151
possible that the ideal of a Christian
community United in belief and worship,

452
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,120
an ideal which was to be
pursued so zealously by
Protestants and Catholics alike

453
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:57,660
was never so closely approximated
to as in the late medieval Paris.

454
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:05,050
It's certainly possible to read the
evidence that way and at present,

455
00:23:05,051 --> 00:23:05,501
as I've said,

456
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:05,860
that's,

457
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,040
that's the dominant
trend in historiography,

458
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,960
but at the same time,

459
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:14,350
one has to recognize that it's
not without some ambiguity's.

460
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,400
One can't be sure quite how well attended
parish churches actually where one

461
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:26,881
can't be quite sure just how extensive
participation in parish guilds was in

462
00:23:28,211 --> 00:23:32,800
some places it seems to have been quite
quite widespread though some guilds were

463
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:34,330
somewhat socially exclusive

464
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,400
and above all it's been said that a vast
amount of the money which was invested

465
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:48,301
in the late medieval church was invested
for the specific purpose of easing the

466
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:51,500
passage of one soul through purgatory.

467
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,070
That was fundamental
to a great deal of it.

468
00:23:55,071 --> 00:24:00,071
As in the case of Robert
Janice and arguably that
preoccupation with easing the

469
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:05,321
passage of souls through purgatory was
motivated more by fear than by anything

470
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:07,604
else.

471
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:09,890
In a sense,

472
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,250
purgatory could have been a
somewhat oppressive doctrine,

473
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,160
raising anxiety,

474
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:20,690
particularly amongst those who couldn't
afford to pay for masters for their

475
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:21,524
souls.

476
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:23,803
In other words,

477
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,160
the fact of heavy investment in
traditional religion cannot be denied,

478
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:31,730
but it's meaning is
open to interpretation.

479
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,500
Like so much historical evidence.

480
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:35,810
You can read it more ways than one.

481
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,350
Well,

482
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:43,280
you can say the same sort of thing about
the evidence relating to relationships

483
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:47,030
between members of the
clergy and the Laity.

484
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,150
Certainly there was some
times quite acute conflict,

485
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,610
especially over such matters as ties.

486
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:56,900
People sometimes resent it,

487
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,910
the payment of ties and resisted it
or similarly other Jews which might be

488
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,410
demanded by the clergy.

489
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:06,170
Mortuary payments when
people died and so forth.

490
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,980
And then there was the perennial problem
of instances of clerical misbehavior,

491
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:16,310
especially the sexual
misconduct of a clergy was,

492
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,590
which was theoretically celebrate.

493
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,770
That was the butt of a great deal of
Ribald comment at throughout the late

494
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:24,860
medieval period.

495
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,360
Sometimes the jurisdiction of the church
courts which had jurisdiction over such

496
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:36,850
matters as marriage and the probate and
wills and other things which would have

497
00:25:37,311 --> 00:25:38,930
a spiritual nature.

498
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,060
This was sometimes resented,

499
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,280
particularly by their rivals.

500
00:25:43,281 --> 00:25:47,570
The common lawyers in the
secular courts or again,

501
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:53,070
the the pump and the pride of some of
the great clergy could occasion a certain

502
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:58,691
amount of cynicism and contempt and
outstanding example of a great clergyman.

503
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,540
Who attracted that kind of opprobrium?

504
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,261
Uh,

505
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:05,180
was Henry the eighth chief minister,

506
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,350
Thomas Woolsey,

507
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,300
Cardinal Woolsey,

508
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:10,970
who to all intents and purposes,

509
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,930
ran the government on Henry
the eighth behalf between 15,

510
00:26:14,931 --> 00:26:17,270
14 and 1529.

511
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,850
Woolsey was proud.

512
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:21,500
He was arrogant.

513
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,090
He was extremely able,

514
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,680
but he was arrogant.

515
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,080
He held multiple livings.

516
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:28,190
He was archbishop of York.

517
00:26:28,191 --> 00:26:29,270
He was bishop of Durham.

518
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:30,560
He held other church livings,

519
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:33,860
places he never visited and
do the income from them.

520
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:38,990
He engaged in a great deal
of conspicuous consumption,

521
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,030
building his own palaces,

522
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,070
most of which would
eventually confiscated by the,

523
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,350
he had a mistress and children
and so on and so forth.

524
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,360
It's been argued that if few people
envisaged an alternative religion before

525
00:26:56,461 --> 00:27:01,461
1520 there was nonetheless a
good deal of anti clericalism,

526
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,430
which could be drawn upon when action
was eventually taken against the church.

527
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,990
That view clearly has some
strength and yet again,

528
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,870
one has to consider whether
it might be overdrawn.

529
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,440
It's true that the parish clergy,

530
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,970
what often not very well educated,

531
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:30,330
that some of them had moral failings
is that some of them came into conflict

532
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,050
with their parishioners,

533
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,511
but on the other hand,

534
00:27:34,511 --> 00:27:37,960
the crucial issue was whether they
were adequate to perform the religious

535
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:39,700
services which were expected of them.

536
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,840
Their principal duties
were not as educators.

537
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,810
Their principal duties were as priests.

538
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,080
That principle duties was sac,

539
00:27:48,081 --> 00:27:48,640
a Dota.

540
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,710
They had to perform the rituals,

541
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,060
the sacraments,

542
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,253
the mass.

543
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,900
If they had their faults,

544
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:01,590
they also had the sacred power by virtue
of the ordination to perform those

545
00:28:02,501 --> 00:28:03,334
sacraments.

546
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:07,000
They had the power to consecrate
the elements in the mass.

547
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,690
They had the power to administer
the last rites to the dying.

548
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:16,350
They had the par to absolve sin and that
above all set them apart and it could

549
00:28:17,711 --> 00:28:20,710
make them objects of
reverence or even have anxiety

550
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:23,941
in a sense.

551
00:28:23,941 --> 00:28:28,941
Then human weaknesses could be
cloaked by the majesty of the office.

552
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:35,310
As for the Higher Claire g by the early
16th century men like Thomas Woolsey,

553
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,100
we're really spectacularly exceptional.

554
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,170
Most bishops on the whole,

555
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,860
quite an impressive group if a lot of
them were primarily administrators in

556
00:28:45,961 --> 00:28:48,600
their functions and seventh of the state,

557
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,910
very often as well as of the church,

558
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,560
they were often conscientious
enough in running their diocese.

559
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,420
So given the powers and the
privileges of the clerical estate,

560
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,500
it was inevitable.

561
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:07,290
That's abuses could provoke
resentment and indeed conflict.

562
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:12,350
And there were occasional notorious
scandals which appear particularly

563
00:29:13,111 --> 00:29:15,630
significant in hindsight.

564
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,603
Nevertheless,

565
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,830
if such incidents reveal tensions,

566
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:25,160
they don't necessarily reveal
a fundamental hostility
to the established church.

567
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:36,110
But there was real criticism which went
beyond mere occasion of resentment.

568
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,720
And it came from three sources.

569
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,371
First of all,

570
00:29:43,371 --> 00:29:48,230
there was criticism that came from
reformers within the church itself.

571
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:51,250
Uh,

572
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,150
John [inaudible],

573
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,190
whose name is on your handout,

574
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,190
the Dean of St Paul's Cathedral in London,

575
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,920
was a man who was deeply troubled
by the failings of the church.

576
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,260
He is a famous sermon,

577
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,760
which he preached a convocation,

578
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:08,620
which was the gathering
of the Eden Clergy,

579
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:09,700
the parliament of the church,

580
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,543
if you'd like,

581
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,120
in a sermon to convocation in 1511.

582
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:17,860
He castigated the pride
and the worldliness,

583
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:18,171
which was,

584
00:30:18,171 --> 00:30:22,090
was to be found among
some clergy and call.

585
00:30:22,091 --> 00:30:27,091
It could be said to be representative of
the long reformers tradition within the

586
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:28,780
church itself,

587
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:33,810
whereby strict moralists demanded from
time to time that the clergy should live

588
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:40,201
up to the standards of their
own profession in a manner
which would deserve the

589
00:30:40,991 --> 00:30:44,710
privileges that they enjoyed
and call it wasn't alone.

590
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,880
His close friend,

591
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,290
the pious laymen,

592
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,550
Thomas Moore,

593
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,360
a learned and devout man,

594
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:51,910
um,

595
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:56,910
sympathize greatly with college desire
for the reform of clerical standards.

596
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,500
And so did others among the senior clergy,

597
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:00,070
uh,

598
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,930
Bishop John Fisher of Rochester,

599
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:05,620
which is down in Kent or Bishop
Tunstall first of London,

600
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:06,454
then of Durham,

601
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,700
where other bishops who had reforming
agendas of this kind within the church.

602
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:13,750
Well,

603
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,970
most of these were elite critics.

604
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,460
They well could say,

605
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,750
enjoyed the luxury of,

606
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,050
of,

607
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:21,760
of knowing better,

608
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:25,900
but they weren't willing to challenge
the ultimate authority of the church

609
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:26,734
itself.

610
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,310
Nor were they really willing to damage,

611
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,423
um,

612
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:35,080
the practice of piety
of the common people.

613
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,660
They were very anxious not to break
the unity of Christian Christendom de,

614
00:31:39,661 --> 00:31:43,930
they wanted the church to reform
itself and all of them died.

615
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:44,771
Catholics,

616
00:31:44,771 --> 00:31:49,771
indeed Thomas Moore and John Fisher
both died as martyrs for the old faith

617
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,680
executed in the early years of the
reformation by Henry the eighth.

618
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,420
They died in defense of the papal
authority over the English church.

619
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,780
So there were some
critics within the church.

620
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:04,690
The other end of the scale,

621
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:09,840
there were a set of very
trenchant plebeian critics
of both church authority and

622
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:15,130
the conventional nature of
late Medieval Catholicism.

623
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:18,880
And these were the heretics known
in England as the law lords.

624
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:21,620
Yeah.

625
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,130
Lola,

626
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:26,540
where the followers of a 14th
century Oxford theologian,

627
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,710
John Wycliffe,

628
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:33,490
who had been very critical of the church
off his time with cliff had died in

629
00:32:34,281 --> 00:32:37,580
1384 but his ideas survived him.

630
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:43,840
The lords where an underground heretical
sect and they had survived for over a

631
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:46,940
century.

632
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,550
Despite intermittent persecution.

633
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,520
They were deeply hostile to the
privileges enjoyed by the church.

634
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:00,860
Many of them saw both the pope and the
church hierarchy as being a kind of

635
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:03,710
collective representation of antichrist.

636
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,010
Uh,

637
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:08,390
they were deeply hostile to
veneration of the saints,

638
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,140
the Reverend's shown to saints
and to relics of the saints.

639
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,490
They regarded it as
fraudulent and idolatrous.

640
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:22,790
They were skeptical of the doctrine
of transubstantiation in the mass,

641
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,840
which they tended to see the community
service more as a service of remembers.

642
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:31,730
They regarded the doctrine of
purgatory as a false doctrine,

643
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:36,620
which had been late introduced into the
church and they saw the saying of masses

644
00:33:36,621 --> 00:33:41,621
for souls as simply the mercenary racket
to put money into the pockets of the

645
00:33:42,081 --> 00:33:42,914
priesthood.

646
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,870
And above all,

647
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,290
they relied upon the
authority of the Bible.

648
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,690
From the 1380s onwards,

649
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:55,930
Lorillards had translated the
new testament into English
and copies of their new

650
00:33:58,011 --> 00:33:59,390
testament translation.

651
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,920
We're secretly circulated
amongst Lorillard groups.

652
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,480
Some of them are extremely beautiful.

653
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:10,481
One tends to imagine these as being
rather primitive products produced in

654
00:34:12,081 --> 00:34:12,621
secret,

655
00:34:12,621 --> 00:34:17,480
but some of them survive and they could
be in fact very beautifully produced,

656
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,770
even illuminated.

657
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,340
So these were the lords and all of these
features of their beliefs and attitudes

658
00:34:25,341 --> 00:34:28,040
tend to make them sound
like Protel Protestants.

659
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,490
And so in a sense they were,

660
00:34:31,491 --> 00:34:36,491
Wycliffe undoubtedly influenced the Great
Bohemian reformer of the 15th century

661
00:34:36,501 --> 00:34:41,501
Yan who's of Prague and Yang horses
teachings deeply influenced Martin Luther.

662
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:42,950
So there is,

663
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,830
there is a connection which can be traced.

664
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:51,550
Both Catholics and Protestants were later
to see the Lord's as being for runners

665
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,100
of the reformation in England.

666
00:34:55,101 --> 00:35:00,050
That's a view you find already
current by the 1540s and 1550s

667
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:06,940
but more recently their role
has been somewhat questioned

668
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,710
or at least a potential
for bringing about change.

669
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
The point usually made is that
certainly the law lords were present,

670
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,750
but they were not very numerous.

671
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,880
Well that's true.

672
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:23,990
Nevertheless,

673
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,700
there were some areas of concentration.

674
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:30,380
There were quite a few of them in London
hiding out in the crowd as it work.

675
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:35,210
There were some areas of the country where
their influence has spread and remain

676
00:35:35,211 --> 00:35:36,044
deeply rooted.

677
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,160
The Tilton hills,

678
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,710
just to the north west of London,

679
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,620
it was one area where they
were well established.

680
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,550
Um,

681
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:48,570
there were outposts of these scattered
through the small towns of East Anglia.

682
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:54,260
We know about all of this
because occasionally bishops
would conduct a kind of,

683
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:54,810
um,

684
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:57,300
purge of lives within their diocese.

685
00:35:57,301 --> 00:35:58,230
They would seek them out.

686
00:35:58,850 --> 00:35:59,130
Uh,

687
00:35:59,130 --> 00:35:59,791
in 15,

688
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:00,660
21,

689
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:01,680
one bishop,

690
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:01,891
uh,

691
00:36:01,891 --> 00:36:05,220
conducted such a purge in the
county of Buckingham Show,

692
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:06,060
which is over here,

693
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:09,830
and he brought in over 400 large suspects.

694
00:36:09,831 --> 00:36:11,130
So within a single county,

695
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:12,660
there were a fair number of these people.

696
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,710
They were nevertheless contained.

697
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,350
The church courts where we're vigilant.

698
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,450
There were these occasional purchase.

699
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:23,760
Occasionally a Lord was burned.

700
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,621
Though most of them,

701
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:30,621
when they were found tended to recant and
then quietly go back when they weren't

702
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:33,930
being observed to their private beliefs.

703
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,140
Occasionally though examples
were made and people were burned

704
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,420
over the nation as a whole.

705
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,100
They were a tiny minority,

706
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:48,160
but they were there and in some areas
they were quite a significant presence,

707
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,900
especially amongst the literate laity
of London and parts of the southeast of

708
00:36:53,901 --> 00:36:54,320
England,

709
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,510
which scatterings of
sympathizers elsewhere.

710
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:01,520
There were even some members of the
clergy who secretly sympathized with the

711
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,363
lodge,

712
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,580
so they were able to retain a presence.

713
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,260
They were able to retain a
certain coherence through
their underground contacts,

714
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,980
and I think it's a mistake
to dismiss them entirely.

715
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,820
One could compare them perhaps to the
dissonance of eastern Europe in the 1970s

716
00:37:22,001 --> 00:37:27,001
in 1980s who were hard put to survive
and we're in no position to overthrow the

717
00:37:28,341 --> 00:37:29,450
established system,

718
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,840
but when on the lesser corrosive presence
within it and when the structures of

719
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:40,871
power where eventually to be
shaken the [inaudible] similarly,

720
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:46,330
we're ready to come out into the open
when they had the opportunity and many did

721
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:53,100
well between the critics
within the church,

722
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:58,050
the reforming members of the higher clergy
and the lodge at the other end of the

723
00:37:58,051 --> 00:37:58,884
scale,

724
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:04,100
there were small numbers of people who
can be legitimately described as early

725
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:07,020
Protestants.

726
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:14,140
Most of them didn't actually
owe much to the Lord tradition.

727
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,450
They were mostly highly educated.

728
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:16,931
In fact,

729
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:21,130
they were mostly members of
England's to universities,

730
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,180
Oxford and Cambridge,

731
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,550
but in particularly Cambridge,

732
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:30,790
they were mostly men of
evangelical orientation,

733
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:32,650
very pious.

734
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:38,580
And when they learned of Martin Luther's
doc trinal protests made in Germany in

735
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:43,050
1517 they took an interest.

736
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:48,070
Luther's books were actually available
in the early years after his first

737
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:49,470
protest of 15,

738
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,313
17.

739
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,560
They weren't actually band
until the early 1520s,

740
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:58,690
so people could get hold of copies from
Germany and they were able to read them

741
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,570
to see what was going on.

742
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,550
Some of them became persuaded
of Luther's arguments.

743
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,271
Uh,

744
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:12,271
the Cambridge men who included Thomas
Cranmer later to be the Archbishop of

745
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,320
Canterbury under the Reform Church,

746
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:15,100
um,

747
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,670
met secretly at a tavern known
as the White Horse Tavern,

748
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,211
uh,

749
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:24,211
which was in the red light district of
the town near the river still stands.

750
00:39:25,481 --> 00:39:27,460
It's now the Cambridge I folk museum.

751
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:28,391
Uh,

752
00:39:28,391 --> 00:39:32,470
and the meetings amongst them were known
as little Germany because they were

753
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:37,060
discussing books which had been
smuggled from the centers of the early

754
00:39:37,061 --> 00:39:38,770
reformation in Germany.

755
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,900
They also discussed the works
of the early Swiss reformers,

756
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,460
which were available to them.

757
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:46,661
Well,

758
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:51,040
the position of these early
Protestants was often rather ambiguous.

759
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:56,020
Not all of them had made a full
transition to dock trinal heresy.

760
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,710
Uh,

761
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,830
one who was much venerated later.

762
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:00,400
Uh,

763
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,350
it was a man named
Thomas Bill [inaudible],

764
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,970
who was actually captured and
burned at the stake in 1531.

765
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,410
It seems unlikely that bill nee
was ever a full blown Lutheran.

766
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,150
Nonetheless,

767
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:18,180
he was a passionate evangelical who
detested some aspects of the practice of

768
00:40:21,221 --> 00:40:22,054
worship.

769
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:22,390
Uh,

770
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,290
at the time,

771
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:23,950
uh,

772
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,140
he saw it as a cluttered form of devotion.

773
00:40:26,141 --> 00:40:31,141
He wanted a much more biblically
based religion and he preached openly,

774
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:31,601
uh,

775
00:40:31,601 --> 00:40:32,680
these beliefs,

776
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:33,843
um,

777
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,960
in his own words,

778
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:39,961
he went up to Jerusalem for those beliefs
and was eventually burned in the city

779
00:40:41,081 --> 00:40:41,914
of knowledge

780
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,020
building was a sort of Protestant.

781
00:40:47,021 --> 00:40:48,850
One could say he was halfway there.

782
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,370
Or another example is William Tyndale.

783
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:57,600
Tyndale was the f the first translator
other than the Lords of the New Testament

784
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,840
into English.

785
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,670
The translator of the first published
version of the English New Testament.

786
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:09,700
He had long had the idea that it was
desirable to translate the scriptures into

787
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,563
English.

788
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:14,830
But he originally brought that
project to Cuthbert Tunstall,

789
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:17,560
the reforming bishop of London.

790
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:18,911
Uh,

791
00:41:18,911 --> 00:41:23,440
he was willing to do it within the
boundaries of the existing church.

792
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,940
Tunstall however,

793
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,470
would not back him.

794
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,220
Tunstall,

795
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:31,600
like many churchmen associated the
scriptures in English with Lalande.

796
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,620
He thought it was dangerous,

797
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,070
so Tyndall had to look
for support elsewhere.

798
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,180
And when rejected,

799
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:42,380
he found patronage from a
London merchant called Humphrey.

800
00:41:42,381 --> 00:41:44,330
Monmouth Humphrey.

801
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:48,170
Monmouth is known to have
been a odd sympathizer.

802
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:54,130
He sent Tyndall abroad where Tyndale
eventually became a Lutheran and in 1526

803
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,100
produced his new testament in Germany,

804
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:03,610
had it printed there and copies were
subsequently smuggled into England through

805
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,680
the cloth trade with the Netherlands.

806
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,300
The fact that these early Protestants
were mostly based in Cambridge and parts

807
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:13,310
of East Anglia in London is no accident.

808
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:18,370
These are the areas most easily reached
by the trade routes from the Netherlands

809
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:19,274
and Germany.

810
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:21,201
Well,

811
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:23,450
as William Tyndale story indicates,

812
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:29,380
people like him had a rather
separate origin from the lol ards,

813
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,780
but not infrequently.

814
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,870
They eventually linked up with them.

815
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:39,190
The older Lord Networks was sometimes
activated to smuggle new testaments into

816
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:44,951
England and look Lutheran books into
England once they were banned and by the

817
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:50,081
1520s the two movements had to a large
extent overlapped to some extent.

818
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:55,280
They were merging together and
becoming worn a critical underground.

819
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,960
So one can say that England
had a religious underground
by the 1520s it did not

820
00:43:04,611 --> 00:43:09,611
in itself mount a significant challenge
to the hegemony of traditional religion.

821
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,710
In all probability,

822
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:18,670
it would never have spontaneously gained
the strength to mount a victorious

823
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:24,431
challenge to the religious status
quo of the kind that was mounted by

824
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:29,501
Protestants in some of
the cities of Germany and
Switzerland and Flanders and so

825
00:43:30,351 --> 00:43:31,184
forth.

826
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,320
But to say that that they might never
have gained the spontaneous strength

827
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:38,930
demands such a challenge is speculation.

828
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,160
Because of course what actually
happened is that this tiny minority of

829
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:46,610
dissidents,

830
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,930
actually one

831
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:54,710
and what made it possible was
a contingent circumstance,

832
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:59,740
a contingent circumstance of the kind
that so often makes history take turns

833
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:04,040
which are otherwise utterly unpredictable.

834
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,420
And that circumstance is
probably known to you.

835
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:13,570
In 1527 King Henry the eighth and man
who's hostility to Martin Luther and the

836
00:44:16,431 --> 00:44:17,540
early Protestants.

837
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:22,220
Protestants was such that he had
written a book against them and had been

838
00:44:22,221 --> 00:44:25,700
awarded the title defender
of the faith from the pope.

839
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:30,820
In 1521 this man decided that he
needed to have his marriage dissolved.

840
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,620
He was 35 his wife Catherine,

841
00:44:37,621 --> 00:44:38,610
was 40 ish.

842
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,070
They had one daughter,

843
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:46,100
but they had no sun and the
tutors succession was in danger.

844
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,130
Henry needed his marriage dissolved.

845
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,110
He needed it desperately.

846
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:58,130
All the achievements of his father and
his own early rain in establishing the

847
00:44:58,860 --> 00:44:59,370
Tudor Dynasty.

848
00:44:59,370 --> 00:44:59,551
What?

849
00:44:59,551 --> 00:45:04,080
At risk of being lost without
a male heir to the crown.

850
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,880
He needed a new wife.

851
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,380
He needed to remarry,

852
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,520
hopefully to be get such
a son to succeed him.

853
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:18,030
The pope Clement the seventh
would have loved to cooperate.

854
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,320
Pope's usually cooperated with
kings over such difficult matters,

855
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,280
but he couldn't oblige for
political reasons since the
pope was in the immediate

856
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:31,110
power of the emperor of Germany,

857
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:35,370
Charles the fifth who happened
to be clean Katherine's nephew.

858
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:41,880
So these were the contingent
circumstances and it was those contingent

859
00:45:41,881 --> 00:45:42,870
circumstances,

860
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,170
which were to make all the difference

861
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:48,900
and how that happened.

862
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:50,280
We'll look at next week.
