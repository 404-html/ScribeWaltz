WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.970
Um,
so last time,
uh,
we start,

2
00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:10.971
we started talking about tropical places where high productivity agriculture is

3
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:14.580
generally not just not possible.
And hence,

4
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:19.581
without productive agriculture you can't support a dense populations.

5
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.760
So those cultures grew up,
uh,

6
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.090
in time in places where plenty of land land was not filled up,

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.920
whose people that were scarce.

8
00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.550
And so while individual women of course still had to control their fertility so

9
00:00:38.771 --> 00:00:42.240
that the children,
infants that they had didn't die.
And there's many,

10
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:45.120
many things that they do for that.

11
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.540
The community cultural controls on fertility or generally absent cause for the

12
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:55.410
com the community point of view,
you always want to be,
uh,

13
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.860
at that time larger and among other reasons to protect your community from the

14
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:04.020
ravages of hostile,

15
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.370
hostile neighbors cause almost all of these communities or you just read any

16
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:10.830
history of any part of the world,
constant,

17
00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:14.550
constant warfares as we've discussed a lot.

18
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.620
So,
uh,
of of many places in the world,

19
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:24.120
which one could describe traditional Africa provides some of the best examples

20
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.580
of how these cultures operate.
And again,

21
00:01:26.581 --> 00:01:29.070
I want to emphasize that this is a tradition,

22
00:01:29.071 --> 00:01:33.670
a picture of a traditional time and things are changing now extremely,
uh,

23
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.680
rapidly everywhere in the world,
including of course Africa.

24
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.930
Um,
as I showed you last time,
uh,

25
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.590
Africa really is different than the rest of world.

26
00:01:46.591 --> 00:01:51.390
I showed you statistics comparing Morocco on the north coast of Africa,

27
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.350
included in the Mediterranean cultural zone.
You're crossed the Sahara,

28
00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.480
you're in Asia or in Mali and totally different,
uh,

29
00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.720
situation.
The number of children as much Ha,
uh,
that people have as much higher.

30
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.690
I showed you that the number of children that they want as much higher infant

31
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:13.050
mortality has come down in both places in Morocco.

32
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.530
The fertility responds to it in the share.
The fertility,
uh,

33
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.940
does not respond to it.
So,
uh,

34
00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.790
while
we're going to win,

35
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.790
so we're going to discuss this region and using a lot of generalizations which

36
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.410
will not fit any particular,
uh,
culture.
Uh,

37
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.610
if you add up all of the birth rates,
statistics,
uh,

38
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.640
sub Saharan Africa has about twice the birth rate of North Africa.

39
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.200
And again,
it's all Sunni Muslim we're talking about.

40
00:02:46.201 --> 00:02:50.490
So religion is not the difference,
but something else about the southern culture,

41
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:51.630
which we've been talking about,

42
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.490
which probably starts with the agriculture and then goes into other fields.

43
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.560
So,
uh,
and of all the things that are changing,
uh,

44
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.670
in Africa,
fertility,
the attitudes toward fertility,
again,

45
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:11.140
I'm always using fertility as the number of children a woman actually has and

46
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:13.060
not her ability to have children.

47
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.040
The attitudes toward fertility are sort of the most resistant to change.

48
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.240
So these societies have what you might call a culture of reproduction in which

49
00:03:24.581 --> 00:03:29.581
the central idea is that of lineage of family and it's line of male ancestors

50
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.360
and the prime duty and these cultures is to keep the lineage going.

51
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.480
Of course,
you've all read stuff about China.
China is not a traditional,

52
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:43.120
China's not particularly different than this.

53
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.560
And the important thing is to provide descendants for the ancestors.

54
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.150
Not only is your own future if you don't have the sentence,

55
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.970
your own future as a shade.
That's sort of a spirit that hovers around,

56
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.580
is dependent on continuation of the line.

57
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.540
But the whole history of ancestors stretching back,
uh,

58
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.260
is dependent on your having descendants and the whole future line,

59
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.650
which is perceived as sort of almost an existence or potential existence.

60
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.890
The whole line from the distant past going through you to the distant future is

61
00:04:17.291 --> 00:04:22.291
all dependent on you having a descendants in male descendants in the line.

62
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.730
So the central purpose,
the central goal,

63
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:32.731
the central job of existence is to continue this line of fertility.

64
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.510
Now,
uh,
the traditional religion is based on,

65
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.570
uh,
this lineage idea.
Uh,

66
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.460
and because it's your own and the gods are in a sense,
your own ancestors,

67
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:50.590
people that you knew,
people that you talk to,

68
00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.000
they stay more close to you after they die.

69
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.470
So unlike western God's where you pray,

70
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:03.750
but it's never clear whether your prayers are being answered or not.
Uh,

71
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.820
in an ancestor worship,
uh,
situation,
the answer right there and there,

72
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.240
you can talk back and forth with them.
They're not distant Erie,

73
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:15.010
supernatural kind of characters,

74
00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.340
but rather like a grandfather who just stays near us after his death.

75
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.240
And this kind of description comes from the ethnography is the anthropologists

76
00:05:25.241 --> 00:05:30.010
that go and talk to the people in these sort of traditional cultures.

77
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.100
The lineage head who is almost always the old,

78
00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.130
the often the oldest male member of the lineage.

79
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.960
He often can communicate directly with these ancestors or there may be a

80
00:05:40.961 --> 00:05:44.070
soothsayer in the community.
And then the,

81
00:05:44.071 --> 00:05:49.071
the head man will commission the Soothsayer to ask the ancestors some a

82
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.860
particular question.

83
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.750
And the ancestors are quite available to discuss the most ordinary and mundane

84
00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.380
issues of life.
Or they can discuss a very weighty affairs.
Uh,

85
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:04.670
this doesn't require waiting for some big holiday or some huge amount of time.

86
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.660
It can be the whole thing can be transacted in 15 minutes or maybe half an hour.

87
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.200
Sometime they contacted,
they provide their answers and,
and,

88
00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.510
and you've got the answer that you need.

89
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.900
And so one of the interesting with respect to this course,

90
00:06:17.901 --> 00:06:21.920
one of the interesting things that goes on is that family planning is being

91
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:23.220
introduced into Africa.

92
00:06:23.221 --> 00:06:27.020
It has been now for quite a while and it's becoming available.

93
00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.850
And so the people are thinking it over.
It's a hot topic.
They're discussing it.

94
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.580
They're trying to figure out whether it's good for them or not,

95
00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:38.270
whether it's permissible for them or not.
What's going to happen if you use it,

96
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:39.710
what's going to happen if you don't use it?

97
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.920
It's a very hot topic and of course they want the wisdom of the ancestors on

98
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:51.290
this.
And so in the middle of this one set of demographers,

99
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.610
uh,
went into a,
in Ghana there's a,

100
00:06:54.611 --> 00:06:56.400
a group of non Kona,

101
00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.300
the name of the people there and they went into their villages and they wanted

102
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.540
to see how this worked out.
This discussion with the ancestors,
uh,

103
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.060
the,
as they call the traditional religion,
uh,

104
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.740
would be hostile to the introduction of family planning because elsewhere in the

105
00:07:12.741 --> 00:07:14.990
world of course,
the more conservative,

106
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.500
the more it doesn't depend on the individual religion that particular religion

107
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.530
as,
as I have said and will say again.
Uh,

108
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.840
but it does depend on the religiosity of the person.

109
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:26.870
The more religious a person is in almost any tradition,

110
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.090
the more hostile they will be to change.

111
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.800
And in particular to the adoption of new reproductive practices like family

112
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:38.120
planning.
So they were interested in this issue,
how this would work out in,

113
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:42.940
in traditional villages in Africa.
So he asks the village head,
man,
uh,

114
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:46.520
one of the anthropologists,
uh,
to inquire of the spirits,

115
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.970
how many children should have family have simple question.

116
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.190
And here's what the spirit said.
Listen to what I have to say.

117
00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.050
Children are the lineage.
If there are no children in the lineage,
the lineage,

118
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.910
if there are no children,
the lineage will end.
We ancestors want many children.

119
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.470
The women should give birth to many children.
Okay,

120
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:13.670
that was pretty clear answer.
There was no,
no fussing around with that one.
And,

121
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:17.410
but being western skeptics,
you know,
the democracy didn't really believe that,

122
00:08:17.411 --> 00:08:21.200
that the ancestor was saying that.
Uh,
so he was saying,
well,

123
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:26.201
the head man put into the mouths of the spirits or whatever the head man

124
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.640
believed.
And that was not made the anthropologist quite satisfied with this.

125
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.230
But he was a clever,
a good scientist.
And he did the control experiment.

126
00:08:36.470 --> 00:08:37.520
He asked the head man,

127
00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:41.030
the same head man who had just reported the conservative views of the ancestors.

128
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.120
But what do you think got a completely different answer.

129
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:50.000
Women need to have just enough children currently it is very difficult to fend

130
00:08:50.001 --> 00:08:54.230
for the children.
There's no food to feed them.
If they are in school,

131
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.140
it is difficult to pay their school fees and to buy them school uniforms,

132
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:02.800
taking them to the hospital when they're sick,
demands a lot of money.
Uh,

133
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:07.410
that is why we need to give birth to few children.
Oh,

134
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:08.910
well that's a little different take.

135
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.970
And so then the demographers brain starts rolling and says,
Aha,

136
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.530
now I got the scene.
Now I got it right.
Uh,

137
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.440
the ancestors are given the traditional point of view.
Well that's true.

138
00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:21.450
That was what the older generation believed.

139
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:25.200
But the head men are part of the current generation and they're going to take

140
00:09:25.201 --> 00:09:29.940
current views into consideration and take a more moderate view.

141
00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:34.530
So they interviewed the next,
went to the next village and interviewed the next,

142
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:36.210
uh,
lineage head.

143
00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:40.980
And that hypothesis didn't stand up speaking for himself.

144
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:42.000
The headman said,

145
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.440
I would like them to have many children because of a large following that makes

146
00:09:46.441 --> 00:09:48.990
one a chief.
There's power in numbers.

147
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.160
So this is the idea that if you have only a few people in your village,

148
00:09:53.161 --> 00:09:55.830
you're not very powerful.
Your neighbors can ignore you,

149
00:09:55.831 --> 00:09:57.030
they can take advantage of you.

150
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.260
But if you have a big set of descendants and big family and extended family,

151
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:05.970
big village,
then you a powerful chief and he wanted children's so that he,
uh,

152
00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.480
would be powerful.
Uh,

153
00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:15.090
but the amp,
then this same guy was asked to,
well,

154
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.250
it has to see what the ancestors have to say about it.

155
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.570
And the ancestors said everybody should have a small number of children,

156
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:24.300
but they should not refuse to have children altogether.

157
00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:29.460
And so since the ancestors are close at hand,

158
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.990
it's perfectly reasonable that they are aware,
uh,
of current trends.

159
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.820
And one of the ancestors said,

160
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.720
it is now difficult to get an education as well as to do farming.

161
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:44.400
If we're problem crops up and the child is sick,
then money is everything.

162
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.030
You have to buy medicine meaning modern medicine.
Uh,

163
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.600
and even if you go to the herbalist,
traditional medicine,

164
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:56.430
you need to take a foul,
a chicken or something along to pay for the treatment.

165
00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.540
It's no longer the same as in the olden days when everybody did farming.

166
00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.700
It's the ancestors speaking very well aware of current trends and,
and problems.

167
00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:09.660
So after they interviewed a whole lot of these non villages in Ghana,

168
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:15.110
they summarize the research and the result was no pattern of responses at all.

169
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.100
Uh,
sometimes the head,
the head man and his ancestors,
they agreed.

170
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:21.870
Sometimes they disagreed,

171
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.900
sometimes it was the ancestor taking the conservative line.

172
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.500
Sometimes it was the head man taking the conservative line.

173
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.670
It was indeed like a discussion between um,
uh,

174
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.870
a man and say his grandfather,
uh,
that was going on.

175
00:11:36.871 --> 00:11:39.820
And they will have different points of view and individuals,
uh,

176
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.793
will be different.

177
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:47.540
This contact with the ancestors seems quite natural because you read this story,

178
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:51.630
you know,
you're here.
This story is my God.
Uh,
but,
uh,

179
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.200
it's perfectly natural that people,
uh,
the,

180
00:11:57.201 --> 00:12:00.550
the people in northern Ghana,
they have no word for supernatural.

181
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.040
It just doesn't exist.
They don't have any,

182
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:05.140
they aren't scientific explanations for anything.

183
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:10.030
So all explanations are sort of somewhere floating around.

184
00:12:10.031 --> 00:12:13.480
Someone were empirical and observational and some of them are,

185
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.220
are supernatural.

186
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:20.470
And so there's no boundary between these kinds of explanations for things.

187
00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:25.060
And so they don't have such a word and they don't distinguish the,

188
00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.950
these kind of discussions with the ancestors from real things,
real dreams are,

189
00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:32.650
or daydreams or any,
anything else.

190
00:12:32.651 --> 00:12:35.110
It's all very fluid kind of thing.

191
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:40.250
Two people living in that kind of have a culture,

192
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.880
the western idea of an unwavering set of rules cast in stone in some book

193
00:12:46.581 --> 00:12:50.760
thousands of years ago.
Like the Bible,
like the Koran,
uh,
would I,

194
00:12:50.761 --> 00:12:54.800
it would seem ludicrous to not uncommon to them.
Our system of,
of,

195
00:12:54.801 --> 00:12:59.801
of a book that says everything you need to know is as crazy as our view of them.

196
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:05.090
Uh,
talking to the ancestors and you should think,

197
00:13:05.091 --> 00:13:08.750
compare this kind of individualistic,
flexible,

198
00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:14.000
a style of religion to the mass monotheistic religions that we have in the

199
00:13:14.001 --> 00:13:17.960
northern temperate zones,
least the western northern temperate zones.

200
00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.910
These religions are all part of a big political structure which require

201
00:13:22.911 --> 00:13:27.911
uniformity of the subjects of some king or some emperor and submission to that

202
00:13:28.521 --> 00:13:30.730
person.
And of course,
as you probably all know,

203
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.260
the word Islam itself means submission.

204
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:38.860
And the ideal in monotheistic religions is often works.

205
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:49.840
Don't give me trouble.

206
00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:00.600
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

207
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.690
<v 0>Notice the uniformity.
This is women at at prayer.</v>

208
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.230
I and notice the university as a CEO,
when you see a bigger picture of this,

209
00:14:07.231 --> 00:14:09.780
this just a sea of women at some big event,

210
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:14.520
all dressed identically or looking identically.
When I was in Morocco,

211
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:19.910
I got a little instruction book that is given to children about how to pray and

212
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:24.240
every detail is specified down to when you're bowed down during prayer,

213
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:28.620
the position of the toes is specified or they crawled under or are they spread

214
00:14:28.621 --> 00:14:30.750
out?
You have to to know that.

215
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:35.990
So conformity is a very important part of mass religion.

216
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.350
Of course,
in the West,
how is conformity enforced?
In Christianity,

217
00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.240
you burn the heretical,

218
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:47.370
no long history of burning and killing by the dominant church.

219
00:14:47.371 --> 00:14:51.860
Wherever it is,
you just slaughter the people that even on very tiny,

220
00:14:52.290 --> 00:14:52.670
uh,

221
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:56.180
theological differences if they don't believe exactly as this as the authorities

222
00:14:56.181 --> 00:14:59.270
think they should believe or would their head.

223
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:04.810
So it's a very different kind of pattern of,
of,

224
00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:09.450
of cultural
understanding of,
of,

225
00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:14.330
of religion and ancestors and the world.
Okay.

226
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.770
So given this intensity of devotion to the,

227
00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.780
to the,
to the lineage,
uh,
the main virtue in Africa,

228
00:15:23.781 --> 00:15:28.070
then his fertility,
uh,
the main sin is to be barren,

229
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:33.190
is to not have children and inability to have children.

230
00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:38.330
Barrenness is not a just a passive thing that happens to you.
Uh,

231
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.300
but it's punishment for something bad that you have done.

232
00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:47.120
And there's no distinct,
there's very little distinction between infertility.

233
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.710
The woman just can't get pregnant and,

234
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:52.820
and of course they don't accept the idea that it might be the man's fault,

235
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:56.090
but the woman doesn't get pregnant and she's infertile.

236
00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.470
She has miscarriages goes partway through the pregnancy or infant deaths.

237
00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:05.180
The important thing is to have descendants who can carry on the line and
however,

238
00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:10.181
whatever the mechanism is by which a man or a woman or the family is incapable

239
00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:16.190
of having descendants,
that's the worst sin and it's your fault.
It's not,

240
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.770
it's not a passive thing that that happens to you.

241
00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.150
A barren women can be divorced,

242
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.880
they can be shunned and sometimes they need to,

243
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.450
they're not even allowed to live in the center of the village because of course

244
00:16:29.451 --> 00:16:31.760
they have no scientific explanation for baroness.

245
00:16:31.761 --> 00:16:35.630
But maybe it's catching and some sense either by evil spirits,
which are 10,

246
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.610
which are keeping the woman from getting pregnant.

247
00:16:37.611 --> 00:16:41.930
You don't want the evil spirits to attack you or some other reason,

248
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:46.640
they can often be required to live on the edge of the village.

249
00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.670
Given this emphasis on in one way or another,
getting pregnant.
Uh,

250
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.370
monogamy is not strictly enforced.

251
00:16:55.371 --> 00:16:59.630
It's not the kind of obsession that it is in,
in the west.

252
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.470
Uh,
here's a wonderful story.
Recent 2000,

253
00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:06.260
this is the People newspaper from Nairobi,
Kenya.

254
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:12.010
A group of woman stormed the Kenyan police station to demand that officer's

255
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.890
either make love to them or close illegal drinking dance.

256
00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:19.940
They said the drinking made their husbands impotent.

257
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.473
You like that?

258
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.410
The women said the population of the district was falling off as a result of the

259
00:17:27.411 --> 00:17:31.790
poor sexual performance of the men.
Uh,

260
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.360
they,
uh,
the,
the women,
uh,
it was Kindara actually north of Nairobi,

261
00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:42.830
uh,
brought the businesses in town to a halt with their day long protest against

262
00:17:42.831 --> 00:17:45.500
excessive drinking by their menfolk quote.

263
00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.870
Our men have turned to vegetables.

264
00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:51.130
They leave home early and come back and toxicant it.

265
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.450
There's no one to meet the sexual needs of the wives.

266
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.950
And guess which group it was,
uh,
where these women came from.

267
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.700
It was 24 Catholic Church groups in,
in Kenya.

268
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:07.080
They came together and demanded that the officer in charge of the police
station,

269
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.910
uh,
uh,
order his men to make love to these women.

270
00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.450
The newspaper discretely does not say how the police responded to,

271
00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:20.160
to this demand.
Now.
Uh,

272
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:25.280
so the women must be fertile and the man must be believed to be potent or,

273
00:18:25.801 --> 00:18:30.450
or,
or fertile.
It's of course,
it's harder to tell whether the man is or isn't.

274
00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.120
Uh,
the men of course,
uh,

275
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:37.500
in a sense want to keep the fertility of the women for themselves,

276
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.370
but it's more important to have children no matter who is the,

277
00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:45.630
is the biological father and not only in the family,

278
00:18:45.631 --> 00:18:47.400
but once a child is born,

279
00:18:47.401 --> 00:18:51.090
perhaps under obviously uncertain circumstances,

280
00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:55.590
the village will accept the,
the community accepts the children.
They need people,

281
00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:58.990
they,
uh,
they,

282
00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:04.020
they want strength in numbers.
And so promiscuity is not frowned on,

283
00:19:04.021 --> 00:19:07.200
particularly,
uh,
by,
uh,
the community.

284
00:19:07.201 --> 00:19:12.120
Everybody knows it goes on and just kept quiet.
So I was reading,

285
00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.910
uh,
this week and last a history of Lesotho.

286
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:20.370
Lesotho's a small country.
You've been there?
Oh,
no,
no.
Okay.

287
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.740
A small enclave totally surrounded,
uh,
by South Africa.
And this was,
uh,

288
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:30.630
a history of before the Europeans came about the 17 hundreds,

289
00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:35.970
and there was a king then in king was a very small group at that time.

290
00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.710
And not much more than a village.
And when the third son,

291
00:19:40.711 --> 00:19:44.280
this is this a sort of a quote,
when the third son of the king died,

292
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.130
he left a widow who was still of childbearing age,

293
00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:50.400
but had no surviving children by custom,

294
00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.150
the widow should have gone to live with her husband's younger brother so that

295
00:19:54.151 --> 00:19:57.690
she could continue the seed of her dead husband exactly as,

296
00:19:57.691 --> 00:20:01.230
as we see in the old testament that we talked about last time.

297
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:06.980
But the widow didn't agree and she went off and actually got pregnant by sort of

298
00:20:07.201 --> 00:20:11.790
a no good,
who wasn't even of that tribe.
Now this is a real,
a real,
no,
no.

299
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.600
And,
but nevertheless,
the child,

300
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.440
since that woman was legally part of a certain lineage,
uh,

301
00:20:19.441 --> 00:20:23.190
that child by someone who wasn't even a member of the tribe and against the

302
00:20:23.191 --> 00:20:27.060
convention was still accepted as a member of the kings,

303
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:29.250
a lineage there.

304
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:34.580
And it turns out that the child of this elite illegitimate in a sense child

305
00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.280
became the greatest king that Lesotho has ever known.

306
00:20:38.281 --> 00:20:41.170
A very important guy named Moshe [inaudible].

307
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:47.060
And Michelle show himself the grandson of the time I'm talking about,

308
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:53.080
he was reputed to have 140 to 200 wives.
You read the history.
They,

309
00:20:53.081 --> 00:20:55.950
of course,
they have whatever written records they have.
And the,

310
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:58.150
the first one says,
well,
he,
when,
when he was young,

311
00:20:58.151 --> 00:21:01.300
when he was 35 wives and he's 81 I said,
every,

312
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.980
every time this is reported as he gets older and probably accumulates more
wives,

313
00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:08.290
uh,
the number goes up.

314
00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:11.920
The last report was 200 wives because we don't know anything about the accuracy

315
00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:13.083
of this,

316
00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.130
but it would said most of his latter wives were regarded as distinctly inferior.

317
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.660
Michaud show would summon whomever he wished to spend the night with him.

318
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.210
And he undoubtedly sired avast progeny.

319
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.860
He also offered these lesser wives to visitors for the night by way of

320
00:21:29.861 --> 00:21:32.650
hospitality.
But according to custom,

321
00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.700
any children these visitors produced were regarded as Michelle shows own

322
00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:41.530
children.
So again,
in the West,
uh,

323
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.750
uh,
chastity,
uh,

324
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:49.830
monogamy is valued who the father is in under populated culture and cultures

325
00:21:51.611 --> 00:21:53.440
that have responded to under population.

326
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.410
It's the children that's wanted and they're,
the mechanism of,

327
00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.050
of biologically fathering the child is,
is much less importance.

328
00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.180
Uh,
I experienced this myself quite surprisingly.
I,

329
00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:08.890
I think I mentioned I had been in Borneo living with some headhunters for awhile

330
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.630
and I got along pretty well with the young guys who sort of the guy stayed

331
00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.370
together.
And so after I was there a little bit,

332
00:22:15.371 --> 00:22:17.530
they offered me their sisters and said,
you know,

333
00:22:17.531 --> 00:22:21.970
you shouldn't be sleeping alone and a discretion,
I won't tell you what happened.

334
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.640
So even now,
nowadays,
uh,

335
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
many African scholars maintain that African societies even don't even really

336
00:22:33.791 --> 00:22:36.790
distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate births.

337
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:42.290
A 15 to 25% of women in various west and east African countries,

338
00:22:42.551 --> 00:22:47.110
including Kenya for instance,
report premarital births.
So that's that.

339
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.080
They may or may not marry the guy,
but there's,

340
00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.170
before marriage and as all these estimates of,

341
00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:57.430
of behavior that is now becoming with the Christianization of the Islamization,

342
00:22:57.760 --> 00:22:58.150
uh,

343
00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:03.150
becoming somewhat questionable if the official physics are 15 to 25% for sure.

344
00:23:03.671 --> 00:23:08.130
It's a lot larger than that.
Uh,

345
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.060
now,
of course,

346
00:23:10.061 --> 00:23:15.061
the husband again isn't really wildly happy about all this playing around and

347
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.740
but what,
what most is important to him as his status.

348
00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:25.210
The,
again,
the biological parentage of the child is,
is less important.

349
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:28.870
He knows whatever child his wife has will be officially his,

350
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.570
but he doesn't want to get to be known as impotent.

351
00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:36.670
His potency is what matters to him.
So as long as the woman,

352
00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:41.530
uh,
and this happens a lot because there's a very often the man is quite

353
00:23:41.531 --> 00:23:44.910
significantly older than the wife,
especially younger,
you know,

354
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.110
as he gets older and accumulates more wives than younger wives.

355
00:23:48.111 --> 00:23:52.610
And so his potency may really be flagging,
uh,
quite a bit.
So it's a real concern.

356
00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.830
But as long as,
and if the wife,
it's,
if as long as the wife is discreet,

357
00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:02.030
it doesn't make a public display that,
that this kid is really someone else's,

358
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:05.330
then,
uh,
not a big problem.

359
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:09.470
The father of the legal father accepts the child,

360
00:24:09.471 --> 00:24:11.150
the community accepts the child.

361
00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.550
So anthropology Curtis is very interesting and,
uh,

362
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.100
they won a wonderful,
uh,

363
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:22.160
Susan Watkins From University of Pennsylvania.

364
00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:27.161
Sociologists works in Kenya in the low with the Louisville and the west of

365
00:24:27.741 --> 00:24:32.420
Kenya,
[inaudible] people.
And she got together a focus group,
uh,

366
00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:35.360
of women to discuss this issue.
It's a long thing.

367
00:24:35.361 --> 00:24:40.010
I just tell you a little bit from it.
Uh,
and so,
uh,
Susan says,

368
00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.040
so sometimes women were unfaithful,
you know,

369
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:47.300
pretending a western perspective.
And the women said yes,

370
00:24:47.301 --> 00:24:51.560
being unfaithful started long time ago and other woman Lauren go,

371
00:24:51.561 --> 00:24:52.730
the older woman,

372
00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:57.170
the elder women will tell us that the only time you could sleep with another man

373
00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.750
was if your husband was not able to make you pregnant.

374
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.520
But it's not that way anymore.

375
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:07.970
And so the moderator again ass and once you got the baby of the other man,

376
00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.730
was it for your husband or the other man?

377
00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:13.970
And notice the forest taken for granted that this is a gift.

378
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:18.110
And who did you make the gift for is the gift for your husband or a gift for the

379
00:25:18.111 --> 00:25:21.890
other man.
And the women are somewhat incredulous.

380
00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:26.630
Of course it is for your husband.
The other man is just like a bull.

381
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:30.140
Uh,
doesn't your cow wander?
And,

382
00:25:30.141 --> 00:25:32.360
and mate with another bowl from,

383
00:25:32.361 --> 00:25:36.410
from the next field when the cow gives birth,
is it,

384
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.250
is the calf yours?
Where's the calf and the owner of the other bull?

385
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:44.960
Of course it's yours,
you know,
the whole women join.
It's a wonderful,
uh,

386
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.110
kind of a little story.
And in this,

387
00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:51.260
the women are kind of incredulous that Susan Watkins herself does not have any

388
00:25:51.261 --> 00:25:55.490
cows.
They sort of presume that in,
in their answers that,

389
00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:00.380
that she does.
And it's also pretty obvious how sort of,

390
00:26:00.381 --> 00:26:01.520
matter of fact,
uh,

391
00:26:01.521 --> 00:26:05.840
the women are about men's limited biological role is one might say,

392
00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:09.530
and there's no romanticization of the relationship.
Uh,

393
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:12.950
none of the western fetish about biological paternity.

394
00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:16.930
So not only his extra marital,
uh,

395
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:21.560
fertility not frowned on in the same way that it is at least officially here in

396
00:26:21.561 --> 00:26:23.100
the West.
Uh,

397
00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:27.800
but premarital promiscuity is reasonably acceptable.

398
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:32.510
So,
and,
uh,
not,
maybe not surprisingly,
uh,

399
00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:35.960
y'all know about truck drivers going around spreading aids from village to

400
00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:39.170
village.
Guess who else spreads?
Aid School teachers.

401
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:43.130
So school teacher is someone who has an education,

402
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:45.600
has been perhaps in the capitol or some big city,

403
00:26:45.601 --> 00:26:50.440
has actually been to some sort of secondary or,
or college education and has a,

404
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:54.300
an income,
a white collar job,
a steady income from the government.

405
00:26:54.301 --> 00:26:55.530
Teachers aren't much demand.

406
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:59.820
So this is a very high status person and he's assigning finishes.

407
00:26:59.821 --> 00:27:04.590
College is assigned to some village in the bush and it's the,

408
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.320
maybe the,
the only,
the highest status person there.

409
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.740
So what do the parents of all the eligible daughters do?

410
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.620
They bring the daughter to them and offer him,

411
00:27:13.621 --> 00:27:16.950
try out my daughter and uh,

412
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.580
which sometimes they do and sometimes they don't.
Uh,

413
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:26.030
but the statistics are now very clear that these teachers have picked up aids in

414
00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:30.900
the city and they're one of the roots of spreading aids,
uh,
in the villages.

415
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:37.230
So along with this loose attitude toward paternity,

416
00:27:37.231 --> 00:27:39.940
toward who was exactly the father,
uh,

417
00:27:39.941 --> 00:27:43.560
the children that are held a lot to a large degree in common,

418
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.210
they do have a nuclear family.

419
00:27:45.211 --> 00:27:49.140
We have a mother and a father of well-defined pair their children,

420
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:52.050
no question about who,
who are their children.

421
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:56.730
That idea of a nuclear family is not a common,
uh,

422
00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:58.590
they're,
um,

423
00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.610
30 to 50% when they survey.

424
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.020
30 to 50% of the children are not living in the compound with their biological

425
00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.440
mother or father.
Uh,
in either case.

426
00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:15.420
And nuclear family is,

427
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.240
let's see if I can get this one out.

428
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.620
<v 1>Oh,
come back.</v>

429
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:37.400
<v 0>Yeah.
So very,
very simple things to find a nuclear family.
Uh,</v>

430
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.490
how frequently does he does main meal?
That doesn't man,

431
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:43.740
it has made meal with his wife.

432
00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:48.810
This gets studied how often he eats his,
made me with his children.
You know,

433
00:28:48.811 --> 00:28:51.450
this is things that we take just absolutely for granted.

434
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.020
How frequently does his wife go with him when he visits friends?

435
00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:57.420
How frequency does his wife go with him when he,

436
00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:01.830
when he visits relatives and how much of his free time does he spend with his

437
00:29:01.831 --> 00:29:06.460
wife and children?
And there's studies of this over the years.
Uh,

438
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:09.380
there's good study in Kenya for instance.
Uh,

439
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:13.440
and the answer to all of these are rarely that there's,

440
00:29:13.441 --> 00:29:18.370
there's a very low degree of new,
of nucleation of the families.

441
00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.050
Again,
this is changing and families are becoming more and more nucleated.

442
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:27.290
And one of the things that studied is the percentage of people in marriages that

443
00:29:27.901 --> 00:29:31.470
are considered nuclear.
And the last is a guy.
So I would like 21,

444
00:29:31.471 --> 00:29:34.320
only about one fifth of families were what we,

445
00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:37.970
what we would call nuclear families.
Just that idea of,

446
00:29:37.971 --> 00:29:40.500
of a tight knit family exclusive.

447
00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:44.590
And in many ways it's just not a common sort of thing.

448
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:46.361
Another,

449
00:29:46.361 --> 00:29:51.361
a result of this attitude is what we might call a quayside prostitution.

450
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:57.010
Uh,
in that traditional system,
the f the father,

451
00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:02.030
the husband is not necessarily required to provide economic support to the

452
00:30:02.831 --> 00:30:06.460
children.
He's probably a rich man or has some land.

453
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.890
He gives that to his wife.
If he has several wives,

454
00:30:08.891 --> 00:30:13.720
he divides it up among the wives.
They then grow the food on the land.

455
00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:17.470
They also have to do some work on his land cause men don't want to work.

456
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:21.550
And so the wife has the responsibility for the children.

457
00:30:21.551 --> 00:30:24.910
She must get the money for health.
She must get the money for education.

458
00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:28.450
She does the farming on,
on her land.

459
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:33.850
So this puts the women in difficult straight and they're always needing

460
00:30:33.851 --> 00:30:34.810
resources.

461
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:39.340
And if another man can come in and provide some resources for her and her

462
00:30:39.341 --> 00:30:41.140
children,
well that's okay.

463
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.310
And so a fair amount of sex involves a,
shall we say,

464
00:30:45.311 --> 00:30:47.190
a a gift from the hers.

465
00:30:47.191 --> 00:30:51.130
And it's certainly not considered prostitution in that culture,

466
00:30:51.131 --> 00:30:53.620
but we might use that word for,

467
00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:58.860
but it's a very necessary part of the whole system that resources can come into

468
00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.080
the mother child family,

469
00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:07.690
other than from the legal husband who may or may not provide very much.

470
00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.620
Now all of the,

471
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:17.770
the whole way the society is set up favors having a large number of children,

472
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:20.890
uh,
in,
in many different ways.
For instance,
sitter land tenure,

473
00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:25.600
the idea of private property,
that one guy owns one plot of land.

474
00:31:25.601 --> 00:31:30.601
It's a new idea there that traditionally the village or the community held a

475
00:31:32.351 --> 00:31:36.610
bunch of property.
They would defend this against other villages.

476
00:31:36.611 --> 00:31:40.380
So in a sense it was sun,
communities,
property,
but I,

477
00:31:40.381 --> 00:31:43.330
and there was constant rating and constant station,

478
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.080
but they would try to defend their territory.

479
00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:51.280
But within the territory of the land did not belong to any individual.
That,

480
00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.780
and this was totally rational,
cause again,
very high death rates,

481
00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:59.410
hard to keep people alive.
So one family would die out,
have no descendants,

482
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:03.940
another family would have many children.
So each generation,

483
00:32:03.941 --> 00:32:08.941
the land just gets redistributed that and more or less equal amounts of land per

484
00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:13.120
child.
However many children that you have.
And again,

485
00:32:13.121 --> 00:32:17.410
land is not especially limiting.
So the result is that if,

486
00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:21.940
if a male or wants to be powerful and have a lot of land,

487
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.070
which means that if one land,

488
00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.810
one part of land goes bare fallow for some region reason,
he has other land.

489
00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.430
So he wants to have a lot of children.

490
00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:35.910
They all are guaranteed land and the more children he has sons and in usually in

491
00:32:35.971 --> 00:32:40.640
the case,
the more his financial security,
his hunger,

492
00:32:40.641 --> 00:32:43.250
security and his power goes up.

493
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:48.380
And the society supports this by giving land to whatever children.
Uh,
there are,

494
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:54.170
um,
this is,
I'm now breaking up because it's becoming impossible.
And again,

495
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:58.460
there are studies in,
in Kenya that in 1981,

496
00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:02.420
the average land holding was 5.1 acres.

497
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.430
And the aggregately agronomists say,
and the local people are aware of this,

498
00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.760
that about four acres of wood there technology of farming at that time about

499
00:33:13.221 --> 00:33:18.221
four acres of good land are required an intense cultivation.

500
00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:21.070
You have to really work it.
Uh,

501
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:25.580
we're required to support a family of the size of the,
the father's generation.

502
00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.790
But even at,
at that time,

503
00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:34.240
the system was to divide the land more or less equally among the sons.

504
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.031
Well,

505
00:33:35.031 --> 00:33:40.031
if you take 5.1 acres and the average number of children was like for,

506
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:44.580
uh,
you get down to about one acre,
which is way below,
uh,

507
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:48.380
the amount of land that can support a family.

508
00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:54.280
And so a crisis has eventuated and a variety of things happen that when the

509
00:33:56.121 --> 00:33:59.970
economy is good in Kenya,
which is occasionally,
uh,

510
00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.080
there are jobs in the cities and everyone hopes that one of their sons,

511
00:34:03.081 --> 00:34:06.500
at least one,
will go off to the city and get a job and send back remittances.

512
00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:12.010
But a lot of the time the economy is bad and the sons have to stay on the land

513
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:17.440
or migrate to the city without a job and become this kind of urban,
uh,

514
00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:22.490
proletariat.
So under the influence of this,

515
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:25.130
um,
uh,

516
00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:31.250
um,
under the influence of this pressure,
uh,

517
00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:37.670
the,
the number of children that have a lot of that,
of the average male wants,

518
00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:42.320
has gone down from five to about three.
But still,
if you have two,

519
00:34:42.321 --> 00:34:46.070
three acres and you're divided up three ways,
it's an impossible situation.

520
00:34:46.071 --> 00:34:49.730
The Sun's cannot live on the land that you have given.

521
00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.600
So while everybody's aware,
there's no ignorance or stupidity involved.

522
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:55.880
Everybody is aware of the situation.

523
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:59.690
The cultural prodding is so strong,

524
00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:04.730
the history is so strong that the fathers don't want to reduce their desire,

525
00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:09.210
uh,
for sons.
And when it's actually happening as the,

526
00:35:09.211 --> 00:35:12.230
the number of sons desired has shrunk,
but from four point,

527
00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:14.240
from 4.5 to three,

528
00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.730
and currently if they divide up their land,
each child gets a half an acre,

529
00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.550
whereas for are necessary to support the family.

530
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:26.350
So in respect to the,

531
00:35:26.351 --> 00:35:31.070
the work on the farm that the man will usually own it,

532
00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.450
that's varies in different parts of Africa own it in some sense while he's alive

533
00:35:35.451 --> 00:35:39.000
goes back to the village on his death.
Uh,

534
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:44.250
and in the slash and burn agriculture that,
that really pre-modern peoples,
uh,

535
00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.700
use,
uh,
the women do almost all the work.

536
00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.020
The only thing that the men do is work that women are basically physically

537
00:35:52.021 --> 00:35:55.590
incapable of doing,
which in this case,
if you're living in,
in the,

538
00:35:55.591 --> 00:35:58.560
in the forest is clearing the land,
chopping down the trees,

539
00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:04.080
hauling away the logs.
And this,
the men do,
it's heavy labor,

540
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:08.070
but it lasts about two weeks out of the year and the whole rest of the year it's

541
00:36:08.071 --> 00:36:11.190
the women doing the work.
Um,

542
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:15.810
this,
uh,

543
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:20.340
and men don't like to in traditional these ultra,

544
00:36:20.341 --> 00:36:22.620
I mean traditional cover that every period is traditional,

545
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.450
some period is traditional.

546
00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.450
Whatever period you're talking about is traditional to some later period.

547
00:36:27.451 --> 00:36:31.560
So it's,
it's not a great term.
Um,
so,

548
00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:35.400
uh,
giving you a comparison,
in 1784,

549
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.700
when the United States was being settled,
uh,

550
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:42.900
there were 6,000 Arab oil spread across New York state,

551
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:49.080
but they were competing for land with 240,000 New Yorkers of European descent.

552
00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:53.580
6,000 versus 240,001 tribe,

553
00:36:53.581 --> 00:36:57.580
the Oneida from upstate.
And I was actually born up there,
uh,

554
00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:01.500
had only 600 members to,
to the whole tribe,

555
00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:05.670
but they inhabited 6 million acres of land.

556
00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:11.220
And so this is the,
what's talked about by population,
low population densities,

557
00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.620
600 people on 6 million acres.

558
00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:19.170
And in as in Africa,
the women did most of the farming.

559
00:37:19.171 --> 00:37:22.980
They had kind of a slash and burn agriculture also.

560
00:37:23.310 --> 00:37:25.830
And the women did most of the farming,
well,

561
00:37:25.831 --> 00:37:30.720
some of the colonists were friendly to the Indians and wanted to help the

562
00:37:30.721 --> 00:37:31.380
Indians.

563
00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:35.580
So they would suggest repeatedly that why don't you take up farming that with

564
00:37:35.581 --> 00:37:38.940
your hunter and gatherer,
uh,
culture.
Uh,

565
00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:41.880
you're never gonna have enough people to resist the Europeans.

566
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:46.230
If you want to resist Europeans and maintain some of your land,

567
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:47.970
you have to increase your population.

568
00:37:47.971 --> 00:37:51.630
The only way to do that is you've got to go to agriculture.

569
00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:56.400
But the men refuse to do that.
And they s one one quote,

570
00:37:56.401 --> 00:37:59.130
one of the Iroquois farming is women's work.

571
00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:04.200
Man was not made to go to work in the earth like a hedgehog put to go to war and

572
00:38:04.201 --> 00:38:07.950
hunting.
So,
uh,

573
00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:13.410
given that women are doing the work in many cultures,

574
00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.970
they are very valuable.

575
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:20.510
And so bride price comes from this idea that in some sense you're buying one and

576
00:38:21.601 --> 00:38:22.800
she is going to work for you.

577
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:28.260
And there's a very rough generalization then in cultures where the women do the

578
00:38:28.261 --> 00:38:32.160
work and the farming work,
especially the man,
the,

579
00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:35.530
the bride price.
We'll go from the man to the woman's family.

580
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:39.190
In other places like India,

581
00:38:39.191 --> 00:38:43.090
many places in India where the women do not do the work but are sequestered and

582
00:38:43.091 --> 00:38:48.070
kept at home,
may be covered up or something,
but only do internal household work,

583
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:49.720
then it reverses,

584
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:54.820
then the man is taking care of the woman and the woman's family must pay the man

585
00:38:54.821 --> 00:38:58.590
or the man's family a dowery situation.
So,
uh,

586
00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:02.620
the issue of dowery and bride price is extremely complicated and cultures handle

587
00:39:02.621 --> 00:39:06.730
it very differently.
But that's sort of the rough generalization.

588
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:08.673
Um,

589
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.860
polygyny results from this since land is,

590
00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:17.560
is traditionally not limiting.
Uh,
but the number you need women to work.
The Ma,

591
00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.990
the land men of course,
won as many wives as possible,
uh,

592
00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:26.110
possibly also for sexual reasons of,
of,
of course.
And again,

593
00:39:26.111 --> 00:39:30.470
comparing North Africa with a sub Saharan Africa,
uh,

594
00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:32.960
in North Africa and the Middle East,
uh,

595
00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:37.870
about one to 7% of men or polygamous.
It,
it happens,
it's condoned,

596
00:39:37.871 --> 00:39:42.300
but it's,
it's kind of a rare thing in the Mediterranean zone.
Uh,

597
00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:47.350
even in the 19th century,
Mormons again,
desert people in the United States,

598
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.560
less than 10% of the men were polygamous.

599
00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:54.910
So the maximum of course is 50%.
Polygamy can never go beyond 50% of the men,

600
00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:59.290
cause one band has two wives,
then another man has no wives.
So,

601
00:39:59.410 --> 00:40:01.480
so 50% of at maximum 50,

602
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:06.430
if they're limited to two wives and maximum 50% of the men can be polygamous.

603
00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:10.300
And if some are allowed more than two wives or can manage to get more than two

604
00:40:10.301 --> 00:40:13.150
wives,
than that maximum goes down.

605
00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:15.900
So in Subsaharan Africa,
um,

606
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:20.770
and this is 1989 data,
uh,
in different places,

607
00:40:20.771 --> 00:40:23.570
12 to 38%,
uh,

608
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:26.740
of the African men are in polygamous marriages.

609
00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:29.830
So if they're limited to two and 50% is the Max,

610
00:40:29.831 --> 00:40:34.831
those places where polygamy is 38% of the men means that most of the women are

611
00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.940
in polygamous relationships.
Uh,

612
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:44.640
and again,
as we saw in New Guinea,
that a widow is very valuable.
Again,

613
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:49.240
the women are doing the work for you.
And so in Senegal,
for instance,

614
00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:54.480
95% of the women who were widowed remarry within five years and 75% of these

615
00:40:57.461 --> 00:41:00.940
widows are married polygynous Lee to man that already has wives.

616
00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:05.860
Compare that to uh,
equally poverty stricken culture like Bangladesh.

617
00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:10.480
This almost never happens.
That widow's get remarried in Bangladesh.

618
00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:17.210
Polygamy contrary to the way we often perceive it as an abuse of,

619
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:18.850
of women.
Uh,

620
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:23.820
it is not usually considered an abuse there and women will often choose a

621
00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:28.480
polygamous marriage over and monogamous mon one because what they want is a man

622
00:41:28.481 --> 00:41:33.481
with resources and such a man will probably already have some wives the

623
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.780
otherwise act as a safety net,
uh,
uh,
and a support group.

624
00:41:38.781 --> 00:41:42.860
So if the woman gets sick or her farming doesn't go well that year or for

625
00:41:42.861 --> 00:41:43.700
whatever reason,

626
00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:48.620
she can have a group of other women who will help her in a mutual kind of aid

627
00:41:48.621 --> 00:41:51.410
society.
When a woman gets sick and,
and again,

628
00:41:51.490 --> 00:41:54.100
sicknesses in premedical Saudis,

629
00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.560
they're sick much greater fraction of the time than,
than we are.

630
00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.870
And it's a big part of their lives and they have to prep for it.

631
00:41:59.871 --> 00:42:02.150
They have children take care of and yet they're sick.

632
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:07.270
The other women can come in and also if they're circumcised and not in some of

633
00:42:09.381 --> 00:42:12.460
the severe ways and not would say enjoying sexuality.
Uh,

634
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:17.210
the burden sometimes in many of these cultures,
the idea of female pleasure.

635
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.520
In some case it's known.
In some cases it's not known.

636
00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:23.960
And it may be very painful if,
if she's had a circumcision operation.

637
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:28.010
So the burden,
so sexuality can be considered a burden on the women,

638
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.070
but if there's many wives,
that burden is spread around.

639
00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:36.170
So in many ways,
um,
the,

640
00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:37.930
um,
uh,

641
00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:41.780
po polygamy is an advantageous situation for a woman to be in.

642
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:46.670
So one,
one,
a anecdote here in Kenya,
in Kenya,

643
00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:51.230
a white French woman,
anthropologists married an illiterate Mussai warrior,

644
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:54.410
she said,
and she wrote a biography.

645
00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.200
She said that despite their cultural differences,

646
00:42:57.350 --> 00:43:01.850
she and her messiah husband as well as his other wives got along famously,

647
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:07.600
he wrote this memoir and it was originally entitled the six wives of my husband

648
00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.340
in a later edition.

649
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:14.540
It was Amanda to the nine whys of my husband in between.

650
00:43:14.541 --> 00:43:19.310
He took three more wives.
Okay.

651
00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:24.340
So I think you get the idea of what goes on in a society where land land is not

652
00:43:24.741 --> 00:43:27.200
limiting.
People,
uh,
are,
are limiting.

653
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:32.450
Now you have to contrast this whole system to that.

654
00:43:32.451 --> 00:43:33.950
In the temperate zones,

655
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:37.250
agriculture is much more productive in the temperate zones.

656
00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:42.580
And the key switch is where a single man can buy as agriculture Evers or a man

657
00:43:43.281 --> 00:43:48.170
or a woman depending can produce more food than he and his,

658
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:52.820
whatever his family unit is,
can consume so that there's an agricultural surplus.

659
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:56.750
In hunter gatherer societies,
there's basically no surplus.

660
00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:00.170
In a lot of the early traditional African societies,

661
00:44:00.171 --> 00:44:04.700
there's basically no surplus.
Uh,
this,
with this surplus,

662
00:44:04.701 --> 00:44:07.160
of course they have more children,
the children are kept alive.

663
00:44:07.161 --> 00:44:11.990
There's enough food for the children and the population starts growing and

664
00:44:11.991 --> 00:44:16.610
eventually you,
you fill up the land.
And this Lusso Solo story that,
uh,

665
00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:21.430
that I'm uh,
the story history.
There's several books on the history.
Uh,

666
00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:25.610
the bond to peoples who,
again,
I mentioned the start in West Africa,

667
00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:30.200
move east is just under this the hell and then come down the east coast of

668
00:44:30.201 --> 00:44:33.240
Africa.
And at the period in the 17 hundreds,

669
00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:38.450
they're sort of moving into southern Africa where conditions are pretty decent

670
00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.460
and who's there?
The bushmen.

671
00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:46.320
And they're kind of pushing the Bushmen al of this part of Africa in the 17

672
00:44:46.321 --> 00:44:50.730
hundreds.
But the land is as they see it as open because the bushmen are very,

673
00:44:50.731 --> 00:44:55.170
very sparse.
They're not a threat of any sort.
And,
and mostly,

674
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:59.430
uh,
the,
uh,
Montreux seem to take the Bushman's wives,

675
00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:04.110
they don't seem to bother to kill the bushmen and just take their wives.
And um,

676
00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:09.420
but later on by the 18 hundreds,
the land starts to get filled up.

677
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:14.130
And then not only do the bus,
who too with the,

678
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:17.760
were solo people call themselves by sue to start having conflicts among

679
00:45:17.761 --> 00:45:21.780
themselves,
but the neighboring groups,
another bunch of group,
the Zulu,

680
00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:25.650
which are big group generally called Zulu,
start getting political.

681
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:27.330
They start getting politically organized.

682
00:45:27.331 --> 00:45:32.220
They tried to get land and you have tremendous wars in Zulu land,

683
00:45:32.221 --> 00:45:37.221
which also slops over into the Bazuto land and tremendous destruction,

684
00:45:38.071 --> 00:45:42.240
tremendous dislocation.
So again,
eventually,
uh,

685
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:46.460
the land fills up when you have the kind of decent agriculture that you have.

686
00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:48.600
You can have an Lisel though,
which is again,

687
00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:53.610
temperate zone and that south enough in Africa to be below the desert zone.

688
00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.530
Uh,
the landfills up and all kinds of things change.

689
00:45:58.531 --> 00:46:03.531
People come into conflict and because individuals can produce more,

690
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:07.980
more children than are needed to work the land,

691
00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.770
each individual can produce more food than is required.

692
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:14.200
The excess children must go off and,
uh,

693
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:19.790
become basically a landless peasants looking for scarce work or go into some

694
00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:21.900
villages are,

695
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:26.900
which eventually become cities and become landless laborers and the urban poor.

696
00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:29.371
Meanwhile,

697
00:46:29.371 --> 00:46:34.371
since there is this excess that now it becomes worthwhile for some people to get

698
00:46:35.281 --> 00:46:40.281
control of others because that surplus in a situation where each man just

699
00:46:40.321 --> 00:46:42.810
produces enough for himself and his wife and children,

700
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:44.900
if it's the man doing the work,
uh,

701
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.870
then there's no sense capturing him and enslaving him.
You know,

702
00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:51.750
politically controlling him politically because he doesn't have any surplus to

703
00:46:51.751 --> 00:46:53.790
give you,
for you to take.
Uh,

704
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:57.300
but once agriculture is productive enough so that he has a surplus,

705
00:46:57.301 --> 00:47:01.440
then he has something worth taking and you start getting the,
the chief,

706
00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.220
the chiefs want to become kings and they want to take over your land and they

707
00:47:05.221 --> 00:47:07.350
want to control you and they want to get your surplus.

708
00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:11.070
And actually civilization starts that way because with the surplus,

709
00:47:11.071 --> 00:47:14.700
they buy luxury ornaments and they have craftsmen and they have trade and they

710
00:47:14.701 --> 00:47:18.690
have scholars and they have priests and all this kind of stuff because not every

711
00:47:18.691 --> 00:47:21.540
man is needed to farm the land.

712
00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:26.730
So you both have as a result of an increasing population density,

713
00:47:26.731 --> 00:47:30.820
the rise of civilization and the rise of a lot of the horrors of civilization.

714
00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:35.860
These dent,
these massive wars and the massive poverty.

715
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:39.310
So this,
uh,

716
00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:43.810
understanding of the dangers of overpopulation,
uh,

717
00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:46.090
have been perceived for a long time.

718
00:47:46.091 --> 00:47:50.320
Surprisingly early in history when local regions got filled,

719
00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:54.490
but even surrounding them,
there could be lots of,
uh,
lots of empty space.

720
00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:58.810
So here's a Greek Greek epic epic from around 700 BC.

721
00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:03.990
There was a time when the countless tribes of Man Oh press,

722
00:48:03.991 --> 00:48:08.380
the surface of the earth,
of the deep bosomed earth.
Deep doesn't mean deep soil,

723
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.071
deep soil,

724
00:48:09.071 --> 00:48:14.071
earth and Zeus saw it and he had pity on the earth and in his wise heart resolve

725
00:48:14.481 --> 00:48:19.240
to relieve the all nurturing earth of men by causing the great struggle of the

726
00:48:19.241 --> 00:48:23.320
Trojan war.
That the load of death,
my empty the world.

727
00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:28.510
And again,
this is his explanation for the,
for the,
this,
this,

728
00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:31.810
whoever wrote this epic explanation for the Trojan War,

729
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:35.110
that it was a mall and thing that they earth got too crowded.

730
00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:39.880
People couldn't support themselves anymore and they had to be cleaned off.
Uh,

731
00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:40.331
uh,

732
00:48:40.331 --> 00:48:45.331
about 900 years later to Chilean Roman historian echoes this

733
00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:48.940
200 a day.

734
00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:53.140
The earth is currently more cultivated and developed an early times.

735
00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:56.440
Now all places are accessible,
all are full of activity.

736
00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:00.640
Everywhere there is a dwelling everywhere,
a multitude,
everywhere,
a government,

737
00:49:00.850 --> 00:49:04.510
everywhere there is life,
we are burdensome to the world.

738
00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:09.310
The resources are scarcely adequate to us and complaints are everywhere.

739
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:14.320
While already nature does not sustain us and he Chilean continues truly

740
00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:19.530
pestilence and hunger and war and flood must be considered as a remedy for

741
00:49:19.841 --> 00:49:24.841
nations like a pruning back of the human race becoming excessive in numbers.

742
00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.800
That's quite lovely.
And of course,

743
00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:31.890
Europeans are not the only ones to uh,

744
00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:36.220
to worry about population in China.
In 500 BC,

745
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.440
Han fades who complained.

746
00:49:38.830 --> 00:49:43.830
People at present think that five sons are not too many in each son has five

747
00:49:44.021 --> 00:49:47.200
sons also and before the death of the grandfather,

748
00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:50.590
there are already 25 descendants.
The women aren't counted.

749
00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:56.020
Therefore people are more and wealth is less.
They work hard and receive little.

750
00:49:56.830 --> 00:50:01.830
So this growing population density is well understood to be causing problems.

751
00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:12.430
One of the problems that happens at population density is that communicable

752
00:50:12.431 --> 00:50:17.200
diseases,
there's many,
many,
many pounds.
As the population gets denser,

753
00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:22.000
the wars become larger,
maybe not as a,
as a percentage of the population,

754
00:50:22.001 --> 00:50:26.400
but you have these enormous wars with enormous numbers of deaths.
Uh,

755
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:31.710
another thing is disease B starts spreading communicable disease because the

756
00:50:31.911 --> 00:50:36.620
population has dense enough that uh,
the disease does not die out.

757
00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:43.100
And again,
this local,
even though at the time of the Peloponnesian war in Greece,

758
00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:47.380
uh,
about four 20 BC,
um,

759
00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:52.130
it was written about in four 20,
uh,
a lot of,
a lot of that world was not Carter,

760
00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:52.911
but Athens,

761
00:50:52.911 --> 00:50:57.440
the Athens area was indeed a crowded and Athens itself was crowded.

762
00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.140
And during the war they had,

763
00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:03.980
everybody had get into the city and the city was blockaded and the population

764
00:51:03.981 --> 00:51:07.640
density in the city with a strong enough set of plague,
some sort of plague.

765
00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.460
We don't know what the disease was.
A broke out.

766
00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:14.030
And this is just the acidities describing this.

767
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:19.370
Words indeed fail.
When one tries to give a general picture of this disease,

768
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:21.560
he's writing the Peloponnesian wars.

769
00:51:21.590 --> 00:51:26.500
How many of you read the Peloponnesian war or some pieces of it?
Phew.
It's,

770
00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:27.890
it's very interesting.

771
00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:33.080
Words indeed fail when one tries to give a general picture of this disease.

772
00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:35.780
And that's for the sufferings of individuals.

773
00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:39.650
They seemed almost beyond the capacity of human nature to endure.

774
00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:44.030
People were dying like sheep.
They died like flies.

775
00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:47.450
The bodies of the dying were heaped one on top of the other.

776
00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:50.900
And half dead creatures could be seen staggering about.

777
00:51:50.901 --> 00:51:55.070
And the streets were flocking around the fountains in their desire for water.

778
00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:59.780
The temples in which they took up their quarters were full of the dead bodies

779
00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:03.170
who have people who had died,
uh,
inside them.

780
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:09.310
And he goes on to despair.
The result of this plague,
which is the people go into,

781
00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:11.270
uh,
an emotional despair.

782
00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:14.580
Civil society just collapses and all kinds of laws.

783
00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:16.970
Lawlessness breaks out

784
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:21.900
in later Europe,
a

785
00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:28.190
Europe under one huge vicissitudes of population in the classic ages,

786
00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:32.540
up through Rome,
uh,
through the,
the whole Roman empire,

787
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:35.690
the population of the Mediterranean world was clearly increasing.

788
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:37.940
Whatever data we have always points to that.

789
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:44.060
Then starting with the dark ages,
maybe as early as three,

790
00:52:44.061 --> 00:52:45.740
400,
uh,

791
00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:49.820
Europe gets invaded by all kinds of quote barbarian hordes as,

792
00:52:49.821 --> 00:52:53.960
as they are perceived by the Romans.
First it's the Germanic tribes,

793
00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:58.100
then it's the huns,
then it's the Saracens and into the vikings.

794
00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:02.960
And by the year 1000 European population is extremely,
uh,

795
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:05.540
cut down European civilizations cut down.

796
00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:10.220
And we don't really have good ideas of why all these invasions stopped.

797
00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:14.300
Uh,
one history that I particularly like says the reason they stopped,

798
00:53:14.301 --> 00:53:17.960
there was nothing left worth taking in Europe.
So,

799
00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:20.560
but about a thousand,
the,
the,

800
00:53:20.561 --> 00:53:25.561
the invasion stopped and then civilization started a recurring and it only took

801
00:53:27.661 --> 00:53:31.620
about 200 years for Europe to basically repopulate itself.

802
00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.950
When you have land,
when you have space,
uh,

803
00:53:35.550 --> 00:53:39.600
people didn't have a lot of children and keep them alive.
So,

804
00:53:39.601 --> 00:53:42.180
and in these good years,
it was good climate at that time.

805
00:53:42.181 --> 00:53:45.180
Also life expectancies and the 12 hundreds,

806
00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:48.270
we're between 35 and 40 years old,
which is,

807
00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:52.080
which is very good for this very early era.

808
00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:54.480
But then around 1250,

809
00:53:54.481 --> 00:53:57.930
the population stopped increasing and for another hundred years or so,

810
00:53:57.931 --> 00:53:59.100
it was more or less level.

811
00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:04.470
And when you find a level population that means there's something limiting,
uh,

812
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:08.010
some block and they can't grow beyond this block.

813
00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:13.730
And historians attributed to the whole sort of a state of culture there.

814
00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:20.280
So the land was not owned by the peasants.
So the peasants,
you know,

815
00:54:20.281 --> 00:54:21.120
if you own your own land,

816
00:54:21.121 --> 00:54:25.910
you'll have a lot of interest in farming it maximally and improving it,

817
00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:28.430
doing stuff when,
when someone else owns the land,
uh,

818
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:31.830
you don't have much interest in that.
And the worst,
the conditions you're under,

819
00:54:32.070 --> 00:54:34.740
the less interest you have in improving the land for the land owner.

820
00:54:34.741 --> 00:54:38.010
Cause he's going to take as much as he can weigh from you and leave you just the

821
00:54:38.011 --> 00:54:42.720
bare amount that,
that you can live on.
So,
so at this time,
uh,

822
00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:47.900
the Catholic Church was by far the biggest landowner in Europe and they own 30

823
00:54:48.061 --> 00:54:51.780
to 50% of all the productive lands in,
in,
in Europe.

824
00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:57.150
The peasants on the land were serfs and lived in this extreme poverty and they

825
00:54:57.151 --> 00:54:58.860
were not allowed to leave the estate.
They were,

826
00:54:58.890 --> 00:55:03.000
they were stuck there living in that kind of conditions.
Uh,

827
00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:07.170
the ones that,
uh,
well the church itself got very rich.

828
00:55:07.171 --> 00:55:10.990
This is a period of tremendous dominance of the church.
Uh,

829
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:15.750
they income of from church lands,

830
00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:17.220
going to church,

831
00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:22.610
nobility and to Rome was 10 times larger and all the church lands,

832
00:55:23.221 --> 00:55:26.160
he had all the crown lands of all the crowns in Europe.

833
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:30.540
The church got 10 times as much income from their lands as did the so called

834
00:55:30.541 --> 00:55:32.700
civil authorities.

835
00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:37.020
The civil authorities controlled what was left of the land,

836
00:55:37.021 --> 00:55:38.550
the kings and so forth.

837
00:55:38.940 --> 00:55:43.940
And it turns out that the serfs on the civil and had somewhat better conditions,

838
00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.500
somewhat more rights than on church lands.
On church lands.

839
00:55:46.501 --> 00:55:48.270
They are really the lowest of the low.

840
00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:51.540
But on civil lands they had somewhat better situation.

841
00:55:51.541 --> 00:55:53.340
But are still deepen in poverty.

842
00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:56.970
And so because of this serves just continue.

843
00:55:56.971 --> 00:56:00.090
They were totally on educated and totally illiterate.

844
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:03.450
And so they continued to fort farm,
the small plots,
uh,

845
00:56:03.451 --> 00:56:04.980
just as they've done for centuries.

846
00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:09.480
And so the productivity of the land did not increase,
uh,

847
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:13.900
and the population could not increase.
Uh,
the Europe was full,

848
00:56:13.901 --> 00:56:16.890
so it was no place that a surf could just run away and start his own farm.

849
00:56:16.891 --> 00:56:17.431
Someone else,

850
00:56:17.431 --> 00:56:22.431
because that land was owned already by someone else in the cities,

851
00:56:22.441 --> 00:56:26.470
which were beginning little bit,
the guilds,
uh,
we're trying to keep members away.

852
00:56:26.471 --> 00:56:29.830
They were closed.
They only took children of the members of the guild.

853
00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:34.330
There was no way for someone to rise up and become a craftsman.

854
00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:40.830
So historians describe this in about 1300 as an a through z and situation that,

855
00:56:43.901 --> 00:56:48.850
that,
that,
uh,
it's,
it's,
we'll talk more about mouth this later,

856
00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:53.440
but a demographic and economic situation where you just can't support more

857
00:56:53.441 --> 00:56:58.120
people.
The productivity of your system is just not enough to provide any more

858
00:56:58.121 --> 00:57:01.370
population than you have.
And that if population rises,

859
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:05.020
something is going to come happen to knock it down again.

860
00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:11.100
The thing that happened in Europe in this era is the plague.
Uh,

861
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:16.980
and the plague first hit in a Europe in Sicily in 1347 the previous time and had

862
00:57:18.551 --> 00:57:22.090
been there with six to seven centuries ago in what's called the Justinian

863
00:57:22.091 --> 00:57:22.840
pandemic,

864
00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:27.840
the end of the Roman empire and the plague spread throughout Europe,

865
00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:32.000
uh,
killing millions and millions of people.
Uh,

866
00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:37.570
and it was wave after wave of this and there was a wave in 1347,
as I said,

867
00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:41.830
the biggest initial way.
Then again,
1360 13,
71,

868
00:57:41.831 --> 00:57:45.620
1381,
13,
88,
1398,
you know,

869
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:50.350
every few years to play good,
come through again and kill lots of people.

870
00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.530
Uh,
numbers are hard to come by.

871
00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:58.800
The most estimates say that about a third of Europe was killed by the plague.

872
00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:04.060
Numbers can range from a sixth of Europe to a half of Europe,

873
00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:08.350
but massive,
massive,
uh,
um,

874
00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:14.800
uh,
death and brought Europe back down to below what you might call its carrying

875
00:58:14.801 --> 00:58:16.840
capacity would that current technology.

876
00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.470
So a plague,

877
00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:24.040
they don't know why did play come into Europe at exactly this time.

878
00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.780
And it may have been a random event,

879
00:58:25.781 --> 00:58:30.781
but the one of the more reasonable ideas is that played kills and plague is

880
00:58:31.571 --> 00:58:36.010
endemic in Asia,
but it has to get from Asia to Europe.
And if someone was,

881
00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:40.090
we're traveling from Asia to Europe,
they would be dead before this period.

882
00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:42.700
There would be dead long ago from the plague.

883
00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:46.420
But in the early Middle Ages,
uh,

884
00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:49.810
traveled on a ship shipping and all kinds of travel,

885
00:58:49.811 --> 00:58:51.640
we're getting better and faster.

886
00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:55.750
And so one of the things that plague may have been able to get to Europe because

887
00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:59.500
a ship leaving the Black Sea,
where apparently is where they caught her from,

888
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:03.910
could get to,
to Sicily before everyone,
everyone who had the plague,

889
00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:08.890
everybody on the ship was dead.
That's,
that's one one hypothesis.

890
00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:14.440
So it took from this nice high level and 1250 and so forth,

891
00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:19.330
a stagnant period and then it was knocked down.
It took hundreds of years,

892
00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:24.360
minimum 200 years before the population of Europe recovered to its 1300 1340

893
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:31.760
levels.
And some historians think it didn't really recover until about 17,

894
00:59:31.761 --> 00:59:36.140
15,
so 400 years or something to recover from.

895
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:37.333
From this.

896
00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:43.060
The play continues for hundreds of years and more than 300 years after the

897
00:59:43.671 --> 00:59:48.500
plague started,
it killed more than 70,000 people in London alone.
One city.

898
00:59:48.501 --> 00:59:51.660
And this is Daniel Defoe,
the journal of the play gear.
Your,

899
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:56.570
some of you have probably read that,
uh,
really horrible.
So that's 16,
64 and 16,

900
00:59:56.571 --> 01:00:00.650
65.
No more than 300 years after the plague starts.

901
01:00:01.490 --> 01:00:03.770
Well,
one of the reasons it's persisted as they,

902
01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:06.470
the people had absolutely no idea what was causing the plague.

903
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:10.190
Absolutely no idea what to do to protect yourself from the plague.
No,

904
01:00:10.191 --> 01:00:15.160
I no real idea of con contagion or contamination.
Uh,
and there was no,

905
01:00:15.161 --> 01:00:17.330
no science whatsoever.
This is before the enlightened,

906
01:00:17.331 --> 01:00:20.600
before rational attitudes toward all these things.

907
01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.490
So what would someone believe back then not having any sort of real

908
01:00:25.491 --> 01:00:29.720
understanding of,
of,
of the whole disease process and infection process?
Well,

909
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:33.010
pretty obvious.
It's God's punishment.
You know,
humans are sinful.

910
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:36.530
We all know that.
And so God is punishing you.

911
01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.320
Well what do you do if you've been a bad boy,
you have to get punished.

912
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:43.220
So Penitence and people would whip themselves.

913
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:48.140
They called the flatulence and have you any,
any of you seen the seventh seal?

914
01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.920
Ingmar Bergman.
And you know this is a great movie.
It starts at,
it's,

915
01:00:51.921 --> 01:00:56.570
it's set at this time in Europe and the opening scene is sort of a bleak baron

916
01:00:56.571 --> 01:01:00.740
European landscape with a long line of pilgrims going through each one with a

917
01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:04.070
whip beating the guy bloodied the guy in front of him.

918
01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.080
This is a toning for their sins.

919
01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:10.520
And this was a way that they intended to try to stay alive.

920
01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:15.740
What was the actual result of this?
They're weakening themselves.

921
01:01:15.741 --> 01:01:19.790
They're cutting holes in their skin,
which is a barrier to penetration,

922
01:01:19.810 --> 01:01:23.270
low flea bites,
Carrie,
Carrie plague.
So these were sick,

923
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:26.960
desperate people and they were going from town to town.

924
01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:30.680
So they would pick up plague in one town,
carry it to the next carrier,

925
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:31.790
the next character next.

926
01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:36.940
So the very mechanisms by which they were trying to keep the plague away was

927
01:01:38.211 --> 01:01:43.211
exactly one of the major mechanisms of the spread of the plague.

928
01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:47.180
And if you read the history of the time,

929
01:01:47.181 --> 01:01:52.010
there are all kinds of of of crazy what we consider crazy things that they

930
01:01:52.011 --> 01:01:55.260
tried.
So syphilis was introduced to Europe,
uh,
at,

931
01:01:55.290 --> 01:01:58.870
at about that time from the new world.
So we're talking,
uh,
you know,

932
01:01:58.970 --> 01:02:03.290
150 years later and while it was a new,

933
01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:05.720
a new thing on the horizon and die,

934
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:09.200
a number of doctors somehow got the idea that syphilis would protect you against

935
01:02:09.201 --> 01:02:10.034
the plague.

936
01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:14.870
So one of the standard cures was to get infected with syphilis as a form of

937
01:02:14.871 --> 01:02:18.230
protection from the plague.
As far as we can tell,

938
01:02:18.231 --> 01:02:21.000
this was a remedy taken up only by rich people,

939
01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:27.330
whether true or not,
I don't know.
So,

940
01:02:27.690 --> 01:02:31.080
but the plague being a very major demographic event,

941
01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:36.090
knocking the population of Europe way down was,
it was one of the seminal

942
01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:43.160
landmarks in European civilization and marked a complete change in how European

943
01:02:43.321 --> 01:02:45.090
civilization developed.

944
01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:50.660
And so I described a medieval Europe is having this sort of an through z and

945
01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:52.590
kind of landlock,
uh,

946
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:55.860
that things are unchanging and couldn't change because no one was allowed to

947
01:02:55.861 --> 01:02:57.240
change.
Uh,

948
01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:01.470
and then all of a sudden you get the black death and then immediately after the

949
01:03:01.471 --> 01:03:05.160
black death,
you get the renaissance.
What happens is a lot of fluidity.

950
01:03:05.161 --> 01:03:07.890
People can leave.
The church estates can leave their lords estates.

951
01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:12.000
There's plenty of empty land.
They go out there,
they can farm it themselves.

952
01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:15.570
The guild's don't have members.
They can join guilds,
they can do technology,

953
01:03:15.571 --> 01:03:19.630
they can move around,
uh,
all kinds of things,
uh,

954
01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:20.933
turn up.

955
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:25.770
So the first and most of the very old wave of the plague lasted from 1340s to

956
01:03:25.771 --> 01:03:29.370
1400,
and the next generation was the core of the renaissance.

957
01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:32.430
So 1420 a Brunelleschi designs,

958
01:03:32.431 --> 01:03:35.850
the great dome of the Cathedral in Florence,
uh,

959
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:39.900
Ghiberti is creating the great bronze doors,
uh,
for the door of Florence's.

960
01:03:39.901 --> 01:03:43.590
Baptistry you've got done.
A Tello makes the first.
David,

961
01:03:43.591 --> 01:03:45.900
I don't know if you ever,
you know,
Michelangelo's David,

962
01:03:45.901 --> 01:03:48.570
but Don told me at a very delicate one beforehand,

963
01:03:48.571 --> 01:03:53.010
which is very different but equally beautiful.
Uh,
Davinci.

964
01:03:53.011 --> 01:03:56.340
Michelangelo all worked in the 14 hundreds,
Machiavelli,

965
01:03:56.341 --> 01:04:00.000
the metta cheese or the century,
and at the end of the century,

966
01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.430
1492,
Columbus discovers America.
So you have,

967
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:10.320
you go from this,
you know,
extremely tight,
locked in medieval thing,

968
01:04:10.321 --> 01:04:13.950
lasting hundreds of years were basically almost everybody's miserable unless you

969
01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:16.590
were a lord or a bishop.
Uh,
and then boom,

970
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:22.670
you reduce the population pressure and the world explodes in creativity.

971
01:04:24.030 --> 01:04:29.030
Now that's not everybody has to agree that that was the seminal event that

972
01:04:29.851 --> 01:04:32.970
caused the renaissance and some Sim.
Nothing is that simple,

973
01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:37.110
but who clearly was one of the major things that one has to consider in

974
01:04:37.111 --> 01:04:40.950
discovering your why did the renaissance,
uh,
happen?
And there were of course,

975
01:04:40.951 --> 01:04:43.860
antecedents to the renaissance before that.
As I said,

976
01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:49.080
European civilization started recovering in the year 1000 well before the
plague.

977
01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:52.510
So that's a simplistic explanation,
but certainly,
uh,

978
01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.750
an important part of what was going on.

979
01:04:58.290 --> 01:04:59.760
Okay.
Um,

980
01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.170
now we're almost out of time,

981
01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:10.160
but even after the renaissance and continuing up until surprisingly modern

982
01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:14.970
times,
uh,
people still live very badly,
uh,

983
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.800
better than before,
but still badly.

984
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:21.790
So from the time of the black death till the industrial revolution started

985
01:05:21.791 --> 01:05:23.080
making things better,

986
01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:27.700
we're talking something like 1350 to maybe 1850,
with,

987
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:31.090
you could push that back to 1800 if you want.
Uh,

988
01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:34.780
so we have about 500 years again,

989
01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:39.400
where the population pressure is not great.
Civilization is improving,

990
01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:41.920
is making great advances in terms of,

991
01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.550
of our culture or exploration of the world.
Uh,

992
01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:50.820
but the common man doesn't really see much improvement in the situation at all.

993
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:57.040
Uh,
the population is still overwhelmingly made up of peasants just living on the

994
01:05:57.041 --> 01:06:01.150
edge of existence.
And this is a description.

995
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:06.010
A typical house in Europe in the late middle ages is made of wood or various

996
01:06:06.011 --> 01:06:09.850
scraps.
So vegetable material mixed with mud or clay.

997
01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.840
The roof is of Straw or reads the floors of dirt,

998
01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:17.620
and there's a pit in the middle for fire.
If it is winter,

999
01:06:17.621 --> 01:06:21.040
the family huddles cold together around the fire.

1000
01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:25.090
And semi-darkness well with the animals nearby for warmth,

1001
01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.900
one of the reasons for living with the animals is so the warmth the animals

1002
01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:33.100
produce and they don't understand ventilation and ventilation.

1003
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:35.980
You bring in cold area.
He didn't let it go out,

1004
01:06:35.981 --> 01:06:38.500
so they don't want the cold air coming in.
So they close themselves up,

1005
01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:43.510
but they need a fire to keep from freezing.
So the room is filled with smoke,

1006
01:06:43.511 --> 01:06:46.120
would may be a small hole for the smoke to go out.
So they're,

1007
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:50.550
they're not breathing fresh air.
Uh,

1008
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:55.800
this is a description of late middle ages.
Uh,

1009
01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:59.660
300 years later,
there's little progress.
Uh,

1010
01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:04.410
one of the great French historians,
yours,
who pair has studied a,

1011
01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:09.430
a village in France and the 16 hundreds and as Senali and it was a village about

1012
01:07:09.431 --> 01:07:11.230
500 to 700 people.

1013
01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:15.520
One third of the babies died in their first year,

1014
01:07:16.270 --> 01:07:18.340
another third died before adulthood,

1015
01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.390
plus only one third survived to reach the reproductive ages.

1016
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:26.560
Remember I showed you that graph from Roman times?
Same,
same story,

1017
01:07:26.561 --> 01:07:30.310
1500 years.
And basically,
no,
no progress.

1018
01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:35.920
Little children who managed to survive.
We're good.
Looking little children,

1019
01:07:36.370 --> 01:07:38.710
but if they reach the age of 10 or 12,

1020
01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:43.630
that you had already assumed to generally unpleasant appearance of adults,

1021
01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:45.790
the people tended to be stunted,

1022
01:07:46.210 --> 01:07:49.390
bent over and have a yellowish complex complexion.

1023
01:07:50.110 --> 01:07:54.640
They did not look healthy.
Their bellies were distended,
lack of lack of protein.

1024
01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:59.020
They move slowly.
They had poor teeth.
That growth was retarded.

1025
01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:04.570
He has village records from this era of the 350 births,

1026
01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:08.410
only 145 would reach adulthood and Marion turn.

1027
01:08:08.890 --> 01:08:13.450
But of the 75 female survivors,
marriage is almost universal.
Again,

1028
01:08:13.451 --> 01:08:16.910
if a woman manager and she was going get married and start Sean Berry,

1029
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:19.940
but since they were a unhealthy,

1030
01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:24.270
they didn't have good nutrition that the girls did not reach,
uh,
uh,

1031
01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:26.570
men sees until about the age of 18.

1032
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.840
And finally they started menstruating and became fertile.

1033
01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:32.900
And so they married late about age 23.

1034
01:08:32.901 --> 01:08:36.740
They just weren't healthy enough to engage in a marriage before that,

1035
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:39.430
<v 2>uh,
uh,</v>

1036
01:08:41.230 --> 01:08:43.630
<v 0>childbearing was almost universal.
Uh,</v>

1037
01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:47.110
marriage and childbearing was almost universal.

1038
01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:51.700
And we'll see this again in China,
but maternal death severely cut short,

1039
01:08:51.730 --> 01:08:56.020
the period of childbearing having a child itself is extremely dangerous.

1040
01:08:56.230 --> 01:09:00.240
And of the third of the one third that reached marriageable age,
uh,

1041
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:05.550
most couples had only one or two children before either the husband or the wife

1042
01:09:05.831 --> 01:09:06.970
died.
So again,

1043
01:09:06.971 --> 01:09:11.770
the limitation on the number of children is poor nutrition,

1044
01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:16.180
late maturity,
leading to late marriage and then early death.

1045
01:09:16.270 --> 01:09:19.450
And uh,
they have only one,
one or two children.

1046
01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:23.530
The end result of his statistics there is that the,
by the,

1047
01:09:23.590 --> 01:09:27.880
by the time a hundred female children of the preceding generation had died or

1048
01:09:27.881 --> 01:09:31.540
finish the reproductive years,
they'd produced only 70 daughters.

1049
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:33.880
The population was not replacing itself.

1050
01:09:33.881 --> 01:09:37.450
This is one of those situations where if no one comes in from the outside,

1051
01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.940
that village is going to go extinct.

1052
01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:44.890
But there were other places with apparently somewhat better agriculture that did

1053
01:09:44.891 --> 01:09:49.891
produce a surplus of children and they wandered around looking for some home and

1054
01:09:50.170 --> 01:09:53.950
the village made up the deficit by marrying,
uh,

1055
01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:58.090
excess people may be the daughter of Tran drawer's of tranche and artisans are

1056
01:09:58.091 --> 01:10:01.000
laborers.
And again,

1057
01:10:01.001 --> 01:10:05.170
as we saw in the underpopulated areas of New Guinea,

1058
01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.940
when a man died,
uh,
leaving a wife,
no time was wasted.

1059
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:12.790
The widows and widowers remarried right away.

1060
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:13.933
<v 2>Uh,</v>

1061
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:16.800
<v 0>and uh,</v>

1062
01:10:16.910 --> 01:10:21.130
and if since land was so scarce that a lot of these,

1063
01:10:21.131 --> 01:10:24.430
a lot of the marriages and another reason for the late marriage was they had to

1064
01:10:24.431 --> 01:10:26.500
wait until the father died.

1065
01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:31.300
And that was important for working the land that was so much land and could

1066
01:10:31.301 --> 01:10:33.310
support so many people you need.

1067
01:10:33.311 --> 01:10:36.670
And you had so much labor that was required to work that land.
The father died.

1068
01:10:36.671 --> 01:10:41.080
That's when they died fairly young when they're still being able to work so that

1069
01:10:41.081 --> 01:10:41.891
Labor is gone.

1070
01:10:41.891 --> 01:10:45.280
You have to take in a wife to replace the labor of the dead father.

1071
01:10:45.281 --> 01:10:48.940
Then the children come on in the generation.
Uh,
it keeps repeating,

1072
01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:51.410
<v 2>okay,</v>

1073
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:56.410
<v 0>this situation that [inaudible] is an in France or was characteristic of France</v>

1074
01:10:56.930 --> 01:11:01.880
for 400 years and during that time the population just hovered around 20
million.

1075
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:03.403
It,
uh,

1076
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:07.370
came out of the black death and rose to 20 million and then they were not able

1077
01:11:07.371 --> 01:11:09.710
to get over that for the ballpark of,

1078
01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:11.213
<v 2>uh,</v>

1079
01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:16.920
<v 0>a 400 years,
um,
in,</v>

1080
01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:22.620
okay.
I think we're,
we're,

1081
01:11:22.621 --> 01:11:27.621
we're about to tell you that the population started to recover then late in this

1082
01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:30.330
period and by 15,
60,

1083
01:11:30.331 --> 01:11:33.690
and had really returned to the 20 million of before the black death.

1084
01:11:33.691 --> 01:11:38.060
This is France.
But then religious fervor a starts up,
uh,

1085
01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:41.670
in the wars of the 16th and 17th century.
And you know,

1086
01:11:41.970 --> 01:11:46.110
the hundred awards between the Catholics and the Protestants in Europe.

1087
01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:51.410
And previously the Christians had had religious wars always against Islam.

1088
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:54.390
They were there.
That was,
that was the main enemy.

1089
01:11:54.391 --> 01:11:58.710
The Turks were very strong and much more advanced than the Europeans.

1090
01:11:58.950 --> 01:12:01.980
And they were battering at the doors of Europe.
They surrounded Vienna.

1091
01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:07.370
And so all of the military activity was a religious origin was against the

1092
01:12:08.281 --> 01:12:09.090
Turks.

1093
01:12:09.090 --> 01:12:13.410
But that threat receded and now you have the reformation and now you have to

1094
01:12:13.890 --> 01:12:17.610
both Christian religious groups within Europe and they start going after each

1095
01:12:17.611 --> 01:12:20.340
other.
And,
uh,

1096
01:12:20.610 --> 01:12:24.600
about a quarter to half of the German speaking peoples of Central Europe were

1097
01:12:24.601 --> 01:12:28.410
killed.
Uh,
in this period.
It was really most severe in Europe,

1098
01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:33.030
in France.
It was sort of stamped out that early on in this period,

1099
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:38.010
uh,
Protestants were doing very well in France and had a large fraction of the

1100
01:12:38.011 --> 01:12:42.660
population.
But have you heard of Saint Bartholomew's Day on that day?

1101
01:12:42.670 --> 01:12:47.490
The,
the,
the was also had to do with the royal succession.
Uh,

1102
01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:51.270
the Catholic force has got together and just slaughtered all the Protestants

1103
01:12:51.271 --> 01:12:55.950
they could find.
And that sort of stopped the reformation,
uh,
in France.

1104
01:12:56.850 --> 01:13:01.410
So Europe again,
uh,
went through then 130 years of,
of,

1105
01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:06.620
of this Catholic Protestant bloodletting before they finally realized that this

1106
01:13:06.781 --> 01:13:08.940
was not a wise thing to do.
Right.

1107
01:13:08.941 --> 01:13:13.540
We're continue with what happens to European civilization after,
uh,

1108
01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:17.880
these slaughter of the religious slaughter Di dies down.

1109
01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:20.310
See you on Tuesday.
