WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.250
Okay.
So as you,

2
00:00:04.251 --> 00:00:09.000
you may have noticed the course has been proceeding,
uh,
somewhat historically,

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.840
uh,
first with pre primate animals,

4
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:17.050
the whole evolution of sex from things that swam in the ocean.
Uh,

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.220
and then we discuss the primate a mating system as,

6
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.220
as you've seen as in the same census on the board.

7
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.590
And so the first,
the,
the pre primate is,
uh,

8
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.010
a few millions of years,
uh,
I'm sorry,
tens of millions of years.

9
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.600
Primates,
uh,
maybe 10 million years or so.

10
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.020
And then last time we started discussing the transition from ape to human and,

11
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.400
uh,
evolutionarily modern human state to something like 150,000 years ago.

12
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.181
So we're moving,

13
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:56.181
we're coming up to time and today we're gonna discuss fully anatomically modern

14
00:00:58.831 --> 00:01:03.270
humans.
They have the same brain capacity that we do,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

15
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.410
The earliest groups that we have any kind of decent demographic data on our

16
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:13.330
hunter gatherers,
which would include caveman and,

17
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:17.310
and people that are a hunter gatherers per do not live in caves.

18
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.310
And,
uh,

19
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.230
last time we asked why there were so few chimps in so many humans.

20
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.390
And today we're going to ask very similar questions about,

21
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.520
we're going to start with,
we're going to cover a lot more.

22
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.550
We're going to ask very similar questions about hunter gatherers.
Uh,

23
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.050
there were not,
there never was a great density of hunter gatherers.

24
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:43.380
They're certainly not now.
And the question is why.

25
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.463
Um,

26
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.950
if you look where hunter gatherers live now,

27
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.220
they eat each small group and again,

28
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:56.730
the small group is the same size we've been talking about something like 40 are

29
00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:01.731
spread out over very large area and they use that area to hunt in and to collect

30
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.910
fruits and nuts and whatever they can get,
uh,
from the trees.

31
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.630
And so it looks like a very simple question.

32
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.770
Why is the density of hunter gatherers so low?

33
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:17.580
Why are there so few of them?
I,
and for a long time,

34
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.970
the answer was they didn't have much food,

35
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.860
that they needed all this space to get enough food to survive.

36
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.210
And if they overpopulated that space,
they,
they,

37
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.980
they couldn't survive.

38
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.780
And in sort of modern a Hubris,

39
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:40.950
we looked back and thought the hunter gatherers and very inefficient form of

40
00:02:40.951 --> 00:02:44.700
food gathering.
Not Modern and,
uh,
we're,

41
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.520
we're so much better than them now.
And,
uh,

42
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.850
the data is quite clear on,

43
00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.820
on some part of those assumptions.
Uh,

44
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.530
hunter gatherers,
uh,
at the time when all human beings,

45
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:04.960
we're in the stage of hunter gatherers,
uh,

46
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.060
before farming starts about 10,000 years ago.
Um,

47
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.780
there's,
uh,
what is the number here?
Uh,

48
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.450
there may have been like 2 million people on the whole earth.

49
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.300
Remember I said Hunter Hunter gatherers spread out of Africa,

50
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.120
spread amazingly over the whole of earth.

51
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.740
And maybe the total population of humans at that time was something like 2

52
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.710
million people.
Now we have over 6 billion people.

53
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.160
That's an increase of 3000 times in the human population.

54
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.290
So clearly there were fewer hunter gatherers then than now.

55
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.480
And this is a very,
you'll see this in lots of discussions of,
of this field,

56
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:52.720
but it's a very elementary kind of consideration.

57
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.470
It talks about the long scale of human demography,

58
00:03:56.471 --> 00:04:00.880
of human population growth.
And we came out of being,
uh,

59
00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.630
other species of primate of hominids and are we gradually grew up to some sort

60
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:09.004
of a limit.

61
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.220
There's the idea that the various in a productive systems that we use,

62
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.010
uh,
like hunter gathering,
uh,

63
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.590
limit is some sort of a carrying capacity limit.

64
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.270
And so the idea is that the human population increased until it reached the

65
00:04:25.271 --> 00:04:27.700
limit.
And then for a very long period of time,

66
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.980
it can't get beyond that limit.
And then 10,000 years ago,

67
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.410
maybe it's 12,000,
uh,

68
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.280
farming is invented and all of a sudden the whole system changes.

69
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.760
There's many more people.
And we jump up and then again,

70
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:47.761
reach a limit and we'll talk about that as a Malthusian limit in this particular

71
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.990
period.
Later we'll discuss that.
And then around here,
uh,

72
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.410
the industrial revolution happens,
uh,

73
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.890
and all of a sudden the population increases.
Again,

74
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.310
this is a logarithmic scale,
so it's,
it's not linear.

75
00:05:03.311 --> 00:05:07.520
Each of these jumps is by a factor of several thousand.
Um,

76
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.260
so that's very,
very a ski Matteis version of,

77
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.180
of human demographic history.
And we're talking about this period,

78
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:19.210
what limited hunter gatherers to this level,

79
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.140
whereas farmers could go up to this level.
And again,
uh,

80
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.010
the obvious answer,
uh,

81
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.080
and looking at this kind of rough data is that it was food,

82
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.600
whoever then,
uh,
archeologists,

83
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.340
paleontologists go and actually try to examine this.

84
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:41.260
And there it turns out to be the data does not fit that theory,
uh,
terribly well.

85
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.530
So,
uh,
what archeologists do,
they dig up skeletons and uh,

86
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.430
they have a good representative,
uh,

87
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.530
set of skeletons from the last 7,000 years in north and South America.

88
00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.130
And one study looked at more than 12,000,
500 skeletons.
So we're,

89
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:04.850
we're talking about,
uh,
a good,
a scientific sample.

90
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:06.740
And what did they find out?

91
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.090
These were set into communities and communities lasted,
uh,
so much time.

92
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:16.091
So you can date the whole archeological site to a certain period and the,

93
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.940
the medical anthropologists got into it.

94
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:23.210
And so are looking at the bones and dentition and all this.

95
00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:26.000
Not only did they find the violence we talked about last time,

96
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.130
but these people were also sick there.

97
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.630
You had diseases at different times and you could see bone problems and how well

98
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:35.930
the bones grew and from the teeth how much calcium they had.
And all this.

99
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.390
And what does it turnout that contrary to the idea of progress that you'd think

100
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:45.980
the later people were more healthy?
In fact,
it was the earlier,
uh,
people,

101
00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.450
uh,
in,

102
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.920
in the earlier individuals that were healthier and as time goes on,

103
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:54.860
the skeletons get less and less healthy,

104
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.960
that they're getting less food and less good food and ha we're more subject to

105
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:03.230
diseases.
It was quite a shocker when this state has started

106
00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:09.760
coming out and the researchers attributed this decline in health decline in

107
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:13.250
health in large part to the rise in agriculture.

108
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.750
Two main factors say the rise of agriculture in the rise of urban living.

109
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:20.510
And we'll talk about the urban story in a moment.

110
00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:25.340
Now if you again go like we did last time from the archaeology to the

111
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:29.000
anthropology and look at current hunter gatherers,
uh,

112
00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:34.390
it's a little bit of a distorted study because nowadays,
uh,

113
00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.690
almost all hunter gatherers have been pushed out of the good lands that they

114
00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:41.600
used to live in until very marginal lands.

115
00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.270
You know this from US history in high school,

116
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:49.480
how the European farmers pushed the either very early farmers or,

117
00:07:49.571 --> 00:07:51.470
or a hunter gatherers and the American Indians,

118
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:56.360
the native Americans into Arizona and to desert into the bad lands in the west,

119
00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.480
the dry bad lands into the west of the u s so farming peoples push,

120
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:06.430
uh,
hunter gatherers into inhospitable land.
Uh,

121
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.770
there's a story in the Smithsonian magazine recently about,
uh,

122
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:13.940
Bush pygmies in Africa.

123
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.030
And I don't know if you know a little bit about the history of African

124
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:18.470
demography,
which we'll also cover,

125
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:23.090
but the bond twos have expanded from southwest,

126
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:27.380
the bulge of southwest Africa basically all around and have pushed other peoples

127
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.250
out.

128
00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.940
And the pygmies are one of the groups that have been very severely discriminated

129
00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:36.140
against and really pushed into inhospitable places.

130
00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.830
Another example is the bushmen of Africa who are pushed into the Kalahari desert

131
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.220
in southern Africa.
But even in the desert,

132
00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:51.730
these guys eat 85 different species of plants and it's almost inconceivable in

133
00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:57.120
their culture for someone to die of starvation.
Because you know,

134
00:08:57.121 --> 00:08:59.540
plants will bloom some years and not bloom.

135
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:03.150
Some years they'll get a fungus some year or virus plants.

136
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.360
Any one species is not generally very reliable.

137
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.240
When you have 85 different species to survive on,

138
00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.820
you're not going to go without food.
There will always be some,
uh,
group of,

139
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:19.410
of plants,
uh,
that,
that are going to be available to too.

140
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.290
And so you're not going to starve further.

141
00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.960
The anthropologist live with these people and they start,
you know,

142
00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:29.961
writing down what they're doing at every point in time and per hour invested.

143
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.840
The bushman get more food than the early agriculturalists,

144
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.570
not modern agricultural is who can drive a tractor and then,
you know,

145
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:40.360
an hour to do a lot.
But we're,
we're comparing,
uh,
uh,

146
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:44.370
hunter gatherers to the first stages of,
of agriculture.

147
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.210
And,
uh,
the Kalahari,

148
00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.200
the Bushmen in Kalahari spent 12 to 19 hours a week collecting food.

149
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.460
And the rest of the time they used for a lot more sleep than then even current

150
00:09:59.461 --> 00:10:03.510
farmers and a lot more leisure than farming peoples.

151
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.460
So life is,
is more generous to them.
Um,

152
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.310
and you have to think now,
this is for people pushed into a desert,

153
00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:14.370
a very inhospitable place.
And now if they,

154
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.200
if you can imagine them living in a,
in a lush forest region where,
where they,

155
00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:23.490
they originated,
uh,
life must've been much,
much easier.

156
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:28.670
So the amount of time exerted to get your basics of food and everything must

157
00:10:28.671 --> 00:10:30.900
have been much of a lot less

158
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.420
and not only a two,
they have to work less and,
uh,

159
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.310
they get more food per hour.

160
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.170
But the variety of foods is very good for you because you need different,

161
00:10:43.171 --> 00:10:45.210
men are a different minerals.
You need different,

162
00:10:45.211 --> 00:10:50.070
other micronutrients need different vitamins.
And as we are bombarded with,

163
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.680
uh,
uh,
in the popular press,

164
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.400
a variety of foods is very good for you.

165
00:10:56.401 --> 00:10:58.890
You don't want to eat just one kind of food.

166
00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:02.580
So they had a very diverse and healthy kind of diet.

167
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.840
Agriculture comes in and indeed,

168
00:11:06.841 --> 00:11:11.550
it enormously increases the amount of food because per acre,

169
00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.590
when land is limited,
when you have a population densities,

170
00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:18.240
which that land becomes limiting rather than your time or your need,

171
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:19.860
when land becomes limiting,

172
00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:24.450
then agriculture becomes important because per acre you can get a lot more food

173
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:26.040
than hunter gathering,

174
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.480
but you have to spend lots and lots of hours to get that land to give you that

175
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.140
amount of food.
So,
uh,

176
00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:40.940
the question remains is why are there so few white were there and still are of

177
00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:47.490
course.
Why are there so few hunter gatherers that again,
it's a Malthusian,
uh,

178
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:50.760
type question that if we know they lived quite well,

179
00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.460
we know that later people going to agriculture lived a lot less well in terms
of,

180
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.990
you know,
basics of life.

181
00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:01.210
How come the hunter gatherer population did not increase up to the same level of

182
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:04.540
misery as,
as early farmers,

183
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:08.950
which is basically one of the earliest examples of a mouth doozy and,
uh,

184
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:12.820
type question mouth those thought,
those same kind of thoughts.

185
00:12:12.821 --> 00:12:15.940
But for much later,
uh,
population.

186
00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:18.443
<v 1>Uh,</v>

187
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.170
<v 0>well,
one just the truth,</v>

188
00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.440
we don't really know the answer to this and it's greatly argued about,

189
00:12:24.441 --> 00:12:29.120
but I can tell you some things that are known are current hunter gatherers,

190
00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.570
uh,
have a moderate number of children and many survive.

191
00:12:32.571 --> 00:12:35.150
They do not have an enormous infant mortality,

192
00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:39.440
certainly not compared to later populations,
which I'll show you the,
have a huge,

193
00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.430
uh,
infant mortality.
Uh,
if they are nomadic,

194
00:12:43.431 --> 00:12:45.500
and I'll tell you about an example of that later.

195
00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.730
They have to move quite a lot and that means carrying children around.

196
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.590
And I think Bonnie has sort of indicated to you,

197
00:12:51.591 --> 00:12:55.160
even dealing with a lot of children in one places is difficult,

198
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:59.690
but the difficulty of moving,
uh,
with very young children,

199
00:12:59.691 --> 00:13:02.180
you're packing up everything and moving for a very long time,

200
00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.990
over a long distance is difficult.
And nomadic peoples,
uh,

201
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.870
very often she'll very clear signs of some form of conscious population control.

202
00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:16.370
They know they can't cope with more than x number of children.
Uh,

203
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.240
we'll get to that.
All societies have indeed controlled their population,

204
00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:25.310
but by mechanism they were not totally not clear what they think the reason for

205
00:13:25.311 --> 00:13:30.020
their doing things were.
But,
uh,
nomads apparently know what they're doing.

206
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.610
A hunter gatherers are moderately healthy.
Again,
their,

207
00:13:33.611 --> 00:13:37.070
their burden of sickness is not,
uh,
is not severe.

208
00:13:37.071 --> 00:13:40.730
Compare it again compared to later populations.
And however,

209
00:13:40.731 --> 00:13:45.230
parasites are always a problem.
And let me show you again,

210
00:13:45.231 --> 00:13:48.500
a modern case of parasites.
This is a girl,
modern girl,

211
00:13:48.501 --> 00:13:52.580
current girl in Central America,
and you may notice the swollen belly.

212
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.430
You know what's inside there to swell it,

213
00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:57.293
<v 1>right?</v>

214
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.750
<v 0>Worms.
Exactly.
And when they purge her,</v>

215
00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:08.620
that was what was inside that girl.
Although those ones,
so,

216
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:13.200
uh,
humans have had this problem since time in memorial.
Uh,

217
00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:18.070
hunter gatherers are not immune to this infectious diseases.

218
00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:22.430
They have less because they're in small groups.
So infectious disease,
you know,

219
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.310
need large groups to keep spreading.
Uh,

220
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.950
and they're hostile to their neighbors.
Just,
just again,
like chimpanzees.

221
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.300
So they don't come in a lot of contact with neighbors.

222
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.200
So diseases don't spread from group to group in each individual group is not

223
00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:40.201
large enough to allow for the maintenance of the disease.

224
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.283
<v 1>MMM.</v>

225
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:46.580
<v 0>Each village,
if you,
you know,</v>

226
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.220
anthropologists go and sit in one village for a long time and they ha they,

227
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.260
they have a population growth rate each fill,

228
00:14:53.261 --> 00:14:57.500
it seems to be expanding quite noticeably.
And you think,
well,

229
00:14:57.501 --> 00:15:01.910
in each village that we go study population is increasing.
Again,

230
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.400
it doesn't make sense.
Why haven't they,
you know,

231
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.860
and living that way a hundred thousand years,

232
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.140
why haven't they filled up their space?

233
00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:13.880
Why is each village surrounded by lots of basically unused space.

234
00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.520
And even in,
in,
in today,

235
00:15:16.521 --> 00:15:19.970
a lot of the very tropical lands are not highly densely populated.

236
00:15:19.971 --> 00:15:22.250
We may have the image that they are,
but,
but uh,

237
00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.060
but they're not new Guinea is not densely populated if you call densely

238
00:15:26.061 --> 00:15:27.740
populated.
The Netherlands is,

239
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.280
I think the most densely populated in the world of Bangladesh,

240
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.610
the livable regions of China,
the livable reasons of Japan.

241
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:39.170
These are densely populated.
The,
uh,
the,
the,

242
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.790
the tropical region of the world.
Nothing,
uh,
nothing like that.
Uh,
New Guinea.

243
00:15:43.791 --> 00:15:47.150
I said Borneo,
very sparsely populated,
uh,

244
00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.280
the Amazon sub Saharan Africa,
vast open area.

245
00:15:51.281 --> 00:15:56.281
So these are not situations of high population density yet any village that you

246
00:15:57.291 --> 00:16:00.860
sit in is increasing its population.

247
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:06.200
And so what's going on?
Um,
so what are the parts?
So what,

248
00:16:06.201 --> 00:16:10.130
what the archeologists find out is that when they study a site,

249
00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:14.450
and I sort of mentioned this already,
what you see is this,
you,
uh,

250
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.850
uh,
go to,
you'd start taking a site new,
you actually dig in reverse,

251
00:16:19.851 --> 00:16:24.320
but you've go to the bottom and you see there was nobody there before certain

252
00:16:24.321 --> 00:16:27.780
years.
And then a small population and what you say,

253
00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.800
you can count the amount of food remains,
all kinds of things.

254
00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.100
The population grows more or less exponentially.

255
00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:38.780
That means that there's same percentage every year or a half of a percent a year

256
00:16:38.781 --> 00:16:39.614
or whatever it is.

257
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.960
And it grows up faster and faster because there are more people producing that

258
00:16:44.961 --> 00:16:46.610
same percent of population growth.

259
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.000
So you get this phase and then all of a sudden you reach to help you upon your

260
00:16:50.001 --> 00:16:52.970
village has gone and there's not,
there's nothing there.

261
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:57.720
So some sort of a crash happened or if it's not totally gone,
uh,

262
00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:02.470
it's really knocked down tremendously.
And then either wait,

263
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.910
look at that site again,
like the biblical sites,

264
00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:09.911
which they dig and dig and dig and sometime later starts up again.

265
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:14.210
Or the or a different site starts up again and you get the same phenomenon and

266
00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:18.170
forget this line.
This is the idea of a cat that was the carrying capacity,

267
00:17:18.171 --> 00:17:22.430
but nothing is even see nothing fits the carrying capacity.
It just,
you know,

268
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.710
maybe stay there for a little bit here.

269
00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:29.330
So the idea of carrying capacity for humans doesn't work very well.
Um,

270
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.020
so what are the reasons?
So,

271
00:17:33.050 --> 00:17:37.760
and then the explanation for the population staying more or less constant and

272
00:17:37.761 --> 00:17:42.560
not filling up the space is not that each community doesn't exist,

273
00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:47.390
but communities,
here's your space filled with community a,
B,
c,
d,
and it's,

274
00:17:47.391 --> 00:17:50.490
each community increases.
Some other commuter just disappears,

275
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:53.790
goes out of existence.
So if you measure over the whole big space,

276
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.730
you have a floating game of different communities,

277
00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.220
each growing but then disappearing completely.

278
00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.630
And the population in the whole space stays more or less the same.

279
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.740
I don't want to push that as really comes super duper constant,
but you know,

280
00:18:07.741 --> 00:18:09.870
more or less the same does not fill up.

281
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.610
So what are the reasons why a community would,
would grow very happily?

282
00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:19.500
More or less,
you know,
very vaguely exponentially and then go out of existence.

283
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:24.360
So one is of course,
climatic disaster.
Uh,
there could be a freeze,
a,

284
00:18:24.361 --> 00:18:28.170
there could be a drought,
uh,
these,
these real climatic things.

285
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:33.380
And if you look at like the Anasazi of Arizona that live near,
near the,

286
00:18:33.381 --> 00:18:38.070
the Colorado River and near,
uh,
regions,
uh,
one of the thoughts,
they,

287
00:18:38.071 --> 00:18:39.690
they're one of the communities that fit this,

288
00:18:39.691 --> 00:18:43.440
they're healthy and go see their ruins,
then they just disappeared.

289
00:18:43.441 --> 00:18:47.280
How many of you have been to the Anasazi site in Arizona?
Oh,
just one,

290
00:18:47.281 --> 00:18:51.330
one student,
something you gotta do.
Um,
uh,

291
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:56.390
and there you're living in a semi true desert now in a semi desert back then.

292
00:18:56.610 --> 00:18:59.460
So climatic things are a reasonable explanation,

293
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:04.740
but you go into the tropical regions,
you don't have droughts that lasts,

294
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:09.810
you don't have freezes.
And yet you see this same kind of phenomenon.
So,

295
00:19:09.811 --> 00:19:13.980
well,
undoubtedly climatic things happened occasionally,

296
00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.760
uh,
in the temperate zone,
certainly in the northern zones.

297
00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:22.560
Certainly most hunter gatherer societies,
probably that's not the explanation.

298
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:27.450
The next thing that could have diseases of the crops that some fungus came by

299
00:19:27.451 --> 00:19:30.410
and wiped out your crops.
Well,
we've just talked about that,

300
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.080
that since they're eating 85 different kinds of things in the desert,

301
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.010
there isn't any kind of a microorganism that,

302
00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:41.040
that cuts across species like that.

303
00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.440
So that explanation doesn't seem to work.

304
00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:50.880
Disease of humans,
same thing,
not diseases of the plants,
but diseases of humans.

305
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:55.890
Um,
again,
the data just doesn't fit that,
that because of the isolation,

306
00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:57.013
uh,

307
00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:01.410
they don't have a huge problem with communicable diseases.

308
00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:06.690
So that leaves the possibility of violent confrontation from one community to

309
00:20:06.691 --> 00:20:07.470
another.

310
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.340
We've seen in the chimps how the northern group will completely wipe out the

311
00:20:11.341 --> 00:20:13.740
southern group and so forth.

312
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:19.400
So what kind of evidence can want to do so that this might be what's going on if

313
00:20:19.501 --> 00:20:24.501
one looks at any modern population and looks at the survival curve.

314
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.170
So this is,
uh,
the,

315
00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.360
the number of deaths per thousand per year.
So into,

316
00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:36.420
this is India for instance,
and it's fairly recent.

317
00:20:36.421 --> 00:20:41.250
1960s beef antibiotics are just coming in at this stage.

318
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.790
So very high infant mortality rate,
80 per thousand.

319
00:20:45.791 --> 00:20:48.820
It's one out of every 12 kids now.
It's like almost immediately.

320
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.150
And then that high rate continues until about,

321
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:56.140
comes down to something about six or seven years old.

322
00:20:56.260 --> 00:21:00.520
So a lot of your population is just wiped out immediately.

323
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:01.510
Uh,

324
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:06.510
and then you have a pretty low level of death and fairly flat until it gets to

325
00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:11.320
be what's considered old age and different populations.

326
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:15.940
And then the death rate rises against you if this very standard u shaped curve.

327
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:20.560
And here after you have sort of modern medicine is a Sweden in the same year as

328
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:21.970
the infant,
primarily.

329
00:21:21.971 --> 00:21:26.470
The main thing that the infant mortality drops like crazy and the old age stuff,

330
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.430
everything drops.
But the main drop is in infant mortality.

331
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.560
The idea is what I just want you to get out of this,

332
00:21:32.561 --> 00:21:35.860
we'll see this graph again and again a couple of times,
uh,

333
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.040
is that during the adult years,

334
00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:42.970
the death rate is very low compared to either here or here.

335
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:48.640
Now,
if you look at what we can gather from archeological data,

336
00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.770
from hunter gatherer communities,

337
00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.840
you have a high death rate among kids,

338
00:21:55.841 --> 00:21:58.870
not,
not as high as when you get all these communicable diseases and modern

339
00:21:58.871 --> 00:21:59.704
societies.

340
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.460
And then you have a flat and then all of a sudden there's this big bump that

341
00:22:03.461 --> 00:22:08.020
there's what they call an excess mortality in exactly the young adult years.

342
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.100
And then it comes back down again and you get a more or less normal old age

343
00:22:12.101 --> 00:22:14.350
situation.
Well,

344
00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.220
what is it that kills people in their middle years violence?

345
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.300
So this kind of data and get,
again,
we don't totally,

346
00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:23.620
we don't really know the answer,

347
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:28.330
but this kind of data leads you to suspect than indeed one of the major reasons,

348
00:22:28.331 --> 00:22:29.230
not the only reason,

349
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:34.540
but a major reason that the hunter gatherer communities and the early

350
00:22:34.541 --> 00:22:39.541
archeological communities disappears so suddenly is that they are wiped out by

351
00:22:40.031 --> 00:22:42.550
some sort of violence.

352
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:48.960
And so we're right back in hunter gatherer times as far as we can tell,

353
00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:52.420
uh,
to,
uh,

354
00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.930
what you've seen before of these mass I've showed you last time.

355
00:22:55.931 --> 00:22:59.350
These mass graves that are characteristic of this period.

356
00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:06.880
Okay.
Nevertheless,
over the very long scale of time,

357
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:11.110
our period of being cavemen and hunter gatherers lasted hundreds of thousands of

358
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.943
years.
Uh,

359
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:16.950
but gradually population did slowly increase and as population increases,

360
00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:21.550
the land available to people gets less,
would talk.

361
00:23:21.551 --> 00:23:23.440
I think next time about Africa,

362
00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.120
which has a culture and with land is not a scarce commodity.
Now it's going,

363
00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.460
it's getting to be scarce,
but a tradition and their traditions,

364
00:23:30.461 --> 00:23:34.210
land is not the scarce commodity,
but as population grows,

365
00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:39.690
the land per person gets less and then you have to make a more intense

366
00:23:40.271 --> 00:23:42.190
utilization of the land.

367
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.680
And farming gets invented and a big discussion,

368
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:50.390
whether actually it was the population pressure that caused farming to be

369
00:23:50.391 --> 00:23:54.230
invented or whether that was just some brilliant stroke by somebody that

370
00:23:54.231 --> 00:23:58.790
invented that,
you know,
people slowly figured it out.
So,

371
00:23:59.030 --> 00:23:59.660
uh,

372
00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:04.660
they actually can trace the origin of agriculture to the current date is 11,700

373
00:24:06.201 --> 00:24:09.980
years ago in the Middle East and Anatolia,
what's now a Turkey now

374
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:16.280
eastern Turkey.
And it expands on the average from the original sites.

375
00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.670
You can watch it expand and it expands at one kilometer a year,

376
00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.840
that's the average.
And then it eventually takes over the whole world.

377
00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:28.400
And so the number of people and when you invent agriculture,

378
00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:32.390
the number of people that can be supported on one plot of land grows up

379
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:36.890
enormously.
Uh,
we've seen that.
And so these people become more numerous.

380
00:24:36.891 --> 00:24:39.560
And so in military confrontation's and warlike connotations,

381
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.710
they're going to be dominant almost no matter what the technology is,

382
00:24:42.711 --> 00:24:45.860
no matter what the bravery is,
if you have an awful lot more people,

383
00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.390
you're going to wipe out or push out,
uh,

384
00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.250
groups that don't have that kind of population density.

385
00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:58.100
Uh,
so agriculture spreads when the early days of agriculture,

386
00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.920
you don't know an awful lot,
uh,
yet,

387
00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:05.750
and you probably have one crop that you really know how to grow.
And,

388
00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:07.370
uh,
for instance,

389
00:25:07.371 --> 00:25:12.110
in the Americas the big crop was corn that most of Latin America,

390
00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:13.820
even to this day,
lives on corn.

391
00:25:13.821 --> 00:25:17.690
And the mirror of the North American Indians lived a lot on corn,

392
00:25:17.691 --> 00:25:21.140
of course in Southeast Asia are great big pop things.
And it was rice.

393
00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.140
And you basically live off most of your calories,

394
00:25:24.141 --> 00:25:27.710
most of your food from one single crop.

395
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:32.300
So that's not very healthy because each crop is missing something.

396
00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.750
So corn,
you may know Mrs Lysine,

397
00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:40.780
one of the essential amino acids and a over a very long time,

398
00:25:41.211 --> 00:25:45.410
the,
uh,
the Americans learn to rather complicated procedure for,

399
00:25:45.411 --> 00:25:49.050
for boiling it in lime to,
to extract a,

400
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.420
this amino acid from the plant.
But until that was discovered,

401
00:25:53.421 --> 00:25:57.500
they must've been extremely unhealthy.
Rice,
you know,

402
00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:01.040
a is missing all kinds of vitamins and people have very severe vitamin

403
00:26:01.041 --> 00:26:05.150
deficiencies if their diet is too much,
uh,
rice.

404
00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:08.240
So you're not getting a health in early farming,

405
00:26:08.241 --> 00:26:12.520
you're not getting a particularly healthy diet.
You're not getting the minerals,

406
00:26:12.521 --> 00:26:17.150
the vitamins and micronutrients that that you need.

407
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:20.810
Furthermore,
your food security goes down.
Again,
as I've mentioned,

408
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:24.890
that a virus or fungus or something attacks your crops and you know,

409
00:26:24.891 --> 00:26:29.780
if that's 80% of your calories and that is wiped out in a year,
you're gone.

410
00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:34.810
Or if or if a locus Kumbaya and eat them up or some insect infestation comes

411
00:26:36.081 --> 00:26:37.940
through.
Um,

412
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:41.720
also with increase in,
uh,

413
00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:47.520
in calorie availability,
you can,
you can,
more people can stay alive.

414
00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:53.010
Uh,
and so we get dense populations.
The social structure changes.

415
00:26:53.011 --> 00:26:54.870
Now,
previously,

416
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.620
each person could only get enough food basically for himself or maybe a very

417
00:26:58.621 --> 00:26:59.454
small family.

418
00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.560
As you develop the technology of agriculture and individual can produce a

419
00:27:04.561 --> 00:27:08.790
surplus,
not everything he feeds well,
who's going to get that surplus?

420
00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:13.440
Then they get in an egalitarian society,
he keeps the surplus himself,

421
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:15.090
his family so forth.

422
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:19.770
But there's other guys that are either stronger or Nastier than you and they

423
00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:22.980
come in and steal your surplus from you and they have to leave you just with a

424
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:26.400
small part of your production to just keep you alive because they want you to

425
00:27:26.401 --> 00:27:29.550
work for them.
And so,
uh,

426
00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.100
you get societies now where there are classes,

427
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.170
there are people who in one way or another,

428
00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:38.850
take the excess food from the farmer and use it for other purposes,

429
00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:40.260
usually their own purposes.

430
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:45.570
They can largely hire military to keep them in power and to protect them from

431
00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.640
other places.
That's a large use of the food surplus,
which agriculture puts up.

432
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.700
Also,
manufacturers come in,
they,

433
00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.570
they hire artisans to make beautiful gold objects,
uh,

434
00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:01.560
for them or to make a beds or chairs or you know,
all the,

435
00:28:01.561 --> 00:28:06.561
all the manufacturing starts on the agricultural surplus that agriculture brings

436
00:28:06.571 --> 00:28:11.571
in because an individual human now can produce more calories than he needs to

437
00:28:11.581 --> 00:28:14.100
keep going at a subsistence level.

438
00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:19.430
So what you see as agriculture progress is a hunter gatherer societies.

439
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.400
They're generally quite a gala.
Tarian.
They'll more or less have a head man,

440
00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:27.100
but he won't,
or a wise man or an old man,
but they won't have authority.

441
00:28:27.101 --> 00:28:31.800
He can't order other people around.
The community has to agree on some project.

442
00:28:31.801 --> 00:28:35.820
If they take undertake projects at all,
as more,

443
00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:40.330
more food wealth becomes available,
society start,
uh,

444
00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:45.420
uh,
stratifying.
You get social classes,
you get casts.

445
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.230
And uh,

446
00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:53.180
this inequality changes everything about the way humans live.

447
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.670
Um,
the congestion in the cities.

448
00:28:56.671 --> 00:28:59.820
Cities start growing up and then you start getting the spread of these

449
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:04.410
infectious diseases where one person spreads it to the next enlarge

450
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:08.840
agglomerations of humans.
And that just gets worse and worse up through,
uh,

451
00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.230
you know,

452
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:14.140
the 14 hundreds in Europe when you get the black death and wipes out a huge than

453
00:29:14.141 --> 00:29:16.860
than that is this.
As,
as civilization progresses,

454
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:21.750
the death rate from infectious diseases just keeps going on up.

455
00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:23.643
Um,

456
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.730
adding all this together and the data we have is that hunter gatherers,

457
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.880
their lifespan is ballpark 50 years in early agricultural societies.

458
00:29:35.491 --> 00:29:39.360
That goes down to 35 years.
So we're really,

459
00:29:39.361 --> 00:29:44.361
and I'll show you data that in a lot of places it's probably even lower than

460
00:29:45.161 --> 00:29:45.994
that.

461
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:51.580
So we have the situation where human w x not,

462
00:29:51.581 --> 00:29:54.970
not counting violence that humans lived when they weren't being attacked by

463
00:29:54.971 --> 00:29:56.890
their neighbors.
Humans were living very well.

464
00:29:56.920 --> 00:30:00.220
The hunter gatherer society sort of Garden of Eden.

465
00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:03.100
And then agriculture comes in and the vast,

466
00:30:03.101 --> 00:30:06.940
massive humans become peasants be the land becomes owned,
not by them,

467
00:30:06.941 --> 00:30:08.140
but by someone else.

468
00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:11.830
And they have to give most of what they produced to someone else.

469
00:30:11.831 --> 00:30:13.150
So life becomes miserable.

470
00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:18.720
And there's a lot of thought that the various garden of Eden myths,
I mean,
every,

471
00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:23.350
almost every culture has some sort of glorification of a very distant path past

472
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:26.950
where people did not have to work so hard in our culture.

473
00:30:26.951 --> 00:30:30.910
We call it the garden of Eden.
Everything was perfect,
then something happened.

474
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.830
And after the fall of one sort or another,
uh,
now it's the sweat of our brow.

475
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:38.990
And it's a very nice description of what I've been telling you of,

476
00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:43.690
of the hunter gatherers living in a lush environment before they're pushed into

477
00:30:43.691 --> 00:30:48.220
the desert living quite well.
Uh,
however,

478
00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:50.920
uh,
later on,
then they have to be farmers.

479
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:55.030
The sweat of the brow and violence like Cain and Abel is what is the,

480
00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:57.990
the fly in the ointment of that beautiful,
uh,

481
00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:03.100
Eden Story.
Okay.

482
00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:09.840
So now we come to the agricultural period in our historical romp through history

483
00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:16.420
and there's certain really fundamental,
uh,
issues,
uh,

484
00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:20.890
that you have to understand to understand what was happening with population in

485
00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:25.540
these times.
So there's constraints on po,

486
00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:29.590
on human population.
And the first,
it was this enormous infant mortality,

487
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.880
which I showed you.
And again,
we're looking at 1960 here,
uh,

488
00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:40.120
in a very civilized place.
You know,
poor India in 1960,
but still,

489
00:31:40.121 --> 00:31:43.930
even even into the 1960s,
uh,
where we're very modern.

490
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.170
The infant mortality rate is enormous.

491
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:51.800
You go even currently to a less well developed place.
Uh,

492
00:31:51.850 --> 00:31:56.850
he just cut out this quote from a Haiti in 1979 before this recent rash of,

493
00:31:58.330 --> 00:32:02.380
of problems.
Uh,
Cornell train Haitian comes from Haiti to Cornell,

494
00:32:02.381 --> 00:32:04.330
gets a medical degree,
uh,

495
00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:08.500
returns to Haiti and he gets a job at a pediatric hospital.

496
00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:13.930
40% of the infants of the babies.
So they have the,
he is working in a,

497
00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.300
among other things of a maternity clinic,

498
00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.810
40% of the babies were dying of endemic diarrhea.

499
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:25.240
A man would come to pick up the bodies three times a day with a big bag.

500
00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.600
The noise of the skulls and the bag was unbearable.

501
00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:32.420
And this is 1979,
uh,

502
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.780
in how far is Haiti from Miami?

503
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.290
150 miles or something like that.

504
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.510
So the data,

505
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:45.260
we have various data sets for what life expectancy was like.

506
00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:49.740
And this is various populations.
Uh,

507
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:53.030
and what this is,
is a survivorship curve.

508
00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:58.270
So you take for a thousand people born in any given space of time in an earlier

509
00:32:59.781 --> 00:33:03.720
period.
So this is Swiss alpine goal.
This is Roman times.
Uh,

510
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:07.520
that's the part of goal is this side of the Alps.

511
00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.770
According to them sis Alpine goal

512
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:16.100
out of the thousand children born.
And actually this shows females,

513
00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:18.890
but it's more or less the same for males.
Uh,

514
00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.550
almost immediately half of them die.

515
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:28.450
And that's very characteristic of human societies until modern sanitation comes

516
00:33:29.601 --> 00:33:32.480
in,
which is in,
in Europe,

517
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:37.100
17 hundreds and in Asia,
maybe 19 hundreds,

518
00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.420
um,
that you have this tremendous death rate of children.

519
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.230
And then it continues,
uh,
at a,

520
00:33:45.231 --> 00:33:48.980
at a fairly high but decreasing death rate.
And then finally,

521
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:50.570
there's very few people left.

522
00:33:50.571 --> 00:33:54.200
So this is not the curve which showed you the percentage of deaths in each age

523
00:33:54.201 --> 00:33:58.790
thing,
but how many people are still surviving?
So at any point in care by age,

524
00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:01.370
uh,
15 here,
this dotted line,

525
00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:05.120
only about 40% of people are still alive,

526
00:34:05.121 --> 00:34:08.300
60% have died before age 15.

527
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:13.070
And this again is women.
So a lot of this death in this middle period,

528
00:34:13.071 --> 00:34:15.230
by the time this,
the reproductive years,

529
00:34:15.231 --> 00:34:20.150
these dotted line is 15 to 45 or so.
[inaudible]

530
00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:24.380
I think 50 in this case,
which is the years in which women can reproduce.

531
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:29.950
And most of the death and females in this period is childbirth itself.

532
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:34.790
In a developing population,
in a premedical population,

533
00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.570
childbirth itself is one of the most dangerous things in these years.

534
00:34:38.571 --> 00:34:42.530
And the death rates are very high,
uh,
from,
from childbirth itself.

535
00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:47.190
So a lot of that is,
is a female is childbirth.

536
00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:52.010
If you looked at a male population,
it might even be more extreme,

537
00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:55.820
uh,
due to probably do the violence that we've talked about.

538
00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:01.250
Now,
as time goes on,
we're going to come back to this graph,
but as time goes on,

539
00:35:01.251 --> 00:35:03.230
this is Italy in 1921.

540
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:08.000
And things have gotten at all ages.
The death is less.

541
00:35:08.001 --> 00:35:09.680
So there's more people surviving.

542
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:13.760
And then you come to Japan in 1984 and you're very,

543
00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:17.600
very little infant mortality,
very little mortality through this period.

544
00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.800
And then again,
old age takes over and people do die.

545
00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:25.610
And this kind of bump here compared to say,
this is again,

546
00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:29.810
possibly violence,
uh,
in that era.
But again,

547
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:34.670
we don't really know.
So for our purposes going back in time,

548
00:35:34.671 --> 00:35:36.470
we're really interested in this lower graph,

549
00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:41.830
which is characteristic of humans from way back till really almost Napoleonic

550
00:35:42.151 --> 00:35:44.970
times,
and maybe throw in Napoleonic times,

551
00:35:44.971 --> 00:35:48.600
but the deaths or the violence in Napoleonic times was enormous.

552
00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.220
If you look at women,

553
00:35:50.221 --> 00:35:55.221
consider this just to graph for women of a thousand women born 400 are still

554
00:35:56.791 --> 00:35:59.700
alive at the beginning of their reproductive period,

555
00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.960
and about 200 are still live at the end of their reproductive period.

556
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.790
So if you average that out,

557
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.630
something like it would be the same as if something like 300 women lived

558
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:11.970
throughout the reproductive period.

559
00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:17.220
Well if that society is going to keep going,

560
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.780
what is needed to happen?

561
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:24.050
That these more or less 300 women have to reproduce a thousand women,

562
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:28.590
right?
And if they reproduce thousand women,

563
00:36:28.591 --> 00:36:33.420
they also have to reproduce a thousand boys,
right?

564
00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:37.590
So 300 women have to give rise to 2000 children,

565
00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:43.110
right?
And if they don't do that,
then there's fewer,

566
00:36:43.111 --> 00:36:46.560
fewer people in each generation rapidly.
You don't see this population anymore.

567
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:51.740
So how many children is that that each woman has to have 300 women making 2000

568
00:36:52.051 --> 00:36:55.530
children?
Six and two thirds,
almost seven.

569
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.640
So that means that in,
when you have a mortality curve like this,

570
00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.600
which again is most of human recorded history,
most of human history,

571
00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.640
not counting hunter gatherers who did live longer,
apparently,
uh,

572
00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:12.220
the absolute minimum that a society could cope with is women having basic,

573
00:37:12.221 --> 00:37:15.270
an average of seven children.
But wait a minute,

574
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.280
I've made this a better case.

575
00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:22.880
That's of the all that this graph shows is women that are alive in this period.

576
00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:27.840
What fraction goes in fertile?
What fraction have infertile husbands,

577
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:32.130
what fraction never get married?
What fraction are too sick to have children?

578
00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:37.580
What fraction of women are worn out after two or three children and can't bear

579
00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:41.670
many.
That's also very large number,
which depends on the population.

580
00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:43.590
So if you subtract those,

581
00:37:43.591 --> 00:37:46.680
let's call them in fertile women for a variety of reasons in which they,

582
00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:49.320
or their husbands or their health,
they're infertile,

583
00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:53.790
then there's even fewer people alive.

584
00:37:56.190 --> 00:38:00.660
And so this curve goes,
if you didn't graph just women alive,

585
00:38:00.661 --> 00:38:03.420
but women that are alive and in child bearing condition,

586
00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:08.130
the curve gets much lower.
So the number of children that women,

587
00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:10.810
the women that were physically capable of it,
uh,

588
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:16.250
had to have in these premodern times was more than seven and probably eight or

589
00:38:16.591 --> 00:38:21.510
nine or you know,
you have to do the calculation and uh,
people don't know how to,

590
00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:26.700
how to evaluate the,
what fraction of Roman women were fertile or infertile.
So

591
00:38:28.830 --> 00:38:30.720
you can't calculate that.

592
00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.560
So we have a huge problem that,
um,

593
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.230
that somehow there must be cultured.

594
00:38:40.231 --> 00:38:44.950
There must be mechanisms to ensure that no women are wasted than any woman that

595
00:38:44.951 --> 00:38:48.400
can reproduce,
does reproduce.
And when they reproduce,
they go at it.

596
00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.110
They just keep going and going.
And of course men have an equal part.
I,
well,

597
00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:56.440
they don't do the amount of work,
but they have a part in it.

598
00:38:58.030 --> 00:39:01.090
So,
um,
and as I said,

599
00:39:01.091 --> 00:39:05.240
this level of mortality continues into quite modern times.
It's,
it's,
it's,

600
00:39:05.241 --> 00:39:08.260
it's quite striking.
Europe got out of it a little bit earlier.

601
00:39:08.261 --> 00:39:12.100
I say somewhere in the 17 hundreds,
but for instance,

602
00:39:12.101 --> 00:39:16.810
in 1912 in Australia,
we have an Australian ta.
Is She here?

603
00:39:16.811 --> 00:39:20.140
Jay went to the,
she's got a ticket to the inauguration.

604
00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:25.890
1912 Australian census shows that 60% of all children born died.

605
00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:31.060
Unmarried.
So that's this number we have them.

606
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:36.160
Well,
it's about the same number as this for this shows that only 40% are left.

607
00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.600
And this says in Australia,
60% are dead.
So that's,
that's the same number.

608
00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.500
Uh,
60% of children born,

609
00:39:44.501 --> 00:39:47.080
died on married and among the married,
one,

610
00:39:47.081 --> 00:39:52.081
ninth of marriages were sterile and just 11% of the men and 14% of the women

611
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.150
produced half of the children.
So,
uh,

612
00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:00.280
that means those that could reproduce,
were married and et Cetera,

613
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:04.750
had to really have very,
very high birth rates.
As late as 1912,

614
00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:08.470
China as late as 1930,
uh,

615
00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:12.580
had a nearly aboriginal,
a birth and death rate,

616
00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:18.070
the total fertility level was at these levels of six,
seven,
eight,
eight,

617
00:40:18.370 --> 00:40:21.880
eight children per woman.
He hit the population was not increasing,

618
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:26.830
which means the death rate was just as high and they were in this kind of a

619
00:40:26.831 --> 00:40:31.060
situation for reproduction.
We can talk a lot about China later,

620
00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:35.680
of course,
at that death rate.

621
00:40:35.681 --> 00:40:40.450
And this is data for China in order to have a 50% certainty.
So as,
as you know,

622
00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:41.170
uh,

623
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:46.170
many cultures and Chinese included in traditional times for sure wanted at least

624
00:40:46.751 --> 00:40:49.210
one child,
uh,
to survive.

625
00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.860
And so they do a calculation at this death rate.
How many children's a minimum,

626
00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:58.890
you have to have to give yourself a 50% chance of having one son survive five

627
00:40:59.681 --> 00:41:04.240
children.
So if you're not thinking of reproducing the population,

628
00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.000
but just reproducing your own family,

629
00:41:07.001 --> 00:41:12.001
which is the way individual families thinking and they have to have a son and

630
00:41:12.041 --> 00:41:16.840
you have this mortality rate at five children,
you have a 50% chance.

631
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:19.150
If you want to have a 80% chance or something,

632
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:23.800
you're back up to eight nine 10 children,
which explains the,
the,

633
00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:27.490
the desire,
not necessarily,
they don't like keep this birthright,

634
00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:30.250
the desire for these very,
very high birth rates.

635
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:35.270
So the result is that in most a premodern societies,

636
00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:39.890
women spend their whole post pubertal lives,

637
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.110
either pregnant or lactating.

638
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:45.800
Here's basically never a time when they're free of the bio.

639
00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:51.340
The biological aspects of child bearing,
not not counting the,

640
00:41:51.341 --> 00:41:53.970
the,
the,
the children that are,

641
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:58.310
that are now not breastfeeding anymore.
The bunny was talking about.

642
00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.300
So for instance in Bangladesh in the 1990s were coming up very close,

643
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:07.010
75% of the women in the age group of 20 to 30 on were either pregnant or

644
00:42:07.011 --> 00:42:11.120
lactating.
Does that means four out of every five women were at that moment.

645
00:42:11.121 --> 00:42:15.710
Any moment that you look there were either pregnant or breastfeeding and there's

646
00:42:15.711 --> 00:42:19.340
a small period in which they rest and then it starts over again.

647
00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:25.010
So we're not talking in,
in,
in the need for these very high birth rates.

648
00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:28.310
We're not just talking about primitive tribes,
but by any means.

649
00:42:28.610 --> 00:42:32.900
We're talking about the period in which all the world's great civilizations

650
00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:35.380
developed and civil.
Say,

651
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:40.390
one of the things that civilizations had to do was ensure a birth rate like

652
00:42:40.461 --> 00:42:42.560
this.
And in the,

653
00:42:42.561 --> 00:42:46.700
in the period in which cultures we're learning to write and producing their

654
00:42:46.701 --> 00:42:51.620
classic literatures and developing the great world religions.
All of these,

655
00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:52.730
if you read through them,

656
00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:58.400
are our calculus or calculators in some sense to keep fertility high.

657
00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:02.470
All of the things glorify high fertility,
uh,
the,

658
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:07.070
the religious doctrines,
uh,
uh,
push it.
Um,

659
00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.580
there's community sanctions.
The is just develop

660
00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:16.300
that in order to increase fertility in any culture that doesn't do that and it

661
00:43:16.301 --> 00:43:19.820
doesn't increase it successfully.
They're just not here anymore.
And of course,

662
00:43:19.821 --> 00:43:22.600
most cultures that you read about are not here anymore.
And they were not,

663
00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:28.040
not successful in our,
uh,
western culture.
The,
the most,

664
00:43:28.041 --> 00:43:29.910
uh,
famous of,

665
00:43:29.970 --> 00:43:33.800
of these things is the first commandment in the Bible to them be fruitful and

666
00:43:33.801 --> 00:43:37.820
multiply well that,
that fits us.
If you didn't do that,
they're,

667
00:43:37.821 --> 00:43:41.060
the Hebrews would be gone and we wouldn't have any of what we,
we,

668
00:43:41.061 --> 00:43:45.710
we currently have in terms of religion and he kind of the monotheistic
religions.

669
00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:50.600
Um,
so there's all kinds and you look at the,

670
00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.150
the cultural or religious tradition of any cultural,

671
00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:57.680
you'll find all kinds of laws about regulating sexuality.
Uh,

672
00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:02.060
no.
Yale students don't know much about the Bible.
How many of you know,
you know,

673
00:44:02.061 --> 00:44:04.640
masturbation is supposed to be bad thing.

674
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.550
And do you know what in the Bible it's supposed to prohibit that?

675
00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.650
Yes.
So it's the story of own and spilling his seed.

676
00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:22.570
And do you know why he was spilling his seed or what the situation is?

677
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.890
<v 1>There's different versions.</v>

678
00:44:23.891 --> 00:44:27.470
One is that he was having sex with his brother's wife.
Correct.

679
00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.120
<v 0>Why was he having sex?
So this,</v>

680
00:44:30.121 --> 00:44:33.480
she said she was sex with his brother's wife and didn't want to impregnate her.

681
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:34.620
That's correct.

682
00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:37.973
<v 1>Passed away.</v>

683
00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:57.360
<v 0>Right,
exactly.</v>

684
00:44:57.361 --> 00:45:02.160
Because I have to repeat that this for the camera.
So the situation,

685
00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:06.340
it's a very short passage,
very interesting passage.
Uh,
and uh,

686
00:45:06.341 --> 00:45:09.340
it's giving out very small section,

687
00:45:09.341 --> 00:45:12.770
giving out moral laws and it says,
uh,

688
00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:17.410
someone had sons and one of them was [inaudible] and Irwin's bang or died.

689
00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:21.160
It doesn't say much about her except that he died owning with the next brother

690
00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:26.640
repeated in the old test in many times is that if a man's brother,

691
00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:28.720
man's brother dies,

692
00:45:28.721 --> 00:45:33.340
he has the moral obligation to inseminate the sister,
the,

693
00:45:33.370 --> 00:45:34.270
I'm sorry,
the,
the,

694
00:45:34.271 --> 00:45:39.271
the sister in law in order to secure on air for the dead brother.

695
00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:44.020
That if he,
if he father's a child with his sister in law,

696
00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:47.230
then that is not considered his child.
Uh,

697
00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.270
it is considered the dead brother's child.

698
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:52.540
And that's one of these important things of carrying on the family lines,

699
00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:57.040
which is one of the ways that of course insurers are high population rate.
That.

700
00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:02.020
So,
uh,
this is the way of keeping women,
whether they're married or not,

701
00:46:02.021 --> 00:46:03.610
whether their,
their husband's dead or not,

702
00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.060
you got to keep them reproducing or the culture disappears.

703
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:11.200
So why doesn't want to do this?
Why doesn't own in want to do this?

704
00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:15.850
Well he may or may not,
it's not his kid.
So you know,
born.

705
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:21.030
So there's none of this sort of a power and authority and Macho stature to come

706
00:46:21.431 --> 00:46:23.830
with having a lot of kids.
Cause it's the brother's kid and the culture.

707
00:46:23.831 --> 00:46:25.840
It's was the brother's kid.
But on top of that,

708
00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:30.010
he would have to support this kid that economically he would have to support not

709
00:46:30.011 --> 00:46:31.240
only the wife but the kid.

710
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:35.440
And he didn't want to have to support kids that weren't his.

711
00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:39.190
So he engaged in the sex act cause that was the fun part of it.

712
00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:44.230
But at the last minute he pulls out and spills the seed upon the ground.

713
00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:46.570
And then the Bible passages,
very curt,

714
00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.670
it doesn't say more to z and then God killed them.
No,

715
00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.990
there's not a lot of explanation for this,
but it's repeated.

716
00:46:52.991 --> 00:46:57.190
This particular law that called the levy rate laws,
as students said,

717
00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.190
is repeated in several places in the Bible.
And it's very,

718
00:47:00.191 --> 00:47:03.940
very clear that people didn't do this.
People did not in salmon,

719
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.370
did not want to inseminate.
They're there,

720
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:09.700
they're brothers wives because of these reasons.

721
00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:13.570
And so whenever you see a law sort of demanding something over and over again,

722
00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:17.860
you know,
people weren't doing it.
And that's why the law is,
is demanding it.

723
00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:22.630
So that's just one example of,
uh,
how,
uh,

724
00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.470
religion gets involved in enforcing fertility.

725
00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:30.520
And in this picture example is one of the mechanism for every woman pregnant as

726
00:47:30.521 --> 00:47:32.980
much of the time as possible,

727
00:47:32.981 --> 00:47:37.450
independent of her state of marriage.
So the,
uh,

728
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:41.500
anybody know why,
uh,
the Muslims took to polygamy?

729
00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:46.840
Why Mohammed allowed for wives?
No Muslims in the class.

730
00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.750
<v 1>Great.
What</v>

731
00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.020
do you like very limited.

732
00:47:56.810 --> 00:48:00.950
<v 0>No,
but the standard version is they were going through a lot of wars.</v>

733
00:48:00.951 --> 00:48:03.530
The most songs were conquering the whole word.
They were constantly at war.

734
00:48:03.531 --> 00:48:05.960
The men were getting killed.
There weren't enough men.

735
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:10.700
So what do you do with the other women that they,
I mean many reasons,

736
00:48:10.701 --> 00:48:15.080
but one of they,
they need support.
And so that's it's a benefits thing,

737
00:48:15.081 --> 00:48:19.610
but the society needed more men,
more children.
So let,
let them get married.
Uh,

738
00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:22.430
multiply and you're just whatever religion you want to look at,

739
00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:25.730
you'll find similar kinds of examples

740
00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:32.060
when we get to uh,
uh,
family planning issues later,

741
00:48:32.061 --> 00:48:35.630
later on,
how,
how people control their reproduction.

742
00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:39.320
One of the major beliefs that the earlier we don't really know again,

743
00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:43.460
but in the West was at the mechanism people use with Koa center up this cause

744
00:48:43.461 --> 00:48:45.950
he's the only thing they knew about cause it's in the Bible,

745
00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.170
it tells you what you do,
it tells you the result of it.

746
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:53.620
And so that own in passage is currently interpreted to,
uh,

747
00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.900
say that masturbation and,
and contraception,

748
00:48:56.901 --> 00:49:00.680
all kinds of things are bad when in fact the past has nothing to do with that.

749
00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:04.100
That's not what that passage is about.
But that's what it's used for today's.

750
00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:08.180
But it's been used absolutely for the opposite.
People use this,
oh,

751
00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:11.690
that's how I can avoid having children.
And so it's,

752
00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:15.860
it's culture twist itself about and has unexpected consequences.

753
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:21.110
Okay.
So,
so I've been stressing for you,
um,

754
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:26.270
that culture pushes up fertility and up to this,
uh,

755
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:30.740
high limit,
but what is the limit of human,
uh,

756
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:35.750
fertility?
So we have to evaluate that.
And um,

757
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:39.980
so there's a very famous calculation of this and it's set by the number of years

758
00:49:39.981 --> 00:49:43.850
a woman is fertile,
which is generally 15 to 45 more or less,

759
00:49:43.851 --> 00:49:45.860
can be a little bit younger occasion,
a little bit older,

760
00:49:45.861 --> 00:49:48.880
but they usually consider,
uh,
30,
uh,

761
00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:53.160
30 or so years of fertility,
uh,

762
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:57.890
and at that will,
if she gets me,
she's going to be pregnant for nine months.

763
00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:58.880
Uh,

764
00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:03.880
[inaudible] rarely starts again before at least three months if she's lactating.

765
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:10.190
Uh,
and,
and therefore we're going through not,
not obviating again,

766
00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:12.990
that's going to be more months.
Ah,

767
00:50:13.970 --> 00:50:16.010
if a woman has sexual intercourse,

768
00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:19.130
it takes an average of five cycles to get pregnant.
We'll talk,

769
00:50:19.131 --> 00:50:21.470
when we talk about abortion,
we'll talk about why that is.

770
00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:24.290
But if a woman's having normal sex trying to get pregnant,

771
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:29.040
the average is five months before she actually does get pregnant.

772
00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:33.200
We'll we'll see where that comes from.
Uh,
if the child dies,

773
00:50:33.201 --> 00:50:37.070
fetal mortality introduces a month there.
Anyway,
you're all,
yeah,

774
00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:41.570
all of this up and you get,
uh,
18 months that,

775
00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:46.680
that sort of pretty much the maximum that that human females can do is 18 months

776
00:50:46.851 --> 00:50:47.990
or one and a half years.

777
00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:51.950
So dividing what they usually do is choose 20 any particular woman will probably

778
00:50:51.951 --> 00:50:53.600
be fertile for 25 years.

779
00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:58.900
You divide that by 18 months and you get a theoretical possibility of 16.7

780
00:50:59.031 --> 00:51:02.680
children right now.
Uh,

781
00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.570
how many of you know somebody who's had more than that?

782
00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.580
What's the maximum number of children you know about it?

783
00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:11.640
<v 1>Sure.</v>

784
00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.510
<v 0>18 I'm bid 18 that's the only one in the class.</v>

785
00:51:17.710 --> 00:51:18.590
<v 1>Much higher.</v>

786
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:23.540
How many have I was looking at the six

787
00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:26.750
<v 0>Oh no,
no,
I'm not 60 no,
nothing.
That's really crazy.</v>

788
00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:31.550
Unless there's some crazy multiple birth.
Now with modern modern drugs,

789
00:51:31.551 --> 00:51:35.780
sometimes there's multiple,
but no,
not 60.
So this is an unusual class,

790
00:51:35.781 --> 00:51:39.190
but as time goes on,
families get smaller and people don't remember.
Uh,

791
00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:43.670
the maximum I got out of this class was 24 children.
One,

792
00:51:43.671 --> 00:51:46.250
I think it was a Chinese student,
I don't totally remember.

793
00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:49.070
And that 24 was only two sets of twins.

794
00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:53.930
So they're 22 separate successful pregnancies,
two of which produced twins,

795
00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.440
24 children,
uh,
one woman,

796
00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:01.550
and even forget this,
independent of this calculation,

797
00:52:01.551 --> 00:52:05.780
which I've just sort of sketched for you,
uh,
at the,
uh,

798
00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.760
even before the calculation was done in the prison,

799
00:52:07.761 --> 00:52:12.570
did the calculation knew about it?
Oh,
this is not,
yeah.

800
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:16.520
Here is the,
the uh,
the,
the uh,

801
00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:20.480
Norway in,
uh,
an earlier set of women,

802
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:24.500
which is this set and a later set of women.

803
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:28.370
And this is the number of children that the women have and the percentage,

804
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:31.910
the per thousand of women that had that number.

805
00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:36.860
So in the 1880,
[inaudible],
late 1880s,
the APP,

806
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:41.420
the most common number for Norway,
again,
we're talking Norway,
eight 89.

807
00:52:41.421 --> 00:52:45.890
We're not talking about him,
anything.
Very Pr,
anything primitive is 10 children.

808
00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:48.650
The,
the,
the mode for Norway,

809
00:52:48.651 --> 00:52:51.830
there was 10 children and it goes out to 18,

810
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:55.910
which was the record that someone here knew.
And there were of course,

811
00:52:55.911 --> 00:52:58.100
if you had a bigger sample,
you'd get an occasional something more

812
00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:00.470
<v 1>world record.
It's 69 children.</v>

813
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.000
<v 0>Oh,
what does it say?
It's good for him.
And what,
what,
where?</v>

814
00:53:05.001 --> 00:53:07.010
That's something special as it say anything about it.

815
00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:16.040
Oh,
okay.
So it was,
it was,
and what was the total number of,
yeah,
so,

816
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:21.710
okay,
I was wrong.
Send me both of you.
Send me the reference,

817
00:53:21.711 --> 00:53:25.880
send me the reference for that because next year I'll use it.
Um,

818
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:30.150
so and now,
just as long as I've got this slide up there,
look what changes.

819
00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:35.130
So we go from 40 years later,
not a huge fraction of time.

820
00:53:35.131 --> 00:53:37.020
We're going to talk about this later in the class.

821
00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:41.460
It goes from the mode being 10 children to the mode being two children.

822
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:47.280
There's something drastic happens in between these two,
uh,
in,

823
00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.980
in 40 years.
And this is common over Europe.
This is just one,
one dataset.

824
00:53:51.050 --> 00:53:53.640
And we're going to talk about that a lot,
but since it's up here,

825
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:56.310
so in this period of time that we're talking about,

826
00:53:56.970 --> 00:54:01.290
women had this very unhappy in the mode is very large number of children and

827
00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:05.980
they far exceeded,
uh,
the,
what's calculated as as the,

828
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:10.770
as the maximum.
Um,
let's see.

829
00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:11.670
Okay,

830
00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:15.960
so the answer is at the biological limit is very high.

831
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:21.660
I'll say 24,
he's a 69.
We have to read that stuff.

832
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:26.870
So in a human population that can end continuing for any length of time,

833
00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:33.050
the highest well-documented fertility instead of the Hutterites in the 1920s,

834
00:54:33.151 --> 00:54:35.400
anybody hear of Hutterites?
It's a,

835
00:54:35.401 --> 00:54:39.090
it's a Christian religious sect that are urgent and what's called an Anabaptist

836
00:54:39.091 --> 00:54:43.140
sect that originated in Europe,
migrates here.

837
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:45.650
They're in the upper Midwest,
in,
uh,

838
00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:49.020
North Dakota and going on over in into Canada.

839
00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:54.560
And they're very successful in both economic ways and in population ways.

840
00:54:56.340 --> 00:55:00.150
Uh,
they marry fairly early,
not extremely early,
but fairly early.

841
00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:01.261
They have a good diet.

842
00:55:01.261 --> 00:55:05.040
They're farmers and very productive farmers and have good medical care.

843
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:10.290
They engage in sex regularly.
Uh,
they're supposed to.
And,

844
00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:13.560
uh,
their religion forbids contraception or abortion.

845
00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.830
And not only do they have the,
they obey these rules and many,

846
00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.740
many people have those rules in the books,
but this,

847
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:24.200
this is a very religious group and they,
they obey the rules there.

848
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:26.610
Uh,
what we call total fertility rate,

849
00:55:26.611 --> 00:55:30.350
which at this moment you can consider the average number of children that are

850
00:55:30.351 --> 00:55:34.230
women in that society would have was 12.4 children.

851
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:37.680
Nothing that's high.
You think that's high?

852
00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:41.430
So someone blanche here as an average children,
but nothing like the,

853
00:55:41.580 --> 00:55:44.280
like the 24 or [inaudible] 69 that we're talking about.

854
00:55:44.580 --> 00:55:47.970
So this is the highest human population that we have documented can have that

855
00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:52.890
and it's nowhere near,
uh,
any kind of calculation,
uh,
for,
for a limit.

856
00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:54.893
And,
uh,

857
00:55:55.890 --> 00:55:59.580
the most usual limit you see a lot of cultures are in at least some part of the

858
00:55:59.581 --> 00:56:00.920
history where the,
the,
uh,

859
00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:05.990
eight is his current cultures were or historical cultures where eight is kind of

860
00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:11.790
a,
a maintained average.
So in the colonial,
the United States for instance,

861
00:56:12.090 --> 00:56:14.340
for short time in the frontier was wide open.

862
00:56:14.790 --> 00:56:19.230
They had a fertility rate of eight children per women.
And uh,

863
00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:22.750
but as soon as the frontier would close in a region,
uh,

864
00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:24.910
the fertility rate would drop.

865
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:27.910
So it was clearly land availability had something to do with it.

866
00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:30.880
And there's good data for Massachusetts.
Concord,

867
00:56:30.881 --> 00:56:33.160
Massachusetts is very good demographic data there.

868
00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:36.030
People have these high birth rates until the frontier closer.

869
00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:40.270
What did the front tier mean in 16 hundreds in Massachusetts it meant like

870
00:56:40.271 --> 00:56:41.800
Springfield,
you know,

871
00:56:41.801 --> 00:56:45.520
these are people living in Plymouth and Concord and Lexington right near the

872
00:56:45.521 --> 00:56:48.850
coast.
And the frontier was Springfield.
And as soon as,

873
00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:50.200
so if they had a lot of children,

874
00:56:50.201 --> 00:56:54.430
the children would have to move out to Springfield or somewhere,

875
00:56:54.431 --> 00:56:57.220
which is what,
a hundred miles or something like that.

876
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:58.900
And that was beyond the frontier.

877
00:56:58.901 --> 00:57:01.860
And as soon as the children had to move more than a day's draw,

878
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:05.260
a horse ride away,
the fertility rate drops.

879
00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:07.450
So there's something about having the support of your children,

880
00:57:07.451 --> 00:57:10.480
really having a group that increases the fertility.

881
00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:14.110
And as soon as the children will have to disperse and not any more be of some

882
00:57:14.111 --> 00:57:19.111
sort of support to you or some part of your group fertility comes back down.

883
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:24.570
So no society really has there has ever come close to uh,

884
00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:26.500
the biological limit.

885
00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:31.900
So before we talked about how culture pushes up the birth rate,

886
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:36.310
but now we say that something is pushing down the birth rate that were coming to

887
00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:41.110
a,
an intermediate level.
And what's going on is again,

888
00:57:41.111 --> 00:57:46.030
fairly straightforward and simple that I think it was,

889
00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:52.210
come on
this slide that I want here is a,
again,

890
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:53.590
fairly recent data.

891
00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:58.800
Chinese women interviewed in 1980 and 81 but referring to their pregnancies,

892
00:57:59.591 --> 00:58:04.591
which had been some time in the past and it says it tried to gather data on what

893
00:58:05.531 --> 00:58:09.070
was the birth interval of your children and how many of them survived.

894
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:12.040
So if the birth interval was less than two years,

895
00:58:12.370 --> 00:58:15.250
45% of the children died.

896
00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:20.740
If it was between two and three years,
34% of the children die.

897
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:23.040
If it was more than three years,
only ninth,

898
00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:26.800
only 19% of the children died.

899
00:58:27.330 --> 00:58:31.450
So in every culture and every time and place where we have data like this,

900
00:58:31.810 --> 00:58:35.770
it's very clear that if the birth interval is too small,

901
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:38.230
the children just don't survive.

902
00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:42.280
So what's going on with pushing down?
Uh,

903
00:58:42.820 --> 00:58:44.860
the fertility rate is that it,

904
00:58:44.861 --> 00:58:48.430
especially in situations of poverty where resources are not great,

905
00:58:48.850 --> 00:58:50.620
women are not especially healthy.

906
00:58:50.621 --> 00:58:55.621
There's no any kind of medicine available that if the child does not get a lot

907
00:58:56.741 --> 00:59:01.090
of resources,
which large cases milk from the mother is the primary thing.

908
00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:02.830
Cause there's like China,

909
00:59:02.831 --> 00:59:06.660
there's no dairy products at this time in this social class,
uh,

910
00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:11.110
it's largely food directly from the mother.
The children just going to die.

911
00:59:11.950 --> 00:59:16.950
So the reason that fertility is a little push up from below is pushed down is

912
00:59:18.611 --> 00:59:22.340
not to reduce total a number of children,

913
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:24.890
but to maximize surviving fertility.

914
00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:28.760
What people aim at is not to just keep popping out and having them die.

915
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:33.170
But people aim at and,
and cultures have learned to accommodate.

916
00:59:33.171 --> 00:59:36.650
Two is to maximize surviving fertility,

917
00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:39.710
not total fertility,
which is just being born,

918
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:44.540
but maximizing the number of children that are going to stay alive to become

919
00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:48.530
adult reproducing members of the society.

920
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:55.520
Now people have many mechanisms for limiting the birth rate.

921
00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.620
A one that is often quite conscious is breastfeeding.

922
01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:05.030
It's very standard method across many cultures.
Uh,

923
01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:10.370
you've all heard of this lactational,
amenorrhea and uh,

924
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:14.780
many,
many cultures don't leave.
I mean in our culture,

925
01:00:14.781 --> 01:00:17.990
women can breastfeed a little bit or a long,
it's totally up to the individual.

926
01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:22.460
Many cultures are very strict
rules about this.

927
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:24.470
You must breastfeed for at least,

928
01:00:24.471 --> 01:00:29.471
and there's a certain period of time and among the Kong of,

929
01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:33.440
of a southwest Africa,
which these people that speak this click language,

930
01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.490
you know,
and they've got all these,
you've heard of them.
Uh,

931
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:39.320
mothers keep the infant with them at all times.

932
01:00:39.321 --> 01:00:44.321
They nurse all day and integral separated by only 15 minutes and that money,

933
01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:49.040
how would you like to have that all day long?
Nurse Every 15 minutes,
the child,

934
01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:54.230
they sleep next to the mother and have access to a breast all night long and

935
01:00:54.231 --> 01:00:57.620
they can,
the nursing continues until the child is more than three years old.

936
01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:03.170
And so by that mechanism,
primarily by the lactational Amenorrhea,
uh,
the,

937
01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.510
the birth interval lung Kong's four years,

938
01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:09.530
which fits is beyond this survival issue.

939
01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:13.830
And this is the kind of,
I talked about nomads be bled,

940
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:17.030
ones that have fairly conscious,

941
01:01:17.031 --> 01:01:21.500
they probably are aware that this is limiting their births and it's a thing that

942
01:01:21.501 --> 01:01:24.800
they want to do.
Uh,

943
01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:32.600
so when the women go foraging,
they carry their chin again,

944
01:01:32.601 --> 01:01:36.800
the cone,
they carry their children with them until they're four years old.

945
01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:41.900
And while carrying the infant,
she walks up to 12 miles roundtrip to Ford,

946
01:01:41.901 --> 01:01:44.620
take six miles to go out and find some food and,

947
01:01:45.210 --> 01:01:48.320
and come back 12 miles round trip.
And then in addition to that,

948
01:01:48.321 --> 01:01:50.960
she carries loads of 15 to 35 pounds.

949
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:56.270
So here's a woman who being a hunter gathers probably fairly healthy.

950
01:01:56.600 --> 01:01:59.000
She's carrying an infant on her back,

951
01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:04.480
walking around 12 miles and coming back with a load of 35 pounds of,

952
01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:10.700
of food.
It's quite a quite a feat.
And uh,
it's clear that they can't,
you know,

953
01:02:10.701 --> 01:02:13.500
they're not going to have a second one on the back,
one on the hip.
This,

954
01:02:13.501 --> 01:02:16.550
this is not a way of improving survival.

955
01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.590
So one,
so that's a lactation is one mechanism.

956
01:02:23.130 --> 01:02:27.030
There's many taboos on sexual relations,
especially after birth.

957
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:32.580
So in many cultures is,
uh,
as I said,
a prescribed period of nursing.

958
01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:37.850
There's also a postpartum taboo against having sexual relations.

959
01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:41.700
And again,
another obvious mechanism for births,
spacing.

960
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:47.250
And if you,
and again this gets to the degree of consciousness of these,

961
01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:51.900
of these methods,
if you ask a member of a society that has a taboo,

962
01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:57.050
they report for instance,
that sex at that time is very dangerous.
Uh,

963
01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:58.870
a life and death matter.
Uh,

964
01:02:58.890 --> 01:03:03.030
it is dangerous to mix the man's blood with the woman's in the man's blood is

965
01:03:03.031 --> 01:03:07.170
transmitted through semen.
It's a bodily fluid and they don't totally,
you know,

966
01:03:07.171 --> 01:03:10.500
the biology is not very strong.
They're course.
Yeah,
it was terrible.

967
01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:14.640
And so they will,
we'll talk a lot about,
not a lot,

968
01:03:14.641 --> 01:03:18.240
some about what primar pre,
pre,
pre education.

969
01:03:18.241 --> 01:03:20.510
People believe about reproduction,

970
01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.410
everything and it and uh,

971
01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:28.290
and if man's blood gets into the woman through his semen,

972
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:29.850
then it also gets into her,

973
01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:34.020
her milk and then the man's blood goes back into the baby through the mother's

974
01:03:34.021 --> 01:03:38.910
milk.
And this is a poison for the baby.
So that's,

975
01:03:38.911 --> 01:03:43.470
that's their version of why they should,
why they have this taboo.

976
01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:47.280
And we see this in the evolution of cultures.
I mean,

977
01:03:47.281 --> 01:03:48.960
just as we evolve biologically,

978
01:03:48.961 --> 01:03:52.590
we of course evolve culturally that cultures may,

979
01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:57.740
we'll pick up a behavioral pattern for who knows what reason and they may have

980
01:03:57.811 --> 01:04:00.270
no clue what it's real coat as we see it.

981
01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:03.630
It's real purposes in this case to to space births apart.

982
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:06.300
They have some kind of cultural story about it.

983
01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.200
And it doesn't matter whether that cultural story has any degree of reality,

984
01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:14.550
if they've picked up a cultural norm that works to society is still here.

985
01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.470
And that gets passed on.

986
01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.920
If that cultural practice does not work,

987
01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.650
not only reproduction,
all sorts of ways that society is gone.

988
01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.410
Um,
so,
uh,

989
01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:33.360
this postpartum abstinence is a major issue,
especially in Africa.
Now.

990
01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:37.740
Uh,
the abstinence is up to three years,
which is,

991
01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.050
that's the con that's sort of the mode of,
of this.

992
01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:44.190
And Africa in addition to limit,

993
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.440
uh,
births.

994
01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:49.980
There's another thing which again is a population limitation issue cause we've

995
01:04:49.981 --> 01:04:53.610
talked about individual family limitation is you're trying to keep the kid
alive.

996
01:04:53.970 --> 01:04:58.230
If the villages,
uh,
resource limited,

997
01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:01.830
they may have mechanisms for keeping the whole population of the whole village

998
01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:06.810
down.
And so in Africa especially and have a thing called terminal abstinence,

999
01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:11.130
that means at a certain point in life the culture demands that you stop having

1000
01:05:11.131 --> 01:05:12.330
sexual relations.

1001
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:17.040
And very often this is when your daughter has her first child after that your

1002
01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:20.380
grandmother and you're not supposed to reproduce anymore.

1003
01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:25.000
And it's interesting what,
what the reason for it to prevent con,

1004
01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:28.570
they perceive it as preventing conflicts between their duties as mother and

1005
01:05:28.571 --> 01:05:29.680
their duties as grandmother.

1006
01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.160
So grandmother is supposed to help raise the grandchildren.

1007
01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:38.430
And there's a lot of biological theory about why do humans somewhat unique among

1008
01:05:38.441 --> 01:05:43.060
animals?
Why don't we just die?
We females,
especially after their fertile period,

1009
01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.910
there's no reason for you to evolutionarily stay alive.
You know,

1010
01:05:45.911 --> 01:05:49.210
and most animals,
they don't have a postmenopausal period.

1011
01:05:49.810 --> 01:05:54.760
And the aunt and the theoretical reason is the grandmother effect that as a

1012
01:05:54.761 --> 01:05:56.840
grandmother you support the,

1013
01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:00.490
the children of your child and that increases their survival.

1014
01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:02.560
And so it's evolutionarily good.

1015
01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:06.190
And here in these tribes in Africa are basically saying the same thing,

1016
01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:08.140
that if you're a grandmother,
you're gonna have a conferencing,

1017
01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.840
taking care of your own children,
taking care of your daughter's children.

1018
01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:15.370
And that conflict is bad.
So you have to not engage in sexuality.

1019
01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:20.530
Up to the middle of the 19 hundreds,
uh,
in Ireland,
Rural Ireland,

1020
01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:23.530
people lived in how,
in households with,
uh,

1021
01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:27.760
many members of both sexes and several generations,
big multi multifamily houses,

1022
01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:32.290
and the Irish believed that there should be only one sexually active procreative

1023
01:06:32.291 --> 01:06:36.850
couple in a household.
So they also practice grandmother abstinence.

1024
01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:40.500
So these cultural items are,
you know,

1025
01:06:40.510 --> 01:06:43.000
they may seem a little outlandish to us in our modern day,

1026
01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:46.840
but they were effective.
They,
they,
they kept that society going.

1027
01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.530
Um,
and

1028
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:57.150
another issue is Exxon gummy that just like chimpanzees.

1029
01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:01.330
It's again,
in most animals it's the males that disperse.

1030
01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:06.480
But in chimps and humans,
it's the females that disperse,
uh,

1031
01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:09.370
the females leave the community at birth,

1032
01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:14.110
I imagine go live with the man's family.
And so she's under the control.

1033
01:07:14.111 --> 01:07:15.730
Then in many cultures,

1034
01:07:15.731 --> 01:07:20.731
basically a slave to the son's family and the reproductive rules are then set by

1035
01:07:21.311 --> 01:07:25.210
the son's family.
And she has no choice in this.

1036
01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:29.410
And,
uh,
we'll talk about that extra.

1037
01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.620
So this out marrying,
uh,

1038
01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:36.460
so remember with chimpanzees were hostile to the neighbors around us.

1039
01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:41.470
Human societies are that same way.
So then I have a lab in Klein,
the professor,

1040
01:07:41.471 --> 01:07:45.850
and the next lab to me is from China,
a village near Shanghai.

1041
01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.390
And he describes this to me in China that he says,
my village,

1042
01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:53.830
which all the same name as him,
it's all a male bonded,
you know,
Poncho liner.

1043
01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:56.230
The males had been there forever.
They're all have the same last name.

1044
01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:59.290
They are hostile to all the villages around them.

1045
01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:03.250
So they won't marry the village around to get married and have to go to villages

1046
01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:08.660
away.
And they're still sort of enemies.
And in New Guinea where,

1047
01:08:08.661 --> 01:08:10.660
and you know,
all over the world,
that's the same problem.

1048
01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.520
You're fighting with your neighbors.

1049
01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:15.610
And yet you have to get wives from somewhere.
You have to,
you know,

1050
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:18.800
exchange genetic material.
Otherwise you get inbreeding.

1051
01:08:19.190 --> 01:08:24.190
And so the Myakka they say in New Guinea that we marry our enemies and now this

1052
01:08:26.481 --> 01:08:29.630
is a great story.
Time is up.
I will continue this story next time.
