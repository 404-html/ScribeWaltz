1
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.580
So I want to start today with some stories from the newspapers.
Set a tone,

2
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.290
a terror.
There's over the last few years,
Tehran,

3
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.080
one afternoon Fatuma Eskandari opened the front metal gate of the shelter.

4
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:21.081
She runs for runaway girls in central Tehran and was confronted with two men

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.010
armed with knives and rifles.
Who are you?
She asked.

6
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.910
We are the uncles who have a girl named [inaudible].

7
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.600
We are told that you are keeping runner and indeed that's true.

8
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.960
Runak was 16 years old and she was inside recovering from the bruises that she

9
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:41.700
suffered at the hands of these same uncles.

10
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.160
She had run away from home to escape them.

11
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.440
The uncles had driven from Sana and die in the northwest corner of Iran,

12
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:52.980
hundreds of miles away.
They demanded to see their knees.

13
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.700
The uncle said she had shamed the family by leaving home a few days before they

14
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:03.810
had come to behead her.
They're very open about this.
There was no secret

15
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.810
Staten Island New York.

16
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.620
The 17 year old girl worked as a cashier in a convenience store.

17
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.670
The store owner said that the girl was stealing from the register and he was

18
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:15.630
going to fire her.

19
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.860
The girl went to her father and said that the store owner had groped her.

20
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.720
The father flew into a rage,
grabbed the baseball bat and a gun,

21
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.750
went down to the store and killed two people.

22
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.350
Islam about Pakistan,
so he did.
Purveen 21 years old,

23
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:39.351
was pregnant in 1998 when her husband Mukmood kickball bound her hands and feet

24
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.180
with the rope.
First he shoved a rod in one of her eyes,
blinding her,

25
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.300
then cut off her nose and ears.

26
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.300
He suspected her of seeing another man,

27
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.480
Tuscaloosa,
Alabama.
Felicia Scott already had two sons,

28
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.260
but she had an obsessive desire to have another baby.

29
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.160
She convinced her boyfriend to help her get one,
so they went out,

30
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.120
shot a pregnant woman and cut the full term fetus from her womb.

31
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.410
Saudi Arabia,
New York Times.

32
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.240
A young woman was raped by seven men.
She pressed charges.

33
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.130
The Saudi court sentenced her to 200 lashes,
200 lashes,

34
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:27.090
almost a lethal dose.
Dominican Republic.

35
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.630
Cressida Mendina is 18 she's been married for a year in which her husband,

36
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:35.460
Jose,
beat her content constantly.

37
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.280
She had the courage to separate from him,

38
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.660
but she met with Jose after their separation.
When he asked her to talk,

39
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.310
he took her to a desolate street on his motorcycle and they had an argument.

40
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.230
He grabbed a container he had filled with what they called the devil's acid,

41
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.240
a mixture of gasoline,
hydrochloric acid,
car battery,
a car battery,

42
00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:59.440
acid,
urine,
and other chemicals.

43
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.480
He threw it at Cruceta liquid disfigured her permanently.

44
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.100
It burned her face,
her arms,

45
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:08.500
the right side of her chest and a portion of her legs.

46
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.070
She is still trying to bring her ex husband to justice.

47
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.590
Casara gone.
Bangladesh.
I'm almost done with this.

48
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.590
The village elders met,

49
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.650
met under Leechy tree to put a value on Pieara becomes good grotesquely ruined

50
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:29.590
face.
A young man had become obsessed with her,

51
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.050
but she was married and he was turned away.

52
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.180
He took his revenge will sulfuric acid to erase the beauty that had once

53
00:03:37.181 --> 00:03:42.100
enchanted him and to empty her life of happiness.
Her cheeks smelted her right.

54
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:44.620
I was a blonde,
blinded in hollow to a crater.

55
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.570
The husband had to bribe the prosecutors before they would even take up the
case.

56
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.520
Eventually the perpetrator's family had to pay a fee of $3,000

57
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.970
in one year than a number of the year.

58
00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:02.971
I have statistics for 1999 there were 174 acid attacks in Bangladesh.

59
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.580
Those are the ones that were officially reported.
Of course,

60
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.850
probably the vast majority of these never get reported.

61
00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.710
The article mentioned the 13 year old girl who was attacked her,
she slept.

62
00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.060
Some victims die.
Some are forced to marry their attacker.

63
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.170
Another was forbidden to come home until she allowed her husband to take a

64
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:28.170
second wife.
Well,
these stories are obviously,
uh,

65
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.790
at the extreme of human behavior,
but the purpose of,

66
00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:37.791
of giving you all that is to explain that human sexual behavior has extremely

67
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:41.620
deep roots,
very emotional,

68
00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.310
and very hard to,

69
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.330
to change or manipulate male female relationships are very difficult for humans

70
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:51.183
to cope with.

71
00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.140
And I think it shouldn't particularly surprise you that human sexuality is not

72
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:58.330
particularly driven by rational calculation.

73
00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.110
This few,
the few stories that I pulled out of the newspapers,
uh,
I just,

74
00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:10.111
the tip clearly just a tip of an iceberg of a very widespread phenomenon in the

75
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:14.320
long course of human history across cultures.
You see the art,

76
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.950
the gave you everything in Brooklyn to Bangladesh.
Uh,

77
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.580
these very similar sorts of things happen,
uh,

78
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.690
females through the long course of history.

79
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:29.020
And in most cultures where most humans have lived a,

80
00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:32.890
females are treated very badly.
There's a huge amount of battering.

81
00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.180
Battering is the time human version of,

82
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.210
of violence and females are so discriminated against that statistics indicate

83
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:45.190
that there's something now,

84
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.280
right now something like a hundred million missing females,

85
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.320
that these females are either a boarded before they're born,

86
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.100
killed by infanticide pretty as soon as they're born or neglected,

87
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:02.750
so that they don't get the food or they don't get their medical care that

88
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:03.584
they're brothers get.

89
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.510
So there's a dearth of something like 100 million women in the world today.

90
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.880
And uh,
so these are not,
these are,
these are extreme incidents,

91
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:16.910
but it's an extremely common,
uh,
thing.

92
00:06:16.911 --> 00:06:20.490
And one of the purposes of this course is to try to get you to understand what,

93
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.100
what is causing all of this from a biological point of view.

94
00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.870
Uh,
this abusive females is extremely weird.
Uh,

95
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.500
males as you know,
can only reproduce via a female.

96
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.140
And so,
and evolution is the name of the game is reproducing.

97
00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.240
So almost all species,
what kind of a female to the males want,

98
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.150
they want the healthiest,
most well protected,
the best fed female.

99
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.450
And you'll see some examples of the extremes to which males will go to,

100
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.570
to provide this so that that female can produce offspring for that mail and

101
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.310
carry on the evolution game.

102
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.370
But in humans,

103
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.610
we find that it's very general that females are treated Shosha slee and it's

104
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:11.741
just doesn't make sense that that human males should keep many of their females

105
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:17.180
hungry,
sick and,
and abused.
And if child birth,

106
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:20.270
if a woman does give birth to a child,
that can often be underweight,

107
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.050
a sickly and so forth,
because the mother is not in great health.

108
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.610
So this is all the biological disaster of the way human males treat human

109
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:32.420
females.
And,
uh,
we don't know why.
I mean we do,

110
00:07:32.421 --> 00:07:35.900
we have some idea why humans do that.
And the first part of the course,

111
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:40.520
we'll talk something about that that's on the individual level and evolution

112
00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:42.050
works on an individual level.

113
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.700
But if you think on a species level missing 100 million of your,

114
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.571
of your breeders,

115
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:52.280
that does not sound like a great tactic for survival of the species.

116
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.090
So I spent some time when I started getting interested in this whole topic,
uh,

117
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.980
reading,
uh,
the anthropological literature,
the sociological literature,

118
00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:02.270
the feminist literature.

119
00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:05.510
And basically I thought all of those explanations where a crock,

120
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.530
and I don't think they came close to,
to an answer.

121
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.800
So in my own studies,

122
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:17.540
I had to go back to the very beginning and understand what sex was really all

123
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:18.374
about.

124
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:23.820
So I'm going to tell you a few important things about sex and reproduction.

125
00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.840
The first one is that reproduction turns out to be very difficult.

126
00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.940
So one day I was sitting over in the our botanical garden under one beautiful

127
00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:34.100
big huge oak tree that they have.

128
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:38.980
And the ground was kind of this covered with Acorns,
uh,

129
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:43.910
under this tree.
And uh,
I asked one of the forestry people,

130
00:08:43.911 --> 00:08:45.620
cause that's the kind of things that they know.

131
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.420
I asked them how many acorns does this tree produced?
And they said,
well,

132
00:08:50.421 --> 00:08:54.020
the wind of the spread is so much and it's this high and you know,
and so deep.

133
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:59.290
And they came up probably 750,000 acorns a year.

134
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:03.900
I thought,
wow.
So I checked the literature and

135
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.660
found that the people that collect these notes for commercial purposes,

136
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.320
a good oak tree can produce 500 pounds of acorns a year.

137
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:18.480
And many sources say that an oak tree produces millions of acorns in its

138
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:21.990
lifetime.
Wow.
Lot of reproduction,
right?

139
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:26.370
Got To be sex before.
And then I asked myself,

140
00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:31.260
how many of these million acorns survive to make a tree like their parents?

141
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.053
What's the answer?

142
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:39.360
I think basic biology course,
you might know it.
Well,

143
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.550
what if each tree on average,

144
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:45.900
taking an average of truth made to acorns?

145
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:49.050
How many acorns would there be?
How many oak trees would they be in the neck?

146
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:50.640
May to acorns that made trees.

147
00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:55.620
How many oak trees would there be in the next generation?
Twice as many as now.

148
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.060
What if they only did?

149
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:02.670
And so that can't continue because then the earth would immediately fill up with

150
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:07.470
oak trees and we'd be,
you know,
this deep in,
in acorns.
And similarly,

151
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:10.770
if they,
if the trees produce less on average,
less than one,

152
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.910
what will happen to the oak species goes extinct.

153
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.540
So over the long time,
on average,

154
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:23.570
each oak tree has only one acorn that grows up to be a,

155
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.080
uh,
an acorn producing tree itself.

156
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:33.530
That's an amazing duction puts out in millions of acorns that only one survives.

157
00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.070
And of course this is true not only for,
for trees,

158
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:42.570
but a fish which spew out,
you know,
fish,
females,
huge numbers.

159
00:10:42.571 --> 00:10:46.140
Thousand 500,
tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands of eggs or,

160
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.160
or males of many,

161
00:10:47.161 --> 00:10:51.870
many species that spilled billions of sperms that in a sexual species,

162
00:10:51.871 --> 00:10:55.620
the way Amazon to parents on average two children,

163
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:59.880
if two parents for a species average more than two children,

164
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.180
the world fills up with squirrels or whatever animal talking about if they have

165
00:11:03.181 --> 00:11:06.030
less than two over a long run,
they've gone extinct.

166
00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.750
Most species in fact in the history have gone extinct.

167
00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:14.940
So the average of current species has got to be one for one or two for two,

168
00:11:14.941 --> 00:11:18.180
depending on how you count.
But for most species,

169
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:22.320
it's less than less than that because most species have gone extinct.

170
00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:27.450
So the answer is it is brutally difficult to reproduce.

171
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.813
Um,

172
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:33.120
if any given individual in a species produces a lot of children,

173
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.210
more than one or two,
depending on how you're counting,
uh,

174
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.410
then that means that some other individuals are having less.
Again,

175
00:11:40.411 --> 00:11:41.730
unless the species of humans,

176
00:11:41.731 --> 00:11:45.990
which are about the only species that are increasing continuously over the long

177
00:11:45.991 --> 00:11:50.370
time as an example,
they now buy this genetic testing,

178
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.100
have tested how many descendants does gangas Colin have?

179
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:59.380
And the answer is 16 million descendants.
This one guy.

180
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.910
So that's an awful lot.

181
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:05.440
But guess how he did it by killing a lot of men and raping their women.

182
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.920
So he,
he has that many descendants,
goes an awful lot of men.

183
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:11.920
All the men he killed don't have any descendants.

184
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.260
And that's just is con the Mongol Hoard,

185
00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:19.261
had a lot of males and I think they spread their seeds quite widely and a lot of

186
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:24.400
males in conquered people just didn't,
didn't survive.

187
00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.830
So,
and of course,
every army in the world,
uh,
has done it all,

188
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.720
essentially all have done a huge amount of raping.

189
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:36.250
And it's a wonderful instrument of gene flow in the human population.

190
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.590
So because reproduction is actually so difficult,

191
00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.450
species have evolved all kinds of fantastic mechanisms,

192
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:47.633
uh,

193
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:52.570
for trying to be successful reproduction.

194
00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.900
So that's 0.1.
Point two is that sex is not fair.

195
00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:01.240
It's not only difficult,
but it's not fair.

196
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:04.960
So sex goes way back and evolution

197
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.680
and even bacteria do it.

198
00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:13.890
So this is the biologist here are laughing.
This is uh,

199
00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:17.710
the bacteria that are in your colon and they have sex in this manner.

200
00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:19.090
And so right now,

201
00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:24.250
billions of sexual acts are taking place in your unspeakable parts.

202
00:13:24.251 --> 00:13:27.880
And this is the way they do it.
Now,

203
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.480
I don't have to go back a little bit in something like this.

204
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.570
Actually can the,
the,
the exchange of DNA can be either way.

205
00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:42.570
And this is even though the hairy guy on the left is producing that long pilots

206
00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:47.630
as it's called,
uh,
there's more or less he quality of sexuality,
uh,

207
00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:52.060
here.
But when it comes to higher organisms,
you get quite a different story.

208
00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:54.850
You all know,
sure.
The chicken and the egg.
Well,

209
00:13:54.851 --> 00:13:57.130
the way I tell it is the poor chicken,

210
00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.940
the chicken has to uh,

211
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.920
build this big egg has to eat like crazy,

212
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.770
put all that protein and fat into the egg,
which are,

213
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:09.040
if you're not fed in the Barnyard,
which are hard to come by.

214
00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:13.450
And then once the chicken is hatched,
guess who sits with the egg comes out.

215
00:14:13.451 --> 00:14:18.310
Guess who sits on the egg?
The female guests who protects the young,
the female.

216
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.240
So that's chickens.
You can go all the way up to humans.

217
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.000
Females have to spend my nine months pregnant.

218
00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.210
And then in most societies and most times,
uh,

219
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:32.170
females are the ones that have the burden of responsibility for the children.

220
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.230
Meanwhile,
in all this,
uh,

221
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:40.090
males just produce a little speck of protoplasm inserted into the female and
say,

222
00:14:40.091 --> 00:14:44.920
bye bye.
I've had my quickie and I'm off.
And not in all species,

223
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:47.290
but in most species,

224
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.590
the male has a very minimal part in reproduction and the has this huge burden.

225
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:58.100
Now why does that come about?
And you'd think evolution would,

226
00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.970
would require that females just wouldn't play this game in evolution and they

227
00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:05.540
would require a more equal distribution of the Labor?
Well,

228
00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:09.440
it turns out it is a starts as a division of labor.

229
00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.870
So the first animals to evolve,
first of anything,

230
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:19.130
we're probably almost certainly in the sea and stuck down on the bottom,

231
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:23.240
are floating around.
And so they couldn't move.

232
00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.960
And so how do you mate,
if you can't get up and find your mate?

233
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.320
Well you just spew out your sperms into the ocean.

234
00:15:30.321 --> 00:15:34.880
You spew out your eggs into the ocean and you hope that they meet.
Not a very,

235
00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.730
very,
not a very efficient mechanisms.

236
00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.850
But at that stage,
uh,

237
00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.660
the male has produced millions of sperms and the female has to produce millions

238
00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:45.613
of eggs.

239
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.030
If you're an animal and you have to produce so many of anything of gametes,

240
00:15:50.031 --> 00:15:54.710
in this case,
each one is going to be very tiny.
Two tiny things,

241
00:15:54.711 --> 00:15:56.180
meet and fuse,

242
00:15:56.181 --> 00:16:00.020
you still got a tiny thing and the odds of survival of a tiny thing in a not

243
00:16:00.021 --> 00:16:00.854
very great.

244
00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:06.070
So evolution doesn't like that idea of the male and the female both spewing out

245
00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:08.540
lots and lots of these tiny gametes.

246
00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:14.260
So what happens eventually is that the two sexes separate that the female's job

247
00:16:15.351 --> 00:16:19.910
is to make a big enough egg with enough nutrient in it so that the organism can

248
00:16:19.911 --> 00:16:23.930
survive.
And the male's job is to go find that egg.

249
00:16:24.410 --> 00:16:25.700
And so what do males have?

250
00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:30.110
Sort of what are the sperms evolve tales to take them swimming,

251
00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:35.750
right?
And as,
and they find their job is to find the agonist.

252
00:16:35.751 --> 00:16:39.230
So there still has to be lots of those and they have to expend a lot of energy,

253
00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.273
uh,
swimming.

254
00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:46.220
So it's still an equal amount of,
of investment.

255
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:50.790
But then the whole animal,
once evolution proceeds,

256
00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:54.980
the whole animal can now get up and walk over and find a female or vice versa.

257
00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:00.200
And now they can copulate or do some sort of insemination very close together.

258
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:05.420
This now does not require zillions and zillions of sperms.
So He,

259
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.650
if you're,
if you're,

260
00:17:07.070 --> 00:17:10.850
if the egg say already laid like a fish in a nest in the mail,

261
00:17:10.851 --> 00:17:15.110
just lays the sperms right on top of the eggs and he needs some surplus over the

262
00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:15.944
number of eggs,

263
00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:20.950
but nothing to compensate for the amount of energy she's putting into her eggs.

264
00:17:22.370 --> 00:17:24.080
So you start getting an inequality.

265
00:17:24.081 --> 00:17:29.081
As soon as animals can find each other and mate in a more spatially enclosed

266
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:34.790
way,
then you start getting any quality.

267
00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.073
<v 1>So</v>

268
00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.310
<v 0>evolution goes down that path because it's turned out to be a very,</v>

269
00:17:44.311 --> 00:17:45.450
very effective path.

270
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.650
And what you get is that females make a eggs.

271
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.540
Her eggs are very expensive,

272
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:56.160
they are expensive and rare mail's still make many,
many sperms.

273
00:17:56.640 --> 00:18:00.030
His berms are plentiful and cheap.

274
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.230
So this is what we call a sexual dimorphism,

275
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:08.880
that males and females are taking different evolutionary roots.

276
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.950
And once they take different evolutionary roots,
uh,

277
00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:18.030
then different reproductive strategies come into play for males and females.

278
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:23.670
So a mail through the first billion years of evolution has been producing a lot

279
00:18:23.671 --> 00:18:28.620
of sperm and now all of a sudden he figures out how to swim over to a female and

280
00:18:28.621 --> 00:18:32.280
he doesn't need all those sperms.
But he's still,
evolution is conservative.

281
00:18:32.281 --> 00:18:34.740
It's still,
he's still producing all of these things.

282
00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.280
What is evolution going to do with all those sperms?

283
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.420
But one thing they can do is if he can evolve backwards and just make fewer

284
00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:46.140
sperm,
that would save him some energy.
It would be good for him a little bit,

285
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.560
but it wouldn't really get him an awful lot more children,

286
00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.590
which is the name of the evolution game.
Now,

287
00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:56.790
what he can do with those access sperms find another female that his limit,

288
00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.900
their there stops being a limit on the number of females that he can seminate.

289
00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:05.280
He spreads his sperm to as many females as he can find.

290
00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.333
<v 1>So</v>

291
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.660
<v 0>this dimorphism that sperm are cheap and plentiful.</v>

292
00:19:11.661 --> 00:19:16.661
While eggs are expensive and rare leads to different strategies of reproduction

293
00:19:16.851 --> 00:19:21.380
in males and females.
It also sets up some odd situations where for instance,

294
00:19:21.381 --> 00:19:25.790
males are expendable big.
If one male can fertilize a lot of females,

295
00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:31.070
females don't need a lot of males around.
And so for instance,
there's a certain,

296
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.820
uh,
female wasps that lays it's egg and a caterpillar,
Caterpillar,

297
00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.430
wasp or one of the major predators of Caterpillar.

298
00:19:37.431 --> 00:19:41.510
They lay the egg in the egg hatches and starts eating up,
uh,
the caterpillar.

299
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:46.850
So,
but all of the eggs that are laid in a single caterpillar compete with each

300
00:19:46.851 --> 00:19:49.790
other for the food.
Uh,
that is the caterpillar.

301
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:56.080
So what happens is evolution as arrangement that the females hatch first and

302
00:19:56.481 --> 00:19:58.190
they eat up all their brothers except one.

303
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:04.520
And then that one male can fertilize all his sisters and,
and things go on.

304
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.650
Uh,
so the males are expendable in that case.
And if the,

305
00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.760
the females just ignored them and let them alive,

306
00:20:10.761 --> 00:20:13.550
the males would be competing with the females for food.

307
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.000
The females would grow less big and healthy and they would have less eggs and

308
00:20:17.001 --> 00:20:20.090
have Elucian,
uh,
doesn't like have that kind of a system.

309
00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.580
<v 1>So,
uh,
we'll</v>

310
00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.340
<v 0>all of these things you,</v>

311
00:20:26.341 --> 00:20:31.070
if you think it's not very difficult to find a human examples of this,
uh,

312
00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:35.680
who goes off to war and gets killed
nails.

313
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.700
And very often you don't find any reproductive,
any change in rate.

314
00:20:39.701 --> 00:20:43.240
The females managed to get inseminated human in humans.

315
00:20:43.241 --> 00:20:45.040
So in lots and lots of species,

316
00:20:45.041 --> 00:20:49.120
the number of males is really not a factor in the amount of reproduction

317
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:50.543
<v 1>that goes on.</v>

318
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.213
So

319
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.200
<v 0>males can inseminate many females,</v>

320
00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:04.450
but females want to worry about the survival of each egg and assembly.
Again,

321
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:08.290
this is pretty obvious,
uh,
in humans that a female,

322
00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.330
she gets pregnant,
uh,

323
00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.770
is going to be spending nine months pregnant and then breastfeeds and won't get

324
00:21:14.771 --> 00:21:15.371
pregnant again.

325
00:21:15.371 --> 00:21:18.910
So it's at least a year and probably at least a year and a half before that

326
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:20.880
female can get pregnant again.

327
00:21:20.881 --> 00:21:25.720
And we almost always bear only one child with an occasional twin or so forth.

328
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:28.960
So very low rate of reproduction where a male doesn't have any,
uh,

329
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.280
such kind of limit.

330
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:33.463
<v 1>And</v>

331
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:39.150
<v 0>this does not mean that females are monogamous because there's many other</v>

332
00:21:39.151 --> 00:21:43.830
reasons why a female might want to have many mates.
First of all,

333
00:21:43.831 --> 00:21:47.520
we'll see.
She might want to get resources for many males.
You'll see,

334
00:21:47.521 --> 00:21:51.850
she sometimes will not mate with,
uh,
with a,
with a mail list that mail her.

335
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:53.160
It gives her some resource.

336
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.860
She might want to mate with a variety of males because she can't tell which one

337
00:21:58.861 --> 00:22:00.150
has the best jeans.

338
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:05.070
She may want to mate with many males if our environment is unpredictable.

339
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.230
And even if she can tell something about his jeans,

340
00:22:07.231 --> 00:22:09.510
she doesn't know what the environment for her children are going to be like.

341
00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:14.310
So she wants to shake up the deck and try have a variety of children with a

342
00:22:14.311 --> 00:22:15.750
variety of different genes.

343
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.880
She might want each mail to think that he's the father of the children so that

344
00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:23.970
he doesn't,
that he protects and doesn't kill the children.

345
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.610
There are species who do that.
Uh,

346
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.050
there's a thing called sperm competition where she may want to have a whole

347
00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:35.040
variety of different sprints from different nails in her and then the sperms

348
00:22:35.041 --> 00:22:35.640
compete.

349
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:40.270
So even though the sort of a comic book presentation says,
Oh,

350
00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:45.060
males and promiscuous males want to go around and have a lot of sex and females

351
00:22:45.061 --> 00:22:46.580
won't one,
uh,

352
00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:50.250
there's many species with many reasons why female may also want to be

353
00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:51.360
promiscuous.

354
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.550
It used to be believed that many species were in fact,

355
00:22:56.551 --> 00:22:58.750
monogamous birds produced very,

356
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:03.240
very good example of what you observe is that a male and a female meet at the

357
00:23:03.241 --> 00:23:06.990
beginning of mating season,
they stay together or mating season.

358
00:23:06.991 --> 00:23:11.820
She made me sits on the eggs and he brings worms or some combination thereof and

359
00:23:11.821 --> 00:23:12.990
people that,
well,
this is great,

360
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.440
this is monogamy and what wonderful animals they are.

361
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:22.040
But now we can do DNA testing and it ain't ain't so that apparently,

362
00:23:23.490 --> 00:23:28.080
uh,
so they call that now social monogamy and distinguish it from sexual monogamy

363
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.040
and probably,
well,

364
00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:34.040
social monogamy is as we've always believed it to be a sexual monogamy is almost

365
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:39.060
nonexistent.
Uh,
in species when they measure it,

366
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:44.210
it turns out at 10 to 70% of the progeny have been sired by someone other than

367
00:23:44.851 --> 00:23:46.820
what they called the resident male.

368
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:52.750
And one article I read claim that there's only one species where does known for

369
00:23:52.911 --> 00:23:56.690
sure that there are 100%,
uh,
sexually monogamous in that case,

370
00:23:56.691 --> 00:24:00.980
the male and female physically fused together.
So neither can go anywhere.

371
00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:06.470
Okay.
So males,

372
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:11.710
so males have the job of finding and gaining access to females and they have to,

373
00:24:14.651 --> 00:24:18.770
to,
they are basically two strategies.
One is,
uh,

374
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.810
to let their sperms compete.
In that case,
they make this more and better,
uh,

375
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:28.580
sperm and socially the sexual system.

376
00:24:28.581 --> 00:24:32.900
And a species like that will be promiscuous,
that the females will mate with.

377
00:24:32.901 --> 00:24:35.260
Many males don't have a lot of uh,

378
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.980
semen in their vagina or sperm,

379
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:40.880
a thicker whatever sack for this.

380
00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.970
And then the f the sperms will compete with each other.

381
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:50.080
And some scientists believe that in humans also we have a variety of sperm

382
00:24:50.811 --> 00:24:53.870
including killer sperm and other kinds of sperm that,

383
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.660
that go in and facilitate this,

384
00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:59.000
find these killer sprint supposed to kill sperm that have a different,

385
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.350
a genotype and it's very controversial.
But whether this,
this is true or not,

386
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:08.990
the,
the it data starts with when you look at sperm,
they have very human sperm.

387
00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.710
They very different shapes and one version as well.

388
00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.520
All these other shapes are just damaged.
They're just bad.
You know,

389
00:25:16.521 --> 00:25:19.490
they're not effective.
And there's some evidence for that.

390
00:25:19.491 --> 00:25:21.170
And the other story is that no,

391
00:25:21.171 --> 00:25:25.090
these are doing different jobs and then fertilization and,
uh,

392
00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.770
it's a hot area of research.

393
00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.880
So that's strategy number one to engage in sperm competition.

394
00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:37.090
And you'll see if we get time that in our related species,

395
00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.860
uh,
Benobos chimps are,

396
00:25:41.070 --> 00:25:44.420
are our group of species generally engages in sperm competition.

397
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.580
And what you get is very large testes.

398
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:51.930
So you can determine this by taking the measure of the weight of testes as a

399
00:25:52.011 --> 00:25:54.650
fraction of total body weight.
And if it's very large,
you know,

400
00:25:54.651 --> 00:25:56.750
this sperm competition going on.

401
00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:02.600
The other strategy of course is males can compete with each other for control of

402
00:26:02.601 --> 00:26:03.560
the females.

403
00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:08.720
And this happens of course in modal motel animals.
Uh,

404
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:12.290
a sperm competition is the original thing when you're spew out and zillions of

405
00:26:12.291 --> 00:26:16.550
sperms.
And then the best ones fine on the ones that find the females,

406
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:18.620
but once their modal,

407
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.640
the males can come into contact with each other and they can fight in some way,

408
00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:25.730
uh,
and say control the territory.
For instance,

409
00:26:25.731 --> 00:26:30.530
so a coral reef fish controlled territories in the coral and the female is

410
00:26:30.531 --> 00:26:31.310
cruise around.

411
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:35.570
Find a male has got a good territory than come and meet with them.

412
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:37.550
Alternately,

413
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:41.750
the males will actually fight with each other for dominance and then use that

414
00:26:41.751 --> 00:26:46.530
dominance to gain access.
Females.
So how does this,

415
00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:49.110
what are some examples of how this all works out?
Um,

416
00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:53.100
the females have also two basic strategies.

417
00:26:54.780 --> 00:26:59.490
One is to get the males to provide,
uh,
resources other than,

418
00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:00.383
than sperm.

419
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:06.080
And those resources allow her to build big healthy eggs.

420
00:27:06.690 --> 00:27:11.510
And one of the really cute examples of this is in the jungle,
uh,

421
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.410
protein nitrogen is very,

422
00:27:13.411 --> 00:27:17.730
very scarce then of the soils are thin and moraines washed everything away.

423
00:27:17.731 --> 00:27:22.170
So it's really hard to get nitrogen.
Guess what's a great source of,
of nitrogen?

424
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:23.783
Dumb.

425
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:28.320
Any animal takes a dump in the rain forest immediately.

426
00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:32.610
There's all kinds of,
especially insects that come and are going to utilize that.

427
00:27:32.611 --> 00:27:34.650
Nitrogen is a really scarce resource.

428
00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.850
So beetles have are ones that are,
that are very good at this.

429
00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:42.600
And there's a whole group of beetles called Dung Beetles.
And what do they do?

430
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:47.480
They soon as they detect this by odor probably,
uh,

431
00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:52.470
they come in and start rolling it up into little balls cutting cause it's,

432
00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.500
it's much too big for them.
Let me show you a picture.

433
00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:58.933
<v 1>Come back.</v>

434
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.690
<v 0>This is a dung beetle and what he's done,
there's a big pad,</v>

435
00:28:06.691 --> 00:28:08.340
a big animal pad nearby,

436
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:12.400
and he's cut off with his cutting clause,
uh,

437
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:16.650
this big ball and that's what he's going to present to a female.

438
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:19.320
So a whole lot of Dung beetles come in.

439
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.920
They make these both then in the species I'm talking about,

440
00:28:22.921 --> 00:28:27.090
they put it on their back and sort of parade around with it.
Meanwhile,

441
00:28:27.091 --> 00:28:31.800
the females are around the outside and they're watching all this go on.

442
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:35.730
And what males do,
they choose ones are the biggest balls.

443
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.810
So she,
she wants,
she wants resources in,
that's her,

444
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.240
her resource.
Now,

445
00:28:45.241 --> 00:28:50.010
the most extreme case of this is in praying mantises.

446
00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:54.990
So praying mantises beautiful animals,
as you may know,
here's,

447
00:28:54.991 --> 00:28:59.100
here's one of them.
And,
but they're very solitary.

448
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.590
They have to actually catch insect.

449
00:29:01.591 --> 00:29:06.540
They s they sit on the ends of branches and with these claws and they wait for

450
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:10.530
an insect to fly by and that they grab it and eat it.
It's not an easy,

451
00:29:10.531 --> 00:29:13.560
it's not an easy way to make your living.
So they're poised.

452
00:29:13.561 --> 00:29:16.560
They're very quiet and they want to capture me.

453
00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.960
They have just a few milliseconds,
something buzzing.

454
00:29:18.961 --> 00:29:23.070
By now a male comes up and wants to mate with this female,

455
00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:24.240
but she's ready to eat,

456
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:29.780
so he's got the problem of approaching her and not getting eaten and in

457
00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:35.670
evolution they sometimes get eaten and that has led to a very interesting form

458
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:42.510
of reproductive strategy that what you see is that the mail will come on and you

459
00:29:44.951 --> 00:29:48.520
can see that that's the Mail on top and look how much smaller he is in the

460
00:29:48.521 --> 00:29:52.810
female.
Then the species,
the male is bigger but he's smaller and that's,

461
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:55.030
that's a sign that the males are not fighting with each other.

462
00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:56.980
We'll see later that if the male is bigger,

463
00:29:56.981 --> 00:29:59.590
that means they're almost always means they're finding things,
but she's,

464
00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:01.960
because he only has to make sperm.
She has to make eggs.

465
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:05.950
Notice he has his head still on.

466
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:07.480
She has her head on.

467
00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:11.440
That's the way it starts and you think that something normal is going to take

468
00:30:11.441 --> 00:30:14.890
place.
When actual fact she reaches around,
grabs him,

469
00:30:14.891 --> 00:30:19.630
she's bigger and stronger than him,
pulls him off and starts eating his head.

470
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:24.340
And what then happens is she allows him to go back,

471
00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:29.320
but now you can see she's still got her head.
There's no head there.

472
00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.370
And the way the insect nervous system has put out the,

473
00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.360
all the circuits to coordinate the copulation are down here.

474
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.930
And what the head actually does is inhibit that,
you know,

475
00:30:40.931 --> 00:30:43.180
unless it goes and says,
well,
most situations,
no,

476
00:30:43.181 --> 00:30:44.920
this isn't right to start calculating,

477
00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.830
but only in the very special situation where it's a female.

478
00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.180
When she eats off his head,

479
00:30:49.181 --> 00:30:54.181
that releases those circuits from inhibition and he calculates her to completion

480
00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.950
now and then she can,
when he's done,
she can eat the rest of him.

481
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:05.050
Now what's really interesting is,
and he doesn't object,

482
00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.950
he doesn't try to get away what's going on.

483
00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:14.470
The the,
the key thing is that this is a spar species.

484
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.750
How many of you have seen a praying mantis?

485
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:21.130
How many have you seen a lot of praying?
Mantises yeah.
One person.

486
00:31:21.131 --> 00:31:25.150
You must study them or something.
They're not hard.
They're not easy to find.

487
00:31:25.151 --> 00:31:25.984
There's not many of them.

488
00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:30.400
So if a male is lucky enough to find a female and getting this situation,
man,

489
00:31:30.401 --> 00:31:33.400
he's in heaven and is unlikely.
If he leaves her,

490
00:31:33.401 --> 00:31:36.010
he's going to find another one that's just an unlikely event.

491
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.280
So how does he maximize this reproduction?
Well,

492
00:31:39.281 --> 00:31:43.930
in my one chance I've got to have that female produce as many eggs with my genes

493
00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.860
in it.
So he wants her to produce a lot of big very healthy eggs.

494
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:50.500
And so his body is the food for her,

495
00:31:50.501 --> 00:31:55.300
including a lot of protein so that she can make a whole lot of eggs and

496
00:31:55.301 --> 00:31:59.560
evolution.
It's worked out that males who sacrifice their bodies,

497
00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:03.470
uh,
to this have more offspring than males who don't see.

498
00:32:03.471 --> 00:32:06.640
You see the evolution from him being prayed just because he's prayed to it being

499
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:09.610
an actual part of the whole sexual situation.

500
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:14.170
So the next time someone tells you that evolution is the survival of the
fittest,

501
00:32:14.171 --> 00:32:17.710
what are you going to tell them?
Fitness has a survival,

502
00:32:17.711 --> 00:32:19.660
has nothing to do with the price of cheese.

503
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:22.780
That that's only one of the ways.

504
00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:29.620
Okay.
Now the next strategy of females,

505
00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:31.300
the first is to get resources.

506
00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:36.720
The second strategy is for females to try to find the male with the best jeans.

507
00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.790
And so that she,
uh,
her offspring are,

508
00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:45.880
have good genes and are very successful.
So,
uh,

509
00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:50.630
there's a whole lot of aspects to this and one is she has to be able to control

510
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:53.480
which may was fertilizing her genes.

511
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:57.560
So the more separated the male and the female,
when you spew out into the ocean,

512
00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:01.880
eggs and sperm says no control whatsoever.
The closer that you come,

513
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:06.710
uh,
the male and the female come to each other,

514
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.560
the more control that the female has.

515
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:15.190
And one of the interesting ways of looking at this as internal fertilization as

516
00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.990
in humans.
Uh,
it is,

517
00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:23.630
it is among other things a strategy for female,
uh,
control.

518
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:28.250
So internal fertilization and internal growth of the fetus has a lot of

519
00:33:28.251 --> 00:33:29.900
advantages.
It protects the fetus,

520
00:33:29.901 --> 00:33:34.160
the fetus allows them other to provide nutrition and waste removal continuously,

521
00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:39.470
et cetera.
But there are also this aspect of the female control strategy.

522
00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:44.720
Uh,
generally if a female won't allow a meeting,
it doesn't happen.

523
00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.630
The female doesn't allow it,
then ray passed happen.

524
00:33:47.631 --> 00:33:51.290
We'll talk about a rape later in humans.
As you know,

525
00:33:51.291 --> 00:33:55.820
females have a vulva and that's the Latin word for Valve Shaman open it,

526
00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.580
she can close it.
And that's the whole idea.

527
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.990
So if the female wants to mate,

528
00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:06.020
she gets excited and she lubricates.

529
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:08.360
And the purpose of the lubrication is to ease,

530
00:34:08.361 --> 00:34:12.110
penetration and ease the sexual act.
Behavioral,

531
00:34:12.111 --> 00:34:14.990
she's also siphon from the beginning.
She's receptive,

532
00:34:14.991 --> 00:34:19.250
she assumes a proper posture and everything goes just fine.

533
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:23.020
But if these things,
if she doesn't want to do it and these things don't happen,

534
00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:23.990
there's no lubrication.

535
00:34:23.991 --> 00:34:27.350
There's no assumption of the proper posture which is necessary for internal

536
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.740
fertilization.
Uh,
then,
uh,

537
00:34:30.741 --> 00:34:35.741
it's very hard for the mail to intermit and probably sexual intercourse won't

538
00:34:36.351 --> 00:34:41.120
happen in a real rape,
say among humans.
The vent,

539
00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:45.720
the vagina does not lubricate.
And that's why there's so much,
uh,
uh,

540
00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.980
lacerating and tearing of the vaginal walls.

541
00:34:48.981 --> 00:34:53.981
It's why it's so dangerous because it's part of the human female strategy to

542
00:34:54.291 --> 00:34:58.880
control what males inseminate her is to not lubricate.
But if she's forced,

543
00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.980
uh,
that can be a lot of damage done to her.

544
00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:05.810
So how does a female,
no,

545
00:35:05.811 --> 00:35:09.770
which male has the best genes which mail to allow to inseminate her?

546
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:13.870
She has to either watch a competition or,

547
00:35:13.871 --> 00:35:17.600
or see the male in some way or know the outcome of some competition that she

548
00:35:17.601 --> 00:35:18.950
doesn't see by say,

549
00:35:18.951 --> 00:35:22.910
detecting a males a position in a status hierarchy.

550
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:25.790
And so in some birds,

551
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:29.150
like flamingos is a beautiful movie of Flamingos doing this,

552
00:35:29.151 --> 00:35:31.780
which I don't have time to show,
uh,

553
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:36.140
that can be a hundred or so males can gather together and start dancing.

554
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:37.620
It's what a Lek.

555
00:35:37.621 --> 00:35:40.890
And many of you may have heard of it or seen on national geographic movies,

556
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:45.420
the males dance back and forth,
back and forth.
They showed their coordination.

557
00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:47.460
They show how perfect their feathers are.

558
00:35:47.461 --> 00:35:49.110
They showed their stamina because they're there.

559
00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:51.510
They're doing this for quite a long time.
And again,

560
00:35:51.511 --> 00:35:55.320
the female stand around on the outside and try to notice a male who's a good

561
00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:57.000
dancer,
good long,
strong,

562
00:35:57.450 --> 00:36:01.710
well coordinated dancer and then she chooses him and goes off and mates.

563
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.440
And by choosing these males that are not,
you know,
not creaking around,
uh,

564
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.100
uh,
she presumed that she's getting a mail with the good,

565
00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:12.840
with good genes.

566
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:19.580
Another way that,
uh,
that,
um,

567
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
the females get to choose a good male is by choosing males who have buy in

568
00:36:28.741 --> 00:36:31.650
species where males fight as part of mail strategy.

569
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:36.810
Then the females choose the winners that males may fight and you set up a

570
00:36:36.811 --> 00:36:37.830
dominance hierarchy,

571
00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:40.790
but there's nothing says that the female has to choose the top dog.

572
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:45.150
Maybe she wants his middle dog or bottom dog.
But in general and species,

573
00:36:45.151 --> 00:36:47.780
females choose the top dog.
They,
they,

574
00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:52.380
they know the result of for a variety of ways the dominance fights and the

575
00:36:52.381 --> 00:36:57.381
female then chooses the top dog and in the mail fights the,

576
00:36:58.871 --> 00:37:00.030
the winner gets,

577
00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:04.590
gets the female or maybe gets a whole Harem of females and the loser may get

578
00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:09.450
absolutely nothing.
Well,
the females are very happy to join,

579
00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:14.460
uh,
the winners Harem.
Why is that?
Because once that starts in a species,

580
00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.380
that means that mail has some genes which allow him to win these fights.

581
00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.740
He's,
he's big,
he's strong,
he's vicious.
He has sharp teeth.

582
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:28.070
It's a violent character and therefore he is successful in these battles and the

583
00:37:28.231 --> 00:37:33.231
female wants her young to also once being in this evolutionary sense of if she

584
00:37:34.291 --> 00:37:36.150
does that,
she passes on her jeans.

585
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:41.400
The female wants her offspring to have these characteristics of being able to

586
00:37:41.401 --> 00:37:46.350
win a fight.
He of being very violent,
so she will choose the most violent male,

587
00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:51.590
the winner of these battles to father her children because then they then the

588
00:37:51.661 --> 00:37:53.880
odds are that they will also become these big,

589
00:37:53.881 --> 00:37:58.881
strong violent males into what happens in this case is

590
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:02.101
in evolution,

591
00:38:02.101 --> 00:38:07.101
males may start fighting and once the female select the fighters,

592
00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:12.000
then both male and female reproductive strategy colludes in increasing the

593
00:38:12.001 --> 00:38:17.001
violence a little bit in every generation and so it's very as the male and

594
00:38:17.971 --> 00:38:22.890
female violence colluding in male on male violence.

595
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.890
Okay.
What else does evolution do?
Well,

596
00:38:25.891 --> 00:38:29.310
if the males are fighting each other and reproductive success depends on winning

597
00:38:29.311 --> 00:38:33.800
these fights,
then males will tend to get larger.
And uh,

598
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:36.850
you get a large male.
Humans,

599
00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
chimpanzees male is larger than the female and that's helps them in the fights.

600
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.770
But it also opens up a second strategy for reproductive success.

601
00:38:49.070 --> 00:38:50.590
Oh three,
if we have time.

602
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:54.940
The second strategy for reproductive success and that is that the male is now

603
00:38:54.941 --> 00:38:58.690
bigger than the female and he can start coercing the female.

604
00:38:59.110 --> 00:39:03.730
So he may not have to fight the males.
He can just coerce,

605
00:39:03.731 --> 00:39:07.140
fight with and coerce,
uh,
this,
uh,

606
00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:08.920
smaller female.

607
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:14.350
And then guess what happens if that gets into a species that the males start

608
00:39:14.351 --> 00:39:17.430
cursing the females?
What does,
uh,

609
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:19.960
what does an evolutionarily wise female to do?

610
00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:26.170
She chooses a male who was most successful at coursing females because again,

611
00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.260
her children will then inherit those genes,

612
00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:33.760
which will allow them to successfully coerce females and get more reproduction

613
00:39:33.761 --> 00:39:36.310
and have more offspring.
So again,

614
00:39:36.311 --> 00:39:41.311
we see that not only are male and female reproductive strategies cooperating in

615
00:39:42.881 --> 00:39:45.280
an increase in male on male violence,

616
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:50.440
they also cooperate an increasing male on female violence.

617
00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:56.100
It's really quite an interesting way of looking at things and explains,

618
00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:01.270
starts to explain some of this violence that we see in human interactions.

619
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:06.050
Now the great,
we belong to the great ape,
uh,

620
00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:11.100
line of evolution and it seems that our line of evolution seems to specialize in

621
00:40:12.641 --> 00:40:17.050
male and female violence and consider rape.

622
00:40:17.770 --> 00:40:22.390
So lot of s political correctness about use of the word great,

623
00:40:22.391 --> 00:40:24.640
but I'm going to do it in a straight biological sense.

624
00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:28.840
As rape is the coercion of an unwilling female into intercourse.

625
00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:34.060
Outside of mammals,
there are only a very few species where rape occurs.

626
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:37.870
Scorpion flies or one of the best known examples.

627
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:43.210
Normal sex occurs when a male offers a female,
a dead insects or other food mass.

628
00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.960
She's getting resources from him after she accepts,

629
00:40:46.961 --> 00:40:51.280
she allows copulation to proceed,
um,
uh,

630
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:55.960
and it goes smoothly.
Sometimes.
However,

631
00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.640
sex happens in quite a different way.

632
00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:01.540
A male without an offering can ambush the female.

633
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.450
And she clearly is trying to escape.

634
00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:08.710
And the whole time he's got genital class papers to try to grab onto her and

635
00:41:08.711 --> 00:41:12.580
she's trying to get away and,
and push him away,
fly away.

636
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:17.250
And in your reading,
there's a description of,
of this rape of Scorpion fly.

637
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:19.480
We don't have to go further with it.

638
00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:25.210
Invertebrates rapes occur in several species of docs.

639
00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.460
And in mammals there are only three species where rape is routine.

640
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:34.490
Elephant seals,
orangutans,
and humans.

641
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:39.260
Rape occurs occasionally in three other mammals,
species,
chimpanzees,

642
00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:43.190
how old her mom,
monkeys,
and gorillas when they're captive,

643
00:41:43.191 --> 00:41:47.990
it has not been observed in the wild.
So this is really quite striking.

644
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.050
So of the six species,

645
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:56.780
a mammalian species in which rape has been observed,

646
00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:00.650
five of those are,
are the great.
Eight are,

647
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:03.650
are apes and sorry,
one is a monkey.

648
00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.800
The six species of primates where it's been observed,
uh,
uh,

649
00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.540
for our great apes like us.

650
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:16.010
So those statistics are way out of the range of chance.

651
00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:21.140
There was something special about ape evolution that has led to this emphasis on

652
00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:24.410
a violent relationship between males and females.

653
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:30.790
And most likely it is the extreme unavailability of eggs.

654
00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:35.420
So it's an extremely rare and Matt and in the Great Apes,

655
00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:40.400
it's extremely rare to find a female who has an egg ready to be fertilized.
Why?

656
00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:41.990
Well,

657
00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:46.990
first primates take many years to become sexually mature in chimps and humans.

658
00:42:47.391 --> 00:42:51.000
It's around 12 to 13 years before a female,
uh,

659
00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:54.530
can obviate an egg.
So,

660
00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.860
and then primate mothers have these long gestation periods,

661
00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:00.440
eight months in chimps,
nine months in humans.

662
00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:05.630
And so just counting gestation and the recovery from childbirth females can have

663
00:43:05.631 --> 00:43:06.980
at most one young a year,

664
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:11.420
which means one egg available for fertilization in a whole year,

665
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:15.560
but then the females lactate.
And you'll probably know about,
uh,

666
00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:20.680
lactational Amen area that when a female is lactating and the baby is sucking on

667
00:43:20.961 --> 00:43:25.400
the nipple,
uh,
hormones are released and the female does not.

668
00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:28.640
A lactate does not awfully late,
again,

669
00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:33.720
the average for chimpanzees about another four years in which the female,
uh,

670
00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:36.950
feeds breastfeeds,
uh,
the infant.

671
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:39.410
And so she doesn't come into fertility again.

672
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:45.830
And then they sometimes stay with their young,
uh,
even longer time.

673
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.460
So the average birth interval for chimpanzees is five and a half years.

674
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:51.080
That means for any female,

675
00:43:51.081 --> 00:43:55.100
there's one egg every five and a half years ready to be fertilized.

676
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:56.421
Uh,
Jay,

677
00:43:56.421 --> 00:44:01.070
that's Jane Goodall's number of Japanese groups as it's six years for

678
00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:02.840
orangutans,
it's eight years.

679
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:06.050
And gorilla females have a baby about once every 10 years.

680
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:11.270
So this is an extreme dearth of eggs to get fertilized.

681
00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:17.120
You have a chimp community.
They say 40,
45 to 55 individuals,

682
00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:20.420
something like that,
maybe 10 or 12.
This is a big community,

683
00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:24.650
10 or 12 sexually mature males,
about the same number of females,

684
00:44:25.250 --> 00:44:29.390
um,
uh,
non mature males and females.

685
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.980
And of those then given the very long period,

686
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:36.150
there's probably gonna be one or two females in that whole year who are going to

687
00:44:36.151 --> 00:44:40.200
be fertile and in estrus ready to get fertilized.

688
00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:45.030
So these males spend the whole year in terms of their reproductive evolution,

689
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:50.180
spend the whole year setting themselves up to have that one to inseminate that

690
00:44:50.971 --> 00:44:53.430
one egg.
That's available in that whole year.

691
00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:56.280
You can imagine there's going to be a huge amount of competition,

692
00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:59.760
a huge amount of violence,
uh,
among the males.

693
00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:05.930
And as we've seen that male male violence then spills over to male,

694
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:08.040
female violence

695
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:13.240
within this group.
Uh,
we,
we,

696
00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.920
we belong to an order called a primates as you know,

697
00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:21.810
and within this group,
monkeys are fairly distant relatives,

698
00:45:21.811 --> 00:45:25.980
but the rest of the great apes are the great apes are fairly close.

699
00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:29.760
And you can see there's a lot of similarities.
Um,

700
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:35.540
this isn't jokes about the singles bar even in biology,

701
00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.090
to have some sense of humor still last.

702
00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:46.130
Now this is another professor at Yale and I always ask students,

703
00:45:47.881 --> 00:45:50.760
you know,
he got too many advisees.
So I asked them,
you know,

704
00:45:50.761 --> 00:45:52.950
wouldn't you rather go to this guy?
And you know,

705
00:45:52.951 --> 00:45:56.730
he looks very fatherly and kind and everything.
Well,

706
00:45:56.731 --> 00:46:00.690
that's an orangutan and of the,
of the great apes,

707
00:46:00.870 --> 00:46:05.870
it's as far distant from humans as the most distant species and yet looks pretty

708
00:46:06.991 --> 00:46:10.940
much,
you know,
you can empathize with that,
uh,
as,

709
00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.270
as almost a human being.

710
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:15.810
It doesn't take a lot of evolution to go between these two.

711
00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:19.260
There are five species of great apes.

712
00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:22.553
That's a young guy.

713
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:30.680
This is 50 this is a timescale that 15 million years ago there was one line of

714
00:46:32.041 --> 00:46:37.041
evolution coming up from long time ago and the first event was that Uranga tans

715
00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:43.440
split off the tree,
the tree split and one branch became orangutans.

716
00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.500
Then about 10 million years ago another,

717
00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:51.390
it was another split and gorillas went off.
A group went off and became gorillas.

718
00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:53.910
Then about 6 million years ago,

719
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:57.480
another group that came off and they evolved into humans.

720
00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:02.760
Most recent split is about 2 million years ago and gave two species very similar

721
00:47:03.901 --> 00:47:08.790
species,
chimpanzees and Bonobos.
The farther distant the split is,

722
00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:11.400
the more of there's been times to evolve differently.

723
00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:16.640
So an orangutan who has that nice guy is very distant from the other species.

724
00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:19.621
So that's,

725
00:47:19.621 --> 00:47:24.621
that's our family tree and the difference this,

726
00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:30.860
this is a fairly recent split here and the genetic difference between these

727
00:47:31.631 --> 00:47:32.470
three species,

728
00:47:32.471 --> 00:47:37.010
between any pair of those three species is about one and a half percent.
We,

729
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:41.530
if you draw out the DNA sequence for a,
for a chimpanzee and a human,

730
00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:46.740
and look at the base pairs and are very hundred 98 or 99 will be identical in

731
00:47:47.171 --> 00:47:49.060
one or two will be different.

732
00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:52.840
So we're extremely similar genetically.

733
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:58.180
Uh,
now what does this difference mean?
One and a half,
2%.

734
00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:02.230
We don't have the foggiest idea of what it means.
Obviously,
you know,

735
00:48:02.231 --> 00:48:03.760
it can look at a chimpanzee and say,
hey,

736
00:48:03.761 --> 00:48:07.330
it ain't human and their behavior is different and they can't speak and all

737
00:48:07.331 --> 00:48:08.200
kinds of things.

738
00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:12.460
But genetically there's not that big of a difference.

739
00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:16.660
So I wouldn't draw any particular conclusions from the genetics yet.
We're,

740
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:20.980
this is a rapidly evolving field and we're going to learn an awful lot very

741
00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:21.814
quickly.

742
00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:26.440
And when doesn't know what the conclusions are going to turn out to be.

743
00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:31.720
One thing which may be solid is that if you look between a ma,
you know,

744
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:36.910
females have two x chromosomes and males have an x and y chromosome.

745
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:37.601
So you can have to,

746
00:48:37.601 --> 00:48:41.230
what is the genetic distance between a human male and a human female?

747
00:48:41.231 --> 00:48:44.080
And guess what?
One and a half percent.

748
00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:47.830
So whatever you think of the difference,

749
00:48:48.370 --> 00:48:50.890
a genetic distance of those species,

750
00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:55.210
you pretty much at this current stage of our knowledge have to think the same as

751
00:48:55.211 --> 00:49:00.160
the genetic difference between a human male and a human female.
So that's,

752
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:04.210
that's grist for your thinking.
Um,

753
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:10.710
each of the great ape species has evolved at different social system to organize

754
00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:14.320
reproduction and all.

755
00:49:14.321 --> 00:49:16.930
But one have an awful lot of violence associated with it.

756
00:49:18.010 --> 00:49:20.800
Orangutans are the least social,
uh,
vapes.

757
00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:23.510
The males and the females generally,
uh,

758
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:28.530
stay apart and the mother and the child or the only stable social unit,

759
00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:32.980
the,
the offspring stay with the mother until adolescence.

760
00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:36.700
Very much like the chimpanzee story.
And,
and,
and like the human story,

761
00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:39.850
it's about 10 years before the young separates.

762
00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:44.950
And for most of the eight years between birth,
the mother has no interest in,

763
00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:47.470
in males at all,
no interest in sex at all.

764
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:50.380
She doesn't really come very close to them.

765
00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:56.110
There are two kinds of orangutan males.
There's a large one and a small one.

766
00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:59.920
The big males are about 200 pounds.
Uh,

767
00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:04.690
the females in the small nails are less than half that size,
about 90 pounds.

768
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:07.680
Uh,
there's this,

769
00:50:07.790 --> 00:50:12.640
the small mail develops normally up to adolescence and then just stops

770
00:50:12.670 --> 00:50:15.920
developing further,
doesn't develop the characteristics of,
of,

771
00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:20.290
of the full mail does grow beard crests,
uh,

772
00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.430
of the hair,

773
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:25.780
throat pouches and etc. They remain looking like adolescents,

774
00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:29.390
but they are completely fertile and have a normal compliment of testosterone.

775
00:50:29.391 --> 00:50:33.660
They're sexually totally capable and they can stay as this in this adolescent

776
00:50:33.661 --> 00:50:35.780
stage for up to 18 years,
maybe longer.

777
00:50:35.781 --> 00:50:38.030
But that's the most that anyone has observed them.

778
00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:42.890
And they probably don't grow into a big male until the dominant male in the

779
00:50:42.891 --> 00:50:47.150
region has died or is too weak to defend himself.

780
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:51.510
So the females,
uh,

781
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:54.290
always wonder when they have a choice.

782
00:50:54.291 --> 00:50:57.560
They always want to meet with the big males because the big males are more

783
00:50:57.561 --> 00:50:58.221
successful.

784
00:50:58.221 --> 00:51:02.180
And it's the old story that females mate with males of the type that are already

785
00:51:02.181 --> 00:51:07.181
successful because that is good for the genes that her children get in the

786
00:51:07.971 --> 00:51:12.860
meeting,
uh,
between,
uh,
a female and a big male,
sexist,

787
00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:17.840
very relaxed.
Uh,
it has taken on a languorous quality and an erotic quality.

788
00:51:17.841 --> 00:51:19.670
There's not a great rush.

789
00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:25.060
Meetings can begin with oral or manual manipulation of the partners' Genitalia.

790
00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.030
And it can be initiated by either the male or by the female.

791
00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:32.570
And when they finally do engage in intercourse,
um,

792
00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:38.260
they do it often face to face missionary style.
And it takes her about it,

793
00:51:38.261 --> 00:51:42.740
about as long as it takes humans an average of 11 minutes and up to half an hour

794
00:51:42.741 --> 00:51:44.570
just in case you want to compare.

795
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:51.200
Now these big males are ponderous,
they can't move fast,

796
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:55.580
whereas the females are alive and they,
they can,
they can go pretty fast.

797
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:57.980
So you know,
the female was choosing the mail cause we didn't want them.

798
00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:00.950
She could be gone and there's no way that he could catch her.

799
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:06.860
But what about the small males?
They uh,

800
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:11.630
they are not attracted to females,
but they have,
they have one advantage.

801
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:16.010
They're small and they're fast and they can run fast and they can catch females.

802
00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:19.370
So that's what mother evolution has,
has done.

803
00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:23.540
They try to catch and rape the females.

804
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:28.430
And the females are usually,
as I said,
alone with their young.

805
00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:33.260
And if they're found by a single buy,
one of these small males,
they're chased.

806
00:52:33.261 --> 00:52:35.090
And sometimes they get caught.

807
00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:39.200
And then the females show fear and they struggle to escape.

808
00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:41.840
And the males sometimes strike them or bite them.

809
00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:46.920
And the females scream and the young there,
they're dependent.
The young scream,

810
00:52:47.510 --> 00:52:51.650
the females bite back,
they hit,
they pulled the hair of the males,
uh,

811
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:56.750
while the copulation is going on.
And that lasts not more than 10,

812
00:52:57.110 --> 00:53:01.070
10 minutes.
So how common is this?

813
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:05.720
A different?
Orangutans are very hard to see.
They live in a part of Borneo.

814
00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:09.020
It's hard to get to and they're,
they're very hard to see.
But,

815
00:53:09.021 --> 00:53:13.520
so there's different studies coming to different conclusions.
Uh,
one,

816
00:53:13.521 --> 00:53:16.010
a theologist found that about a third one,

817
00:53:16.011 --> 00:53:20.480
third of a Orang mutations of off some degree of forcing of the female by the

818
00:53:20.481 --> 00:53:21.230
male.

819
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:25.710
Japanese observers reported that 88% of the copulations where rapes and that

820
00:53:25.711 --> 00:53:27.150
these were the severe kind,

821
00:53:27.730 --> 00:53:30.950
a Dutch observer judged half the copulations to be raped.

822
00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.720
So these are not rare events.

823
00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:38.730
They're standard part of the rang of Tang sexual,
uh,
strategy.

824
00:53:39.930 --> 00:53:42.180
There's a lot of examples where,
uh,

825
00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.320
orangs are close enough to humans that apparently a lot of those same sexual

826
00:53:46.321 --> 00:53:48.970
signals are passing.
Uh,

827
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:54.930
a woman primatologist who ran primatology research in,

828
00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:58.740
in,
in Borneo,
uh,

829
00:53:59.370 --> 00:54:02.280
talked about in neuron who had lived with humans for a lot of his life.

830
00:54:02.281 --> 00:54:05.610
So it was very acculturated to humans.
And one day,

831
00:54:05.611 --> 00:54:09.020
apparently he raped one of the female cooks,
the rang Tang,

832
00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.690
the mail or ring raped,
one of the human female cooks at the camp.

833
00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:17.010
And the parents are complete rape with penetration and everything.

834
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.090
And as you know,
uh,
rape is a big embarrass,

835
00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:26.580
a big embarrassment for the female as well as the male.
But in this case,

836
00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:31.830
and this an Indonesia,
uh,
the husband very unusually took it quite easily.

837
00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:35.730
The husband said that since the rapist was not human,

838
00:54:35.940 --> 00:54:40.190
the rape should not provoke shame a rage.
He said,
why should my wife,
Rebekah,

839
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.930
my wife,
will I be concerned?
It wasn't demand.

840
00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:48.800
So there's all kinds of stories that I don't have time to tell you about this.

841
00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:55.680
Uh,
okay.
Now,
why doesn't evolution,
uh,

842
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:59.580
just keep the males and females together?
Probably food density.

843
00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:03.900
There's food is hard to get in and individuals have to forage alone to find

844
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:06.420
enough food vape fortune pairs.

845
00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:10.500
What they found would not be enough for two of them.
Now,
well,

846
00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:15.501
gorillas live in a region and have an ecology that they have more food available

847
00:55:15.541 --> 00:55:16.140
to them.

848
00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:21.140
So they live in somewhat larger groups and in gorillas,

849
00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:25.230
the female stick close to the mail.
Each male,

850
00:55:25.231 --> 00:55:28.760
a big silverback male can have a Harem of say three to four.
Uh,

851
00:55:29.040 --> 00:55:33.450
females in these Harem thinks I spend most of their time.

852
00:55:33.451 --> 00:55:37.830
Just the few of them together.
They're quiet,
they're relaxed,

853
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:42.930
they're affectionate with each other.
The,
the,
the troop is stable.
Uh,

854
00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:48.030
with the,
the one silver back three or four females and whatever young,
uh,

855
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:53.240
they have very little aggressiveness of between the males and the females or

856
00:55:53.311 --> 00:55:56.010
female to female just hardly happens.

857
00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:01.830
But as I said before,
if one male was controlling three to four females,

858
00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:06.120
that means there's two to three males that don't have any mates whatsoever.

859
00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:10.590
And what does evolution going to do with those bachelor bowels?
Again at eight.

860
00:56:10.591 --> 00:56:13.410
Nice.
The mail.
So they,

861
00:56:13.411 --> 00:56:18.300
the gorillas traveled through the jungle,
resting some eating,
some,
the fruits,

862
00:56:18.301 --> 00:56:19.680
the roots,
the shoots.

863
00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:25.190
These bachelor males followed the troop on the uphill side and just wait until

864
00:56:26.021 --> 00:56:29.800
the silver back is not watching.
Then they charge down.
They make,

865
00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:33.190
can make a fair amount noise so often the silverback notices and goes over and

866
00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:36.010
beats the hell out of the guy.
And he retreats again.

867
00:56:36.790 --> 00:56:41.380
But every so often he's successful.
He,
the male is with another female or off.

868
00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:45.520
Never very far away,
but a little way it goes down.
What does he do?

869
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:48.250
He charges downhill.
So he gets up a lot of speed.

870
00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:51.100
He charges right at a female with a young,

871
00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:54.570
he grabs the young immediately,
uh,

872
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:59.430
smashes it on the ground and kills it,
runs away.
It doesn't try to do anything.

873
00:56:59.431 --> 00:57:03.780
It just kills the young of the female.
Now,

874
00:57:03.781 --> 00:57:06.260
what does the female do at the females are the,
these are very smart.

875
00:57:06.261 --> 00:57:08.060
They are the great apes,
so they're very smart.

876
00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:11.270
They recognize each other's individuals.
They have long memories.

877
00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:14.180
So you would expect that this female would remember this male,

878
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:18.290
the rest of her life and fear him,
hate him,
avoid him.

879
00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:20.690
In fact,
the opposite happens.

880
00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:26.260
What happens is the female within a few days generally leaves the silver back

881
00:57:26.541 --> 00:57:31.130
that was supposed to be guarding her and goes with the single male and they go

882
00:57:31.131 --> 00:57:32.980
off and have a consort ship.

883
00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:37.910
What the message that the male is delivering to the female is,
look,

884
00:57:37.911 --> 00:57:41.990
you've put a huge investment into this infant and now it's wasted.

885
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:46.670
That guy can't protect you.
You know,
he has too many females.
He's too old.

886
00:57:46.671 --> 00:57:51.320
He's too big and slow.
He can't protect you.
I can call.
You can get,

887
00:57:51.350 --> 00:57:52.820
you can stay with him and get pregnant again,

888
00:57:52.821 --> 00:57:55.100
and I'm going to come down and kill your next baby too.

889
00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:57.920
So if you want to reproduce,
you come off with me.
Of course,

890
00:57:57.921 --> 00:58:00.410
none of this is verbal.
This is an evolutionary story.
I hope.

891
00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:01.770
I hope you understand that,
you know,

892
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:05.870
they're not meditating this stuff tonight that I'm saying.
Uh,

893
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:08.120
and so what you notice is in a few days,

894
00:58:08.121 --> 00:58:13.121
this female leaves and goes with the male that has just killed her young and,

895
00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:18.880
and starts reproducing with that one that may be stable and last a long time or

896
00:58:18.921 --> 00:58:22.640
another male may come by and in a few months,
uh,

897
00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:25.940
separate him,
separate them.

898
00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:30.470
So again,
these are not isolated incidents.
Uh,

899
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:32.710
Diane Fossey,
uh,

900
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:38.360
had data on about 50 infants,
38% of them died.

901
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:42.920
I went before they were three and 37% of those were from infanticide.

902
00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:48.490
About one infant in seven dies from infanticide in each of the female gorilla

903
00:58:48.741 --> 00:58:52.910
she studied,
had at least one infant that was killed by infanticide.

904
00:58:54.770 --> 00:58:55.680
Soon the gorillas,

905
00:58:55.700 --> 00:59:00.410
the females are trapped in this vortex of male initiated violence.
At any moment,

906
00:59:00.411 --> 00:59:03.560
a male may come crashing through the forest and,
and kill her young.

907
00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:08.060
And the best way for her to prevent this is to go off with that male.

908
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:09.560
She needs protection.

909
00:59:09.561 --> 00:59:14.060
She leads lives in a world of baby killers and she needs a protection from them.

910
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:20.650
Chimpanzees who are going down the list of species and we won't get time to

911
00:59:20.651 --> 00:59:21.484
finish,

912
00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:26.650
but chimpanzees have yet another solution to this primate reproductive problem

913
00:59:26.811 --> 00:59:29.030
of very,
very scarce eggs.

914
00:59:30.110 --> 00:59:34.730
Unlike orangs and gorillas,
the males are not solitary,
but related.

915
00:59:34.731 --> 00:59:38.840
Males spend their lifetime together as a community.

916
00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:45.790
Chimps live in groups of about 40 individuals with a dozen or so,

917
00:59:46.161 --> 00:59:50.180
a adult males.
And a similar number of adult females.

918
00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:53.270
As with the Orangutans,
uh,

919
00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:56.510
the chimp female spend most of their time alone with their young,

920
00:59:56.960 --> 01:00:01.960
and they're not separated from their young until there are several years old,

921
01:00:02.211 --> 01:00:04.610
really into adolescence.
And so first they hold them,

922
01:00:04.611 --> 01:00:08.540
they're not physically separated for several years and then for several years

923
01:00:08.541 --> 01:00:10.190
they're not out of sight.

924
01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:12.950
And then for several more years than not out of voice contact.

925
01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:17.870
So it's really very,
very tight bonding between mother and,
and,
and,
and children.

926
01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:21.570
The males defend a rather large territory,
um,

927
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:25.000
numbers of square kilometers in which they range in which the,

928
01:00:25.001 --> 01:00:30.001
the females range and the males spend their time searching for food patrolling.

929
01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:35.180
Uh,
the board is the territory and they're often with other males.

930
01:00:35.181 --> 01:00:37.240
This patrolling is off,
is,
is,
uh,
is a,

931
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:41.540
is a bunch of males together and they go around checking on the females to see

932
01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:45.530
which ones have come into estrus or if any have come into estrus.

933
01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:46.851
As I mentioned,

934
01:00:46.851 --> 01:00:51.710
the females come into estrus only about once every six years after their last

935
01:00:51.711 --> 01:00:54.980
young was born.
They have a 35 day cycle,

936
01:00:54.981 --> 01:00:59.981
very similar to humans and our sexually receptive for about 15 of these days in

937
01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.750
each of their monthly cycles.

938
01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:08.210
Her fertility increases during these 15 days and she's most fertile the last two

939
01:01:08.211 --> 01:01:11.450
or three days of this receptive period.

940
01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:14.270
The females do an interesting thing.

941
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:17.840
I've ever been to a zoo and looked at chimpanzee females,

942
01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:23.600
but do you see
big red rump if they're,
if they're fertile,

943
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:25.730
it looks rather disgusting to humans.

944
01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:27.920
And I've been looking for a picture of it an amazingly,

945
01:01:27.921 --> 01:01:31.040
it's such a striking thing.
I cannot find a really good picture of this,

946
01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:34.980
but you go to a zoo,
it's very,
very obvious.
They,
they're,
uh,

947
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:36.980
of the cold anal genital swelling.

948
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:40.850
They advertise their estrus oppositely to humans.

949
01:01:40.851 --> 01:01:43.380
Humans keep the Astra secret needed.

950
01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.080
The male or the female knows whether they're in estrus chimpanzees advert.

951
01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.810
Everybody knows.
Now why did they do that?
Well,

952
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:53.120
what happens is when a female comes into estrous,

953
01:01:53.121 --> 01:01:56.990
the mail's been waiting all year for this.
The males congregate together.

954
01:01:57.230 --> 01:02:01.490
And what are the males start doing competing for the female?
They're fighting.

955
01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.460
The dominant male arrives and it's clear who's dominant.

956
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:09.910
So the females advertise as a way of inciting male violence that they want to be

957
01:02:11.511 --> 01:02:15.080
able to choose the dominant male,
the ones that are great fighting form.

958
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.360
So they say,
Hey,
I'm an estrus,

959
01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.540
or you guys come and fight and I'm going to sit there and,
and,

960
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.820
and choose the best of you.

961
01:02:23.821 --> 01:02:26.940
Which in this case means the most violent of you.

962
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:30.900
But unfortunately in this situation,

963
01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:32.790
all these males are not only fighting with each other,

964
01:02:32.791 --> 01:02:37.740
but they're trying to get it to females.
So the females are,
are heard about,

965
01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:42.720
they have to run around to escape the end.
The cloud that clashes with the males.

966
01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:45.420
They regularly receive quite a lot of,
of,

967
01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:50.260
of wounds when they chased or they try to climb up trees to escape this,

968
01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:54.840
sometimes they fall out of trees.
Uh,
and uh,

969
01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.170
they had their young Windom and the young something to cling to them.

970
01:02:58.171 --> 01:03:02.640
And then if they,
if the mother's fault,
the kids fall,
it's a very,
very dangerous,

971
01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:07.700
uh,
unpleasant time.
And the,
the,

972
01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:12.720
the,
uh,
the violence is so great that when a male approaches a female,

973
01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:16.830
she doesn't know whether he's coming to be,
uh,
you know,

974
01:03:16.831 --> 01:03:19.230
to try to meet with her or to be violent toward her.

975
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:24.000
Because you'll read in the reading how the males have a long history of being

976
01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:25.350
violent to the females.

977
01:03:25.351 --> 01:03:30.351
It's a way of counting them so that when they're in this melee,

978
01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.330
when their estrous,
no male approaches them,
they don't resist.

979
01:03:33.331 --> 01:03:37.590
If they do try to resist,
he does a lot of violence on them.

980
01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:41.760
So the male has to,
when the mail comes and wants to mate with the female,

981
01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:46.350
he has to signal to her,
don't run away.
I'm not going to try to beat you up.

982
01:03:46.650 --> 01:03:50.790
And he has,
this is,
sorry,
these orangutans,

983
01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:55.080
gorilla chimpanzee with
her young,

984
01:03:55.450 --> 01:03:58.780
uh,
this is the,
uh,

985
01:03:59.130 --> 01:04:03.300
this male is inspecting the female that not only is a red rump,
but there's,

986
01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:07.560
there's odors,
chemicals,
and he's trying to see what,
what the status of her,

987
01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:10.340
her cycle is.
Uh,

988
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:15.200
and this is a male displaying letting a female,
no.
Uh,
that,

989
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.640
that this is the sexual,
uh,

990
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:22.320
engagement and humans have been known to do the same thing.

991
01:04:22.321 --> 01:04:24.300
This is a picture from Borneo.

992
01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:28.020
The same sort of advertising was pretty much the same message.

993
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:31.990
And here's an incredible photographs.
And I saw,
I don't know,

994
01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:33.060
should I leave that on the board?

995
01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:39.990
I get in trouble leaving things like that on that
for too long.

996
01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:43.800
Um,
okay.

997
01:04:43.801 --> 01:04:47.740
Now [inaudible] so in this great Malay,
there's great violent man.

998
01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:50.780
There's all the males they're trying to get at this female.
Um,

999
01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:52.950
if a male does it,

1000
01:04:52.951 --> 01:04:56.160
let's say that Alpha males or fighting with someone else and the females alone

1001
01:04:56.161 --> 01:05:00.360
for a minute,
the male,
uh,
any male that's around,
rushes in,

1002
01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:03.570
but he's not going to have a lot of time before the other males notice what's

1003
01:05:03.571 --> 01:05:07.730
going on in rush into,
to separate them because they're all competing for,

1004
01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:10.710
to inseminate,
uh,
that egg.

1005
01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:15.900
So the males have a very short time in which to complete the copulation and

1006
01:05:15.901 --> 01:05:20.901
ejaculation occurs an hour of just 15 seconds with only 8.8 pelvic thrusts.

1007
01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:23.620
I think those are very important numbers you should know.

1008
01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.690
But the females make up in quantity.
What they don't get in quality,

1009
01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.600
they appear,
and there's a story behind this,

1010
01:05:31.601 --> 01:05:35.290
but they appeared to be quite promiscuous and their sex partners and the

1011
01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:38.770
community followed by Jane Goodall in each estrous cycle.

1012
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:42.460
Each female had at least one bout of intercourse with every male.

1013
01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:46.150
So all the males are getting some chance at having intercourse.

1014
01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:51.040
The average six encounters a day,
but don't get excited.
It's still only a minute.

1015
01:05:51.041 --> 01:05:55.270
And a half at their rate.
And in each monthly sexual cycle,

1016
01:05:55.271 --> 01:05:58.600
they have about a hundred or so bouts of intercourse.

1017
01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:03.820
So there's a lot of sexuality.
Do females have Oregon orgasms?

1018
01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:08.440
Not known debates about it,
but not,
no.
All right.

1019
01:06:08.441 --> 01:06:13.330
I guess,
um,
um,
our time is running out.
Uh,

1020
01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:18.540
we will continue on Thursday and I'll set up sections in between and a,

1021
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:25.420
any questions?
Can I stay after every lecture for as long as necessary?

1022
01:06:25.421 --> 01:06:27.910
If people want to come down and ask questions.
