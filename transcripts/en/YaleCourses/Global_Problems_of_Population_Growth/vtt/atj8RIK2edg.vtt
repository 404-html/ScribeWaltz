WEBVTT

1
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:04.950
As you undoubtedly have noticed,

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.610
most of the chorus has been a sort of have a global focus in mostly focused on

3
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.270
foreign countries with Fairmount on Europe and very little actually on America

4
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.790
now.
Now we've come to the part of the course,

5
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:22.560
we were going to discuss social issues and those are very country dependent.

6
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:26.550
What's a,
what's a hot social issue?
Depends on the cultural context.

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.800
And so we're going to use that to do American issues.
And what are the,

8
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:36.030
with respect to reproduction?
Uh,
one of the main,

9
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:37.650
there was a couple of main issues.

10
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.600
One which is not quite as hot as it as it was a decade ago,

11
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.840
but it's teen sex and teen pregnancy as a both has an ethical moral issue.

12
00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:54.060
And as a practical economic issue about the children of,

13
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.440
of,
of teams,
how are they going to get supported and what does it do to poverty,

14
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.110
uh,
of the mother.
And you have some really good readings,
uh,
on those.

15
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.911
And the other one,

16
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:09.600
the other topic which will come next after this is abortion and we're gonna

17
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.370
spend two lectures on that.

18
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.400
It's going to be a nice long discussion of that cause that's,

19
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:16.140
that is really the hot topic.

20
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.000
So today is teen sexuality and teen pregnancy.

21
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.110
And just to start with some data and keep it local.

22
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.710
This is from the Hartford Current,
uh,

23
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.110
November last November of November 19th,

24
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.080
2008 and there's a national,
uh,

25
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.540
risks youth risk behavior survey and that monitors health risks among,

26
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.980
among high school kids,
ninth to 12th graders all over the United States.

27
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.840
So in Connecticut,

28
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.320
a 42.4% of the kids have had sexual intercourse of high school kids and it says

29
00:01:55.291 --> 00:01:59.100
31.8% are sexually active.
I don't know exactly what active means,

30
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:01.590
but I guess they're continuing.
They,
uh,

31
00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.150
there's a few percent that didn't like it or something.
Uh,

32
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.850
but there's quite a lot of both one time,

33
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.330
early sexuality and then a continuing a bout of it.

34
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.820
And as part of a problem that of those that are,
uh,

35
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.170
have had or are sexually active,

36
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.010
37.3% reported that they did not use any kind of protection at the last act of

37
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:31.530
intercourse.
And therefore they're at great risk for pregnancy.

38
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.510
And that's just real sexual intercourse.
Uh,

39
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.870
I guess as Bill Clinton to find session
and,
uh,

40
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.980
uh,
when you go to,
uh,
oral sex,

41
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:48.810
you get another set of numbers and,
uh,
oral sex,

42
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:51.660
as you may or may not know,
is become the big thing in America.

43
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.320
And one I'm sure that we don't really know the causes of it.

44
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:58.620
I'm not aware of any real academic literature on that.

45
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.140
But the fear of aids,
there is a perception which is true,

46
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:05.410
that oral sex is less likely to trend,
not zero likely,

47
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:09.860
but less likely to transmit aids.
And also because,
uh,

48
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.930
maybe,
I dunno how much you are aware of this,
but during the Bill Clinton trials,

49
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.120
the very conservative prosecutor,

50
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.680
Kenneth Starr was talking about oral sex all the time and everybody in America,

51
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.260
uh,
learned about it.
And then he sort of popularized it and has a,

52
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.350
as is often the case,
uh,

53
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.790
people that want to push society in this direction end up having pushed it in

54
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.140
exactly the opposite direction.

55
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.990
So a oral sex is alive and well in new haven.
And,
uh,

56
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.140
I sometimes teach teachers how to talk in their classes about the kinds of,

57
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:51.460
the kinds of population issues,
that kind of issues we talked about in the class.

58
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.580
And they give me a lot of information.
So,
uh,

59
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.900
one day I'm talking to these teachers and they say,
oh,

60
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:02.170
something interesting has happened in the school and the low one of the local

61
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:04.480
high schools,
uh,

62
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.610
a freshman girl and an older girlfriend rules caught in the stairwell providing

63
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:14.080
oral sex for a line of boys.
They were staying there waiting,

64
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.840
uh,

65
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.840
of few of them with their pants down and this girl was doing them one after the

66
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:25.180
other.
The new,
this is a freshman in the local high school.

67
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.980
The new haven register,
uh,
has a headline.

68
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.910
Teens turned to oral sex,
10th grade students.

69
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:35.260
So that's high school sophomores,

70
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.530
40% of the boys and girls reported they had engaged in oral sex in the last year

71
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.170
and about 25% that they had three or more different oral sex partners in the

72
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.510
previous year.
So,
uh,

73
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.770
sex among teenagers is alive and well as they say.

74
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.800
Now.
Uh,
some of my,
some,
here's your anecdote for today,

75
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.510
a teenager.
So Hartford as you know,
it a very bad,
a very,

76
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.710
a lot of poor people in Hartford,
let's just put it that way.
And uh,

77
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.290
planned parenthood has set up a clinic in the northeast,

78
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:16.070
part of Hartford were very poor part of Hartford.
And this is from one of the,

79
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.450
the,
the counselors,
they're a teenager,

80
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:24.190
teenage girl comes into the planned parenthood clinic there and says,

81
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.630
I'm pregnant.
And the counselor says,
oh,
how do you know that?

82
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.000
And she says,
Oh,
I know,
I know that I know exactly when I got pregnant.
Oh,

83
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.240
well I know that if you,
uh,

84
00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:41.170
only if your boyfriend comes only once,
you can't get pregnant,

85
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.930
but on such and such a day.
And she named the date.

86
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.030
We did it twice and I allowed him to come the second time and that's when I got

87
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:49.451
pregnant.

88
00:05:49.451 --> 00:05:53.830
I know that's when I got pregnant because she was of the belief that one time

89
00:05:53.831 --> 00:05:57.680
can do it,
but two times,
uh,
we'll,
well,

90
00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.510
they took the test and indeed she would.
Yes.
Yeah.

91
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.970
Okay.
Indeed she,
she took the test in deed,

92
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:08.420
she was pregnant but she had been pregnant like two months before she thought

93
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.930
she was watching him.
The chief had,
it had a completely wrong,

94
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:15.120
<v 1>oh my mother worked in the Health Service for the 70</v>

95
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.453
<v 0>shell shell.</v>

96
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.830
<v 1>My mother worked in the National Health Service Corps in the seven days.</v>

97
00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.780
I'm in rural Colorado and she get a 12 year old come in who was in labor.

98
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.603
She was pregnant.

99
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.380
<v 0>Did Not.
Yeah.
So that's,</v>

100
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.180
I don't know that your hurdle that or her mother worked in Colorado and a 12

101
00:06:33.181 --> 00:06:37.200
year old came in in labor and she didn't even know she was,
she was pregnant.

102
00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.480
So that's the story.
Colorado,
Hartford,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's all around.

103
00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.650
Uh,

104
00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:48.480
in 1999 which is sort of the peak of this concern about teenage pregnancy,

105
00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.830
450 Hartford teenagers,
uh,
gave birth.

106
00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.410
How many completed high school?

107
00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.390
332 girls graduated from Hartford city schools in,
in that same here.

108
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.220
So one third more girls became mothers then graduated from high school.

109
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.440
You can imagine this was considered a serious problem.
Now,

110
00:07:10.441 --> 00:07:13.410
what is this,
the,
the social,
the political,
the social,

111
00:07:13.411 --> 00:07:16.440
the school response to this problem?
Well,

112
00:07:16.441 --> 00:07:21.441
they're kind of hamstrung and a nurse practitioner at a Hartford School Clinic

113
00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.370
said that she's allowed to test and treat students for sexually transmitted

114
00:07:26.371 --> 00:07:30.450
diseases,
but you can do nothing about the possibility of pregnancy.

115
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.870
She may not prescribe birth control or even distribute condoms in the,

116
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:40.320
in the school.
And there was a proposal in the,

117
00:07:40.321 --> 00:07:42.030
in the city council,
uh,

118
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:47.460
to allow the schools to distribute condoms.
And it was roundly,

119
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.420
uh,
turned down.
And what is,
why is,

120
00:07:51.421 --> 00:07:53.070
what is the political concern here?

121
00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:57.420
The political concern is what you can see here

122
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.880
<v 1>that,
that</v>

123
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:06.800
<v 0>people who are opposed to,
uh,
providing,
uh,</v>

124
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:11.270
contraception for teenagers and including politics.
This is,
this is a,

125
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.980
an advocacy,
and this is not a,
not an academic sort of thing.
And,

126
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:21.070
but this is actually true that people believe that even discussing sex,

127
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:27.230
uh,
will tend to encourage it.
And certainly handing out a birth control,
uh,

128
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.580
will facilitate,
uh,
teenagers,
uh,
having sex.

129
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.250
So this is the political,
uh,
this is the,
uh,
the opinion,

130
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.550
the kind of attitude that that is opposed to it and why the Hartford school

131
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:44.290
system and many other school systems can't,
uh,
provide,
uh,

132
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:50.040
contraception.
So,
uh,
of course this gets discussed a lot and uh,

133
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.990
and,
and it's a topic of discussion,
not only for the team,
for the parents,

134
00:08:53.991 --> 00:08:55.160
but for the teenagers.

135
00:08:55.830 --> 00:09:00.830
And one nice quote from Mouritsen Lopez who's a Hartford public school high

136
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:04.410
school junior,
and she was already a mother,
uh,

137
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.230
and she dismissed this idea saying,

138
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.140
all the girls I know are sexually active,

139
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.930
most started in the sixth or seventh grade,

140
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.850
they're going to do it no matter what.

141
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:20.730
Now I experienced the same kind of attitude.
Um,
I was again,

142
00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:24.330
teaching the teachers,
sort of teacher training kind of stuff.

143
00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.610
And I was new at it and a little naive.

144
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.960
And this was Connecticut teachers all over the state.
And before I started said,

145
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:33.990
look,
you know,
we're going to discuss some pretty heavy heavy stuff here,

146
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:36.000
you know,
in the sex and everything.

147
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.120
And I don't know how much of this you can talk to your kids about.

148
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:44.830
They roared with laughter.
And what they all told me was all of our kids,
I,

149
00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.800
they,
they exaggerated and I'm sure it wasn't all,

150
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:50.040
but the way they express it with all of our kids are into sex already.

151
00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:53.020
I can say anything that I want this,

152
00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.560
there's nothing that they're going to be shocked by.

153
00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.910
Okay.
So,
uh,

154
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.770
some schools can do a decent proper sex education and some schools are not

155
00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:09.510
allowed to do proper sex education.
And the problem with,

156
00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:14.490
even in the schools where it's allowed is that it's often the choice of

157
00:10:14.491 --> 00:10:19.380
teachers.
It can be the health head teacher or something who may be a Jock,
uh,

158
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.590
that has said,
okay,
your job to teach sex education.

159
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.820
It's rarely that a teacher gets to volunteer that they survey all the teachers

160
00:10:26.821 --> 00:10:29.760
and say,
this is a tough,
tough job.
Who wants to do it?
No,

161
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:34.740
somebody gets assigned to do that.
And then you get that very often,
uh,

162
00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.390
the teacher herself may not approve of sex education,
uh,

163
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:42.780
for the children.
She may think it's not a proper topic for a school,

164
00:10:42.781 --> 00:10:45.780
for whatever grade she's supposed to teach it in.
She May,

165
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.400
and I say she had maybe she or he,

166
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:51.640
the teacher may be uncomfortable talking about sex.
Uh,

167
00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.980
may not be well educated on how to handle questions about sex or about

168
00:10:55.981 --> 00:10:59.930
contraception.
May also very likely now be afraid of,

169
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:04.380
of legal complications or disciplinary actions from the school if they handle it

170
00:11:04.381 --> 00:11:07.590
wrong and they say the wrong thing and parents start objecting,

171
00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:11.100
which certainly happens then it happens in Connecticut and I've been involved in

172
00:11:11.101 --> 00:11:14.070
some of that stuff.
Uh,

173
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.440
parents are parents coming in and screaming and yelling at them or,
or,
uh,

174
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.620
threatening to sue the teacher is happens.
In any case,

175
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.260
most sex education teachers,

176
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.590
as far as one has data which was very skinny.
Uh,
the,

177
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.200
the teaching of this subject is just not coming from person's guts.
They're,

178
00:11:34.201 --> 00:11:36.240
they're fulfilling.
A curriculum was assignment.

179
00:11:36.241 --> 00:11:38.370
It's something that they're assigned to do.

180
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:44.010
And if in something of this nature,
the teacher is not really,

181
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.480
there's not coming from her from her soul,
then it's,
it's a,

182
00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:50.340
it's a guarantee for an unsuccessful program.

183
00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.500
And we've seen things like this before.

184
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.470
Remember when we talked about the family planning program in Pakistan and

185
00:11:56.471 --> 00:12:00.610
Bangladesh?
They started with the diease when,
when it was one country,

186
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:01.540
one is Pakistan,

187
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.380
and the days where the traditional birth attendants who themselves were not

188
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:08.560
using contraception,
didn't believe in it,
didn't know anything about it,

189
00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:12.190
and could make more money doing attending births.

190
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:17.490
So the program was a complete failure until they changed and started hiring

191
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:23.230
women who themselves were using contraception or several high status and really

192
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:26.080
approved of it.
And then the program became a great success.

193
00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:27.910
So you have to have consistency.
If you,

194
00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:30.190
if you make a law or try to have a policy,

195
00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.200
the people that are supposed to carry out the policy most want to do that.

196
00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.940
If they don't really want to do that,

197
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:41.680
whatever your policy is in any area of activity,
it's not going to work.

198
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.883
<v 2>Okay?</v>

199
00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:47.561
<v 0>Okay.
Now,</v>

200
00:12:47.561 --> 00:12:51.880
this doesn't mean that it's necessarily terribly difficult to be effective with

201
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:55.570
sex education.
Uh,
planned parenthood for instance,

202
00:12:55.571 --> 00:12:59.960
I use them an example because I know about them.
Uh,
they do a lot of uh,

203
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.580
sex education for the schools and often with the school is uncomfortable doing

204
00:13:03.581 --> 00:13:06.610
it or it doesn't have anybody that they think wants to do it or is qualified to

205
00:13:06.611 --> 00:13:07.240
do it.

206
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.840
They will call in a planned parenthood or we're one of a number of other kinds

207
00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:14.470
of organizations.
And planned parenthood has flexibility to hire people.

208
00:13:14.471 --> 00:13:18.070
They don't have licensing and so forth with climate who are really committed to

209
00:13:18.071 --> 00:13:19.660
this kind of thing.

210
00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:23.210
So they did what they call a seminar for high school students.
Uh,

211
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:29.050
again in Connecticut here I think it was also Hartford and they got a letter

212
00:13:29.051 --> 00:13:33.730
back from one of the students.
Hello,
my name is Kelly and I was in your seminar.

213
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:38.170
I would like to thank you for making me aware of some of the consequences of sex

214
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.880
because of your seminar.

215
00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:44.020
I got the courage to ask my mother for birth control before something happened

216
00:13:44.021 --> 00:13:46.000
that I would regret for the rest of my life.

217
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.440
I also got the courage to ask my boyfriend to use a condom instead of nothing.

218
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.760
Thank you so much.
You've really honestly changed my life.

219
00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:58.900
I guess when the Info doesn't come from the teacher,
it actually hits home.

220
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.320
Thank you,
Kelly.
Now this is a teenager,
teenagers letter and it's,

221
00:14:03.321 --> 00:14:06.670
it's one anecdote,
so you can't make an awful lot out of it,

222
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.000
but you have to think a little bit.
She says,
uh,

223
00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.230
making me aware of some of the consequences of sex.
Well,
you know,

224
00:14:14.231 --> 00:14:17.290
do you think she really didn't know the get pregnant from sex that you can get

225
00:14:17.291 --> 00:14:20.740
diseases?
No.
She all knew that,
that she had missed,

226
00:14:20.741 --> 00:14:23.170
identified what was going on.
I don't,

227
00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:26.110
I doubt I'd be flabbergasted if she didn't,
uh,

228
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.480
know that by the time she's in high school.

229
00:14:28.481 --> 00:14:30.820
What do you think you've been more recently a high school doing all the kids

230
00:14:30.821 --> 00:14:32.320
know that you get pregnant from sex.

231
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:33.990
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

232
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:37.350
<v 0>Yeah.
And all know they can get an STD from Sachs.</v>

233
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.960
I'm not so sure.
All right man.
Maybe Kelly was,
maybe I'm wrong.

234
00:14:42.961 --> 00:14:46.040
And Kelly Kelly was right.
I don't know.
Um,

235
00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:49.290
but the thing is,
it's all the way it's presented.

236
00:14:49.291 --> 00:14:51.980
It's presented by someone that really cares it and wants to do it.

237
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.000
There's just a whole different atmosphere and,
and,

238
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.200
and kids' minds open up to this kind of thing.

239
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.830
Anyway.
Uh,
America is generally,
uh,

240
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.830
in a mess with respect to sex,
education and sex and generally,

241
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:12.140
and it's quite different than European countries.

242
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:17.320
So here is a typical graph that is presented frequently in this shows the number

243
00:15:19.011 --> 00:15:22.680
of children born to teenagers.
This is it.
And again,
at the peak of,

244
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.030
of the problem,
and he has France,
he is Germany,
his Japan,
his Great Britain.

245
00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:29.900
OOPS is United States.

246
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.140
Ah,
perfect.

247
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:36.080
That was the next question and I'm glad one of you caught it right away.

248
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.630
This isn't,
this is again,

249
00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:44.300
they usually presented like this.
It's an advocacy thing.
It wants to scare you.

250
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:49.040
It wants to show you how much worse the United States is than everybody else.

251
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:51.260
But as we just got told,

252
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.520
Nancy has a much larger population than any of these places.

253
00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:58.730
So this is not really a legitimate way of presenting the data.

254
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.390
So of course you dutiful teacher,
uh,
re did it.

255
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:08.050
And here is when you divide out by population and you see it's not as severe as

256
00:16:09.681 --> 00:16:11.360
the illegitimate graph,
but it's still,

257
00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:15.710
the United States is still more than twice has more than twice the percentage

258
00:16:15.711 --> 00:16:18.560
problem.
Any of us,
it's still serious.
So in fact,

259
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:23.000
they didn't have to do use the improper data.

260
00:16:23.001 --> 00:16:26.560
They could have used data like this and it's still the PR,
the problem,
uh,

261
00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:31.460
becomes very clear.
So,
uh,

262
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.640
from a lot of studies of these kinds of things,

263
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.590
it turns out countries that have a very liberal attitude toward sexuality have

264
00:16:39.591 --> 00:16:43.760
the lowest teen birth rates,

265
00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:48.740
teen pregnancy rates,
and a place like Netherland,

266
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.280
it's probably in the West under either Denmark or Sweden or Netherlands is

267
00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:54.200
probably the most liberal.

268
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.930
And in those countries it's considered a perfectly normal part of,

269
00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.450
of teenage experience.

270
00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:04.700
And the teenagers are ex are expected and encouraged to bring their girlfriend

271
00:17:04.701 --> 00:17:06.700
or boyfriend home.
And,
and,

272
00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:11.330
and sleeping in the same room that is maybe starting to happen in America under

273
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.220
how many,
how many of your parents would allow that?
Phew.
All right,

274
00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:21.610
we're going to,
she's married.
Um,

275
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.810
okay.
So in,
in the Netherlands,
uh,
we,

276
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:30.350
the US rate is 54 per thousand teens,
about one out of 20 each year.

277
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.720
And Netherlands vigorous seven.
So eight times eight,
nine,
eight times lower.

278
00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:40.100
So it's a,
it's a huge difference depending on the,
the country attitude.

279
00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:46.370
So in academically discussing this,
uh,
things get terribly mixed up.

280
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.593
Uh,

281
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:52.630
there is a bunch of issues which usually people don't separate out what is teen

282
00:17:53.311 --> 00:17:54.144
pregnancy.

283
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.690
And that's very different than teen or can be different than teen child bearing.

284
00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.240
Cause not all of those pregnancies come to borough.

285
00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.940
There's teen sex and you have sex,

286
00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:05.850
you might get pregnant and if you get pregnant you might actually have a live

287
00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:09.760
birth.
So there's three different steps and when you're looking at statistics,
uh,

288
00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:14.760
you have to separate those,
the hose and another is,
uh,

289
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:20.300
the whole idea of out of wedlock births that births born to mothers that are not

290
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:24.540
married.
And then you could go bind or pregnancies.

291
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:25.920
You combine those two.

292
00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:31.190
So two out of wedlock teen pregnancies and when you read discussions of this,

293
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:36.750
try to figure out what their talk,
which of these problems they're talking about,

294
00:18:36.751 --> 00:18:40.170
it's often not made a very clear,
but it's very important to,

295
00:18:40.171 --> 00:18:44.910
to keep it straight and all.
I'll try to
talk about these different things,

296
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.440
uh,
and make it clear.

297
00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:51.480
So when you discuss this,
so,

298
00:18:51.481 --> 00:18:54.930
so one issue is your,
what is,
what is it?

299
00:18:54.931 --> 00:18:56.980
Statistics you're looking at referred to.

300
00:18:56.981 --> 00:19:00.480
And I hope I've always been clear in these slides.
The other,

301
00:19:00.481 --> 00:19:05.010
when you go across nationally,
like to other countries and uh,

302
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:10.860
it's not always clear what marriage means.
Uh,
so,
uh,

303
00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.430
in other culture in,
in the,
in the west and in general,

304
00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:19.431
the United States in particular a marriage is a legal statement and it's an all

305
00:19:19.471 --> 00:19:20.850
or nothing sort of thing.

306
00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:24.240
You either have a marriage certificate and you aren't married or you don't have

307
00:19:24.241 --> 00:19:26.130
a marriage certificate and you're not married.

308
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.560
And if you have one and you get divorced,

309
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:32.460
then you in principle don't have one anymore.
It's an honor off kind of thing.

310
00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:36.510
Everyone really knows whether they are married or,
or they are not married.

311
00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:40.710
In other cultures.
Marriage is quite variable.
Uh,

312
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.180
it's a stage thing and it may have various steps in the match.

313
00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:46.261
So for instance,

314
00:19:46.261 --> 00:19:51.000
in Nigeria among the Fulani a circle at circumcision,

315
00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:56.090
a boy whose aged seven to 10 at this time is then be trolls to an infant girl.

316
00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:01.260
And sometimes patrolled is translated as married to,
uh,

317
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:03.870
when the,
when the future has,

318
00:20:03.871 --> 00:20:08.871
but they don't live together when the future husband's father learns from the

319
00:20:09.721 --> 00:20:14.580
girl's parents who are living separately that she has begun menstruation and is,

320
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.370
and then is believed to be capable of childbirth.

321
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:21.630
The grill then moves into her husband's,
uh,
her future husband's compound.

322
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:26.940
So there's still patrolled,
she's now mentoring.
So she moves in with the husband.

323
00:20:26.941 --> 00:20:31.380
It's still the future husband and she's treated as a daughter of the husband's

324
00:20:31.381 --> 00:20:36.000
father's household.
She's treated like a sister,
uh,
of the boy,

325
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:38.430
the boy and girl sleep together.

326
00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.780
They have sex in the open and the boy is usually in this culture.
It's,
it's a,

327
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.710
it's a hurting culture.
They sleep outside near the corral to guard the,

328
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.580
the cattle against the Raiders and Wilson,

329
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:56.740
whatever kind of Predator animals they have there.
And this all done,
of course,

330
00:20:56.741 --> 00:20:57.574
very openly,

331
00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:02.790
but they still have the status of an unmarried youth and a maiden were his

332
00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:05.320
major,
not a virgin anymore,
but she's,
she's a maiden.

333
00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:08.050
When the girl becomes pregnant,

334
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:13.080
she moves back to her father's household and she stays in there for three wet

335
00:21:13.091 --> 00:21:16.930
seasons and they have wet and dry seasons there.

336
00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.630
So it's a geological climatological thing.

337
00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.050
And that takes two to two and a half years depending on when,
when,

338
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:27.430
when they've started and then she returns to the boy and only then are they

339
00:21:27.431 --> 00:21:28.600
considered married.

340
00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.280
So there's so many different steps and then they're officially married.

341
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:38.500
And so using our definition of marriage,

342
00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:43.060
applying to the Fulani since they always had that first child and until it's two

343
00:21:43.061 --> 00:21:45.910
or three when they're not married,

344
00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:51.130
basically all Fulani first births are illegitimate births by our accounting of

345
00:21:51.341 --> 00:21:54.910
it,
among the Dogan people,

346
00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.070
which is Mali and Burkina Faso.

347
00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:01.000
A girl doesn't move into her spouse's home until the birth of the second or even

348
00:22:01.001 --> 00:22:04.060
the third child.
Uh,

349
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.300
speaking of that in,
in suite,

350
00:22:07.301 --> 00:22:12.130
I lived in Sweden and we have a guest whose son is in Sweden.
When I was there,

351
00:22:12.131 --> 00:22:12.461
the,

352
00:22:12.461 --> 00:22:17.170
the tradition was building up that you get married on the birth of your second

353
00:22:17.171 --> 00:22:20.340
child.
And she is that,
that's still happening or

354
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.290
her own her own son.
But that's because he's a foreigner

355
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.740
in China.
They have,
uh,
an interesting,
uh,

356
00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:36.780
systems in the old days and some places that I don't think I described where

357
00:22:37.061 --> 00:22:42.061
they have child marriage and they married a boy to an older girl and the older

358
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:46.680
girl then acts as a kind of nanny and takes care of the boy,
uh,

359
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.420
until they grow up.
But they're,
they're,
they're legally married,
but he's,
uh,

360
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:54.340
he's five years old or something and she takes care of them until he becomes,

361
00:22:54.341 --> 00:22:58.870
she's a surrogate mother until he,
uh,
become sexually mature.

362
00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.860
And one of the explanations for the low rate of Chinese fertility within

363
00:23:02.861 --> 00:23:07.660
marriage is that a boys rarely have sexual interest in their sisters.

364
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:12.400
I mean at least not for long.
And so this kid grows up and this girl,

365
00:23:12.401 --> 00:23:15.070
older girls been taking care of him and by the time they get married,

366
00:23:15.071 --> 00:23:16.990
there's no sexual interest hardly at all.

367
00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:20.530
So the rate of intercourse is very low in the birth rate is very low.
And we,

368
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:23.140
we talked quite a bit about that

369
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.810
also in traditional China that men can take,

370
00:23:28.811 --> 00:23:33.640
many wives and men can take concubines and they can take slaves.

371
00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:38.620
And the distinction among all these categories is not very clear since marriage

372
00:23:38.621 --> 00:23:40.570
is usually not a government function,

373
00:23:40.571 --> 00:23:45.571
but they go to the local Buddhist shrine and do a variety or shrine and do a

374
00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:49.010
variety of different practices depending on the women.

375
00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.610
One of the most common ways.
So the,
the marriage,
the first,

376
00:23:52.611 --> 00:23:57.320
there will be often a first wife,
not necessarily the first,
uh,

377
00:23:57.590 --> 00:24:00.950
woman that's taken into the household for Lou sexual relations with the husband,

378
00:24:00.951 --> 00:24:03.710
but what's called the first wife.
And she will be prominent.

379
00:24:03.711 --> 00:24:07.190
And then there'll be all kinds of,
depending on how rich the person is,

380
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:08.630
variety of other women.

381
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:13.900
And apparently one of the frequent things is that this,

382
00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.180
the,
the degree of importance of the marriage,

383
00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.880
it depends on how public the ceremony was.

384
00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:25.480
If there's a big public ceremony with lots of relatives and neighbors invited,

385
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:28.850
then it's very clear.
This is a very clear,

386
00:24:28.851 --> 00:24:33.440
this is what we would call him a marriage.
Uh,
other cases a,

387
00:24:33.441 --> 00:24:36.530
a woman has just taken in the middle of the night and brought in the house and

388
00:24:36.531 --> 00:24:39.270
there's never anything public done or what's whatsoever.

389
00:24:39.271 --> 00:24:43.010
And she lives there as well as a sexual partner for the husband.

390
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.080
And you can call it Mary to call it not married.

391
00:24:45.081 --> 00:24:48.430
She lives in the house probably till she dies,
uh,

392
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:54.500
with that.
So,
uh,
this marriage again,

393
00:24:54.501 --> 00:24:58.220
is not an all or nothing kind of thing.
Uh,
it,
uh,

394
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.550
we'll start out with different levels of status and then during the course of

395
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:03.200
the marriage,
the status can change.

396
00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:06.860
The husband may become enamored of the wife and live in various ways,

397
00:25:06.861 --> 00:25:10.670
race or status or degrade her status and so forth.

398
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.520
Now in poorer communities,

399
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:19.070
everywhere you read about this in Brazil and in among poor people in the United

400
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.370
States,

401
00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:24.370
a formal marriage is sort of almost disappeared and it's replaced by various

402
00:25:24.591 --> 00:25:29.450
informal unions.
And in these informal unions where there's no,
uh,

403
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.460
no legal status whatsoever.
No,

404
00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:37.440
the word marriages is just not used.
Uh,
the related,

405
00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.610
the state of the relationship between the man and the woman is sort of

406
00:25:40.611 --> 00:25:45.470
negotiated daily.
I mean,
it can,
it can,
it can change all the time,

407
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.310
uh,
that it's not,
again,
not a fixed thing,

408
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.800
but very floating kind of relationship.

409
00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:55.000
Even in the United States of,

410
00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:58.520
of course a marriage is not a uniform legal situation.

411
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Each marriage as a state law,
it's not a federal,

412
00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.210
you don't get married in a federal situation,
get married in a state situation.

413
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.780
So there's 50 different,
uh,
situations all together.

414
00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:14.200
Then we have a prenuptial agreements which are arranged the financial

415
00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:19.100
relationship between the man and his wife or vice versa.

416
00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:23.630
And so that it can be different in other places,

417
00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:27.710
even more issues than just financial are arranged by private contract.

418
00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:28.670
It's not set by law,

419
00:26:28.671 --> 00:26:32.660
but by private contract between the marrying parties are more likely between the

420
00:26:32.661 --> 00:26:37.190
marrying,
uh,
uh,
families.
And so,
uh,

421
00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:41.330
a friend of mine daughter went to a college,
uh,

422
00:26:41.450 --> 00:26:44.840
in Egypt going to the American University Cairo.
Uh,

423
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.060
I was going to say fell in love with an Egyptian guy.
I don't know they had sex,

424
00:26:48.061 --> 00:26:51.230
I don't know what they come up or not,
but she,

425
00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:55.050
she got pregnant in the girl decided to get married.
Uh,

426
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.380
the parents were divorced and the girl's father went and have nothing to do with

427
00:26:58.381 --> 00:27:00.470
it.
So there was the mother,
uh,

428
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.140
had to do something about it and she was opposed to marriage,

429
00:27:04.141 --> 00:27:07.890
but the girl didn't listen.
So they're going to go ahead with the marriage.

430
00:27:07.891 --> 00:27:11.220
Now in Egypt at that time,

431
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.360
you have to have a marriage contract and that specifies,
uh,

432
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.050
all kinds of rights that the woman has.

433
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.790
What rights does she have in her children without that specified marriage

434
00:27:23.791 --> 00:27:26.370
contract?
They are totally the husband.
There's any divorce or anything.

435
00:27:26.371 --> 00:27:29.340
The husband gets them.
There's no,
no legal case whatsoever.

436
00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:34.080
What her are her rights to travel.
Can She,
can she traveled by herself?

437
00:27:34.081 --> 00:27:36.720
Can she go abroad?
Can she traveled around Egypt by herself?

438
00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:38.670
What her rights to residents,

439
00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.730
what are her rights to child custody and so forth.

440
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.660
So all of this had to be specified and there was no husbands do it.

441
00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:49.210
So guess who played,
uh,
played a Versailles.

442
00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.850
I played the role of the,
of the father and,

443
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:56.430
and help negotiate this thing is very interesting.

444
00:27:57.780 --> 00:28:02.180
And uh,
so each marriage means something different in,

445
00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:07.290
in many places.
And you can see that in the DHS surveys,

446
00:28:07.291 --> 00:28:08.880
the demographic and health surveys that have shown you,

447
00:28:08.881 --> 00:28:10.230
it never uses the word marriage.

448
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:14.610
It says in union that because marriage is sort of a means,

449
00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:18.120
so many different things are means nothing at all.

450
00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:25.010
Now it's often perceived that a teenage pregnancy and related social problems

451
00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.880
are,
are,

452
00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:30.660
are from graphs like that or are either uniquely American,

453
00:28:30.661 --> 00:28:35.550
are more extreme in America.
Uh,
but it's not the case.
Uh,

454
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.110
for instance,
in Japan of women who were teenagers,
that their first birth,

455
00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:45.380
82% became pregnant before marrying of women age 20 to 24,

456
00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.910
58% became pregnant before marrying.
And if all women,

457
00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:55.530
26% became pregnant before marrying.
In other words,

458
00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:59.820
uh,
if a Japanese woman got pregnant before her late twenties,

459
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.260
she was probably unmarried at the time that she got pregnant.

460
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:09.200
And these numbers are uh,
uh,

461
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.610
well our numbers that have actual have live births.

462
00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.040
And as you'll see in the next lecture,

463
00:29:17.041 --> 00:29:21.090
Japan is an extremely high rate of abortion.
So these numbers are way,

464
00:29:21.091 --> 00:29:25.930
these are the women who carry the birth determine probably at least these are

465
00:29:25.931 --> 00:29:30.390
our underestimates by a factor of have to,
because this doesn't take in account,

466
00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:35.160
uh,
abortion.
So I've assigned you reading that,

467
00:29:35.161 --> 00:29:38.880
discusses this issue from a whole variety of perspectives.

468
00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.760
And if it's,
I don't have to tell you what it is because you'll,

469
00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:47.570
you'll do the reading.
So a little bit of the biology,

470
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.200
biological background to these issues.

471
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.780
And some of this I don't have to tell you about,

472
00:29:52.781 --> 00:29:54.940
cause you were teenagers yourself very recently.

473
00:29:55.570 --> 00:30:00.570
So several things happen at puberty and they're tremendous physical changes.

474
00:30:01.421 --> 00:30:04.570
You've noticed this,
there are tremendous physiological changes.

475
00:30:04.571 --> 00:30:08.770
I'm sure you've noticed that.
And they're even tremendous emotional changes,

476
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.820
which of course you guys wouldn't know anything about cause you've,

477
00:30:10.821 --> 00:30:13.990
you've been studying too hard,
pay any attention to this.

478
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.340
So evolution,
uh,

479
00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:21.540
has clearly designed to have this incredible eruption of the ability to get

480
00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:23.950
infatuated to form,
loved,

481
00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:28.210
have sexual emotions and all comes on like a ton of bricks at puberty.

482
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:30.580
This is not by chance.
This is not my culture.

483
00:30:30.581 --> 00:30:34.330
This is straight old mother evolution and doing these things to you.

484
00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.150
Um,
and simultaneously with this,
especially on males,

485
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:44.410
there's an eruption but it's not absent.
And females,
uh,
uh,

486
00:30:44.411 --> 00:30:47.950
great eruption of revolt against parental authority.
You know,

487
00:30:47.951 --> 00:30:51.790
you're a little kid,
you whatever mommy says,
more or less when you're a teenager,

488
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.420
no,
no,
go.
This competitiveness,

489
00:30:55.421 --> 00:31:00.421
this aggressiveness as violence onsets at puberty and all of this is to set a

490
00:31:01.571 --> 00:31:03.850
place in the dominance hierarchy.

491
00:31:05.290 --> 00:31:07.480
And of course we are in the west,

492
00:31:07.481 --> 00:31:11.470
well aware of these incredible emotional outbursts.

493
00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.140
And there's tons of literature about this,

494
00:31:14.141 --> 00:31:16.300
of which probably most same as Romeo and Juliet.

495
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.520
So anybody taking a Shakespeare class,

496
00:31:18.521 --> 00:31:23.090
how old the Romeo and Juliet supposed to be,
13,
14,
some,

497
00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:24.640
something like that.

498
00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:28.750
And what did their great overpowering love caused them to do?

499
00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.740
They killed themselves over it very purposely.

500
00:31:32.741 --> 00:31:37.150
They could not live without the other,
with their partner.

501
00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:41.170
So this emotion is,
is extraordinarily strong,

502
00:31:41.171 --> 00:31:44.500
even stronger than the desire to have life.

503
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:46.563
Now,

504
00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:52.500
adolescent sexuality is more or less disruptive depending a lot on the culture.

505
00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:57.490
And probably the one most important variable is how much teen sexuality is

506
00:31:57.491 --> 00:32:00.850
allowed that do,
does one have an outlet for these emotions?

507
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.830
If the culture allows an outlet,
uh,
in one a variety of ways,

508
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:10.660
uh,
then it probably easier for the adolescent to accommodate this.

509
00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:15.070
If like our culture in principle,
we're not supposed to have an outlet for this,

510
00:32:15.071 --> 00:32:19.180
then the tensions build up and strange things happen.

511
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.510
So,
um,

512
00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:28.240
different societies handle adolescent sexuality very different.
Uh,

513
00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:33.330
you read the Umayyad story about the Egyptian woman and uh,

514
00:32:33.670 --> 00:32:37.750
that is one way in which traditional societies handled sex.

515
00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:41.870
And you remember her sexual initiation began very early.

516
00:32:41.871 --> 00:32:45.510
It began before puberty,
if you remember that,
uh,

517
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:49.490
it was introduced with what she perceived to be a fair amount of violence member

518
00:32:49.491 --> 00:32:53.250
on her wedding night.
She had no clue what was going on and the women come and,

519
00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:58.580
and,
and investigate her,
uh,
before the marriage ceremony.

520
00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:02.930
And it must be an extremely,
uh,
scary business.

521
00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:06.800
And even before that,
you know,
the women in Egypt,
all those,
well,

522
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.970
that was only one woman you're read about.
They all had clutter.

523
00:33:08.971 --> 00:33:11.360
Ectomies which again,
he read out there.

524
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:15.740
So there's a lot of violence involved in teenage sexuality,

525
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.720
a lot of places,
and it's a moderately common,

526
00:33:20.721 --> 00:33:22.100
at least in traditional times,

527
00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:27.350
that marriage and first intercourse precedes puberty in Iran.

528
00:33:27.351 --> 00:33:29.000
For instance,
a few years ago,

529
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:33.140
Iran raised to legal age of marriage to the age of nine.

530
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:37.490
I may have mentioned this in a previous lecture and the Conservatives were very

531
00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:40.760
upset about this and they were opposed to this because they considered that that

532
00:33:40.761 --> 00:33:45.230
raising of the marriage age be much too liberal for Iranian society.

533
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:50.920
And the reason that they chose the age of nine was that Mohammed married his

534
00:33:51.171 --> 00:33:55.970
favorite wife,
his second wife,
Iyisha,
uh,
when she was nine.
But again,

535
00:33:56.420 --> 00:34:01.370
again,
warn you that getting married doesn't necessarily mean the onset of sexual

536
00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.340
intercourse.
You don't have any idea of what happened there.

537
00:34:04.341 --> 00:34:08.660
But getting married like the five year old boys and China getting Mac does not.

538
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:12.380
You don't know what that means with respect to,
uh,
to sex,

539
00:34:12.410 --> 00:34:17.150
just that a contract has been decided upon and at some stage,
uh,
sex will,

540
00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:19.040
will take place between the two.

541
00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:24.820
So with respect to this,
uh,
this,
this bill,
uh,

542
00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:29.870
parliament actually passed it oh,
later on.
And they did raise it to nine.

543
00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:33.500
And then a further bill came in to raise the age from nine to 13,

544
00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:36.020
but that was blocked by the Guardian counsel,

545
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:39.270
which is the conservative religious body.
Uh,

546
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:43.220
and they thought that since Mohammed got married at nine,
that you couldn't,

547
00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:45.980
you couldn't do anything different than that.

548
00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:52.580
Now in many parts of the world until very recently,

549
00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:56.630
I have a girl got into her late teens or certainly early twenties,

550
00:34:56.631 --> 00:34:57.860
without being married.

551
00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.940
It was considered a disaster that then she was here by 20.

552
00:35:01.941 --> 00:35:06.500
He's much too old and she would never get mad.
She'd be a spinster for the rest

553
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:10.850
of her life.
And

554
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.930
so these cultures had,

555
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.220
most traditional cultures have various prescriptions,
uh,

556
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:24.230
against premarital sex,
um,
sex before marriage.

557
00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.800
And this has several very important functions.

558
00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:30.410
One is to ensure the paternity.
If,
if you're,

559
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:32.360
if you're married and you had pregnant,

560
00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:38.220
the society can be pretty sure over at least can assume legally that the father

561
00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:38.821
that you invent,

562
00:35:38.821 --> 00:35:43.350
they know the father and therefore the economic responsibility for the child is

563
00:35:43.351 --> 00:35:43.951
very clear.

564
00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:48.951
That's one of the reasons to have a fixed a fixed legal status of marriage.

565
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:54.090
Uh,
and back then,
marriage and puberty,

566
00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.980
we're essentially the same,
uh,
prepubescent girls.
We're all,
uh,

567
00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:02.700
uh,
post pubescent girls.
They got married at puberty and that's it.

568
00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:06.870
So a lot of these languages don't have words that the symmetry maiden in the

569
00:36:06.871 --> 00:36:10.770
sense of a young girl and virgin in the sense of a girl who's not had sex.

570
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.790
And there's a large theological discussion in the Bible when,

571
00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:18.040
you know Mary Virgin Mary was,
was she a maiden or a virgin?

572
00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:23.040
And the language maybe doesn't distinguish between these two kinds of things.

573
00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:25.710
Another,

574
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:30.710
a prohibition against Fremantle sick since puberty and marriage are often very

575
00:36:30.901 --> 00:36:32.220
tightly tied,

576
00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:37.730
that the prohibition against premarital sex was really intended in many cases to

577
00:36:39.151 --> 00:36:44.070
protect girls from pre pubertal sex.
So what,

578
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:49.190
what was had originally that that goal deal with pre prebuttal sex,

579
00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:54.360
if you retained the legal aspect of it till the women are much later,

580
00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:59.190
it doesn't anymore have that kind of kind of function.
What's whatsoever.

581
00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:05.420
So,
uh,
teenage,
uh,
married,
uh,

582
00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:10.290
teenage child bearing was very common.
Illegitimacy,
uh,
was very common.

583
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:15.770
So the earliest records we have are from the 16 hundreds and the Chesapeake Bay

584
00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:21.670
colony.
And in way back then,
uh,

585
00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.370
guess what fraction of,
uh,

586
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:27.870
women were pregnant when they got married of married women.

587
00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:29.010
What fraction were pregnant?

588
00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:35.650
Make your guest 16 hundreds Chesapeake Bay colony,
what?

589
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:37.910
30 30%,

590
00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:41.750
which is very much similar to the numbers that we've had until recently.

591
00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:45.460
It's just seems to be almost a constant.
And the,

592
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:47.490
they have fairly decent records,
uh,

593
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:51.230
through American history and a lot of other histories and the rates of

594
00:37:51.231 --> 00:37:53.510
premarital pregnancy seem to go up and down.

595
00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:58.840
And this can be large increases in the late 16 hundreds and around 1725,

596
00:37:59.061 --> 00:38:01.760
two of the earliest booms of premarital pregnancy.

597
00:38:01.761 --> 00:38:04.640
And I don't have any idea what the costs of those are,

598
00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.390
but you can go to our professor of colonial history and try to find out.

599
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:12.920
So how are these,
why are these not a social problem,

600
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:16.910
these premarital pregnancies?
Because what happened then

601
00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:22.370
they got married and those kinds of marriages are cold

602
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:28.250
shotgun weddings and have you all not heard that word?
Shotgun weddings.

603
00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:33.590
You get pregnant first,
then the in principle though,
the image comes from the,

604
00:38:33.591 --> 00:38:36.710
the girl's father and you can a shotgun say you're gonna man,

605
00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:41.500
my daughter aren't you?
But those are standardly cold shotgun weddings.

606
00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:46.270
And I think I've mentioned to you that if the Mother didn't get married either

607
00:38:46.271 --> 00:38:49.150
because of her and willingness or the guys unwillingness,

608
00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.840
then she had a real problem.
Because as I said in the Anglo American tradition,

609
00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.660
he was not the family that had responsibility.

610
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:59.860
The village had responsibility for the young child to,

611
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.500
to both the mother and the child had had a support it.

612
00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:07.260
And for all these villages living on the edge of subsistence,
this was not a,

613
00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:10.830
this is a very big burden.
So,
uh,
I,

614
00:39:10.831 --> 00:39:14.050
I think I mentioned this to the stories of pregnant women being chased from

615
00:39:14.051 --> 00:39:17.740
village to village so that they would not have the child in the village cause

616
00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:22.660
then ever thereafter that child is the responsibility of the village.

617
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:30.010
Another thing to keep in mind that we talk now a lot about a single parent

618
00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:33.640
families and what a bad problem this is.

619
00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.740
It turns out that the prevalence of single parent families has always been very

620
00:39:38.741 --> 00:39:43.030
high.
So in the 17 hundreds,

621
00:39:43.330 --> 00:39:46.720
for instance,
uh,
there's a quote from a history book,

622
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:51.640
one of the main characteristics of European urban households in the 18th century

623
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:56.830
was the large proportion that were headed by women in ramps in under the

624
00:39:56.831 --> 00:39:59.890
Alzheimer's gene before the,
in France,
before the French revolution,

625
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:03.630
one out of four,
uh,
homes,
uh,

626
00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:09.020
were headed by women and 15 to 25% of all the towns for which they have a data

627
00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.810
in this and

628
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:21.070
in the u s the prevalence.

629
00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:25.940
So the big divorce boom came in after the fifties in,
in America.
Uh,

630
00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:31.180
but it turns out that the prevalence of single parent households at the end of

631
00:40:31.271 --> 00:40:34.600
the 20th century was almost identical to that at the beginning of the 20th

632
00:40:34.601 --> 00:40:38.920
century.
But what was the difference at the beginning of this?

633
00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:42.130
At the end of the century,
single parent households were caused by

634
00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:47.240
either lack of marriage or divorce,

635
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:52.280
but at the beginning of the century,
death,
death of one of the parents.

636
00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.670
So what has happened is that managers

637
00:40:57.410 --> 00:41:01.220
on average didn't last very long in traditional time because one of the parents

638
00:41:01.221 --> 00:41:03.470
would die.
Death was the death rates were so high.

639
00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:07.670
So they coped with single parent families because of death.

640
00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:12.230
And now people psychologically apparently are not attuned to staying together

641
00:41:12.231 --> 00:41:14.150
for a long time.
So even getting married in the first place.

642
00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:18.890
So now that situation has changed so that now what sort of voluntary single

643
00:41:18.891 --> 00:41:23.360
parent families,
but the numbers are probably didn't have changed very little,

644
00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:28.010
little bit.
Um,
okay.

645
00:41:28.011 --> 00:41:30.820
So it's another one of these things that I've talked about in,

646
00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:34.580
in history where things change from outside of human control,

647
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:35.810
like whether you're married or not,

648
00:41:35.811 --> 00:41:39.800
where they're going to be a single parent outside of human control is brought

649
00:41:39.801 --> 00:41:43.910
into human control.
It's in some sense into human choice.

650
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.633
<v 3>Uh,</v>

651
00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:53.710
<v 0>so what has changed in the modern west with respect to all this and is now</v>

652
00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:54.730
spreading everywhere,

653
00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:58.450
is that children are not supposed to get married as teenagers.

654
00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:00.850
Probably if you had gotten married in high school,

655
00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:05.530
and probably every single one of your parents would have really been very upset

656
00:42:05.531 --> 00:42:09.700
by that,
because in the old and the,
the essence has to do with education.

657
00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:12.010
Then in the old days,
you were a peasant.

658
00:42:12.011 --> 00:42:15.430
You were a farmer and things were done the way they had always been done.

659
00:42:15.431 --> 00:42:17.830
And the little kids starting at age five,
six,
seven,

660
00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.380
started going into the fields with his,
his mother,

661
00:42:20.381 --> 00:42:24.010
his father or both of them and,
and watching how the farming is done.

662
00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:26.980
And by the time,
uh,
he was a teenager,

663
00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:30.430
he'd probably learn how you do things because it's done.
Traditionally,

664
00:42:30.431 --> 00:42:33.670
there was no,
no science to it.
There's no pontification,

665
00:42:33.671 --> 00:42:36.250
no arithmetic involvement.
This is the way you did it.

666
00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:39.160
When the moon is at such and such a phase after this,

667
00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:43.090
you start planting and so forth and so on.
And you learn all that.

668
00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.510
And so there was no need for the,

669
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.050
and no economic need to have a lot of education.
Now,
of course,

670
00:42:50.051 --> 00:42:51.370
that's turned around completely.

671
00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:55.510
Even farmers definitely do not do things in a traditional manner.
Of course,

672
00:42:55.511 --> 00:42:58.540
a lot of education to be a very efficient farmer.

673
00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.720
And so we need a lot of schooling for whatever we do.

674
00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:06.520
And so we're not supposed to get married until our schooling is finished.

675
00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.720
And,
uh,
your parents who would not only have been mortified,
uh,

676
00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:13.180
if you got married in high school,

677
00:43:13.181 --> 00:43:15.610
but there probably would be mortified if you've got married before you graduated

678
00:43:15.611 --> 00:43:16.444
college.

679
00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:20.200
How many of you think your parents would be very happy if we got married now?

680
00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:26.440
Now how many of you are married?
One,
two,
two,
sorry.

681
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:31.210
Two of the TA's are married and they're like,
no,
moderately married.
So,

682
00:43:31.211 --> 00:43:35.980
and now mostly I teach a biology majors and we all know when to biology majors

683
00:43:35.981 --> 00:43:36.814
grow up.

684
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:43.880
Is it when they get their MD or is it when they finish their residency,

685
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:46.940
that's,
that's the big issue.
And they,

686
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:50.000
they generally don't get married before that.

687
00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:52.603
Okay.

688
00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:57.080
Now we have to do a little quantification of all of this.

689
00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:03.430
So here is the crux of the problem and this is an 1890,

690
00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:12.050
so murky of course as the onset of the Menzies and presumably more or less the

691
00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:13.820
time of beginning of fertility.

692
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:18.950
And that was at about 15 years of age.

693
00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.040
Now with presumably increase nutrition,

694
00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.660
although the reasons they're still somewhat,
uh,

695
00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:28.790
questionable the age America is now 12 and a half.

696
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:32.160
So this period has been extended forward.

697
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:38.060
The age at marriage was 22 in 18 of the average age of marriage for women.

698
00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:39.720
This is,
this is for women.

699
00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:45.890
And so the period was still failing between the onset was Emily a of sexual

700
00:44:47.401 --> 00:44:50.380
desire.
And the quote,

701
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:55.020
legitimate realization of it at marriage was about seven and a half years.

702
00:44:55.021 --> 00:44:58.770
And then very rapidly,
a first birth a would occur.

703
00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:03.600
Now what happens is you go to 1988 men are key,

704
00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:07.350
becomes earlier,
and marriage becomes a lot later.

705
00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:12.470
And now both of these things have expanded even more so that now the period of

706
00:45:13.111 --> 00:45:18.111
time between the onset of adolescents in sexual desires and marriage becomes

707
00:45:20.671 --> 00:45:24.000
longer.
And as time goes on,
this gets longer and longer.

708
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.830
And it's the same story for men.

709
00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:30.130
We don't have good early data on the sperm Marquis,
uh,

710
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:35.040
but marriage is even later than for women.
So for men,
it's 12 and a half years.

711
00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:40.290
That's a very long period of time in the life cycle of a man,

712
00:45:40.291 --> 00:45:42.900
especially not much less for a woman.

713
00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:46.120
And especially during the fertile years.

714
00:45:46.121 --> 00:45:49.440
A 15 to 40 I like 25 fertile years.

715
00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:54.770
This is a 35 this is half are somewhat less than half of your total fertile

716
00:45:55.591 --> 00:45:59.160
period is pre marital here.

717
00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:01.230
So quantitatively.

718
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:06.240
That's probably where the social issue comes up.
Wait,

719
00:46:06.241 --> 00:46:06.391
wait.

720
00:46:06.391 --> 00:46:11.391
Before 1890s and nutritional side is men are key and marriage come at the same

721
00:46:11.641 --> 00:46:13.710
time.
There's no,
no real interval there,

722
00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:16.500
so there's not a social problem of what to the search was,

723
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:21.510
what to do with sexuality in this interval here that in traditional times when

724
00:46:22.921 --> 00:46:26.610
our religions grew up in most of our cultural presuppositions grew up.

725
00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:31.970
There was no period though we're extremely little period between the onset of of

726
00:46:32.611 --> 00:46:34.740
adolescents and marriage.

727
00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:38.010
As time goes on and the need for education increases.

728
00:46:38.370 --> 00:46:40.710
That period between

729
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:45.120
onset of adolescence and marriage grows longer and longer,

730
00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:50.340
and there becomes this very long social period in which by some social

731
00:46:50.341 --> 00:46:53.490
conventions you're not supposed to have sex of the child.

732
00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:56.550
And it's still a child in a sense,
not supposed to have sex,

733
00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:00.150
but the biology is telling them that yes,
they want it very much.

734
00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:04.080
And societies have had western societies especially,
but the,

735
00:47:04.081 --> 00:47:07.860
the rest of the world is not any different.
Uh,
have had a long,

736
00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:09.050
have had a lot of trouble in,

737
00:47:09.051 --> 00:47:13.050
are still in the middle of having difficulty with deciding what to do with this

738
00:47:13.051 --> 00:47:14.850
peer.
What is the morals,
what are the ethics,

739
00:47:14.851 --> 00:47:19.851
what's the religious attitudes that should take place about sexuality and these

740
00:47:20.011 --> 00:47:24.440
periods.
And this whole lecture basically is this whole problem of,

741
00:47:24.441 --> 00:47:29.440
of teenage sexuality is due to that problem there.

742
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:32.590
Okay.

743
00:47:38.410 --> 00:47:42.110
Now,
so if you look at,
at the time,
what has happened?
What's the,

744
00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:46.510
what has happened to sexuality in this period?
Well,

745
00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:51.070
what do you think has happened to the frequency of sex among teenagers,

746
00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:55.930
unmarried teenagers or team up?
Oh,
well,

747
00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:59.560
Yep,
that is correct.
Here's,
here's the data.

748
00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:03.850
So this data is not clean.
I,
you'd want to bring the data more up to date,

749
00:48:03.851 --> 00:48:07.270
but we just don't have it.
But here's women,
uh,

750
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:10.930
starting in 1956 after World War Two,

751
00:48:10.931 --> 00:48:14.170
there's a very conservative period in America,
uh,

752
00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:18.070
where the war was very disruptive to have the big depression in the war.

753
00:48:18.071 --> 00:48:22.060
And people wanted to go back to a traditional way of living a little White House

754
00:48:22.061 --> 00:48:26.710
in the suburbs with the man and wife and a white picket fence around it.
And,

755
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:32.350
uh,
the fraction of teenage women,
this is teenagers having sex,

756
00:48:32.351 --> 00:48:35.710
was like still a quarter,
uh,
more than a quarter.
So it was,

757
00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:39.160
it was not zero by my name means,
and then as time goes on,

758
00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:44.110
it goes higher and higher and now it's sort of double the rate,
not now.

759
00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:48.820
This is a,
this is a 1980,
late,

760
00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:52.720
late eighties.
So we've progressed another 20,
30 years since then,

761
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:57.280
and it's just continued to creep up.
This is for females and this is,
uh,

762
00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:02.740
for males showing the same thing.
So yes,
indeed,
sex has increased.

763
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:05.290
No question about that.

764
00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:08.320
But what do you think has happened to the teen birth rate?

765
00:49:09.130 --> 00:49:14.130
This is really what people don't realize is that during that same period where

766
00:49:14.141 --> 00:49:18.130
the,
the,
the frequency of teen sex was rising,
quite noticeably,

767
00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:23.380
the teen birth rate went from 80 or even 90,
in the middle fifties,

768
00:49:23.381 --> 00:49:26.890
during where that other graph started in the middle of this conservative period.

769
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:28.840
It was a very high teen birth rate.

770
00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:33.100
And then it's going down and it's continued on down.

771
00:49:33.101 --> 00:49:37.950
It's now down to about this level,
about 40,
uh,
currently.
But this,

772
00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.980
these graphs rolled done during this period of peak.
It's being a peak in the,

773
00:49:41.981 --> 00:49:46.090
as a social issue.
This bump here,

774
00:49:46.210 --> 00:49:48.790
we're at Ray's temporarily was significant.

775
00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:51.790
We are going from 50 to 60 or something,

776
00:49:51.791 --> 00:49:56.320
which is a 20% increase,
uh,
in,
uh,

777
00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:00.520
teen births.
So no one really knows what that is,

778
00:50:00.521 --> 00:50:04.200
but sort of the presumption it was the,
the,
the,

779
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:09.100
the Reagan and Bush just say no period where social programs to combat,

780
00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:13.510
uh,
pregnancy,
largely sex education were frowned upon,
were,
were put down,

781
00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:17.440
and the result was an increase.
That's very conjectural.

782
00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.590
We really don't have any way of finding out what caused that.

783
00:50:20.591 --> 00:50:23.110
But since that's over,
it's,
it came,

784
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:26.140
it's come back down and continued to fall every year.

785
00:50:26.141 --> 00:50:31.040
Basically the rate teen pregnancy gets less than than the previous year.

786
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.983
<v 3>MMM.</v>

787
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.740
<v 0>So,
but it's still a big problem.
Of course,
I showed you in the first guy,</v>

788
00:50:36.741 --> 00:50:40.090
there's still about a half a million,
uh,
teenage pregnancies,
uh,

789
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:45.620
each year.
And that is in the American context about half what it,

790
00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.730
what it used to be.

791
00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:49.960
<v 3>Um,
but,
uh,</v>

792
00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:55.050
<v 0>in,
in the world it's,
it's middling.
Uh,</v>

793
00:50:55.090 --> 00:50:59.140
it's more than in Europe and less than in a lot of other countries.

794
00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:03.760
So if you break this down,
uh,
this decline in teen childbearing,

795
00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:07.840
you can average it out.
It's 1% a year,
kind of continually since late 1950.

796
00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:12.460
So the last 50 years,
teenage pregnancy has dropped on average 1% a year,
very,

797
00:51:12.461 --> 00:51:16.810
very consistently and you can break it down and stopped in all 50 states.

798
00:51:16.811 --> 00:51:21.190
If you break it down geographically,
it's croptical all ethnic groups,

799
00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.570
you pick your ethnic groups,

800
00:51:22.571 --> 00:51:26.440
the teen pregnancy has fallen and the drop in,

801
00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:30.460
especially during the peak of the crisis,
there was a special worry about poor,

802
00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:34.150
a poor teenagers.
And at that time meant mostly black teenagers.

803
00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:38.860
And the rate of drop of teen pregnancy among black teenagers has been about

804
00:51:38.861 --> 00:51:43.720
twice the rate of drop,
uh,
among whites.
So they,

805
00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.600
they've come much closer together.
Uh,

806
00:51:47.650 --> 00:51:51.130
and it's not only a child bearing,
but actual pregnancy rates.

807
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:54.250
If this is childbearing rates,
if I put a pregnancy rates,

808
00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:57.970
it would look pretty much the same.
Okay.

809
00:51:57.971 --> 00:52:02.470
Now we got a problem here.
So we've said that the rate of teen pregnancy,

810
00:52:03.010 --> 00:52:06.790
something like doubled and the rate of teen,
uh,
sorry,

811
00:52:06.791 --> 00:52:11.791
the rate of teen sexuality somewhat doubled yet the rate of teen childbirth went

812
00:52:13.121 --> 00:52:16.990
in half.
So there's a factor of four that we have to explain,
you know,

813
00:52:16.991 --> 00:52:21.991
right now what we think should have doubled in fact went down by a factor of

814
00:52:22.751 --> 00:52:25.780
two.
So what is,
what is the factor here?

815
00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:29.880
Oh No,
what a teens start to do.

816
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:35.430
<v 3>What
they,
what matters.</v>

817
00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:40.750
<v 0>No,
no marriage.
I'll show you.
I'll show you.
Imagine in a minute.
In fact,</v>

818
00:52:40.751 --> 00:52:44.110
I will show you marriage.
Okay,
good.
That's good.
Good point.

819
00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:50.340
This is the marriage rates for different ages and here is women in the prime age

820
00:52:51.431 --> 00:52:56.170
of marriage is marriage rate 1960 marriage disappears.

821
00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.670
Madge falls off the face of the cliff.

822
00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:05.060
I'm sorry.
Birth rate.
Yes.
Sorry,
my mistake.
Uh,

823
00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:10.690
the birth rate drops.
Yeah,
sorry.
The very,
the birth rate drops tremendously.

824
00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:13.480
And what happens in the early sixties to cause that

825
00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:18.180
the pill,
the birth control pill,

826
00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:22.890
so this is a pure technological effect and this kind of drop.

827
00:53:22.891 --> 00:53:27.020
We've seen this for China and when Mexico legalized,
uh,

828
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:30.660
contraception,
you get these drops that,
and this is 15 years,

829
00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:34.110
it goes from 250 down to less than 125.

830
00:53:34.111 --> 00:53:37.080
It drops by a factor of two and 15 years,
enormous strop.

831
00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:41.580
And this is all a technological drop due to the availability of,

832
00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:46.620
of modern contraception and the pill and in particular.

833
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:50.910
And uh,
uh,
we've seen that kind of,

834
00:53:50.911 --> 00:53:55.050
that means that at this point in time when the birth rate was one out of every

835
00:53:55.051 --> 00:53:59.700
four women,
every year of,
of for lasers,
that's a very,
that's a pretty high rate.

836
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.983
That means that,

837
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:05.040
I mean the other social indicators don't change so much like the economy or the

838
00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:07.800
amount of female education or anything like that.
Not so rapidly.

839
00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:10.170
So this means that at that time,

840
00:54:10.171 --> 00:54:13.320
that must have been a fairly large desire to stop child bearing,

841
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:16.140
but there wasn't the technology available.

842
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.150
And so as soon as the technology is available,

843
00:54:18.151 --> 00:54:22.770
whom the birth rate drops now for teenagers,

844
00:54:22.771 --> 00:54:27.030
he was age 15 to 19,
you also get a drop also at the same time,
Fanta.

845
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:30.930
But it's much more gradual.
And why is that?
That's

846
00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:34.653
<v 1>a,</v>

847
00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:42.100
<v 0>the legalization of abortion is probably this blip down down here.</v>

848
00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:47.080
Uh,
uh,
16 yeah,
73 no,
that's later.
That's,

849
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.480
that was 73,
so that's down here.

850
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:54.490
The fertility drop is 60 contraception gets legalized in 65 and abortion in

851
00:54:56.761 --> 00:55:00.880
[inaudible] 73 so it's too late,
too late for that.

852
00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:05.620
Uh,
but the availability of contraception and the legalization of it.

853
00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:08.260
So in 1960,
uh,

854
00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:14.340
contraception between married people was not legal and it was in 1965 for the

855
00:55:16.151 --> 00:55:18.760
part,
way through this drop that it became legal,

856
00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:22.770
but it was used very heavily then was as in China with the one shop policy.

857
00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:26.050
We've just ramped and ignoring of the law.

858
00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:30.220
Who was the Supreme Court case that that was for?
That was a Connecticut case.

859
00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:35.580
The planned parent of Connecticut did the contraception more did the case that

860
00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:39.670
that made contraception legal for married people.

861
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:43.390
And it was later that unmarried people got the right to have contraception.

862
00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:48.640
So the birth rate drops,
uh,
for married women.

863
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.720
Uh,
but for teenagers that drops much more slowly.

864
00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:57.220
And that's the,
the trade off between that.

865
00:55:57.221 --> 00:56:01.530
They're having more sex,
so you expect it to go up,
but they're having other,

866
00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:04.290
using contraception.
So it's,
it's going downwards.

867
00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:08.170
These women married women at that age were having sex before this period.

868
00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:10.810
So what you see as all a contraceptive effect,

869
00:56:10.811 --> 00:56:14.950
and there's no increase in sexual frequency to counter balance that.

870
00:56:14.951 --> 00:56:19.480
So this is what you would expect.
Uh,
well this would be,
this is the,

871
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:21.040
the full contraceptive effect.

872
00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:26.400
This is the contraceptive effect minus the increased sexuality effect.

873
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:30.430
So,
um,

874
00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:34.163
<v 3>yeah,</v>

875
00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:37.940
<v 0>and we know that something like three quarters of sexually active teenagers in</v>

876
00:56:37.941 --> 00:56:42.650
this for a long time,
I use contraception and they're,
and they're amazing.
Not,

877
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:46.430
not good.
They're not there.
They're not dumb about it at all.
They,

878
00:56:46.431 --> 00:56:50.660
in general used contraception at least as effectively as adults.

879
00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.310
And in many,
in several of the studies,

880
00:56:52.311 --> 00:56:56.180
they use contraception more effectively than adults.

881
00:56:57.590 --> 00:57:00.950
And so if you ha,

882
00:57:00.980 --> 00:57:04.530
if contraception hadn't come in at that time,
uh,

883
00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:09.880
you would have seen a tremendous rise in teen pregnancy and teen birth.

884
00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:11.420
Whereas in fact,

885
00:57:11.421 --> 00:57:16.421
you saw a gentle 1% a year of gentle drop in teen births.

886
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:19.703
<v 3>MMM.</v>

887
00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:23.240
<v 0>So,
and,
and,
uh,</v>

888
00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:29.000
cross national studies show quite convincingly that the,

889
00:57:30.781 --> 00:57:35.280
that the drop that,
that the moderation that this drop,

890
00:57:35.281 --> 00:57:39.630
that why white teen pregnancy didn't rise when teen sex rose was due to,

891
00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:42.390
uh,
contraception.
So,

892
00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.473
<v 3>uh,</v>

893
00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:47.240
<v 0>in Canada,
us,
Sweden,
France,
Great Britain,</v>

894
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:51.530
the age of sexual debut doesn't change very much when you go across these

895
00:57:51.531 --> 00:57:52.364
countries,

896
00:57:52.730 --> 00:57:57.730
about 40% of the 15 to 17 year olds have already had intercourse and this rises

897
00:57:57.801 --> 00:58:02.490
to 70 to 80% a month,
18 to 19 year olds.
Uh,

898
00:58:02.810 --> 00:58:03.171
in fact,

899
00:58:03.171 --> 00:58:07.010
the u s had a significantly lower percentage of girls who had intercourse in the

900
00:58:07.011 --> 00:58:09.200
past three months.
Then at the year,

901
00:58:09.201 --> 00:58:14.090
this was taking say 59% in the u s and 79% in Sweden.

902
00:58:14.091 --> 00:58:16.970
So we had less sexuality and the other countries,

903
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:18.583
<v 3>uh,</v>

904
00:58:19.770 --> 00:58:23.280
<v 0>and even though we had a lower amount of sexual activity,</v>

905
00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:26.610
the teen pregnancy rate,
the teen birth rate,

906
00:58:26.611 --> 00:58:31.380
the team sexually transmitted disease rates were much higher.
And again,

907
00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:36.360
if you compare the use of contraception in Europe,
it's much better than here.

908
00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:41.160
And that explains all these problems with the sexuality.
Uh,

909
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:44.670
non use of contraception in the United States,
uh,

910
00:58:44.850 --> 00:58:46.500
was five times as great as that,

911
00:58:46.501 --> 00:58:49.710
a Great Britain and three times as great as that in Sweden.

912
00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:51.773
<v 3>Uh,</v>

913
00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:57.200
<v 0>the effect is not concentrated in lower economic groups that uh,</v>

914
00:58:57.290 --> 00:58:58.920
that's somewhat interesting facts.

915
00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:02.020
Almost everything else breaks out by economic groups.
Uh,

916
00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:07.560
contracept views among Tina's doesn't vary that much among different economic

917
00:59:07.571 --> 00:59:11.520
groups.
Okay.
Um,

918
00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:16.030
now,
so,
so what's the problem here?

919
00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:19.000
So we started out that there was,
or still is,

920
00:59:19.001 --> 00:59:23.630
appeared to be a huge problem with teen teen pregnancy and,

921
00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:27.480
but we see that in actual fact the data contradicts that,
that,
uh,

922
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:30.140
the team brings.
It has been declining rather steadily,

923
00:59:30.141 --> 00:59:34.370
1% a year for the last 50 years.
And now half of what it used to be.

924
00:59:36.450 --> 00:59:37.440
<v 3>But,
uh,</v>

925
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:41.960
<v 0>this is,
there's a whole second we can discuss teenage abortion rates,</v>

926
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:47.060
but what has happened is the disappearance of shotgun weddings.

927
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:52.170
So this data is primarily pregnant women this little time.
What?
Oh,

928
00:59:52.310 --> 00:59:54.590
wider age range.
Not,
not teenagers,

929
00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:59.270
but 15 to 29 and what fraction we got married before the birth of their first

930
00:59:59.271 --> 01:00:04.070
child.
So they're pregnant before this graph happens.
Sometime later.

931
01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:05.480
They may or may not get married.

932
01:00:05.660 --> 01:00:08.000
What fraction of them getting married before the birth of their child?

933
01:00:08.001 --> 01:00:09.680
They're pregnant.
The child's born.

934
01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:14.450
Do they get married in between traditional shotgun wedding and here?

935
01:00:15.250 --> 01:00:16.300
<v 3>Oh No.</v>

936
01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:19.700
<v 0>Well you can see there it is.
It's getting bad.</v>

937
01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:24.470
You haven't seen it was fairly stable for many years and then boom,

938
01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:28.130
it just falls off.
That's white women.
Here's,

939
01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:36.480
here's a total women.
You can see Hispanic and black woman,
what disappears?

940
01:00:36.810 --> 01:00:39.510
It's not an issue with sexual activity.

941
01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:44.630
It's an issue with marriage that the problem is that marriage drops much faster,

942
01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.530
uh,
then then,
then,
then,

943
01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:53.160
then the teenagers or anybody else,
uh,
can cope with.

944
01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:55.713
<v 3>MMM.</v>

945
01:00:56.450 --> 01:01:00.650
<v 0>And so what happens in here is the source of the problem that even though the</v>

946
01:01:00.651 --> 01:01:03.200
teen birth rate during this period is declining,

947
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.980
the non-marital teen birth rate is rising.

948
01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:10.850
And that's one of the things that people always,
uh,
don't distinguish between.

949
01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:15.530
And it was this,
the non marital teen birth rate that was making,

950
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:18.890
making a real social issue was not,
not the total birth rate,

951
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:23.930
but the unmarried birth rate.
And,

952
01:01:24.620 --> 01:01:27.920
um,
and this,

953
01:01:27.921 --> 01:01:30.410
this was enough of a social problem,

954
01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:35.390
but without the teen use of contraception.
The problem,
remember we,

955
01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:37.340
we thought we should,
we fought,

956
01:01:37.341 --> 01:01:42.330
we should have seen a doubling of teen pregnancy and we saw a halfing,
uh,

957
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.840
cutting in half.
So there's a factor of four difference.

958
01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:50.110
This would have risen four times as fast without teenage use of contraception.

959
01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.280
And again,
that's the,
we started with,

960
01:01:52.281 --> 01:01:56.570
that's the big one of the big social issues of should teens be given

961
01:01:56.571 --> 01:01:57.410
contraception.

962
01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:02.330
And I think the data here shows that don't go make any kind of moral statement

963
01:02:02.331 --> 01:02:04.520
or ethical statement,
but that if they don't have it,

964
01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:09.990
melon marital teen birth rate is going to be fantastic.
If the question,

965
01:02:09.991 --> 01:02:13.430
somebody I thought raised their hand,
no.
Okay.

966
01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:18.530
Um,
now,
uh,

967
01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:23.610
you have the reading day,
there's all kinds of,

968
01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.340
of programs that are supposed to

969
01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:32.370
do something about teen pregnancy.
And you'll read about this one of these,

970
01:02:32.371 --> 01:02:37.140
these virginity pred pledges,
the abstinence only programs,
uh,

971
01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:38.760
various conservative measures.

972
01:02:38.761 --> 01:02:42.800
And there's now good studies of all these and none of them work.
And,

973
01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:47.230
and the information on that is,
is,
uh,

974
01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.850
is in your reading.
Okay.

975
01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:54.150
So here's the story on that.

976
01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:57.600
With this drop in marriage,
and this is all women,

977
01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:02.780
it's not just teen teenagers look at the rise in unmarried birth and it's about

978
01:03:04.921 --> 01:03:08.970
a third of all births are to unmarried women of all ages.

979
01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:14.460
And that's,
that's continued on the slow rise since then.

980
01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:20.040
So this is kind of a,
uh,
uh,
a huge sea change

981
01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.150
in American child bearing practices.

982
01:03:24.151 --> 01:03:29.151
It's going from almost always within marriage to very heavily have to a very

983
01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:33.810
large fraction outside of marriage and here.

984
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:36.600
So this is the birth rate,
Ron.

985
01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:40.830
So mostly like older women,
it's rising,

986
01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:45.990
uh,
over 40.
It's,
it's low,
but rising,
uh,

987
01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:51.180
35 30 on,
it's rising,
30 to 34 slightly rising,

988
01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:54.720
uh,
25 to 49 little bit rising.

989
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:59.490
And the only group that's having a lower birth rate are in the 15.

990
01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:06.000
The 15 to 19 year olds that you can see that their,

991
01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:10.980
their line is definitely sloping down.
So this marriage problem,
uh,

992
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:12.060
this is uh,

993
01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:17.840
this is the change in birth rates and the only one that that's having a smaller

994
01:04:18.181 --> 01:04:20.640
birth rate are,
are the teenagers.

995
01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:24.210
And this is now the unmarried birthrate.

996
01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.960
And here you see again 35 to 39 year old women,

997
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:34.920
very much increased.
Uh,
again,
the 30 to 34 of the different ages.

998
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:39.750
All the ages of women have an increasing rate on my birthday except the

999
01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:43.290
teenagers.
Here's the 15 to 17 year olds.
They are,

1000
01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:48.030
they are falling down.
And here this dark blue line is 18 to 19 year olds.

1001
01:04:48.031 --> 01:04:50.220
So whether it's 15 to 19,

1002
01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:54.330
that's the only group in America in which unwed,
uh,

1003
01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:57.150
child bearing is going,
going down

1004
01:05:02.090 --> 01:05:06.170
rate per thousand.
I don't know if you can see this rate rate per thousand.

1005
01:05:06.171 --> 01:05:09.800
So 10,000 2,140 per thousand.

1006
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:12.223
Okay.

1007
01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:13.973
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1008
01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.220
<v 0>Do you know if the programs</v>

1009
01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:23.050
<v 3>from 15 to 18 year olds you successful at all?</v>

1010
01:05:23.051 --> 01:05:23.884
Or is it,

1011
01:05:24.090 --> 01:05:27.450
<v 0>no,
the data has been,
most of the programs work on younger kids</v>

1012
01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.030
<v 3>chat.
Why it's not going up as much as the others</v>

1013
01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:37.400
<v 0>that is in debate?
No,
no.
The,
the,
the abstinence programs.
No,</v>

1014
01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:41.180
there's two sets of programs competing when an abstinence type programs,

1015
01:05:41.181 --> 01:05:44.360
virginity,
pledges of work and the other sex education programs.

1016
01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:47.390
And you have to have a very good study to figure out what's going on for any

1017
01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.700
particular group of students.

1018
01:05:49.701 --> 01:05:53.390
And I put in your reading packet some of the best studies of this.

1019
01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:58.730
Here's another interesting sort of factor that if you break a teenage birth

1020
01:05:58.731 --> 01:06:01.520
rates out by state in America,

1021
01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:06.620
the red states have the 10 highest rates and they are the,

1022
01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:09.170
the south in the south belt here.

1023
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:13.700
So the most conservative and most and the ones who are the lowest 10 sites,
it's,

1024
01:06:13.701 --> 01:06:18.050
you know,
New England,
New Jersey,
upper Midwest,
the,
uh,

1025
01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:23.460
the most conservative and the most religious parts of America are the ones that

1026
01:06:23.601 --> 01:06:27.230
have the highest teen birth rate.
But again,

1027
01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:32.150
you have to be careful about overinterpreting this data because what you might,

1028
01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.490
this is they get married young are also,

1029
01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:38.960
so a fair amount of this is marital teen birth rate.
And again,

1030
01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:41.420
the data isn't,
isn't readily available.

1031
01:06:41.421 --> 01:06:44.930
At least I haven't been able to find it on what you're worried about at the or

1032
01:06:44.931 --> 01:06:47.150
you think you're worried about the unmarried teen birth rate.

1033
01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:48.171
Now a lot of people,

1034
01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:51.920
some are married about teen birth rate period because it means people are not

1035
01:06:51.921 --> 01:06:55.820
getting it.
The,
the,
the teenagers are not getting education and so forth.

1036
01:06:56.510 --> 01:07:01.310
But like most other things that the,
the social practices,

1037
01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:02.623
uh,

1038
01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:07.930
in the more conservative regions of the country lead to a very lower age of

1039
01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:12.380
when,
when,
when people have births.
And that's not,

1040
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:17.090
not surprising at all.
Um,

1041
01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:20.543
okay.

1042
01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:29.380
Okay.
Now I want to expand this internationally a little bit.

1043
01:07:29.381 --> 01:07:33.130
So we've talked about America and here is uh,

1044
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:35.743
<v 3>the,</v>

1045
01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:42.000
<v 0>the country and this is teenagers and it's who have ever had sex.</v>

1046
01:07:43.181 --> 01:07:47.830
Two different columns and one column is male and one column is female.

1047
01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:51.220
And I cut off by mistake,
which sex?
It was.

1048
01:07:51.221 --> 01:07:53.140
So it was it obvious which sex is which.

1049
01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:55.013
<v 3>Here</v>

1050
01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:03.860
<v 0>the left column you'll notice is consistently larger than the right column.</v>

1051
01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.590
So it should be pretty easy to figure out which is male,
which is female

1052
01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:13.200
males on the left,
and then how many people agree with that?

1053
01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:17.870
How many people think it's to be the opposite and why do you think it's going to

1054
01:08:17.871 --> 01:08:18.704
be the opposite?

1055
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.320
<v 1>Women are going to get married and have sex,</v>

1056
01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.410
whereas men and uploading the society might have to wait longer.

1057
01:08:26.730 --> 01:08:30.080
<v 0>Right?
Exactly right.
So here it is.</v>

1058
01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:31.940
The first column is indeed women.

1059
01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:37.190
So you see now the point is very different considerations come in and this is

1060
01:08:37.191 --> 01:08:40.100
all an effect of age at marriage.

1061
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:44.090
And so here is the complete graph as it as it was published.

1062
01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:48.950
And notice the fraction of teenage men that are in union,

1063
01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:52.700
almost none,
nine number.
We've,
we've talked about that,

1064
01:08:52.701 --> 01:08:55.730
that the old man keep the young guys from getting married.

1065
01:08:56.060 --> 01:09:01.060
And these about 25% across the countries are in union with men who are older and

1066
01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:07.370
therefore they've had more sex than the young males have.

1067
01:09:07.371 --> 01:09:09.440
Not had the opportunity to have sex.

1068
01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:14.150
So this is part of what I've described before about the power structure and the

1069
01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:18.080
money structure that the old man keep the young men in kind of a state of

1070
01:09:18.081 --> 01:09:21.560
frustration and the females,
uh,

1071
01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:23.480
have sex earlier.

1072
01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:27.980
Okay.
Um,

1073
01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:36.440
now you can look at different countries and uh,
a lot of people,

1074
01:09:36.441 --> 01:09:38.120
again,
this is uh,
this uh,

1075
01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:43.960
discussion of sexuality is very often tied in with ideas of religious morals.

1076
01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:47.480
And you can look at um,
Ireland.
You can,

1077
01:09:47.490 --> 01:09:50.150
you can look at religion could look around the world that countries that are of

1078
01:09:50.151 --> 01:09:54.500
different religions and one of the most Catholic countries is Ireland.

1079
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:56.480
And,
um,

1080
01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:01.760
more than half of all babies are born to mothers under 25.

1081
01:10:01.761 --> 01:10:02.870
So they have a low,

1082
01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:08.230
a low age of birth and about half of those are born outside of marriage.

1083
01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:13.060
So if half your babies are born before you're 25 and a half of those are

1084
01:10:13.061 --> 01:10:14.960
legitimate,
that means that all the babies,

1085
01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.600
just from the young women having babies,

1086
01:10:17.601 --> 01:10:21.390
that's 25% of your total babies are legitimate.
Uh,

1087
01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:25.180
when you add in the legitimacy of,
of,

1088
01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.500
of children born to women over 25,

1089
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:32.420
then it increase that the Irish rate comes to equal or exceed the u s rate of

1090
01:10:32.421 --> 01:10:34.850
about one third.
Um,

1091
01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:40.960
and if you compare the Irish illegitimacy rate to white American women,

1092
01:10:41.811 --> 01:10:45.170
which was in some sense the proper comparison group,
the Irish rates way higher,

1093
01:10:45.171 --> 01:10:49.130
about 50% higher,
uh,
than,
than the American rate.

1094
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:53.300
There you go.
The other side,
New Zealand is an old fashioned Protestant country.

1095
01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:57.890
You've,
it's,
it has the array retro feeling when you,

1096
01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.880
when you visited,
she was in the,
you've been,
you've been there.
Yes.

1097
01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.150
And um,
they,

1098
01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:09.320
38% of all births in New Zealand are,
are out of wedlock.

1099
01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:13.650
In England.
It's nearly 40% of births.
And uh,

1100
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:18.900
they have the same Rambito third of marriages end in divorce and ever increasing

1101
01:11:18.901 --> 01:11:21.840
numbers of people see marriage is just an irrelevant thing and don't,

1102
01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:27.030
and don't bother in Japan.
I think I gave you these things.

1103
01:11:27.210 --> 01:11:32.210
The 26% of first births are two women who conceive before marriage and uh,

1104
01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:38.490
and in Japan.
And I guess I mentioned this before,

1105
01:11:38.491 --> 01:11:41.910
they have such a high rate of abortion that you can't tell very much from,

1106
01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:46.080
from the actual childbirth rates.
Okay.

1107
01:11:46.081 --> 01:11:50.700
We're coming to the end.
We are at the end and there's lots more to say.

1108
01:11:50.701 --> 01:11:55.170
Let me tell you one more thing.
So the Pan whole pattern of child bearing is,

1109
01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:58.380
is changing address the,
especially in poor communities.

1110
01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:03.450
So it's very difficult for poor people to bring up children cause they just have

1111
01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:05.250
no money.
And so you look,

1112
01:12:05.251 --> 01:12:09.990
what's happening is who actually brings up say largely black children in

1113
01:12:09.991 --> 01:12:13.830
America?
Is it the mothers,
the grandmother,

1114
01:12:13.831 --> 01:12:17.400
very common pattern.
I don't know if it's the,
it's the,

1115
01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:21.860
it's that the grandmothers are bringing up the children and we get upset.

1116
01:12:22.190 --> 01:12:24.900
You know,
the white dominant group gets upset by this.

1117
01:12:24.901 --> 01:12:29.280
But actually it's a split between the biological act of parenting and the

1118
01:12:29.281 --> 01:12:33.810
psychological and economic act of parenting.
The kids get married,

1119
01:12:33.811 --> 01:12:35.190
get pregnant quite young,

1120
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:39.750
but they're probably biologically very capable of pregnancy at the ages of which

1121
01:12:39.751 --> 01:12:43.290
they get pregnant.
So in,
in some sense from a logical point of view,

1122
01:12:43.770 --> 01:12:47.370
getting pregnant in your late teenage may be a biological optimum,

1123
01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:50.460
but they are not psychologically prepared to be a parent and they're not

1124
01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:55.230
economically prepared to be a parent who is most stable psychologically is

1125
01:12:55.231 --> 01:12:57.570
probably the mother's mother,

1126
01:12:57.571 --> 01:13:02.571
the grandmother who will be 35 or 40 at a time when you were sort of more or

1127
01:13:02.731 --> 01:13:05.340
less emotionally stable.
You haven't gotten into old age yet.

1128
01:13:05.341 --> 01:13:07.980
And whatever degree of economic stability you're going to have,

1129
01:13:07.981 --> 01:13:12.390
which is never going to be very great,
is strongest at,
at that age.

1130
01:13:12.690 --> 01:13:15.940
So in a sense it's a very rational kind of split that you,

1131
01:13:16.210 --> 01:13:20.280
that you do in your life cycle.
You do your biological reproduction,

1132
01:13:20.281 --> 01:13:21.720
the age where you're most capable of that.

1133
01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:25.320
And at a later stage when you're most psychologically and economically capable,

1134
01:13:25.650 --> 01:13:30.570
you do,
uh,
your,
your,
your psychological,
economic parenting.

1135
01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:34.650
And there's also this.
And because of that,
you know,
there's,

1136
01:13:34.890 --> 01:13:37.410
there's been big debates in America about welfare.

1137
01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:41.370
Does welfare encourage illegitimate,
uh,
uh,

1138
01:13:41.371 --> 01:13:43.080
bursts and they go in the public roles.

1139
01:13:43.081 --> 01:13:45.750
And this is especially done either openly or covertly,

1140
01:13:46.170 --> 01:13:50.530
always referring to poor people in often to minority,
uh,
people who,

1141
01:13:50.531 --> 01:13:51.930
if you actually look at the economics,

1142
01:13:51.931 --> 01:13:55.050
the amount that women get on welfare is really very small,

1143
01:13:55.770 --> 01:14:00.180
whereas the major and not enough to allow you to stay alive and bring up your

1144
01:14:00.181 --> 01:14:02.850
child.
Where's the economic sustenance coming from?

1145
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:06.960
It's coming from the grandmother,
the grandmother,
the young girl,

1146
01:14:06.961 --> 01:14:10.350
and certainly the baby will often live with the grandmother.
She pays the rent.

1147
01:14:10.351 --> 01:14:13.960
She has a job that the welfare is not coming from the government.

1148
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:18.610
That's a small amount.
The welfares coming from the grandmother.
So,

1149
01:14:18.910 --> 01:14:22.780
uh,
there is welfare involved,
but it's within the family kind of welfare.

1150
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:28.110
And it's really this system of having the grandmother take care of the kids and

1151
01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:30.340
economic is support the kids.

1152
01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:35.700
That is what enables a large degree of unwed teen pregnancy in poor and minority

1153
01:14:37.571 --> 01:14:42.220
communities.
Okay.
We will from that lecture,

1154
01:14:42.221 --> 01:14:43.570
we're going to abortion next time.
