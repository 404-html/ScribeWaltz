1
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.660
Okay,
you're going to get more numbers today.

2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.070
I know how many love numbers you can't live without numbers.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.493
So

4
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
what did I tell you was the traditional before modern times death rate number

5
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.750
you should keep or birth rate.
Same

6
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:25.930
about per thousand.

7
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.820
About 40 to 50 per thousand is the birth and death rate at a,

8
00:00:36.191 --> 00:00:39.370
at a,
at a life expectancy of 20 years.

9
00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.570
That means one 20th of the people die every year.

10
00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.600
And so you need 50 out of a thousand births,

11
00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:49.240
one 20th of your people to be brought.

12
00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:53.230
So births and deaths in what we call primitive times,

13
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.730
which might mean up to the Napoleonic revolution almost,
uh,

14
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.860
is 40 to 50

15
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.940
births and 40 to 50 deaths a year.

16
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.120
So now here is modern times.

17
00:01:07.121 --> 00:01:11.330
We're starting in 1950 and all of these graphs and coming up in a,

18
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.070
in the period of the puppet,

19
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.720
the main it beginning burst of the population explosion,

20
00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:20.290
1950 to 1990 and all these cases,

21
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.750
and here are the various parts of the world.

22
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.670
And you'll notice that this is the death,
the,
I'm sorry,

23
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:30.040
the birth rate is 50,

24
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.230
the birth rate is 50,
birth rate is 43 or something,

25
00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:40.231
(424) 034-0540 five that by at 1950,

26
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.740
the birth rate is it approximately it's level for centuries,

27
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.690
uh,
way back.
And we know that not too much before this time,

28
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.920
since population was not growing until some,

29
00:01:56.921 --> 00:02:01.780
a little bit before this time that the death rate must have been the same.

30
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.590
So the death rate was also 40 to 50 people.

31
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.680
But look with hadn't by 1950,

32
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.580
the death rate is already down to half of its traditional level.

33
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.690
Even in sub Saharan Africa,
it's almost reduced to half.

34
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.710
And in Central America,
the Caribbean,
uh,
less than half South America,

35
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:27.730
less than half China,
about half South Asia,

36
00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:32.620
about half Southeast Asia,
about half.
So in most of the world,

37
00:02:32.621 --> 00:02:35.770
by the 1950s,
uh,

38
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.120
the birth rate was still extremely high and put,

39
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.670
the death rate had come down to half of what it had always been.

40
00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.900
And what was going on is that these countries,

41
00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:51.700
we're almost all still under colonial rule with the exception of South America.

42
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.970
Uh,
which might be the reason why it's even better.

43
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.850
And among all of their faults,

44
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.510
the colonias did a basic sanitation,

45
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.930
basic public health,
basic public order,

46
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.050
and they stopped a lot of the warfare between communities that they imposed a

47
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:11.860
lot of violence on the people.

48
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:16.090
But that was apparently much less than the violence that local communities

49
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.450
imposed upon each other in the precolonial era.

50
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.220
So the death rate was way down by the 1950s,

51
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.500
sometime in the 50s,
around 1950,

52
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.280
the birth rate started coming down in all these countries.

53
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:36.580
And even though the birth rate starts at these very,
very high levels,

54
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.970
they come down almost everywhere.

55
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.240
We'll of course the exception being sub Saharan Africa,

56
00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.460
and you've read about why that is.

57
00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:50.170
And I keep saying that almost everything we say Subsaharan Africa is an

58
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:52.090
exception to the rate.

59
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.980
So even though the death rate was down,

60
00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.570
the birth rate didn't change much.

61
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.540
But in every other of the developing regions of the world,

62
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.080
the birth rate and the death rate came down approximately in parallel with each,

63
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.063
with each other.

64
00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.790
And of course the difference between that birth and death rate is a population

65
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.430
population increase.
And this is the,

66
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.280
the hay day of the population explosion.

67
00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.500
And remember this is per thousand,
so it's a percent,
uh,

68
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.980
kind of kind of a number.
So as the population grows,

69
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.310
the number of people represented by this percent cap grows and grows and grows.

70
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.740
And so this explains the graph I showed you last time or two times ago,

71
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.290
not again.
So starting again,
1950 to 1990.

72
00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.060
There's the number of people added each year,

73
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.970
just keeps growing with one blip.

74
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.580
And you'll see later in the course I've shown you that,

75
00:04:57.581 --> 00:05:02.020
but before we'll discuss what that a blip is.

76
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.590
So the data for the individual regions of the world and this all fits together.

77
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.753
Makes Sense.

78
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.610
Now we've been through the European population story.
And again,
we saw that,

79
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:16.241
not always,

80
00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:21.040
but mostly the death rate fell first and then the birth rate fell in Europe,

81
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.790
went through a population explosion.
So to say this story,

82
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:27.670
the way I've been telling you,
no differences that,

83
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:32.380
that the third world is just going through exactly what Europe,
uh,
went through.

84
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:33.970
Uh,
but it isn't true.

85
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.990
And let's compare a to of the fertility transition.

86
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.610
This is Sweden,
this is Mexico.

87
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.200
And you'll notice that Sweden has,
you know,

88
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.220
a lot of birth and death kind of hanging around until maybe here until 1860s.

89
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And that's just what the Princeton project out that the really a serious decline

90
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.880
happened somewhere in this 1870 region.

91
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.013
And then

92
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.230
just fix this and then the death rate declines rather continuously on through

93
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:17.660
the time and the birth rate declined.

94
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.090
So this starts around 1870.

95
00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.240
Mexico's decrease starts around 1970.

96
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.220
So between what we now call the developing countries of the third world

97
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.020
countries,
about a hundred year difference,
uh,

98
00:06:31.021 --> 00:06:36.021
between when Europe started its transition and when the developing countries

99
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:38.380
started their transition.
Now,

100
00:06:38.381 --> 00:06:41.630
a hundred years may seem a lot to you when the course of human history,

101
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:46.280
since these,
these numbers had been going on forever,

102
00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.910
uh,
a hundred years is a very,
very short time.

103
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.600
Another difference you should know is,

104
00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.120
<v 1>oh man,</v>

105
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.220
<v 0>hang on.
I just fixed this.</v>

106
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.420
Usually that's all that's required,
I hope.

107
00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.310
<v 1>Nope,
it makes it worse.</v>

108
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:35.680
Decent backwards.

109
00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.010
<v 0>Anybody have a laser point by any miracle?</v>

110
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.930
All right,
we're going to have a little bit of trouble today,
but I think you can,

111
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.340
you can figure things out.

112
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.020
So notice that the levels of,

113
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.850
of everything there are lower in Sweden,

114
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.530
that Sweden starts in the European hundred generally start at a lower level of

115
00:08:11.531 --> 00:08:15.310
births and a lower level of deaths.
So they already,

116
00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:18.550
by the time that they're serious transition starts,

117
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:23.830
they are already quite a ways down compared to where Mexico starts.

118
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:29.130
Notice that the deaths and the births are much higher in Mexico than in Europe.

119
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.640
Oh,
wonderful.
Wonderful,
wonderful,
wonderful.
Ha.

120
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.160
Lifesaver.
Okay.
So now that those,

121
00:08:42.161 --> 00:08:43.120
those are important,

122
00:08:43.121 --> 00:08:47.890
but notice the gradual illness of the decline here,

123
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.750
that Sweden had a long time to adjust to these changes.

124
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:57.810
Whereas look at the drop in death rate in Mexico.
Boom.

125
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.370
Basically all of a sudden,
and then give it a generation.

126
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:06.870
Look at the drop in the birth rate.
That's the most amazing thing.

127
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:12.230
How rapidly things change in the developing world compared to the way it changed

128
00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.010
in,
in Europe.
So,

129
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:22.011
and because of this rapidity of this decline and a natural delay here,

130
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.260
whereas in Sweden,
that might be the delay.

131
00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.590
The delay means because of the repetitive,

132
00:09:28.591 --> 00:09:33.591
the client that the difference now between births and deaths is this huge amount

133
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.350
compared to a much smaller amount here.

134
00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.620
Europe never had to cope with the rate of increase,

135
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.810
the number of people added every year.

136
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:47.250
The percentage of population never had to cope with anything like what the

137
00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:52.070
currently developing countries have.
And that's a result of,
of,
of the,
the,

138
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:57.360
the,
the rapid,
uh,
graph.
The other thing to note of course is that,

139
00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.700
uh,
by this time,
uh,

140
00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:04.800
the births and the deaths and Sweden are essentially equal and Sweden's

141
00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:09.120
population is not growing anymore and that as you heard from professor conductor

142
00:10:09.121 --> 00:10:14.121
title Bounce Lecture is characteristic of Europe as a whole as well as Japan.

143
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.000
Uh,
east a lot of the East Asian countries.

144
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.290
So,
uh,

145
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:26.040
a cartoon of this which has won a lot writing about it.

146
00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:31.041
And one big thing wrong with it is that here's the rich countries they start,

147
00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.193
this is the,

148
00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.820
this is the rate of increase of population growth that they start earlier.

149
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:39.390
Uh,

150
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:44.390
he starts at quite early in France and a hundred years later that what's in this

151
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:49.580
graph is called poor countries start the peak,
the raw,

152
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:53.760
the rises slow,
the fall is slow,
the rise is fast,

153
00:10:53.761 --> 00:10:57.060
the fall as fast.
The peak is much lower.

154
00:10:57.061 --> 00:10:58.800
Here the peak is about 1%.

155
00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:03.870
The maximum rate of growth that Europe ever experienced is,
was 1%.

156
00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.430
Whereas for poor countries,

157
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.360
the average was two and a half percent and some were up at 3%.

158
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:14.750
So enormously greater stress on the countries that went through this very,

159
00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:20.220
very fast.
And

160
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:24.930
why,
why did this happen?

161
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.050
Why is it so much faster in developing country?

162
00:11:28.051 --> 00:11:32.040
And we see that that as each country,
as it gets in to the,
their,

163
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.610
their transition phase later,
everything happens faster.
It's quite a,

164
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.110
quite a robust,
uh,
phenomenon every,
every few years.
Uh,
he say,

165
00:11:40.111 --> 00:11:45.060
Oh man,
China or some country,
you know,
Korea,
Taiwan had the fastest,
uh,

166
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:47.840
decline ever.
And then a few years later,

167
00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:52.050
some new countries enter in and they've declined as is even faster.

168
00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.740
And one of the main reasons is that contraceptives were invented around here,

169
00:11:57.971 --> 00:12:02.230
the pill,
the diaphragm kind of all of that.
Well,

170
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.700
some of them went way back here.
But the modern method,
the really modern methods,

171
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.940
we're all like the pill in around the 1960s and this is a graph showing that the

172
00:12:12.881 --> 00:12:16.690
developing countries are using contraception.

173
00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.270
So here is contraceptive prevalence.

174
00:12:19.271 --> 00:12:23.890
The percent of women in childbearing ages that use contraception and it ranges

175
00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:28.030
from very little less than 10% to like 70%.

176
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.480
The US is in this 60 to 70% range.

177
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.330
And notice that the fertility,
the total fertility rate,

178
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:36.520
the country's not using contraception,

179
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:40.630
very high fertility rate as they use more and more,
uh,
contraception,

180
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.910
their fertility rate goes on.

181
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.310
So the mechanism in the developing countries is use of contraception and mostly

182
00:12:48.311 --> 00:12:52.600
modern contraception.
Whereas in Europe went through its transition.

183
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.840
They didn't have hardly any contraception,

184
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.300
some condoms were just beginning to come in,

185
00:12:58.301 --> 00:13:03.301
but none of the modern chemical methods or the better kinds of barrier methods.

186
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.410
So this,
the story is kind of a,

187
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:13.210
that why the developing countries are faster,

188
00:13:13.211 --> 00:13:18.040
is that the science is already there.
The medical,
uh,
stuff is there to,

189
00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:22.020
the death rate comes down because again,
Europe developed,
uh,

190
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:26.170
the medical knowhow and then it just got transferred very rapidly.

191
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.770
Vaccines,
vitamins,
uh,
viruses,

192
00:13:29.771 --> 00:13:33.250
all of those were discovered before the transition there.

193
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:37.260
And just as important as,
uh,

194
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:42.520
the knowledge was an attitude towards civil government and civil society,

195
00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.840
that it is the responsibility of governments to take care of the health of their

196
00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:50.710
people.
That's not a given.
Most countries through most of history,

197
00:13:50.711 --> 00:13:55.120
the government was a rapacious and their idea was to get as much taxes from the

198
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:56.140
peasants as possible.

199
00:13:56.141 --> 00:14:00.220
The peasants were sort of like non humans and use those taxes to have an army

200
00:14:00.221 --> 00:14:03.400
and go try to get enlarge their territories.

201
00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.990
The idea of civil government where the government is for the people is a fairly

202
00:14:07.991 --> 00:14:11.860
modern idea and one of the basic things that governments try to do is,

203
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.520
is public health.
Then of course the uh,

204
00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.990
the,
in the technology,
look at the contraceptives,

205
00:14:19.991 --> 00:14:24.460
I've mentioned the means of mass communication.
I'll show you a slide later.

206
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.700
That change in behavior is in Inco is triggered by a lot by what you see on

207
00:14:32.591 --> 00:14:36.400
television,
what you see in the radio,
what you see in newspapers.
Uh,

208
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:37.990
as in chimpanzees,

209
00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.860
we're very social species and we're always looking what's acceptable,

210
00:14:41.861 --> 00:14:45.460
what kind of behavior is acceptable and gossip.
Maybe I mentioned this,

211
00:14:45.461 --> 00:14:49.180
that most of what humans say to each other as gossip and the function of gossip

212
00:14:49.181 --> 00:14:52.110
is defined.
What are the limits of acceptable behavior.

213
00:14:52.111 --> 00:14:57.111
So the mass media is extremely important in this and like telling people in this

214
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:01.040
case that two children is,
that is the proper way of families.

215
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.720
They see American television,

216
00:15:02.721 --> 00:15:06.380
American movies or Japanese and uh,

217
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.020
what do they see rich people with two children,

218
00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.570
whereas they previously believed that,
you know,

219
00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.300
in order to be rich in some sense you have to have eight children.

220
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:19.630
So the media are very important in changing perceptions.

221
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:26.090
Also for a very long time,
maybe not now,
the West had a cache had,

222
00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.090
was considered the future of the modernity.

223
00:15:29.091 --> 00:15:31.820
The West was very respected and loved around the world.

224
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:36.410
And so the use the small family norm,
uh,

225
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.080
was,
uh,
a characteristic of the western.

226
00:15:39.081 --> 00:15:42.470
A lot of people try to become like the west.

227
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.160
There was that cache and of course family planning programs.

228
00:15:46.161 --> 00:15:49.250
The West had a long experience with family planning programs.

229
00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:52.190
You've read some of the markets,
Sanger stuff from America,

230
00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:56.840
the Marie stopes stuff from England where people are struggling with these

231
00:15:56.841 --> 00:16:01.280
things and finally come out the other end and decide to gain control of their

232
00:16:01.281 --> 00:16:03.990
fertility.
So in a sense,

233
00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.530
both medically and culturally,
Westerners were the Guinea pigs for this,

234
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:13.430
uh,
fertility transition.
And then once it was,

235
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:17.000
in some sense perfected and finished in the west,

236
00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.120
it was sort of transferred wholesale to the newly developing countries.

237
00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:30.340
Now another thing about the fertility transition is that not only is it more

238
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:38.390
intense a demographically with all the statistics that we can gather,

239
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.420
but it's also more intense emotionally.

240
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.710
So as you're for sure,
well aware by now in this course,

241
00:16:45.711 --> 00:16:50.711
that there's enormously strong social norms about sex and reproduction.

242
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:56.450
And if those norms are about to change and attacks one of the most important

243
00:16:56.451 --> 00:16:59.420
foundations of a culture,
and there's not,

244
00:16:59.421 --> 00:17:04.040
that does not happen without a lot of conflict within the culture.

245
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:08.240
And so in the west,

246
00:17:08.241 --> 00:17:13.040
although there's lots of discussion about this,
the idea of individualism,

247
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:17.180
that people individually go out and do what's good for them,

248
00:17:17.181 --> 00:17:19.880
they make choices based on their own desires.

249
00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.040
There's kind of a long history of that.

250
00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.480
And it was sort of formalized by Adam Smith in economic saying that if everybody

251
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:30.380
went out and tried to get as rich as possible,
it'd be wonderful for everybody.

252
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.240
In most of the developing countries,
they have a more communal kind of attitude.

253
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.780
Whereas often if you speak to older,

254
00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:43.070
say Chinese or Indians who the smallest unit of desire,

255
00:17:43.071 --> 00:17:43.881
which they speak of,

256
00:17:43.881 --> 00:17:47.420
is the family very hard to get them to think of what they want.

257
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:52.230
It's family or village or some larger entity.

258
00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:57.600
So when you start changing norms,
so there,
the,
the norms in,

259
00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.050
in,
in non western societies or,

260
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.470
or pre modern western size are very much stronger in control of the people.

261
00:18:04.471 --> 00:18:08.610
People have less latitude to go and do their own thing.
They,
they're,

262
00:18:08.611 --> 00:18:12.210
they're under social,
much more social,
uh,
control.

263
00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:17.190
And of course all of these things,
multiple square,

264
00:18:17.191 --> 00:18:19.180
these things quadruple them.
Uh,

265
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:23.130
if you're talking about sex and one of the readings,

266
00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:25.710
I don't know if you gonna do it tonight or you did it or write about the

267
00:18:25.711 --> 00:18:30.180
Palestinian woman who was killed.
Did you,
was that not in your,

268
00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:31.650
not in your reading yet.

269
00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:36.660
So what it is that a Palestinian woman was suspected of.

270
00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:39.000
Some infidelity,
no,
no hard evidence for it.

271
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.990
And her little and her little brother killed her after searching for her for

272
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:47.820
many years.
And the idea of giving you that article is,
it's,

273
00:18:47.821 --> 00:18:48.900
it's a tear jerker,

274
00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.920
but it gives you an idea of the emotionality of the,

275
00:18:53.921 --> 00:18:55.700
the,
the,
the,
the,
uh,

276
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.220
the strength with which the older social norms are held.

277
00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:04.150
And someone who appears on the surface even mildly to violate it,
uh,

278
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:09.300
um,
can eat,
can get killed.
And a Jordanian woman,

279
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.520
uh,
uh,

280
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:15.090
road has just come out with a book 2003 on her lost.

281
00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:17.460
And she talked about her best friend.

282
00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:21.480
And this is what triggered her to patent is right the back.
This woman,

283
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:25.440
her friend had been seen in public walking with a man who's not a relative,

284
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.740
not doing anything bad,
but right there in public.
So,
you know,

285
00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:32.010
nothing was going on,
uh,
on the streets.

286
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.970
And this being seen alone,

287
00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.930
being seen on the streets of the man who was not a relative with such a stain on

288
00:19:39.931 --> 00:19:44.931
the family's honor that the woman's father stabbed her 12 times in the chest and

289
00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:48.990
then stood over the body to make sure that she was dead before calling an

290
00:19:48.991 --> 00:19:52.650
ambulance.
So imagine this,

291
00:19:52.651 --> 00:19:56.810
the strength of the cultural norms that allows him a brother to kill a sister,

292
00:19:56.811 --> 00:20:01.770
a father to kill his daughter.
In this last case,

293
00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.120
this woman who the father killed her,
uh,

294
00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:08.340
the family was not poor and was not Muslim even though it's in Jordan,

295
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.340
but they were middle class and Roman Catholic.

296
00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:16.910
So that means it's not almost nobody in these cultures escapes the cultural

297
00:20:17.611 --> 00:20:21.870
norms.
Even though,
uh,
Catholics and Jordan are,
are very small.
Minority has his,

298
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.360
uh,
middle class in Jordan.

299
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.890
They obey the same rules of the culture as everyone else.

300
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.030
And the author of that book claims that this happens to thousands of women,

301
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.440
that there's thousands of women dying and honored so called honor killings.

302
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.280
Now,
of course,
it's not restricted to the Middle East.

303
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:45.000
You will read a little bit later or reading,
uh,

304
00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:50.170
for India where a woman is raped by her father in law and her own father insists

305
00:20:50.171 --> 00:20:52.510
on killing her.
That's from India.

306
00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:57.940
And you have to contrast this with not all cultures are,
are like this.

307
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:03.110
So contrast this very tight,
strict norm about,
uh,

308
00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.260
women's giving woman any possibility for going beyond the norm.

309
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.330
Compare it with the na of China,

310
00:21:10.331 --> 00:21:13.870
which I think you've already read where everything is totally free or the

311
00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:18.040
Japanese,
the story that the Cmr,
so you're Maura women.

312
00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:20.620
Have you read that yet?
You know,
we're,
again,

313
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:22.540
there's a huge amount of sexual freedom.

314
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:26.880
So it isn't that all cultures have the same,
uh,

315
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:28.630
cultural norms,

316
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:33.950
but they all do have cultural norms and violation of those cultural norms,
uh,

317
00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.740
will be punished.

318
00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:42.400
Another thing is that in the difference between the western and the eastern

319
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:46.730
fertility transition is that the economic constraints,
the,

320
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:51.010
the level of poverty,
uh,
in the third world is,

321
00:21:51.011 --> 00:21:55.630
is much worse than it was in Europe at the time of its transition.

322
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:56.861
So there's just,

323
00:21:56.861 --> 00:22:00.250
everything is more difficult when you're poor and you're living in a poor

324
00:22:00.251 --> 00:22:04.450
country with poorly developed government,
everything is more difficult.

325
00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.290
And in your reading packet is a one,
a one page,

326
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:13.330
a collection of headlines from Tanzania and you just see all the problems that

327
00:22:13.811 --> 00:22:17.300
Tanzania is going through,
uh,

328
00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.590
in a period when uh,

329
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:24.610
their fertility is high and maybe beginning to start falling down.

330
00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:32.200
Okay.
So we have some understanding of the many ways in which,

331
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.690
uh,
statistically,

332
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:39.700
except by magnitude the fertility of the demographic transition in the countries

333
00:22:39.701 --> 00:22:40.521
that have entered it,

334
00:22:40.521 --> 00:22:45.430
it since 1960 looks very different from those that entered it in 1860

335
00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:47.530
quantitatively.
Also,

336
00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.940
when you go through a period of population growth,
the question is,
well,

337
00:22:51.941 --> 00:22:56.110
how much did your population grow all together between the beginning of the

338
00:22:56.111 --> 00:22:56.681
transition,

339
00:22:56.681 --> 00:23:01.681
which we've had the beginning in Europe in the end in Europe as your tech says

340
00:23:01.871 --> 00:23:06.700
something like 19 seven,
1870 to 1930 and,

341
00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:08.700
uh,
Europe,
uh,

342
00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:13.530
grew by about a factor of four.
Uh,

343
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:16.270
the population quadrupled.

344
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.540
This is the time when the population of the developing countries with staying

345
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.960
constants.
But developing countries,

346
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.040
India actually as far as we can predict as having one of the smallest between

347
00:23:27.041 --> 00:23:30.340
four and five.
So they're sort of at the maximum,
uh,

348
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:35.230
for Europe,
uh,
no country in Europe was more than four.
In India,

349
00:23:35.231 --> 00:23:38.770
one of the lowest countries for the developing world will be somewhere between

350
00:23:38.771 --> 00:23:39.461
four and five.

351
00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:44.461
So we expect Mexico will have grown by a factor of seven to 10 times Kenya by

352
00:23:45.861 --> 00:23:49.430
more than 15 times.
So here's again,

353
00:23:49.431 --> 00:23:53.930
countries that started the transition poor.
Uh,
they're still moderately poor.

354
00:23:53.931 --> 00:23:56.980
Mexico is doing better,
but,
uh,
uh,

355
00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:01.940
certainly Kenya's not in India is doing somewhat better and now they have to

356
00:24:01.941 --> 00:24:06.740
cope with five,
six,
seven,
eight,
nine,
10 times as much population

357
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:10.640
because of these multipliers.

358
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:15.730
The fraction of people in the different parts of the world goes first one way

359
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:19.240
and first the other way.
Uh,
before the,
uh,

360
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:21.140
the mortality transition,

361
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:26.560
Europeans represented about 18% of the world's population at its maximum when

362
00:24:28.461 --> 00:24:32.030
you're up,
had the maximum Frankie Europe and European people in America,

363
00:24:32.031 --> 00:24:36.680
Australia,
New Zealand and so forth.
But European stock people,
uh,

364
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:37.470
their fraction,

365
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:41.180
the European fraction of the world population doubled more than doubled actually

366
00:24:41.181 --> 00:24:45.380
from about doubled from 18 to 35%.

367
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:46.423
So they,

368
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:51.410
Europe was undergoing Europeans who are undergoing a huge population thing,

369
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:56.710
but now a monotonal by 1995 because Europe's population growth is over,

370
00:24:57.201 --> 00:24:58.550
European peoples are over.

371
00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:02.210
And the developing countries population growth is starting.

372
00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.040
It's back to where it started.

373
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:08.360
It's back to about 18%.

374
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:13.860
And now that's 1995.
And we've had already 13 years of,
uh,

375
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.520
population growth continuing in the developing countries.

376
00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:18.850
And it's continuing and,
uh,

377
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:22.400
getting more and more so the,

378
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:27.230
the relative percentage of people in what's now called the developing world

379
00:25:27.231 --> 00:25:29.120
versus the European world,
uh,

380
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:33.050
is going now to be so high,
uh,

381
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:37.130
in the developing countries that it's way beyond anything that was historically

382
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:42.060
the case,
except maybe when humans started moving out of Africa into,
uh,

383
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.460
the Middle East and into Europe.
So,

384
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:49.850
and this may not stable.
I mean,

385
00:25:49.851 --> 00:25:54.560
so far there is no sign that European population of almost all of the European

386
00:25:54.561 --> 00:25:58.830
population is now have fertility rates below two.
And,
uh,

387
00:25:58.940 --> 00:25:59.990
so they are going to,

388
00:25:59.991 --> 00:26:03.890
if they continue with that of course they eventually disappeared altogether.

389
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:08.000
And the idea that there's going to be some stabilization of some ratio of say

390
00:26:08.001 --> 00:26:12.060
rich and poor countries,
uh,
is,

391
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:15.200
is dependent on fertility coming up in the developed countries.

392
00:26:15.201 --> 00:26:17.810
And we don't have any reason to expect that.

393
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.800
And this is an important factor because if part of live of,

394
00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:25.521
of the,

395
00:26:25.521 --> 00:26:30.521
the developing countries coming out of poverty and is aid from the west and

396
00:26:32.331 --> 00:26:35.510
that's again a very,
everything is debated,
debatable in this course.

397
00:26:35.511 --> 00:26:39.080
How much help aid a does it actually,
there's no question about that.

398
00:26:39.081 --> 00:26:43.560
In some cases it's tremendously helpful that if there's nobody left in the

399
00:26:43.561 --> 00:26:46.680
developed countries to,
to give them,
give the aid,

400
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:51.960
then one of the props which helps develop in countries come up,
uh,

401
00:26:52.050 --> 00:26:56.430
we'll have disappeared.
Okay.

402
00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:01.940
So we've gone through the quantities of the transition,

403
00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:06.000
but you've competed,
we have compared the,

404
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.120
the demographic transition developing countries with European countries,

405
00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:13.950
but we haven't compared it to anything else.
And so,
uh,

406
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:19.670
the world populations that I've say is growing something like 70,

407
00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:23.580
80,
70 to 80 million people a year.

408
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.860
And the question is,
if we imagine some sort of a landing for this,

409
00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:34.170
what kinds of things are going to stop this population explosion?

410
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:38.590
And there's bad things and there's good things and possibility,

411
00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.560
bad possibilities and good possibilities.

412
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:45.080
So the bad possibilities and have been known for,
you know,

413
00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.690
have been thought about for a long time.
It's one famine that could,

414
00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.660
people could start storming disease aids.

415
00:27:51.661 --> 00:27:55.020
People are talking about aids balancing the popular education or war.

416
00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:59.070
So I'm going to give you some idea of the magnitude of these factors.

417
00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:01.620
So family,
uh,

418
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:06.420
one way that famine operates is some country has a big drought and they go

419
00:28:06.421 --> 00:28:11.010
through a short period of terrible famine,
but that's not the main thing.

420
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:15.120
People all over the world and especially children are malnourished and

421
00:28:15.121 --> 00:28:19.020
malnourished lists,
lists,
leads to disease.
So,

422
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:20.550
uh,

423
00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:25.380
it's very hard to get these statistics and to gather the statistics and it

424
00:28:25.381 --> 00:28:26.520
depends on who you're talking to.

425
00:28:27.150 --> 00:28:31.410
So I was teaching in a health course and the,

426
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:35.320
we sort of did a cereal lecturers and Michelle barrier,
um,

427
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:39.390
professor of international infectious diseases,
uh,

428
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:42.000
gave the lecture before mine.

429
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
So I went to her lecture to see the lay of the land and she was describing,

430
00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.970
you know,
millions of deaths from various diseases and the medical students,

431
00:28:50.971 --> 00:28:52.740
this is to medical center,
had no clue.

432
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:57.030
And they were just absolutely shocked at that,
the magnitude of what's going on,

433
00:28:57.031 --> 00:29:01.410
especially in developed countries.
And she was listing,
maybe,
you know,

434
00:29:01.411 --> 00:29:04.210
aids is about,
back then it was about 2 million a year.

435
00:29:04.211 --> 00:29:08.280
It might be 3 million and coming down,
uh,
malaria,

436
00:29:08.281 --> 00:29:12.510
tuberculosis from the one to 2 million deaths a year kind of thing,

437
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.800
diarrhea in children,
etc. These are,
there are massive killers in the world.

438
00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.420
Next week I came on and said,
you know what,

439
00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:27.260
there's x millions of deaths from malnutrition and there they were shocked cause

440
00:29:27.901 --> 00:29:32.130
it's even bigger number than than Dr. Barry had given.
And so I said,
you know,

441
00:29:32.131 --> 00:29:34.770
what did the same depths you heard about last week?

442
00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:39.960
So the thing is something like,
I don't remember the number of American,

443
00:29:39.961 --> 00:29:42.820
something like if you take a skin test for tuberculosis,

444
00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:48.120
something like a third to a half of us have been exposed to the TB a bug so that

445
00:29:49.331 --> 00:29:50.800
we have antibodies against it.

446
00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.310
We basically in some sense in a small sense of had TB,

447
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:58.120
if you go to India where people have had it,

448
00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:03.040
but the fraction that actually come down and get sick are much,
much higher.

449
00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:07.600
Why malnutrition that all of the diseases,
if you're malnourished,

450
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:11.530
your immune system and your other body systems can't fight the bug so you

451
00:30:11.531 --> 00:30:14.110
actually get sick and will often die.

452
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:17.950
So there's a big uh,
uh,

453
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:22.960
discussion of when you see a deaf to say,
uh,

454
00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.273
TB.

455
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:29.530
Is that death caused by the tuberculosis bacillus or is that death caused by

456
00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:34.620
malnutrition and the World Health Organization and a lot of other groups are now

457
00:30:36.161 --> 00:30:41.161
saying that about half the deaths from all of these things are really at a base

458
00:30:42.130 --> 00:30:45.370
caused by malnutrition that at the level of infection,

459
00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.850
but that the people are exposed to,
you should see so many deaths.

460
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:53.100
But you actually see twice that many deaths because,
uh,

461
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.940
people are hungry.

462
00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:59.770
So the numbers from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,

463
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:04.990
or is that 25,000 people die every day?

464
00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:10.030
Like today,
25,000 people will die from starvation or malnutrition.

465
00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:14.110
That's a huge number.
It's 9 million deaths a year.

466
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:19.090
And so I kind of get out during the course of this lecture of 1,300 people will

467
00:31:19.091 --> 00:31:22.660
die of starvation or malnutrition.

468
00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:28.000
So it's really very serious,
uh,
most of the day.
Yeah.

469
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:32.970
<v 2>What,
how many people will be born during this lecture?</v>

470
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:37.240
<v 0>[inaudible] also a very large number.
More than the deaths we've seen that the,</v>

471
00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:41.550
you can calculate yourself,
have the,
uh,
the,
the,

472
00:31:41.551 --> 00:31:43.480
the birth rate is something like three times,

473
00:31:43.481 --> 00:31:48.340
two and a half times the death rate,
but that's not just a.com.

474
00:31:48.341 --> 00:31:51.520
You can sort of double the total number of desks will be something a little more

475
00:31:51.521 --> 00:31:54.700
than double the deaths from,
uh,
malnutrition.

476
00:31:55.570 --> 00:32:00.570
So a lot the population is still growing up at as you've seen because we do have

477
00:32:01.061 --> 00:32:04.420
a lot more births than deaths.
I showed you that data before.

478
00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:10.210
So malnutrition is the leading cause of death in children in developing

479
00:32:10.211 --> 00:32:12.190
countries and

480
00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:13.563
<v 2>mmm,</v>

481
00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.630
<v 0>the numbers you read are all over the place.</v>

482
00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:22.090
And one number that I pulled out as 13 million child deaths a year.
Uh,

483
00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.250
and I've seen uh,
lower than that.
Uh,

484
00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:29.930
the World Bank in the middle,
it's millennium goals.
Uh,
you know,

485
00:32:29.931 --> 00:32:31.100
the big millennium goal thing,

486
00:32:31.101 --> 00:32:34.760
what the whole world is supposed to go to says again that half the deaths of

487
00:32:34.761 --> 00:32:39.120
children under five are due to malnutrition and oh,

488
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.120
so this all together for all reasons.

489
00:32:41.121 --> 00:32:46.121
There's 13 million child deaths a year and you get numbers from different sized

490
00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:51.590
anywhere between a third and a half of these deaths are due to malnutrition.

491
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.770
And what is malnutrition look like?
You may have seen,

492
00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.633
<v 2>uh,</v>

493
00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:02.440
<v 0>this is quite short core.
How many of you heard of that?</v>

494
00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.680
It's very prevalent kind of thing too.
I haven't signed in the village.

495
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:10.210
You go to a village in,
in poor places and you see these distended bellies,

496
00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.020
this is
everywhere.

497
00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.830
And actually we don't even know even that is a tremendously prevalent thing.

498
00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:19.420
We don't actually know the cause of it.

499
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:22.180
The old story was that it's a protein deficiency,

500
00:33:22.181 --> 00:33:27.181
disease and protein makes albumin albumin that holds water into the blood and

501
00:33:28.451 --> 00:33:30.670
the tissues.
And when you can't hold water,

502
00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:35.230
it's sort of floods into your tissues and,
and,
and,
and spreads out.

503
00:33:35.231 --> 00:33:39.400
But now there's a lot of other theories and we just don't know really what's the

504
00:33:39.401 --> 00:33:42.730
basic cause of course,
crush your core.
It is malnutrition.
That's,

505
00:33:42.731 --> 00:33:45.870
there's no question about it.
But exactly what in the Diet is,

506
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.780
is missing is not totally clear.

507
00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:52.060
Here's another kind of shocking pan.

508
00:33:52.061 --> 00:33:56.260
Now I'm going to give you some shocking pictures and,
and uh,
uh,

509
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:59.530
tear jerkers but it's important to see.
It seems saying

510
00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:05.200
this is an American missionary or aid worker.
I don't know which.

511
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:08.410
And that's her baby.
And that's this baby and they're both six months old

512
00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.000
<v 2>in Africa.
Um,</v>

513
00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:17.700
<v 0>another thing that happens is that population,</v>

514
00:34:17.701 --> 00:34:19.230
when population grows,

515
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:24.270
the people who are strongest take the best land and they push people that are

516
00:34:24.271 --> 00:34:28.230
less strong for less population or less violent or whatever reason or less

517
00:34:28.231 --> 00:34:32.580
technologically advanced,
they push them into marginal land like deserts.

518
00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:37.850
And this is the site in Mali of what used to be one of the largest lakes in

519
00:34:38.581 --> 00:34:42.380
Africa.
And then it goes through periodic,
uh,

520
00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:45.150
climatic things.
It dries out every so often.

521
00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:49.830
And so in some sense people should not be living there because you know,

522
00:34:49.831 --> 00:34:52.470
it's going to there,
you know,
goes every so often through droughts,

523
00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:56.130
but they have no choice because stronger peoples in the past have pushed them

524
00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.680
into these desert kind of regions.

525
00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:03.360
One of the results of population explosion they've told you in Europe where the

526
00:35:03.361 --> 00:35:08.310
extra farmers had to go up hillsides and into less,
less profitable land.

527
00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:13.040
So there they are in this,
uh,
very arid region and in,

528
00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:18.600
in normal years they can survive but then come to drought and this kind of thing

529
00:35:19.261 --> 00:35:22.120
happens.
And the result,
of course,
this is a,

530
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:25.110
a boy who is I think nine years old or something.

531
00:35:25.111 --> 00:35:27.970
He's 13 pounds and uh,

532
00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.120
almost impossible

533
00:35:31.740 --> 00:35:34.380
to keep the boy alive.

534
00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:38.850
And here's one of the really pictures that,
you know,

535
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:44.090
in the political discourse about population and fertility and family planning in

536
00:35:45.151 --> 00:35:48.570
America,
there's a lot of motherhood.
You know,
how wonderful motherhood,

537
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:53.250
everything,
but you have to see,
well,
oops,
okay,
I didn't show that.
I've got,

538
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:57.000
I put it in the wrong picture,
which is maybe good.
Good for you.

539
00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:00.120
Now you've seen a lot of these pictures.

540
00:36:00.121 --> 00:36:03.060
The organization's I want you to give money,
show a lot of them.

541
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:08.660
And one of the discussion items about these kinds of pictures is that it makes

542
00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:12.420
people in poor countries seem sort of helpless.
And that's not true.

543
00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:15.840
Then the amount of stuff that people in [inaudible] are doing to try to help

544
00:36:15.841 --> 00:36:19.680
themselves is enormous.
They can be very strong and very smart people,

545
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.850
but the resources are very limited what they can work with.

546
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:32.130
Okay.
Um,
and so the,

547
00:36:32.131 --> 00:36:32.431
the,

548
00:36:32.431 --> 00:36:37.431
the bottom line of this little bit is that given the number of deaths that we

549
00:36:37.831 --> 00:36:42.831
understand to be from malnutrition and given the number of d of population

550
00:36:43.411 --> 00:36:47.160
increase,
if the solution is to be solved by famine,

551
00:36:47.161 --> 00:36:50.610
if the balancing of births and deaths is going to be a famine situation,

552
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:55.920
a starvation rate has to increase by a factor of eight,
you know,
plus or minus.

553
00:36:57.630 --> 00:37:00.900
The next thing is a disease is the second of our,

554
00:37:00.901 --> 00:37:03.090
of our triplet of horrible solutions.

555
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:08.690
And in 2008 it killed about 3 million people up from 2 million.

556
00:37:09.781 --> 00:37:13.560
This is clearly apparently the peak everyone breaking because of the retrovirals

557
00:37:13.561 --> 00:37:16.230
and various other public health measures,
uh,

558
00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:20.340
the number of supposed to go down and the,

559
00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:25.260
the numbers are already changing in the end.
By the end,
at the end of 2007,

560
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:30.710
the UN got a whole bunch of better data from certain countries and they had to,

561
00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.470
they lowered the number of people they thought

562
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:40.110
to be infected with the AIDS virus by 6.3 million.

563
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:44.190
So something like 33 million people infected with AIDS.

564
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:48.900
And presumably they will all die at some point or the other retrovirals can keep

565
00:37:48.901 --> 00:37:49.734
them alive.

566
00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:55.010
Long time notice that 33 million is less than half of one year as population

567
00:37:55.531 --> 00:37:58.500
growth,
uh,
from,
from aids.

568
00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:04.160
And it's the way it works out demographically is here is a somewhat older data

569
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:10.680
at the from the peak of the,
of the AIDS epidemic.

570
00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:15.960
This is the impact,
uh,
in sub Saharan Africa with and without aids.

571
00:38:15.961 --> 00:38:19.140
So the gray,
uh,
the,
the,
I'm sorry,

572
00:38:19.141 --> 00:38:21.720
the purple is the way the population is.

573
00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.230
It was Scott was modeled to increase,
uh,

574
00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:28.890
without aids is if there was no aids.
And then with AIDS,

575
00:38:28.891 --> 00:38:32.760
AIDS kills these people basically prevents these births.
Uh,

576
00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:37.450
you still have an enormous population increase for sub Saharan Africa,

577
00:38:37.451 --> 00:38:41.740
which is the worst effected place.
And this was one of the,
uh,

578
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:44.800
the worst scenario.
They did a worst scenario run.

579
00:38:44.890 --> 00:38:47.380
They tried to imagine things to be about as bad as they could get.

580
00:38:49.450 --> 00:38:51.130
This thing,
when you do it for a whole,

581
00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.370
most of a continent hides a lot of difference.

582
00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:56.890
So this is Uganda,

583
00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:01.930
which has had an intelligent response to AIDS.
And here,

584
00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:02.920
uh,

585
00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:05.950
with AIDS there'll be this much and without aids that would have been this much.

586
00:39:05.951 --> 00:39:10.030
But population keeps growing.
Any case in South Africa,

587
00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:12.670
which is about the worst really badly hit place,

588
00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.820
you do see that population growth without aids would be this.

589
00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:20.590
And they're actually expecting population growth to come down as a result of

590
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:24.070
AIDS.
So in some countries it has a,

591
00:39:24.071 --> 00:39:26.290
an important demographic effect,

592
00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:29.350
but for sub Saharan Africa as a whole,

593
00:39:29.351 --> 00:39:32.500
not an enormous effect in the rest of the world where at least so far the

594
00:39:32.501 --> 00:39:35.680
numbers are much smaller.
Uh,
a minor factor.

595
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:39.430
It can easily get lost in this statistical noise that we don't know how many

596
00:39:39.431 --> 00:39:40.090
people are in earth.

597
00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:44.860
We don't know exactly how fast the population's growing and AIDS can be within

598
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.380
that statistical noise.

599
00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:52.090
So from a demographic point of view,
uh,

600
00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:57.340
aids as a killer is a significant,
well,

601
00:39:57.341 --> 00:39:58.174
let me show you.

602
00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:02.650
So this is another thing that kills 1.6 million people.

603
00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:06.910
More than half of the AIDS number.
You'll never guess what that is.

604
00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:09.213
It's this,

605
00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:14.170
it's smoked from cooking fires that in the developing countries and the poor

606
00:40:14.171 --> 00:40:14.890
countries,

607
00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:19.180
this is the way people cook and the smoke fills the room,

608
00:40:19.181 --> 00:40:21.970
gets into their lungs and they get all kinds of diseases extra.

609
00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:27.600
And the estimates of that is 1.6 million deaths comparable to tuberculosis and

610
00:40:28.241 --> 00:40:31.600
malaria and somewhat less than aids,

611
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:35.320
but they have a solution to this loops.

612
00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:40.830
And it's a stove that keeps that,
that you don't get these kinds of smoke with.

613
00:40:40.831 --> 00:40:45.831
And those costs $10 each and they'll cut out a number of desks,

614
00:40:46.631 --> 00:40:50.080
equivalent to half of the AIDS deaths.

615
00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:52.330
So one of the things when,

616
00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:56.200
if you're interested in and understanding the magnitude of the problems of the

617
00:40:56.201 --> 00:40:56.441
world,

618
00:40:56.441 --> 00:40:59.860
one of the things you just have to pay attention to is the magnitude of the

619
00:40:59.861 --> 00:41:04.080
problem and the magnitude of any solution.
And when there's a,

620
00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:09.140
an almost sure thing at $10 available and retroviral rurals costs an awful lot

621
00:41:10.031 --> 00:41:11.740
more,
uh,
you know,

622
00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:16.030
which kind of person are you going to try to save the person that can be saved

623
00:41:16.031 --> 00:41:21.031
by $10 for the person that needs $1,000 to be saved if you have limited kinds of

624
00:41:21.131 --> 00:41:26.020
money.
So,
uh,
from a demographic point of view,

625
00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:30.970
the problem with the almost worst than the total number of deaths,

626
00:41:30.971 --> 00:41:34.490
because you know,
malaria has been people for long time and,

627
00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.980
and TB and these are all horrible situation.
Of course,

628
00:41:36.981 --> 00:41:39.350
every death is a horrible sort of thing,

629
00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:44.600
but aids kills people in the prime of their life.
And that's,

630
00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:47.390
this is what we call hollowing out of the age structure.

631
00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.250
So there's children who are dependent,

632
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.190
there's adults who work and there's old people who are dependent.

633
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.920
If you kill off your working people,

634
00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:58.520
that leaves the kids with no one to take care of them,

635
00:41:58.521 --> 00:42:00.620
no one to provide economically for them.

636
00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.760
That leaves the old people with no one to take care of them.

637
00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:08.810
So an addition.
So the,

638
00:42:08.811 --> 00:42:12.470
the direct deaths from AIDS itself is one horrible thing.

639
00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:16.880
But what they do to taking care of everybody else in the population,
uh,

640
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:22.400
multiplies than affected by a lot.
And as of 2001,

641
00:42:22.401 --> 00:42:24.170
the last statistic that I could find,

642
00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:29.450
there's about 12 million children that had been orphaned in Africa,
uh,

643
00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.010
due to AIDS.

644
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:34.700
And that is we do a lot of work in the political refugees.

645
00:42:34.701 --> 00:42:39.701
That's tripled the number of political refugees that there are in Africa.

646
00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:44.270
Okay.
So we've done a famine disease and,

647
00:42:44.271 --> 00:42:48.740
and wars is the last set of numbers and you hear it,

648
00:42:48.741 --> 00:42:53.030
cocktail parties at some war or pick whatever the current war is,
you know,

649
00:42:53.031 --> 00:42:57.800
we'll balance births and deaths.
So the worst we've had is the atom bombs.

650
00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:01.580
And underneath your know what the numbers on the atom bombs are.

651
00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:05.150
But the Hiroshima bomb killed 75,000 people.

652
00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.360
The Nagasaki Bomb Killed 25,000 people.

653
00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:12.800
That's 100,000 people dead into quick flashes.

654
00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:19.580
But the population on earth grows by approximately 200,000 a day.

655
00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:23.900
So what that means that if we can imagine and all these are imaginary,

656
00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:29.290
if we imagine that some wars are going to balance births and deaths on earth,

657
00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:34.780
that means that every day you have to blow up to Nagasaki bombs and to Hiroshima

658
00:43:36.021 --> 00:43:39.800
bombs killing that equivalent number of people just to keep even,

659
00:43:39.801 --> 00:43:44.000
that doesn't reduce population that just keeps,
uh,
population flat.

660
00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:49.160
It's an idea of giving you all these horrible numbers is just to give you an

661
00:43:49.161 --> 00:43:51.310
idea of the magnitude of,
of,

662
00:43:51.550 --> 00:43:56.390
of this issue and that it's of course,
absolutely unthinkable.

663
00:43:56.690 --> 00:44:01.690
That one sort of continues to just let this pop this situation go rampantly

664
00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:07.040
until one of these negative kind of disasters happens.

665
00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:10.820
There's going to be,
uh,
there's gotta be a solution.

666
00:44:10.821 --> 00:44:13.670
We have to figure it out in some way.

667
00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:17.890
Okay.
So,
so far in the last lecture,

668
00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:20.550
so I've obviously been what we call apocalyptic,
you know,

669
00:44:20.551 --> 00:44:25.551
that the world is coming to an end and due to population explosion,

670
00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.660
uh,
but there's a famous saying,
uh,
to the opposite,

671
00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:33.210
which is that if something can't go on forever,
it won't.

672
00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.400
And I think that,
uh,
has a large chance of happening.

673
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:39.880
And I,
I've,

674
00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:44.930
I've described some of this already to you last lecture and I'm going to talk

675
00:44:47.071 --> 00:44:48.090
more about it right now.

676
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:52.080
So consider that these two interviews,

677
00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:55.860
one is an interview very much like the one of the ones in your readings.

678
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.760
It's from Mali in 1983.
Uh,
see Tom,

679
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:03.750
this is the woman who's heard about contrast on the contraceptive pill but has

680
00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:08.730
not used it.
Interviewer sitaution how many children are more,

681
00:45:08.731 --> 00:45:12.540
would you like to have,
ah,
that is for God to decide.

682
00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:17.280
Interviewer,
you yourself,
how many more children would you like?
How many,

683
00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.070
how many children would you like to have in your whole life?

684
00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.780
I don't know the number.

685
00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.710
It's when God stops my births and interview.

686
00:45:25.711 --> 00:45:28.410
How many boys and how many girls?
Who would you like to have?

687
00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:32.970
It's God that gives me children.
Since it is God that gives or not you,

688
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.270
you cannot make a choice about your children.
You've read some of these.

689
00:45:36.271 --> 00:45:37.950
This is a different country,
a different time.

690
00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:42.660
But this is a not uncommon sort of attitude where people,

691
00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:47.040
you know,
women especially just can't,
it's not within their,
their,

692
00:45:47.041 --> 00:45:49.890
their calculus of conscious choice.

693
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:54.290
Now in Bangladesh,
which is again,

694
00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:58.530
both of these countries or Muslim Bangladesh shoes,
more,
uh,

695
00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:02.670
conservative,
uh,
uh,
religiously,
uh,

696
00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:07.050
the poverty getting better now,
but it was about the same.

697
00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:11.550
So these are the d the socio economic indicators for the two countries or about

698
00:46:11.551 --> 00:46:15.630
the same,
but the government in Bangladesh,
uh,
was very different.

699
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:19.620
And the government of,
from very early on,
uh,

700
00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.710
we decided that that they would make family planning available in the country

701
00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:30.750
and the international groups then came on board and said,
okay,
we will help you.

702
00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:36.980
And so this is now another interview with an 18 year old girl named Shemy Ron.

703
00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:43.170
And she is just learning that there is such a thing about her birth control.

704
00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:46.800
And the reason she knows about it is that,

705
00:46:46.801 --> 00:46:49.410
and you'll read about and you're going to read about the family planning program

706
00:46:49.411 --> 00:46:53.940
and the results in Bangladesh is that,
uh,
as I said,

707
00:46:53.941 --> 00:46:55.500
Bangladesh is a very conservative Muslim.

708
00:46:55.501 --> 00:46:59.610
So women are generally not allowed out of the house to get medical service,

709
00:46:59.611 --> 00:47:00.444
for instance.

710
00:47:00.930 --> 00:47:04.020
And so just to go out and talk to women's meetings where these things get

711
00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:05.400
discussed,
no,
they can't do that.

712
00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:10.850
So the family planning program in Bangladesh,
the government program and the,

713
00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:15.630
and the private program hired high class women from that community,

714
00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:20.340
uh,
who themselves were using family planning and,
and Billy and thought it,

715
00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:25.230
it was good and sent them into the houses of poor women who couldn't come out.

716
00:47:25.530 --> 00:47:28.510
This is kind of like if Mohammed the mountain won't come to Muhammad Muhammad

717
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:30.160
and go,
go to the mountain.

718
00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:34.300
And so the people in the village all know about this woman who will muck Demar.

719
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:37.780
That was her name and she's considered a health worker.

720
00:47:37.781 --> 00:47:41.120
And she actually gave her aunt,
her aunt was an acceptor and mocked him.

721
00:47:41.121 --> 00:47:46.060
[inaudible] was giving,
came by regularly to give around pills and the girls,

722
00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:48.910
uh,
knew about it,
but they didn't really understand it.

723
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:54.040
And so they went and asked the aunt,
the girl or Shemy Ron,
uh,

724
00:47:54.370 --> 00:47:56.560
and to the ant refuse to tell her anything because again,

725
00:47:56.561 --> 00:48:00.610
the social conservatism that these matters will be explained to her only when

726
00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:04.330
she's married and she's not to know anything about this now.

727
00:48:04.900 --> 00:48:07.600
So what did the kid do?
Like every kid,
everywhere else in the world,

728
00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:11.500
she goes to school and talks to her friends and then they also pick little bits

729
00:48:11.501 --> 00:48:14.350
of information and misinformation and uh,

730
00:48:14.770 --> 00:48:19.540
pull it together from the other girls.
Some of them apparently knew of McDurmont.

731
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:22.150
Some of them didn't know about her.
I'm sorry.

732
00:48:22.151 --> 00:48:25.300
I said everyone in the village knows.
No,
apparently they didn't.
But since her,

733
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:29.980
this girl's aunt was getting pills from [inaudible] uh,
she knew about it,

734
00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:34.180
but everyone of her schoolmates was interested.
One girl said,

735
00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:39.490
I would like to work as she does.
She,
him look at her,
she wears her,

736
00:48:39.491 --> 00:48:42.760
sorry so nicely and goes to different neighborhoods.

737
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:47.230
My sister told me she earns a good amount of money,
others said,

738
00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:50.890
but my father and grandmother says she's not a good lady.

739
00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:56.620
Shemy Ron said,
grandmothers and fathers are always behind the times.

740
00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:59.020
They do not want to let girls go to school.

741
00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.180
I didn't want to consider their opinions.

742
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:05.200
I like MCHDI Ma's work and I will have pills to control births.

743
00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:10.200
Some girls said,
yes,
I think we should have this medicine,
should we,

744
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:14.710
so we will not have so many problems with so many children with few children

745
00:49:14.711 --> 00:49:17.260
will be able to keep our saris clean and nice.

746
00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:22.330
Then everybody laughed together and that apparently ended that interview.

747
00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:25.050
So this is uh,

748
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:29.650
an older generation versus the younger generation.
Uh,

749
00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:33.570
and there's an interest of the girls is they self perceive it and the interest

750
00:49:33.571 --> 00:49:38.380
of the older generation as they are trying to impose it on the younger

751
00:49:38.381 --> 00:49:41.320
generation.
It's a very clear kind of a conflict situation.

752
00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:46.000
The girls see having many children is just causing a lot of problems and what

753
00:49:46.001 --> 00:49:48.190
the girls are instead as not having a lot of children as,

754
00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:49.570
which was terribly important to their,

755
00:49:49.630 --> 00:49:51.670
certainly their grandparents and probably their parents.

756
00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:55.000
They want to have nice clean Saris and,
and,
and,
and look nice.

757
00:49:55.330 --> 00:49:58.990
They want to be able to earn money and go around to different neighborhoods.

758
00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:04.000
And they either the older generation trying to keep them out of school,

759
00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:08.230
keep this information away from them,
et Cetera,
and keep them in the mold,
uh,

760
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:09.183
previously.

761
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:14.830
But the girls in that society are pretty much powerless because,
uh,

762
00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:19.120
even though the,
the agent marriage has risen shemy Ron's already 18,

763
00:50:19.121 --> 00:50:23.050
which traditionally is terribly old for girl to be on married,

764
00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:24.460
she will eventually get married,

765
00:50:24.461 --> 00:50:29.090
move in with her husband and the husband will also be a teenager probably.

766
00:50:29.091 --> 00:50:31.010
And we'll have not say much in the,

767
00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:35.060
the husband's mother will be the arbiter of,

768
00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.740
of medical things,

769
00:50:36.741 --> 00:50:41.741
reproductive things so that both the son and the daughter in law will be under

770
00:50:42.561 --> 00:50:44.230
the control primarily of the mother-in-law.

771
00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.500
And so it's the mother-in-law's opinions that count the mother-in-law's attitude

772
00:50:48.501 --> 00:50:52.670
toward reproduction.
That counts very often.
Uh,

773
00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.350
we in the west say that it's the,

774
00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:57.920
it's the problem is all with men that near the Macho men,
uh,

775
00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:01.820
for swimming it to having children.
And some of that is certainly true.

776
00:51:01.821 --> 00:51:06.050
And sometimes in Latin America,
a fair amount of that can be true.
But in,

777
00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.470
in Asia,
it's very often the mother-in-law,
wherever you see that,

778
00:51:09.471 --> 00:51:13.190
the young girl to get married young,
the husband and wife are both young.

779
00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:18.440
They move into the husband's house,
which is the grandparents house.

780
00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:22.070
Then the boy will be under control of his mother and the new wife will be

781
00:51:22.071 --> 00:51:25.070
perhaps almost a slave to that mother.
And so you have many,

782
00:51:25.071 --> 00:51:29.750
many instances where both the boy and the husband and the young girl wife do not

783
00:51:29.751 --> 00:51:33.080
want to have children,
but they don't have any choice.

784
00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:36.830
So in matters of reproduction,

785
00:51:36.831 --> 00:51:40.550
it's mother-in-law's who the dominant transmitters of,
of,

786
00:51:40.551 --> 00:51:45.551
of culture and the thing in the world.

787
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:52.030
So I showed you in the data at the beginning of last lecture that the Shammy

788
00:51:53.331 --> 00:51:57.950
runs of the earth who are not so enamored of having a lot of children have taken

789
00:51:57.951 --> 00:52:01.610
over from the Tetons of the earth who will have as many as,

790
00:52:01.611 --> 00:52:05.630
as they're going to have.
And the data was,

791
00:52:05.631 --> 00:52:09.860
was very strong.
That women in the developing countries,
uh,

792
00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:13.100
don't want all the children that they're currently having.

793
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:18.020
And you've seen new data and you've seen old data from that.

794
00:52:18.021 --> 00:52:20.290
I showed you Bolivia,
new data.
You could,
I can,

795
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:24.050
you can come up to my office and see the demographic and health surveys and pick

796
00:52:24.051 --> 00:52:29.051
a country and it's pretty much all the same with the exceptions of sub Saharan

797
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:32.750
Africa is someone exception.
And some of the Arab countries,

798
00:52:32.751 --> 00:52:33.650
not the Muslim countries,

799
00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:37.870
many Muslim countries have really reduced their fertility but Arab countries are

800
00:52:37.871 --> 00:52:41.120
going through uh,
a nonstandard situation.

801
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:45.340
This information has been,
God has,

802
00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:47.840
we've had this since about the 1960s.

803
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:51.770
We had it for about a half a century knowledge that,
that,

804
00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:55.940
that women in the developing world don't really want the children that they're

805
00:52:55.941 --> 00:52:58.220
having in 1960.
And uh,

806
00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:02.450
they started with a surveys called kap knowledge,
attitude,

807
00:53:02.451 --> 00:53:07.430
practice knowledge.
Did you know about contraception attitude?

808
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:10.460
What do you,
do you want it,
what do you think about it and practice?

809
00:53:10.461 --> 00:53:12.260
Are you actually using it?

810
00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:16.160
And then from 1972 to 82,
there were,
uh,

811
00:53:16.450 --> 00:53:20.960
a survey is called the world fertility survey,
which were improved from that,

812
00:53:20.961 --> 00:53:22.340
from the K P surveys.

813
00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:27.760
And they reached 62 countries with 350,000 women interviewed.

814
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:33.010
And then from 1985,
they've been coming on with,
uh,

815
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:34.950
these demographic and health surveys,

816
00:53:34.951 --> 00:53:39.750
which are more or less standardized across the world and from which the data I

817
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.033
gave you came.

818
00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:47.430
And so if you listen to the verbal report of these women,

819
00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:51.240
they say they don't want,
uh,
these children.

820
00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:55.020
But the question you have to always question,
you know,

821
00:53:55.380 --> 00:53:58.350
scientists question everything,
you know,
okay,
they say that,

822
00:53:58.351 --> 00:54:01.920
but how much oomph is behind it?
It could be,
you know,
an interviewer comes in,

823
00:54:01.921 --> 00:54:05.570
obviously a very modern person,
you know,
that modern people sort of think that,

824
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:07.980
that the modern way is to have fewer children.

825
00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:11.070
So you may very well answer them in that way.

826
00:54:11.071 --> 00:54:13.350
So you can never be sure of the servers.

827
00:54:13.351 --> 00:54:17.370
You always have to look at what are people actually doing.
And,

828
00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:22.680
uh,
there were various ways that you can find out if this is a real,

829
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:26.850
uh,
a desire backed by,
by behavior.

830
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:30.170
And one of the things as well,
how permanent,
if,

831
00:54:30.180 --> 00:54:34.860
if of those women that choose some sort of a family planning method,

832
00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:37.890
uh,
how permanent is it?
How,
how,
how good is it?

833
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:40.800
And it turns out that basically everywhere in the world,

834
00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:44.910
sterilization is the dominant choice of,

835
00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:49.620
of family planning.
And in Brazil,

836
00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:54.720
uh,
friends in the late by the late 1980s and their facility has come down from

837
00:54:54.721 --> 00:54:55.020
them,

838
00:54:55.020 --> 00:55:00.020
40% of married women using contraception in fact chose to,

839
00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:04.770
uh,
to be sterilized over all the other methods.
Now,

840
00:55:04.771 --> 00:55:08.670
you might think that this was the poorest women who chose this,

841
00:55:08.671 --> 00:55:10.140
that they were kind of desperate.

842
00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:14.040
Maybe they were influenced by family planning workers to just get it over with.

843
00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:18.930
Uh,
and I've heard polemical arguments saying that,
oh,

844
00:55:18.931 --> 00:55:19.920
these sterilization things,

845
00:55:19.921 --> 00:55:24.060
because that was what was pushed upon them by some family planning program.

846
00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:25.810
But in fact,
uh,

847
00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:30.330
to Sussex are very clear that the higher the income level of the woman,

848
00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:34.410
the greater likelihood that she was to choose a sterilization.

849
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:38.220
Uh,
one of these,
have any of you seen this?

850
00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:42.690
This feeling about the testing of the birth control pill in Puerto Rico called

851
00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:43.660
[inaudible]?

852
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:48.480
It's sort of a far feminist thing but very shown,

853
00:55:48.481 --> 00:55:51.610
very frequently claiming.
So the birth,

854
00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:55.860
one of the places that the birth control pill from invented America was tested

855
00:55:55.861 --> 00:56:00.861
was in Puerto Rico and it shows a lot of people and they're talking in Spanish,

856
00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:04.650
but there's a narrator speaking in English,
which most everybody can understand.

857
00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:08.250
And s and the narrator is saying how terrible everything is that these women

858
00:56:08.251 --> 00:56:10.080
weren't told what was going on,
blah,
blah.

859
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:15.360
And what you see when the narrator is speaking is an older woman who wasn't

860
00:56:15.361 --> 00:56:20.361
eligible to be a subject in the test at night climbing into the window at the

861
00:56:21.001 --> 00:56:24.790
basement of the hospital to get the birth control pill.

862
00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.750
And the narrator says nothing about that,
but they're showing this to you.

863
00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:30.040
Have you seen it or no?

864
00:56:30.041 --> 00:56:35.041
I saw you had sort of a hand up in the U S so among African educated women that

865
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:38.740
nobody has presumably pushing around.
Um,

866
00:56:39.460 --> 00:56:42.370
13.8 million.
This is a,

867
00:56:42.970 --> 00:56:47.970
a million women use Tubal ligation of female form of sterilization as their

868
00:56:48.131 --> 00:56:51.490
method of birth control.
And less than that 13.2 million,

869
00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:55.090
we're using the birth control pill.
So in the United States,

870
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:56.800
like in almost every other country,

871
00:56:56.980 --> 00:57:00.640
sterilization is the chosen means.

872
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:03.530
And uh,

873
00:57:03.670 --> 00:57:08.080
I think that's one indicator that when people say they want a reduced fertility,

874
00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:13.240
they,
they really mean it.
Sometimes,
uh,

875
00:57:14.610 --> 00:57:15.310
uh,

876
00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:20.310
family planning contraception is not available and then people can get into very

877
00:57:20.771 --> 00:57:23.770
desperate situations.
So

878
00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:28.800
an American,
a maternity nurse,
uh,

879
00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:32.050
went to Lusaka,
Zambia,

880
00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:35.800
and this is the university teaching hospital in Zambia.

881
00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:39.130
So most of these developed countries will have a capital city and they have one

882
00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:42.550
high class hospital.
It'll usually being attached to a university.

883
00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.240
And that's demanded by the upper class of that country,
the political elite,

884
00:57:46.241 --> 00:57:50.060
the economic elite demand,
good modern medical service.

885
00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:54.270
It will be one hospital there.
And you can look at the uh,
the,

886
00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:58.900
the public health budget for these countries in a very disproportionate amount

887
00:57:58.901 --> 00:58:00.670
of it will go to this one hospital.

888
00:58:01.180 --> 00:58:06.040
So this university teaching hospital in Lusaka is the high level hospital in

889
00:58:06.041 --> 00:58:09.430
Zambia.
And this nurse went into the maternity ward.

890
00:58:09.431 --> 00:58:14.431
She's a maternity nurse expecting to see a lot of women having children.

891
00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:17.350
But instead,
this is what this is her report.

892
00:58:18.070 --> 00:58:22.270
10 women with botched abortions were lying on nine beds,

893
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:26.440
five others were sprawled on the concrete floors of the hallways,

894
00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:30.460
a few more on the whole,
on the floor,
outside the entrance.

895
00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:35.740
There were no blankets or covers most wait 12 hours for treatment from a

896
00:58:35.741 --> 00:58:36.574
physician.

897
00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:40.840
The quote average woman ends up overnight on the floor.

898
00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:45.300
She receives no food or water.
The women were boarding on the,

899
00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:49.660
on the floors or on their way to the single toilet.
At the end of the long haul,

900
00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:54.220
30% of the patients complete their abortions on the concrete floor with no

901
00:58:54.221 --> 00:58:57.070
medical care.
All we can do is clean it up.

902
00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:01.600
That's the head nurse there said that all we can do is clean it up.

903
00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:05.400
And this is not isolated to this one hospital.

904
00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:10.410
You go anywhere in the underdeveloped world and at least half the beds in

905
00:59:11.261 --> 00:59:16.261
maternity wards are taken up with botched abortions.

906
00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:19.120
And what goes on is in most of African,

907
00:59:19.121 --> 00:59:23.900
a lot of the world abortionist illegal so doctors can't do it.

908
00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:26.330
So they go into or in call Bush doctors,

909
00:59:26.331 --> 00:59:31.220
but some very poorly trained midwife or someone who just says they'll do it and

910
00:59:31.221 --> 00:59:35.360
they have this operation.
And usually something is,
is uh,

911
00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:41.050
put up a stick or coat hanger or something up to the uterus and they tried to

912
00:59:41.241 --> 00:59:44.390
scrape out the fetus.
But in fact,
they often puncture the uterus,

913
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:49.190
which allows infection to get into the main body cavity.

914
00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:52.370
And then after a few days,
uh,
the,

915
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:55.500
they're getting very sick from the infection then,

916
00:59:55.501 --> 00:59:58.350
which is now systemic because it's inside the body.
Uh,

917
00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.440
plus the wound doesn't heal because of the infection.

918
01:00:00.441 --> 01:00:04.880
So there's constant bleeding and they can lead out huge death rates.

919
01:00:04.881 --> 01:00:08.000
We're going to talk about abortion later and I'll give you some of these
numbers,

920
01:00:08.001 --> 01:00:09.080
but huge death rates.

921
01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:14.490
The important point for this course is that probably all of these women know a,

922
01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.810
of someone else who has died from one of these.

923
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:22.460
And so we call them unprofessional,
uh,
abortions.

924
01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.460
And um,

925
01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:29.480
and yet when they get pregnant,

926
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:33.230
their desire not to have an x child is so strong that they will themselves

927
01:00:33.231 --> 01:00:36.190
choose to undergo this very,
very,
uh,

928
01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:39.160
serious operation with a very high,

929
01:00:39.170 --> 01:00:41.390
a threat of death.

930
01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.150
And what's one of the things that,
uh,

931
01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:51.790
the planned parenthood federation and its international efforts like what you

932
01:00:51.951 --> 01:00:54.680
saw is trying to cure and they went to Canada.

933
01:00:54.681 --> 01:00:59.030
They had one project to go to Kenya to train a local private doctors who

934
01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:04.031
somewhat escape the law in family planning and abortion services.

935
01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.550
And the local doctors had been turning away,
uh,

936
01:01:07.551 --> 01:01:09.950
abortion clients cause they did not know where to refer them.

937
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:14.450
So that means they got,
uh,
some unskilled,
uh,
practitioner.

938
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:18.680
One physician told the project director and then he had turned away a young girl

939
01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:20.330
only to find her in a hospital.

940
01:01:20.331 --> 01:01:24.830
A few days later after she had procured an illegal abortion,
the girl died.

941
01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:29.240
The private doctors said that he had since then lived with a great deal of
guilt.

942
01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:33.500
He's happy now that he can provide treatment using a very safe procedure they've

943
01:01:33.501 --> 01:01:36.590
lead and then they,
in between that they've legalized things.
Uh,

944
01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:38.870
to some degree in Kenya,

945
01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:45.340
it's not only the third world in which this takes place in Bulgaria,

946
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:49.490
uh,
sometime back under the Soviet system,

947
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:53.030
57% of pregnancies ended in abortion.

948
01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:56.900
You'll hear during the abortion lecture in the United States,
one,

949
01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:01.670
there's one abortion for every three live births and something like 40 to 50

950
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:03.140
million abortions worldwide.

951
01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:08.460
And about half of these are illegal and illegal means a very unsafe and a woman

952
01:02:09.201 --> 01:02:14.201
dies about every three minutes from a batch to one of these illegal abortions.

953
01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:19.100
So I think with the stories and the large numbers that attached to them in any

954
01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:23.670
woman in that situation that has an abortion,
she does not want that child.

955
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:26.670
And when you say there's 50 million of them worldwide,

956
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:31.560
that means that the demand for control of fertility is very,

957
01:02:31.561 --> 01:02:36.120
very,
very,
very high.

958
01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:40.410
You'll read,
uh,
the Brazilian solution to this,

959
01:02:40.411 --> 01:02:42.690
which is a modern form of infanticide.

960
01:02:42.691 --> 01:02:45.330
I don't know if you read yet the death without weeping.

961
01:02:45.331 --> 01:02:50.331
It's in your reading packet where mothers who know that they can't raise a child

962
01:02:51.751 --> 01:02:54.030
just leave the child to die,

963
01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:58.950
and they say that God can take better care of it than I can and,

964
01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:02.310
uh,
they just let the child die.

965
01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:08.700
So this is not to say that.

966
01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:13.760
So what has happened in the world is that fertility has come down drastically.

967
01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:18.250
And I,
and I've,
I've,
I've showed you that in,

968
01:03:18.251 --> 01:03:23.251
in previous graphs where the fertility is coming down and in the peak period,

969
01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:28.580
uh,
and Bolivia,
uh,
during the period 20,

970
01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:34.170
the number doubled from about 12% to 25% of people using a modern method.

971
01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:38.970
Ecuador,
50% of the women are using a modern mech mechanism.
Uh,

972
01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:43.290
Tunisia 60%.
And Iran is one of the really interesting cases.

973
01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:46.140
So Iran had this,
uh,
uh,

974
01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.160
very conservative government and they were against family planning and all this.

975
01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.930
And then they had the war with Iraq,

976
01:03:51.931 --> 01:03:56.280
Iraq invaded with the u s help and huge numbers of people died,

977
01:03:56.281 --> 01:04:00.750
including a lot of kids.
So afterwards there,
there young people are depleted.

978
01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:04.590
But once those kids,
they're the recovered a little bit from that.

979
01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:09.060
The government realized what was happening and decided on a family planning

980
01:04:09.061 --> 01:04:09.894
program.

981
01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:15.150
And this is an Iranian woman packing condoms and they're now,

982
01:04:15.151 --> 01:04:18.230
we have this image of places like Iran is being,
you know,

983
01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.850
so backwards and conservative and everything.

984
01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:25.440
But they have in fact now one of the best family planning programs in the world

985
01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:29.010
and the UN a few years ago awarded it their top,

986
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.120
top best program in the,
in,
in the world.

987
01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:36.660
And their fertility rate is now at replacement level.

988
01:04:37.260 --> 01:04:41.980
So fertility is,
uh,
coming down,
uh,

989
01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.860
almost everywhere with again,

990
01:04:43.861 --> 01:04:48.480
Subsaharan Africa and some of the Arab countries as an example.

991
01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:49.921
And birth rates,

992
01:04:49.921 --> 01:04:54.540
not only in birth rates fell Thailand 50% in 12 years.

993
01:04:54.541 --> 01:04:59.130
Columbia 40% in 14 years is at the peak of Indonesia,

994
01:04:59.131 --> 01:05:03.510
48% 20 years,
Morocco,
31% in 12 years.
Turkey,

995
01:05:03.511 --> 01:05:07.860
21% in 10 years.
Brazil,
60% and 25 years.
Mexico,

996
01:05:07.861 --> 01:05:12.150
30% in just six years.
Botswana,
26%.
Zimbabwe,

997
01:05:12.151 --> 01:05:15.960
18% Kenya,
35%.
I mean everywhere that you look,

998
01:05:16.230 --> 01:05:18.160
the actual fertility is coming down.

999
01:05:18.161 --> 01:05:20.710
So people are using contraception and using it

1000
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:27.300
efficiently and the world birth rate has come down quite significantly.

1001
01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:36.350
So none of this is to minimize that.
Uh,

1002
01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:40.750
people in developing countries are caught in a bind that you all have heard,

1003
01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:45.730
all kinds of reasons why they might want to have a lot of children.

1004
01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:49.190
And one is extra farm labor.
Uh,

1005
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:53.530
one is support for children and old age or a major kind of problem when their

1006
01:05:53.531 --> 01:05:57.560
religion might demand it,
uh,
to cultural reasons,

1007
01:05:57.561 --> 01:06:00.190
the various ancestor worship reasons.

1008
01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:04.570
So in India you have to have a son to like the funeral pyre.
No son,

1009
01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:07.150
you don't go into the afterworld,
uh,
properly.

1010
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:12.270
We discussed some of this with respect to Africa,
a status reasons,
uh,

1011
01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:13.420
you have more children,

1012
01:06:13.421 --> 01:06:18.340
you have more prestige for both the man and the woman is much a reasons to prove

1013
01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:19.174
your fertility.

1014
01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:24.180
And the list goes on and on and the reasons they may not use birth control or

1015
01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:27.910
many,
one of which is,
uh,

1016
01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:31.900
planning family planning services can be very primitive.

1017
01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.180
There's not a great slide,
but it's an old bus in India,
the Red Cross on it.

1018
01:06:36.181 --> 01:06:40.300
And this is the family planning clinic,
uh,
in this part of India at this time.

1019
01:06:40.301 --> 01:06:40.601
And you know,

1020
01:06:40.601 --> 01:06:43.690
people were supposed to go on this bus and have some operation that they didn't

1021
01:06:43.691 --> 01:06:45.010
understand,
a done to them,

1022
01:06:45.011 --> 01:06:49.030
sterilization or a IUD insertion or something and you know,

1023
01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:54.460
you wouldn't be exactly very anxious to get on to that,

1024
01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:57.100
to that bus.
Um,

1025
01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:01.360
another thing that I mentioned last time with respect specter,
uh,

1026
01:07:02.570 --> 01:07:03.403
uh,

1027
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:08.670
Vinas lecture that the worry about medical complications is one of the most

1028
01:07:08.890 --> 01:07:13.330
major reasons why women either don't use contraception all or start it and then

1029
01:07:13.331 --> 01:07:14.164
stop using it.

1030
01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:18.580
And what does this mean in a premedical country where they don't have really

1031
01:07:18.581 --> 01:07:22.000
modern medical ideas?
You take the pill,
you're scared of it.

1032
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:26.650
Anything that happens to you,
you get a tummy ache,
you fall and break your leg,

1033
01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:31.000
you know,
anything that happens to you,
what do you blame?
You blame the pill.

1034
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:35.230
So here is a culture without much medicine at a low standard of living,

1035
01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:36.430
they're getting sick.
A lot.

1036
01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:41.110
People in developing countries are not generally very healthy and they get sick

1037
01:07:41.111 --> 01:07:42.810
and they don't know what to closet by.

1038
01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:47.110
You probably read already about the evil lie.
Now did you read the Egyptian,

1039
01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:51.340
the coalcoholic yet the evil eye is the reason.
If you've taken the pill,

1040
01:07:51.341 --> 01:07:54.670
you know,
that's changing your body in some way and you're afraid of it.

1041
01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:58.410
You get sick with anything.
It's the pill was the reason for it.

1042
01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:01.180
And then you tell all your friends that and everybody in the community learns

1043
01:08:01.181 --> 01:08:04.720
that such and such got some problem because of the pill.

1044
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:06.950
So they're very much afraid,
uh,

1045
01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:11.870
to use the pill and uh,
on,

1046
01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:16.280
on,
on and on.
That's a big conflict contest station.

1047
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:20.660
The media,
I think this is,
uh,
in Morocco,

1048
01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:24.650
this is a cave.
Whoops.
One that doesn't project very well,
but the wide open,

1049
01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:27.710
you can see it's a cave.
This is the desert around here.
They're in the cage.

1050
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:32.300
And what they're watching is the TV show.
And I was in Morocco in the far desert.

1051
01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:37.570
And you see these little villages have just a few mud houses and they all had

1052
01:08:38.601 --> 01:08:43.430
solar arrays and they all had television.
So media is passing on very strongly.

1053
01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:44.510
Uh,

1054
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:47.900
on the other side of the question is all kinds of reasons that they don't use it

1055
01:08:47.901 --> 01:08:52.400
or that they do do use it.
It's a very much in contestation

1056
01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:58.130
in the West,
uh,
uh,
especially activists,
liberal people,

1057
01:08:58.131 --> 01:09:00.650
people in the forestry school believe that,
you know,

1058
01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:04.580
we shouldn't support family planning programs because it's politically,

1059
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:09.110
it's politically contentious.
And why is it politically contentious?

1060
01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:12.740
Because people in the right or opposed to it for religious or more regions,

1061
01:09:12.741 --> 01:09:16.220
people on more or less left.
And these are characterizations right and left,

1062
01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.320
you know,
we can't impose,
you know,

1063
01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:22.490
we great white Westerners can impose our values on our poor,

1064
01:09:22.491 --> 01:09:27.260
little yellow and brown,
uh,
cousins.
And it's utter nonsense.
And,
and it's,

1065
01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:27.681
it's,

1066
01:09:27.681 --> 01:09:32.150
it's patronizing because the people in these developing countries has spoken

1067
01:09:32.151 --> 01:09:36.890
very clearly when they add up all these pluses and minuses,
that's,
that's their,

1068
01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:40.040
their,
their choice.
And as I've showed your data,

1069
01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:44.000
not hit you over the head with data showing you that when people in the

1070
01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:46.370
developing countries themselves add up the data,

1071
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:51.380
they want to be protected from contraception.
And I think that we in the west,

1072
01:09:51.381 --> 01:09:56.381
or to take that very seriously and starting with intellectuals who should know

1073
01:09:56.961 --> 01:10:00.680
better.
But since people don't give courses like this and people,

1074
01:10:00.681 --> 01:10:05.210
even environmentalist and all kinds of others just don't pay any attention to

1075
01:10:05.211 --> 01:10:08.750
human population,
uh,
because it's politically untouchable.

1076
01:10:08.751 --> 01:10:10.610
The major organizations,

1077
01:10:10.611 --> 01:10:13.730
the environmental organizations won't touch it because they do fundraising.

1078
01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:17.640
And the public opinion is that,
oh,
it's a horrible thing to,

1079
01:10:17.641 --> 01:10:22.160
to push family planning on developing countries.

1080
01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.730
So,
um,

1081
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:30.290
I guess that is where we will end today.

1082
01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:34.550
Few,
yes.
One more this week before vacation.
