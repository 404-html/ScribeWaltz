WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.690
So,
uh,
I see this as largely what I'm cars,

2
00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.600
not exclusively a female class.

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.100
And I know that's because of the reputation classes being very tough on on men.

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.750
And what have we learned about men so far?
They're violent,

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.740
they contribute only a speck of protoplasm to the next generation.

6
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.540
They help hardly at all.

7
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:26.040
And child rearing in the Tuesday reading you vent that they're even afraid of

8
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:30.640
their wives.
And on Thursday,
uh,

9
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.830
how many of you did the reading about the na wonderful self.

10
00:00:34.831 --> 00:00:37.830
So what do they believe about man's role in reproduction?

11
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.730
Just to gardening.

12
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:46.731
They just water it that the baby comes totally from the woman's a substance and

13
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:51.600
men just have to water it.
Occasionally,
as you know,
water is water is water.

14
00:00:51.601 --> 00:00:55.680
So it doesn't matter which man waters it and they have a very promiscuous

15
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.930
sexuality.
So feeling very sorry for the males.

16
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.050
Um,
and I don't want them to go through too much of an ego crush.

17
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.180
I have to tell you that some cultures indeed give credit to males in all of

18
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:10.014
this.

19
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.500
And in piggy of the Bari tribe of Venezuela who were one of the isolated tribes

20
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:19.470
in the,
in the am and the Venezuelan,
Amazon.

21
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.510
And they believe that a woman's body is just a vessel and that men do all the

22
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:29.370
work of,
of reproduction.
They only,

23
00:01:29.371 --> 00:01:33.710
they only limitation maybe that the very first act of sex,
uh,

24
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.260
must be between husband and wife.
They have,
they have marriages.

25
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.590
But the first copulation has to be between husband and wife because that plants

26
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:47.640
the seed.
And it's very important that the seed belong to the husband.

27
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.000
But once he's planted this seed,
uh,

28
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.050
the growing fetus is not done with male need.

29
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.070
So the from the fetus obviously has to be nourished.
It's keeping to grow,

30
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.550
has to get the nourishment,
doesn't get the nourishment from the mother,

31
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.050
gets it from seaman.

32
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.670
So the fetus needs a constant war,
uh,
contribution,
uh,

33
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.020
of semen all on too to make it grow.

34
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.990
The Bari claim that this is very hard work for men to support a pregnancy and

35
00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:22.610
you know,
they have to have sex just all the time to do this.
And the poor.

36
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.660
The women are worried about wearing out their poor husband's.
So,

37
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.770
and now this is not just this cultural,
you know,
just dreaming stuff up.

38
00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.810
This has real empirical basis in the Bari.
Say,
look,
it's obvious.

39
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.880
Women grow factoring and pregnancy,
well men,
they grow thin from all their work.

40
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.310
So they have good reasons for believing what they do.
So what's the solution?

41
00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.690
Well they ask other men to help.
The husband isn't,

42
00:02:51.691 --> 00:02:53.460
they don't want to wear out their,
their husband and he's,

43
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:57.510
he's got to do a lot of stuff to ask other men to help and strange,

44
00:02:57.511 --> 00:02:59.060
even though it is such hard work than me,

45
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.990
the men seem quite willing to pitch in and help.

46
00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.300
And so it's so it's very nice.

47
00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.830
It's very heartwarming that men can at least temporarily stop all this man male

48
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:11.950
competition and help another guy,
uh,
when he,

49
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.480
when his wife needs a little nourishment.
So

50
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.053
she likes that one.

51
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.520
When we get to discussing the reproductive biology that relates to abortion much

52
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:25.810
later in the course,

53
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.110
you will find that actually western scientific knowledge does not go much beyond

54
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.690
what the Bari understood until about 1840 and well into the 19th century.

55
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.200
And that's until then what,
how a fetus was formed,

56
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.220
what the male contribution was,
what the female contribution was,

57
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.010
was a big hot argument.
Some thought it was all a woman,

58
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:51.130
some thought it was all male and they just had no idea.

59
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.530
Human fertilization was not discovered until 1840 in,
in the,
in the West.

60
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.090
So,
uh,
we were having the same argument that the Bowery do.

61
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.630
Furthermore,
I,
anybody know approximately how long it takes if,

62
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.090
if a human couple wants to get for gets get pregnant,

63
00:04:10.091 --> 00:04:14.350
how long it takes on average three,
it's more like five months.

64
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.440
And you'll hear that again when we discussed abortion,
you'll,

65
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:22.300
you'll hear the reasons for that.
So actually in that findings or the,
the,

66
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.840
the husband gets the first a copulation,
but thereafter,
uh,

67
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.840
a lot of guys have to help.
So by the time five months rolls around,

68
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:34.450
the average for getting impregnated,

69
00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.530
an awful lot of guys have had their seed in there.

70
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.340
And so again,
in actuality,

71
00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:46.420
paternity is totally uncertain that it comes right back to the,

72
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.620
to the chimp story that the community hangs together.

73
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:54.850
One reason because no one knows anything about paternity.

74
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.850
Okay.
So last time,
um,

75
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.510
I was describing how all cultures have mechanisms so that families in fact only

76
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:10.960
have about half as many children as we,
of which they're biologically capable.

77
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.460
Remember,
we did this calculation and we've found this 69 number and so forth.

78
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:17.350
And uh,

79
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:22.420
I was in the middle of his story and actually it's in your reading.

80
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.220
Uh,
reading for the last two is about the May my anger of New Guinea.

81
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.030
And they believe the males and females both believe that the sexual fluids and

82
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:38.701
odors and emanations from women are dangerous and even lethal to men.

83
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.390
Hence the men are terrified of having sex with the women.

84
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.800
Now,
you'll read this in your reading and uh,

85
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.250
you may again throw it off as just a one of these cultural practices of

86
00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:58.160
primitive people.
That's not the way you should approach this class.
You should,

87
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.900
on the other hand,
ask,
how does such a practice arise?
What are,

88
00:06:01.901 --> 00:06:05.360
what are its roots and how does it help their culture to survive?

89
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.450
The theory being that most of the things that people's do have some role in,

90
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.200
in helping them in a difficult world.
So as you know,

91
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.380
uh,
in,
in chimps,
as in most human societies,

92
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.250
they're x arguments that instead of the mail going out to meeting,

93
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.540
the males stay together in one community and the females go out for mating.

94
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.320
And the same is true with my anger and females transfer groups.

95
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.780
Also,
we know that as in chimps in New Guinea,

96
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.520
each of these tribes is always a constant warfare,
uh,
with their neighbors.

97
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.440
They are truly,
uh,
enemies.
Um,

98
00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.693
so

99
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.440
when women are exchanged between neighboring communities,

100
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.860
they don't travel very far.
They'll get killed if they traveled very far.

101
00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.270
So they only people they know,

102
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:04.040
or the neighboring communities and someone from this community will marry.

103
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.920
We'll get a woman from a fairly neighboring community,

104
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.570
which means getting an,
uh,
a wife from their enemy.

105
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.570
And that's again,
very similar to the,

106
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:19.280
to the chimp setup and the Manga are very much aware of this as you've read.

107
00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:24.110
We marry the people we fight and there was a lot of distrust and fear of the

108
00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:27.200
enemy lives because of that.

109
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:31.670
The husband does not sleep in the hut with his wife and children,

110
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:33.830
but sleeps in the men's hut,
the man,

111
00:07:33.831 --> 00:07:38.120
and it's a male bonding sort of thing rather than a male female bonding sort of

112
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:38.954
thing.

113
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:43.580
And apparently culture has used this distrust of the wife,

114
00:07:43.581 --> 00:07:45.810
this fear of the wife,
uh,

115
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.900
as a mechanism for restricting sexual activity.
Uh,

116
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.520
so of course my ankle,

117
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:55.820
like every other human has tremendously strong sexual drives,

118
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.960
but they living on very fragile ecological land and they can't,
uh,

119
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.150
overpopulated.
So they have to have some mechanism of camping,
uh,
down,

120
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.830
uh,
reproduction.
And so this is one of the mechanisms.

121
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.740
The men don't even sleep in the same house who am,
and it's a,

122
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:17.060
it's a rare event than the women when they visit the women are rare and

123
00:08:17.061 --> 00:08:21.910
dangerous event.
And that keeps the birth rate down now.

124
00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:22.701
And the reading.

125
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:26.660
There's a third point that that's very easy to miss because it's just one little

126
00:08:26.661 --> 00:08:29.650
phrase when it talks about how dangerous is,

127
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.150
do you remember who it says is particularly vulnerable?

128
00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:37.170
The young males are particular,

129
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:40.970
she remembers that the young males are particularly vulnerable to to these

130
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:44.540
dangers.
And so they're held to be undermined,

131
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:47.660
not only by frequent intercourse with with women,

132
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.570
but even by frequent contact with women.

133
00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.710
But of course the older men are rather immune.
As you grow older,

134
00:08:54.711 --> 00:08:56.910
you gather immunity to this.

135
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.680
Now we know younger males are driven very much sexually older males.

136
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:03.360
It cools down somewhat.

137
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.800
And so here's this cultural belief counteracting biology.

138
00:09:07.801 --> 00:09:10.020
It's the inverse of what you would expect.

139
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:14.670
You'd expect the younger men to have a lot of sex in the older men to sort of

140
00:09:14.671 --> 00:09:15.660
tail off on it.

141
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.500
But what does it ensure and ensures to control by the older dominant sex mature

142
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.380
men?
Again,
it goes right back.
It's the Manga.
It's,

143
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:31.910
it can be perceived as the May anger version of dominance hierarchy in the

144
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:36.330
chimpanzees.
Well,
uh,

145
00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:39.840
there's an extended description of this in the reading,
which is wonderful,

146
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.640
which I hope you've already done.
So the,
the,

147
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:45.474
uh,

148
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.060
so so far we've been,
I've been describing how can,

149
00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:02.090
how culture communities push fertility up because if you don't get like on

150
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:05.790
average eight or so children from each woman,
the culture disappears.

151
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.240
But they also have to push it down because of reproduction goes to wild.

152
00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:12.240
The children just die.
I showed you data about introvert.

153
00:10:12.241 --> 00:10:15.690
The interval can't get too short or the children just die.

154
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.090
But individuals,
that's all from the community perspective so far.

155
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.950
But individuals and individual families,
they have to adjust these rules.

156
00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:29.730
There's these cultural rules which are usually very strongly enforced.
Uh,

157
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.650
but individual families have,

158
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:36.710
each has a different situation and they have to adjust the rules somehow to cope

159
00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:39.090
with their individual situation.

160
00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.650
And of course this leads to conflict between what an individual or an individual

161
00:10:43.651 --> 00:10:47.070
family wants and what the culture says you must do.

162
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.590
And so one of these examples I mentioned last time is postpartum abstinence.

163
00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:57.600
That in many parts,
for instance of Africa,
after a child is born,

164
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:01.710
there'll be three years in which women is not supposed to engage in sex.

165
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.210
Obviously primarily a mechanisms are spacing births so that the children stay

166
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:10.710
alive and the woman doesn't get killed from too much strain on her resources.

167
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.890
Now.
But if you think about that a little bit,
you have young woman,
young husband.

168
00:11:16.891 --> 00:11:20.400
Marriage is fairly young.
Generally husband will be good,
bit older,

169
00:11:20.401 --> 00:11:24.090
but still young and he's facing he's hazard.
The wife has a kid,

170
00:11:24.091 --> 00:11:28.560
he has a kid and the wife is the husband now facing three years without any sex.

171
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:30.480
Why does he gonna do,

172
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:36.390
he's gonna want to take a second wife or maybe visit a lot of prostitutes a lot

173
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:41.160
and spend money.
Uh,
that's something that often the,
the wife,

174
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:46.250
the first wife or second or third or wherever she is in the chain will not want.

175
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:49.960
So sometimes she does want that.
And we'll talk about polygamy later.
And,

176
00:11:49.961 --> 00:11:53.620
and why women very often choose to be in polygamous relationships,

177
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.330
but very often she won't want him to take another wife.

178
00:11:58.331 --> 00:11:59.680
Authon unless he's got a lot of money,

179
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:03.220
he just won't be able to help more than one wife.

180
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.780
So what does she do?

181
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:11.220
She has to figure out a way of resuming sexual intercourse but not get pregnant.

182
00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.940
What does she use?
Contraception.
So surprisingly in Africa,

183
00:12:15.941 --> 00:12:20.941
one of the major reasons for the people accepting contraception is not a desire

184
00:12:21.161 --> 00:12:24.730
to reduce fertility as an almost all the rest of the world,

185
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:29.440
but as arch resume sexual relationships without getting pregnant.

186
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.830
And she has to do this,
uh,

187
00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.150
not only to protect herself because she knows that if she has children too
often,

188
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:37.770
uh,

189
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:42.770
she wears out her body and there's a reading on exactly what certain groups in

190
00:12:42.881 --> 00:12:47.800
Africa,
one group in Africa considers this wearing out of the body.

191
00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.890
But also if she gets pregnant right away,

192
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.550
the community knows that she and her husband had violated the taboo.

193
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.460
And there's very strong social,
uh,

194
00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:02.350
prescriptions against proscriptions against violating the taboos.

195
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.520
So contraception,
which you take privately,
uh,
is,

196
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:11.680
is sort of the perfect solution for women wanting to return to sexuality but not

197
00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.300
to get pregnant.
So,

198
00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.463
uh,

199
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.600
another aspect which we've already just,

200
00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:27.601
I just mentioned of control of fertility is what I call gerontocracy rule by the

201
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.190
rule by old folk.
And uh,

202
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:38.590
the old folk can monopolize,
the older men can monopolize,

203
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.850
uh,

204
00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:44.380
the sexual activities of younger women and because they're not as vigorous,

205
00:13:44.381 --> 00:13:48.640
shall we say,
that reduces is one mechanism for reducing fertility.

206
00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.730
One of the ways which came up in one of the sections said you have bride price.

207
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.391
You know,

208
00:13:55.391 --> 00:14:00.391
dowery is more commonly known is where the wife's family pays the husband,

209
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.530
the husband or the husband's family.
When the wife gets married,

210
00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.530
the reverse of that is called bride price.

211
00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:12.310
And it's much more common than dowery in Africa,
right?

212
00:14:12.311 --> 00:14:14.200
Price in this case,

213
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:19.710
the man of the man's family or the mantra must pay the father of the wife for

214
00:14:20.261 --> 00:14:22.480
the before he gets the woman.

215
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.540
It's sometimes in the West consider buying the woman,

216
00:14:25.541 --> 00:14:28.960
but it really is not a buying situation.

217
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:34.930
And
these bride prices can be very high.

218
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:40.470
And a young man usually does not have the money to buy a bride who controls the

219
00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:42.160
money of the village,

220
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:46.750
who controls the resources of the older men who are the village elders and

221
00:14:46.751 --> 00:14:49.590
control everything.
So,
uh,

222
00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:54.290
they dole out very sparingly,
uh,

223
00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:59.180
the bride price to allow men to get married.

224
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.690
And this is like among the Messiah of Kenya,
very tall people,

225
00:15:02.691 --> 00:15:06.500
which a lot of popular press about them.

226
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.780
And uh,

227
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.860
because the young men are not getting married and there's Russell equal numbers

228
00:15:12.861 --> 00:15:17.150
of males and females that leads a lot of excess young girls,

229
00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:19.430
fertile young girls and who gets them.

230
00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.850
The older men go polygamous and they can have several wives.

231
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.040
But remember for every man was more than one wife,

232
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:28.640
that means there's another man that has no life whatsoever.

233
00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.673
<v 2>And</v>

234
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.760
<v 0>when you,
when you read the ethnography of this,
the anthropologist who go in,</v>

235
00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:40.230
it's very clear that the young men are held in a state of sexual frustration.

236
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.800
And the young men have ways that they talk to each other and they are just on

237
00:15:46.381 --> 00:15:47.550
the verge of rebellion.

238
00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:53.090
And the strategy of the older guys is to keep these young men just below that to

239
00:15:53.191 --> 00:15:55.410
keep things as much sex for themselves,

240
00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:59.640
but keep the young men from getting together and rebelling.

241
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:04.590
And so they coopt what we now we're would they call up the young guys when the

242
00:16:04.591 --> 00:16:07.500
older,
more dominant of the younger guys,

243
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.440
when things get started to get out of hand a little bit.
Oh,

244
00:16:10.441 --> 00:16:14.880
we now have bride price and you can go and get married and that co-ops him and

245
00:16:14.881 --> 00:16:19.320
takes him out of the cabal that might start a small revolution.

246
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:24.150
So this,
this is all going on,
sadly,

247
00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.480
often hidden within these communities.

248
00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:30.283
<v 2>Uh,</v>

249
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.200
<v 0>and it's,
these are large effects.</v>

250
00:16:33.201 --> 00:16:37.250
This whole polygamous situation in much of west Africa,

251
00:16:37.251 --> 00:16:40.790
almost half,
half of all wives are in polygamous marriages.

252
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.480
And that means about half of the men have no wives whatsoever.

253
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:50.410
And in the 1920s so a lot of what I'm describing is traditional culture.

254
00:16:50.931 --> 00:16:54.590
And you all know that the whole everywhere in the world is changing very
rapidly,

255
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.220
but you can't understand where they're going unless you know where they're

256
00:16:58.221 --> 00:17:00.560
coming from.
So in the 1920s,

257
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.780
40% of the men got to be 40 years old without having been able to marry.

258
00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.890
So that's half,
almost half of your population without lid,
quote,

259
00:17:09.891 --> 00:17:14.630
legitimate sexual outlet until they're 40 years old.
And today,

260
00:17:14.631 --> 00:17:18.130
even today,
and this is from a few years ago,
uh,

261
00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:23.350
the meeting age of marriage is still almost 30 and great pressure and power from

262
00:17:24.921 --> 00:17:28.700
the older guys is necessary to maintain a situation like that.

263
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.153
<v 2>Uh,</v>

264
00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.410
<v 0>they also leave a sort of a pressure valve on,</v>

265
00:17:35.411 --> 00:17:40.030
on this whole situation that they don't totally suppress the sexual activity of

266
00:17:40.031 --> 00:17:44.350
young man.
Uh,
they turned a blind eye to a fair amount of prostitution,

267
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:47.980
and that's reasonably accepted.
And to miss a quote,

268
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:53.220
discrete to the younger wives have older brothers or even of their fathers.

269
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:58.170
So,
so again,
the,
there's the dominant males are sort of officially in charge,

270
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.400
but a lot of extra stuff going on.
Again,
it's,
it's the,
it's the,

271
00:18:02.401 --> 00:18:04.200
the great ape kind of pattern.

272
00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:07.590
And even in today,

273
00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:12.240
this story of the dominant older males getting the most sex has by no means

274
00:18:12.241 --> 00:18:16.860
disappeared.
Now it gets a little,

275
00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.820
uh,
more unpleasant because,

276
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:22.583
uh,

277
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.400
this control of population by pre modern chemical contraceptive societies,

278
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:35.070
uh,
is very often post-pregnancy.
We've described so far,

279
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:39.780
all kinds of pre pregnancy mechanisms,
reducing sex,
et Cetera,
et cetera.

280
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.710
But women still get pregnant and very often they are,

281
00:18:43.711 --> 00:18:46.620
their families decide that they can't have this children.

282
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.920
So a lot of this is post-pregnancy,
uh,

283
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.900
population control and even and postnatal also,
um,

284
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:57.960
abortion and infanticide are common among,

285
00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:01.950
on or have been recently among almost all human groups.

286
00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:08.130
And so different communities and different individual families have different

287
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:13.200
amount of resources and they must match in some way match their fertility to the

288
00:19:13.201 --> 00:19:15.870
resources that are available.

289
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.570
So this is a very discussed and studied topic,

290
00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:26.130
uh,
in population circles.
So a few years back,
Karen Mason,

291
00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:30.570
who was president of the Population Association of America and gave a wonderful

292
00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:34.260
quote about how people adjust their family size.

293
00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.340
Parents kill their infants,
abandoned them,

294
00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.250
neglect them in the hopes that they will die,

295
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.590
give them into the care of wet nurses where they usually die,
sell them,

296
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:50.340
give them up for adoption,
marry them off at a young age,

297
00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:52.830
loaned them to other families for fostering,

298
00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:57.810
send them into service or into other households,
send them to the military,

299
00:19:57.811 --> 00:20:02.610
the merchant marine prostitution,
or send them overseas as migrants.

300
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:08.390
All of these are very standard mechanisms for individual families controlling

301
00:20:09.661 --> 00:20:12.060
the number of children that they have to rear.

302
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:17.760
And in Western culture,
it's certainly not unknown.
Uh,

303
00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:22.260
the founding myth of the Jewish people,
Moses,

304
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.640
what happened to Moses?
He's a baby.
He's thrown in the basket,

305
00:20:26.641 --> 00:20:29.670
floated down the Nile.
You go to China,

306
00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.780
very standard way of getting rich on everywhere,
every culture that has a river,

307
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.010
uh,

308
00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.520
babies or putting baskets and floated down the river as a way of getting rid of

309
00:20:38.521 --> 00:20:38.940
them.

310
00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.940
And of course the Bible story is that the Pharaoh's daughter finds this baby

311
00:20:41.941 --> 00:20:46.260
floating down the river and uh,
you can believe that or not.

312
00:20:46.261 --> 00:20:51.261
But obviously that sort of behavior of putting a newborn infant in a basket and

313
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:55.650
floating down the river was apparently extremely common at that time.
So the,

314
00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.640
the story wouldn't have been surprising.

315
00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.403
<v 2>Yes,</v>

316
00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:06.100
<v 0>that's the story.
Yeah,</v>

317
00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:09.900
<v 2>yeah,</v>

318
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.810
<v 0>yeah.
If you read the rich that you're,
you're completely correct.</v>

319
00:21:12.811 --> 00:21:15.840
If you read the original story,
it reads as if one,

320
00:21:15.870 --> 00:21:19.470
she wants to keep him alive and Pharaoh was going to kill them all.
And two,

321
00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.270
that she saw the princess sort of on the other side of the river and,

322
00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.900
and thought that the princess w would see it.

323
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:29.340
So you can interpret the story as you want,
but it's a very standard multicom.

324
00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.460
Many,
many cultures cross cultural mechanism and infanticide.

325
00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.600
And there it appears.
What is the founding myth of the Roman people?

326
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.430
I'm going to stream.
It's what's the story of Romulus and Remus

327
00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:48.770
raised by wolves.
So Ron Midstream is twins.

328
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:52.790
You're talking about twins a moment left out on a hillside,
right.

329
00:21:52.791 --> 00:21:55.760
Standard form everywhere in the world of abandonment.
You know,

330
00:21:55.761 --> 00:21:59.990
some animal eat it,
but in this case the wolves didn't eat the babies,

331
00:21:59.991 --> 00:22:04.720
they suckle them and they came up to found the Roman empire.
Sure.
Uh,

332
00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.830
so it's quite interesting how many of the founding myths,
uh,

333
00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.810
have,
uh,
this abandonment,

334
00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:16.700
a story in them respect to twins.
For instance,

335
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.470
the [inaudible] tribe who are very traditional isolate people in Columbia,

336
00:22:20.471 --> 00:22:23.990
in South America,
uh,
when they have twins,

337
00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:28.910
they abandoned them and the forester or tossed them into the rivers and their

338
00:22:28.911 --> 00:22:33.510
cultural belief is that they bring bad,
bad luck.
But of course,
you know,
in,

339
00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:35.570
in the situation where mothers under nourished,

340
00:22:35.900 --> 00:22:38.750
she probably is going to have difficulty bringing up one child.

341
00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.360
And two is just kind of impossible.

342
00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:48.620
If she believes where the culture has sort of over history figured out that the

343
00:22:48.621 --> 00:22:51.200
children are going to die one or both of them,

344
00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:55.400
then the amount of resources put into trying to raise a child who you know is

345
00:22:55.401 --> 00:22:59.600
going to die anyway is just not,
not acceptable.

346
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:05.750
And of course,
none of this is,
is a conscious calculation.
Uh,

347
00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.030
if you asked the people why they're doing it,

348
00:23:08.031 --> 00:23:11.330
they always give some kind of religious or mystical or magical kind of

349
00:23:11.331 --> 00:23:12.890
interpretation to this behavior.

350
00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:18.220
But we can see it as one of these mechanisms for having families limit their

351
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:23.400
fertility to what they think they can cope with.
Um,

352
00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:27.110
so in addition to controlling the rate of reproduction,

353
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:31.730
the control of population continues after birth.
Uh,

354
00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:35.450
and we haven't talked about abortion,
but during pregnancy,
Avaya abortion,

355
00:23:35.451 --> 00:23:39.980
we'll get to that later.
Societies are also really very,

356
00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:40.820
uh,

357
00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:45.820
careful about controlling the number of child bearers and the,

358
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.880
uh,
in England for instance,

359
00:23:49.881 --> 00:23:52.940
and we'll talk a little more about this at a later time,

360
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.560
people couldn't marry the,
the,
the,

361
00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:01.730
the peasants on somebody's estate could not get permission to marry unless he

362
00:24:01.971 --> 00:24:06.440
had enough property to support a wife and children.

363
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:11.000
And very often this meant that he couldn't marry until his father died,

364
00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:16.220
that the father was living in the house and he just had to wait until the father

365
00:24:16.221 --> 00:24:20.270
dies.
And then he was owner of this property,
then he could take a wife.
Well,

366
00:24:20.271 --> 00:24:23.360
the father dies is when the guys may be 40 or late thirties.

367
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:28.280
And so that cuts down his reproductive potential a lot.
And of course,

368
00:24:28.281 --> 00:24:32.840
the wife that he marries,
uh,
has,
has not been married up up until then.

369
00:24:32.841 --> 00:24:36.830
So her reproductive potential has also been knocked down.

370
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:42.590
And,
uh,
in many ways,
uh,

371
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.980
since the fertility of a society basically does not depend on the number of men,

372
00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.700
depends primarily on the number of women.
Uh,
we saw this last time,

373
00:24:52.701 --> 00:24:56.300
we discussed the permissability of,
of polygamy,

374
00:24:56.750 --> 00:25:00.290
even with limitations when a lot of men are dying in war.

375
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.220
Um,
but,
uh,
this happens in many,

376
00:25:04.221 --> 00:25:08.720
many situations in India as,
as you know,

377
00:25:08.721 --> 00:25:12.830
traditionally it's almost never practice.
Nowadays a man dies.

378
00:25:12.831 --> 00:25:17.330
What happens to the wife
sacrificed on the funeral pyre?

379
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:18.463
Again,

380
00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:22.220
there's all kinds of religious and cultural explanations for which the people

381
00:25:22.221 --> 00:25:25.490
who tell you,
but standing back from it,
among other things,

382
00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:29.990
it's a way of controlling,
uh,
the birth rate of the population.

383
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:35.450
Sometimes in a single,
uh,
geographical setting.
You can see the,
the,

384
00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:38.660
the two different things,
uh,
working together.

385
00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:43.700
So the Ma,
the my anger,
which you've already heard about in New Guinea,

386
00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:46.220
they live in an overpopulated territory.

387
00:25:46.221 --> 00:25:50.660
They are pressing up against the ecological limits of their resources.

388
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.800
So the women are severely degraded.
Uh,

389
00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:59.360
funerals are held to honor man,
men and pigs,

390
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:03.680
but not women or children.
If a,
if a husband dies,

391
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:04.730
if a man dies,

392
00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:10.030
his widow is strangled within 24 hours of his death on the same island.

393
00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:16.490
In New Guinea,
the foray,
people have a different problem.
They have Kourou,

394
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:19.130
you know,
which we now called Crites felt Yacob disease,

395
00:26:19.131 --> 00:26:20.930
a prion that destroys the brain.

396
00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.460
So they have a very high death rate and their territory is,

397
00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:26.870
is quite underpopulated.

398
00:26:26.871 --> 00:26:31.100
They have great difficulty in getting enough people to stay alive.

399
00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:35.390
So in that culture where everybody is scarce,
uh,

400
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:38.720
they mourn women and children as much as men.

401
00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:44.080
They encourage premarital sex and widows are not killed but courted for

402
00:26:44.101 --> 00:26:46.140
remarriage by the men.
Again,

403
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.620
this is a Saturday when you're way below the limit,

404
00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:54.510
then you want to keep a woman's womb fall and you want to keep them reproducing.

405
00:26:56.190 --> 00:27:01.190
And so I've told you this mechanism for reducing the number of child bearers is

406
00:27:01.441 --> 00:27:05.490
severe,
very severe around the world.
Now.
And I mentioned,
and we'll hear it again,

407
00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.360
that the estimates are that there by various mechanisms of discrimination

408
00:27:09.361 --> 00:27:13.830
against women,
there's 100 million women missing in the world.

409
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.650
And this is a big part of the global,
uh,

410
00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.630
control of population.
So we've seen,
you know,

411
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:26.010
some people and a lot of the popular discussion thinks that,
uh,

412
00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.020
fertility control,
contraception,

413
00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:31.950
all that is a new thing that's burst in 1960 or something when the pill was

414
00:27:31.951 --> 00:27:33.930
invented that is burst on the world.

415
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:37.080
And some people think it's wonderful and some people think it's immoral,

416
00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.530
but in fact,
coaches have always have,
uh,

417
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:46.160
have had mechanisms for controlling their fertility and they've often been more

418
00:27:46.651 --> 00:27:49.620
brutal than,
than what we current,
uh,

419
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:52.710
the have [inaudible].

420
00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:56.650
So I want to shift gears a little bit.
Um,

421
00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:00.540
it falls on the following way.

422
00:28:00.541 --> 00:28:03.930
So we've been talking about the way people regulate their fertility.

423
00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:08.520
And what is the main limitation on fertility?
Well,

424
00:28:08.521 --> 00:28:12.420
it's often food and food depends on how much land you have.

425
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:18.180
So most of what we read in history and what we're used to thinking of human

426
00:28:18.181 --> 00:28:19.690
society,
uh,

427
00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:24.840
has to do with very crowded places from Europe or China or India in historical

428
00:28:25.531 --> 00:28:28.830
times.
All of these places have had very high,
you know,

429
00:28:28.831 --> 00:28:33.090
historically compared very high,
even dense populations.

430
00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.100
And in all of these cultures,
you have masses of,

431
00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:41.430
of peasants without any land,
landless,
landless peasants,

432
00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:45.330
they called Land Hunger.
Everybody wants land and there isn't land for it.

433
00:28:45.331 --> 00:28:48.210
They fight over land.
If you manage to own land,

434
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:52.040
you're going to be very rich from the land.
You don't have to work at yourself.

435
00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:56.280
There's always plenty of landless peasants that can do the work for you and so

436
00:28:56.281 --> 00:29:01.080
forth.
So this is pretty much true of,
of,
uh,

437
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.600
pretty much the characters of recent human history.

438
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:07.500
But for most of human history,
that that was not true at all.

439
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:10.680
The opposite was true.
The world was,
was open,

440
00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:15.060
and there was plenty of land available.
Uh,
we were not a numerous species.

441
00:29:15.061 --> 00:29:17.670
We had almost no population growth rate.

442
00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:22.560
And so what was scarce was not land.
Land was plentiful,

443
00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:27.770
but what was scarce was people to fill up the land and cultures have been aware

444
00:29:31.201 --> 00:29:34.650
of this problem as well as the opposite pump.
But this problem for a long time.

445
00:29:34.651 --> 00:29:37.410
So,
uh,
one of the great Chinese philosophers,

446
00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:42.411
a merger a fifth century BC wrote what is hard to increase?

447
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:47.680
He's talking about politics and everything.
Only people are hard to increase.

448
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:52.540
And he argues,
he says that there are policies which can increase population.

449
00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:58.080
The kings of old required that all men married by the age of 19 and all women

450
00:29:58.721 --> 00:30:03.721
married by the age of 14 now those who want to marry early Marriott 20 those who

451
00:30:04.781 --> 00:30:06.100
want to marry late Mary,

452
00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:11.101
his latest 40 we can expect two or three more children to survive.

453
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:16.360
If we were reduced to reduce the age of marriage through universal marriage,

454
00:30:16.361 --> 00:30:19.030
we should be able to increase the population size.

455
00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:23.890
This is his advice to the rulers on how to increase the population in their

456
00:30:23.891 --> 00:30:27.250
territory.
There's plenty of land that's not a problem.

457
00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:29.980
They have to be strong because there's neighboring warring states.

458
00:30:29.981 --> 00:30:32.410
They're always fighting with each other.
If they're not,

459
00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:36.880
don't have a big population,
their neighbors who will come in and wipe them out.

460
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:39.243
And of course,

461
00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:44.110
this idea that the government should be an agent of control of population,

462
00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.820
uh,
again has not disappeared.
China does it now.
In the old days,

463
00:30:48.821 --> 00:30:51.730
they wanted to use the government and did sometimes who's government to increase

464
00:30:51.731 --> 00:30:55.720
population.
China now wants to use it to decrease population,

465
00:30:55.990 --> 00:31:00.070
but it's the same idea that control in one way or another is important for every

466
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:04.210
society.
So in this,
the rest of this lecture,

467
00:31:04.211 --> 00:31:07.320
and we'll see how long it takes,
uh,

468
00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:11.320
we're going to talk about under population of,
of places.

469
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.230
And the examples are largely going to come from the tropics.

470
00:31:14.231 --> 00:31:16.450
And especially we're going to talk about Africa.

471
00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:19.780
And that is because until recently,

472
00:31:19.781 --> 00:31:23.440
the tropics have generally had not had a dense population.

473
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:28.540
They have been what you might call underpopulated.
People were scarce.

474
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.920
And up to now we've been talking about,

475
00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:36.820
we've talked about biological determinants of,
of population,

476
00:31:36.821 --> 00:31:40.030
size of reproduction,
we've talked about cultural determinants.

477
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.720
There's another whole big factor,
geographical determinants.

478
00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:49.200
And we're going to talk about three very important geographical determinants of,

479
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.570
uh,
of population size.

480
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:57.280
And largely we're using the tropics as an example of this.

481
00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.850
So the tropics generally have low agricultural productivity.

482
00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:04.360
The great grand juries of the world are not in the tropics.

483
00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:09.910
They have parasitic diseases which are endemic and geographically they're often

484
00:32:09.911 --> 00:32:14.410
isolated from the rest of cultural worlds.

485
00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:18.760
So,
uh,
let me,

486
00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.620
so this is the,
uh,

487
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:28.090
just a general map of Africa and what you see is this is a very standard,

488
00:32:28.091 --> 00:32:28.924
here's the,

489
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:33.210
here's the equator and I'm sorry here is

490
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.970
that this is the equator up here.

491
00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:40.940
So what you have is in a sub Saharan Africa,
well,

492
00:32:40.941 --> 00:32:44.270
in all of Africa you having the center,
a rain forest.

493
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:49.300
This is the very traditional jungle and it's flanked north by the Sahara desert

494
00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:54.420
south,
uh,
by the Kalahari desert.
Uh,

495
00:32:55.160 --> 00:33:00.160
then here you'll see him or is another Green Zone right along the ocean and the

496
00:33:00.411 --> 00:33:05.240
very north,
this is Tunisia and Algeria.
Morocco,
I'm sorry.

497
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.950
Yeah,
just the coastal sections of Africa are green again.

498
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.083
They have rain.

499
00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:15.650
So we're not going to talk about North Africa because that's included in the

500
00:33:15.651 --> 00:33:19.400
Mediterranean world,
just culturally,
not Sahara desert device.

501
00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:21.830
We're going to talk about sub Saharan Africa.

502
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:26.270
You may note that these deserts continue into Saudi Arabia,

503
00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:31.070
then into the sin desert of Pakistan and the Roger Stone desert of India.

504
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:32.840
And then the Himalayas interrupted,

505
00:33:32.841 --> 00:33:36.590
but you get the Gobi desert up here and it continues across.

506
00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:41.360
And in the Americas,
uh,
there's the,

507
00:33:41.361 --> 00:33:45.590
the Amazon around,
uh,
around the equator.
Very dense jungle.

508
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:49.160
And what's the desert to the north of Amazon,

509
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:55.760
the Sonora desert of Mexico,
New Mexico,
Arizona.

510
00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:59.430
That desert is in the same,
similar geographical position to this.

511
00:33:59.431 --> 00:34:03.380
It moves up and down.
And what's the southern desert in South America?

512
00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:05.800
<v 1>Okay.</v>

513
00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.990
<v 0>The Atacama desert of Chile,
Chile.</v>

514
00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:13.040
And you go over the Andes and it's not quite as desert,
but it's the,
the pump us,

515
00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:16.150
which is a very dry,
dry,

516
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:20.650
dry region in Argentina.
So all over the world you have this,

517
00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.680
a central zone around the equator,
which is extremely wet,

518
00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:28.860
flanked by a desert zones.
And then once out of the desert zones,

519
00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:32.740
uh,
you got a moderate rainfall again,
quickly.

520
00:34:32.741 --> 00:34:36.850
The reason for this is quite simple.
Uh,

521
00:34:37.390 --> 00:34:41.920
this is the tropics.
Uh,
heat comes down,

522
00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.590
the hot air rises.
It's the hottest part of the earth.

523
00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:49.120
So the hot air rises bringing up the moisture from the tropics.

524
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:53.350
As it rises,
it cools.
And what happens is hot air,
hot,

525
00:34:53.351 --> 00:34:58.180
moist air cools rain.
So this is a very rainy region,

526
00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:03.010
so now the air has risen,
it's dropped out,
it's moisture,
it's dry air.

527
00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.640
The air that continues to rise pushes it away.

528
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.300
So it goes either north or go south and it now,

529
00:35:10.301 --> 00:35:13.930
by the time it reaches somewhat farther away,
it's cooled a lot.

530
00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.500
It's dry because it lost its rain.

531
00:35:15.501 --> 00:35:19.780
Tonight you have cool dry air and because this region is sucking air back in,

532
00:35:19.781 --> 00:35:21.070
there's a little bit of a vacuum.

533
00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:26.380
The air falls back down as a cold from being up here,

534
00:35:26.381 --> 00:35:27.520
cold,
dry air,

535
00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:32.220
and you get the desert regions and they happened in the north and they happened

536
00:35:32.221 --> 00:35:36.070
in the south.
So you get deserts here and you'll get desserts here.

537
00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.430
This is just a characteristic of the whole world.

538
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.100
And of course this is interrupted by oceans,

539
00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:43.560
this uninterrupted by something like the Himalayan mountains.

540
00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:47.310
So there's a lot of,
uh,
not,
it's not a perfect a Schema,

541
00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:51.450
but it explains an awful lot of the geography of the earth.

542
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:56.310
And in this Schema,
as I just showed you in Africa,

543
00:35:56.430 --> 00:36:00.150
look how much of it is taken up with that Schema.
It's from here,

544
00:36:00.151 --> 00:36:01.980
from the north edge of the Sahara desert,

545
00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:04.710
for the south edge of the Kalahari desert.

546
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:09.810
It turns out it's 97% of Africa something now.

547
00:36:09.811 --> 00:36:13.770
Yeah,
93% of African lion,
one of those three reasons,
very,

548
00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.020
very wet jungle were too dry.

549
00:36:16.021 --> 00:36:20.400
And you just have very thin region here in some region here,

550
00:36:20.401 --> 00:36:23.220
which gets some of the monsoon,
a circulation of air,

551
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.800
of warm air out of the ocean.

552
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:33.060
Okay,
so we have the image of the wet tropics anyway,

553
00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:38.220
as extremely lush and fertile.
And you'd think what a wonderful place,

554
00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:42.930
uh,
for farming,
it's a tropical paradise.
Actually,

555
00:36:42.931 --> 00:36:45.440
nothing is farther from the truth.
The tropics,

556
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:50.130
the tropics are generally very difficult to farm.
And if you do find them,

557
00:36:50.131 --> 00:36:54.480
they're very poorly productive regions.
And why is this,

558
00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:58.980
uh,
how many of you aware of that,
that the tropics are not good for farming?

559
00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:02.530
All your forestry guys ought to be aware of this.
Uh,

560
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:07.350
the reason is that the soils are very bad.

561
00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:12.570
So when they're bad for,
for a number,
uh,
of,
of of reasons,

562
00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:16.620
um,
uh,

563
00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.540
well let's go back a little bit.

564
00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:22.590
So plant growth is very rarely limited by sunlight.

565
00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.230
What the tropics have is plenty of sunlight,

566
00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.730
but it's very rare that that is the limitation on,
on plant growth.

567
00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:34.940
So the most productive part of the world is in terms of bio productivity is the

568
00:37:35.641 --> 00:37:38.430
ocean around Antarctica.
Very,

569
00:37:38.431 --> 00:37:41.970
very cold region in terms of intensity of some song.

570
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.060
Every part of the world gets the same number of hours of sunlight in a year.

571
00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.780
But the intensity around Antarctica is very much less so.

572
00:37:48.781 --> 00:37:52.560
It is very little sunlight.
Yet you get these tremendous algal blooms,

573
00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:54.540
the krill eat them,
the whales eat the Krill,

574
00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:59.250
and it's a tremendously productive region.
Why has nothing to do with sunlight,

575
00:37:59.251 --> 00:38:03.420
has nothing to do with temperature?
Have Antartica the continent of Antarctica,

576
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:08.310
which has a rock down below it.
It's not like the North Pole.
There's rock there.

577
00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.320
And the glaciers,
uh,
slide down to the scene.
They grind the rock.

578
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:15.870
So where the glacier is coming,

579
00:38:15.871 --> 00:38:20.871
falling into the sea underneath is a layer of what they called glacier glacier

580
00:38:20.911 --> 00:38:24.600
flower.
And that's ground rock falls into the sea,

581
00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.560
fertilize the seed tremendously,
uh,
uh,
valuable.

582
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.930
They're tremendously nutrient rich.

583
00:38:31.170 --> 00:38:36.070
And then that circulates up the west coast of Chile.
For instance,

584
00:38:36.071 --> 00:38:38.910
the Pacific coast of Chile,
the Humboldt current you may have heard of,

585
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:43.540
brings up all these nutrients and the richest fishing banks in the world are off

586
00:38:43.541 --> 00:38:48.040
Peru where the Humboldt current comes up and brings all these nutrients to the

587
00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:50.020
surface.
So all over the world,

588
00:38:50.021 --> 00:38:54.640
nutrients are almost always what limits agriculture?
Well,

589
00:38:54.641 --> 00:38:58.870
what's the story in the tropics,
the soil may have started,
uh,

590
00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:04.120
with a lot of nutrients.
It's sometime back.
Uh,
but,
uh,

591
00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:07.240
the rains come huge amount of rain.
And what does rain do?

592
00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:12.040
Washington nutrients back away.
So in most places,

593
00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.660
nutrients are,
uh,
recovered by several mechanisms.

594
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.680
One is,
uh,
by,
uh,
mountains being eroded down that the,

595
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:24.470
that the mountains are road.
So just was in,
uh,

596
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.920
in February was in the Peruvian Amazon.

597
00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.340
And you're sitting there right in the shadow of the Andes and the rains come

598
00:39:30.341 --> 00:39:31.360
into the Andes,
the road,

599
00:39:31.361 --> 00:39:36.310
the rock and parts of the Amazon have rich water flowing through it.

600
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.350
Uh,
with the Andes nutrients,

601
00:39:41.850 --> 00:39:45.520
mostly Amazon is flat,
does not have any runoff from the Andes.

602
00:39:45.521 --> 00:39:50.410
Mountains in fertile is hell no nutrients,
uh,
uh,
of there.

603
00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:55.090
So how does the jungle,
you know,
so you have this nutrient poor soil.

604
00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:59.710
If you go there,
you'll see the soil is extremely thin.
You take your boot,

605
00:39:59.711 --> 00:40:04.060
you can kick it and uh,
uh,
a few and you know,
an inch or two and there's no,

606
00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:07.030
no soil left.
And if you look at the trees,

607
00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:12.220
what are the roots of tropical trees often look like these huge thing cause

608
00:40:12.221 --> 00:40:15.670
there's not enough soil to support them,
you know,
on,
on,
on deep roots.

609
00:40:15.671 --> 00:40:16.720
There's nothing down there.

610
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:21.220
So they spread out and hopefully stay upright because with these huge,

611
00:40:21.221 --> 00:40:23.500
huge buttressed,
uh,
kind of roots,

612
00:40:23.501 --> 00:40:25.780
everything is telling you if you're not having to look at everything is telling

613
00:40:25.781 --> 00:40:29.230
you that this is thin and poor soil.

614
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.600
But nevertheless,

615
00:40:31.601 --> 00:40:36.601
there's all this biomass in the jungle and the mechanism is that the whole floor

616
00:40:39.461 --> 00:40:41.320
of the jungle is covered with a fungus,

617
00:40:41.321 --> 00:40:45.400
with a fungal mat and a leaf falls and just wet.

618
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.760
And so then it's never can,

619
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:52.090
cannot fall far from a fungus cause they were everywhere.
The Fungal Hyphae,

620
00:40:52.091 --> 00:40:54.190
there's sort of a route of the fungus,

621
00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.330
invades the leaf and very rapidly sucks,

622
00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:02.140
sucks out its nutrients.
And then what does it do with those nutrients?

623
00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:05.080
And one end of the fungus is attached to,

624
00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:09.580
to the decaying leaves and other stuff that falls down.

625
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:13.660
The other end is attached to the trees and it gives these nutrients to the
trees.

626
00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:15.460
Why is it so generous?

627
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:20.140
What are the cheese must be giving something to the fungus?
Well,

628
00:41:20.141 --> 00:41:24.400
the trees are up there in the sunlight.
The jungle floors is dark.
Very,
you know,

629
00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:27.430
there's canopy of the forest.
Let's very little sunlight really.

630
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:31.540
So they can't photosynthesize down the bottom.
Uh,
it's,
it's,

631
00:41:31.541 --> 00:41:35.180
there's not a lot of grass and stuff,
uh,
under jungle trees.

632
00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:40.160
So the trees make the sugars through photosynthesis,
they send them down,

633
00:41:40.161 --> 00:41:41.270
pass them with the fungus,

634
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:44.660
the fungus dictates everything and sends the nutrients back up into the tree.

635
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:46.370
It's a wonderful cycle.

636
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:51.290
And so basically all the nutrients are up in the jungle canopy up in the,

637
00:41:51.291 --> 00:41:55.580
up in the forest,
not,
uh,
in the soil.
Uh,

638
00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:59.950
so this stuff,
this decaying,
uh,
vegetable matter,
um,

639
00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:02.300
is the source of fertility.

640
00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:07.570
And you measure how much of it there is and the productivity of the soil depends

641
00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.460
very closely to the percent and depth of the humorous stuff is called Humus.

642
00:42:13.461 --> 00:42:18.190
In the soil,
in tropical soils,
it's less than 2%.
Uh,

643
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:22.040
of,
of the soil that things live in is humus.
In temperate soils,

644
00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:26.000
it's always over 10%.
In upper New York state or Ohio,

645
00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:29.270
it's 10 to 12%.
And the richest Iowa farm lands,

646
00:42:29.271 --> 00:42:31.310
it's up to 16%.

647
00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:35.330
So you can see the productivity of Iowa is just going to be just from the soil

648
00:42:35.331 --> 00:42:37.220
consideration is going to be an awful lot,

649
00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:40.460
a greater than the productivity of the Amazon.

650
00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:48.010
And another thing is the rapidity of decay aside anything that the fungus

651
00:42:48.411 --> 00:42:52.360
doesn't get,
which is rare decays by bacteria,
uh,

652
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:56.120
and maybe other fungi that don't,
uh,
don't feed the trees.

653
00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:00.020
And so it's hot,
it's hot all the time in the Amazon.

654
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:03.050
And what does temperature due to chemical reactions

655
00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:07.460
speeds them up.
So for every 10 degrees warmer,

656
00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:12.770
the chemical reaction in general goes twice as fast.
So in a jungle floor,

657
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:13.461
in a jungle,

658
00:43:13.461 --> 00:43:17.840
you'll have maybe 30 degrees higher than New York state than Ohio or Iowa.

659
00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:20.000
So that's two,
four,
eight decay.

660
00:43:20.001 --> 00:43:24.400
We'll go eight times as fast as in say,
New Yorker in,

661
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:29.180
in my backyard to say nothing of the absence of the winter where decay basically

662
00:43:29.181 --> 00:43:30.350
doesn't happen at all.

663
00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:35.420
I know I make a mulch pile and it takes four years.
When I put in a leave,

664
00:43:35.421 --> 00:43:40.220
four years later,
it's down to good soil and then it takes more years.

665
00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:43.460
I don't know how many before that turns all back to carbon dioxide and water.

666
00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.620
The whole thing is organic,
the whole thing.
Eventually it goes away.
Uh,

667
00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:51.830
in a jungle it happens much,
much more quickly.

668
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.560
So to summarize all this,
this is,
you know,
you've got to have some biology,

669
00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:01.100
this course.
Um,
so what is,
which is more fertile?

670
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:03.710
The Sahara desert or the Amazon basin,

671
00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:10.280
the answer's really surprising.
And there is a quote annually,

672
00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:15.520
millions of tons of dust from the Sahara or blown by the northeast Tradewinds

673
00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:21.410
thousands of kilometers across the Atlantic Ocean there and they settle upon the

674
00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:22.244
Amazon.

675
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:26.870
Some scientists suggest that this is one of the major sources of soil nutrients

676
00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.300
for the poor,
poor soil of the Amazon.

677
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:34.830
So it's really not a,
not a mile situation.
It's very extreme.
If,

678
00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:39.150
if nutrients from the Sahara can blow a few thousand miles and drop in and be a

679
00:44:39.151 --> 00:44:42.330
very significant source of nutrients for the Amazon.

680
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:49.350
<v 2>Okay.
Um,
now</v>

681
00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:54.120
<v 0>what happens?
You try to farm this place,
try to farm in a jungle.
What do you do?</v>

682
00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:57.030
What you have to chop down the trees right now.
Mind you,

683
00:44:57.031 --> 00:45:00.720
I told you that the forest floor is moist and dark and if any of you've been

684
00:45:00.721 --> 00:45:04.540
there,
you'll know that it's very,
very striking.
It's you're not boiling all.

685
00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:08.130
Now you cut down the trees,
the sun now beats down.

686
00:45:08.131 --> 00:45:11.640
The tropical sun can be quite brutal and it dries out the soil.

687
00:45:11.670 --> 00:45:13.980
It bakes the soil.
What dies?

688
00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:20.780
The fungi die cause fungi need coolish and moist environment.

689
00:45:21.090 --> 00:45:24.600
They die.
Your means of recycling nutrients is gone.

690
00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:27.240
The soil has very little nutrients themselves.

691
00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:30.120
What have you done with the trees that you're chopped down?

692
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:35.670
If you're a commercial agricultural place,
you shouldn't downriver to a saw mill.

693
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.880
Right?
So the nutrients that are there,
they're taken away.

694
00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:44.130
The secret of what's called Sweden agricultural slash and burn agriculture is

695
00:45:44.131 --> 00:45:47.070
that yes they do chop down the trees,
but in a very local,

696
00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:52.520
very small plot of land and they burned the trees in place and that puts the ash

697
00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:57.030
is the mineral nutrients which are so,
so missing in that fertilizes the soil.

698
00:45:57.031 --> 00:45:58.320
It's not wonderfully efficient,

699
00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:03.300
but it does work if you keep your plot small because then the fungus which is

700
00:46:03.301 --> 00:46:08.010
killed there can re invade from,
uh,
the surrounding trees.

701
00:46:08.011 --> 00:46:11.880
But you start doing commercial farming with many,
many acres of spread,

702
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:15.930
then there's no way that soil is going to regenerate.

703
00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:22.400
Okay.
So how does this work out?
Uh,
so for instance,
in

704
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.380
the Yucatan of Mexico,
uh,

705
00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:31.940
the Maya lived there for a very long time.
In the 16th century,

706
00:46:31.941 --> 00:46:35.990
a Franciscan bishop,
Diego Delonda,
who is,

707
00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:37.040
he wrote everything.

708
00:46:37.041 --> 00:46:42.041
Everything we know about the pre precolonial a Mayan existence comes from him.

709
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:44.480
The UK tendency from him.

710
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:49.340
The Yucatan is the country with the least earth that I have seen since all of it

711
00:46:49.341 --> 00:46:52.370
is one living rock and has wonderfully little earth.

712
00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:57.320
And when you read all these chronicles,
they always are,

713
00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.440
they're speaking oise of famines in the Yucatan cause there's so little,
uh,

714
00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:05.060
productivity.
And how do they avoid the famines?
And this is again,

715
00:47:05.061 --> 00:47:09.360
before the Spaniards calm,
uh,
they,
uh,

716
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:13.460
take care of their,
they have exports,
which they get food from,

717
00:47:13.461 --> 00:47:16.760
from better regions.
And what are the export honey?

718
00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.500
Which you don't have to farm soul,
which you don't farm and slaves.

719
00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:26.360
That's another use for quote excess people and controlling your population.

720
00:47:26.570 --> 00:47:31.380
You sell them as slaves and you look all over,
uh,
the,

721
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:34.990
the pre modern world.
And of course,
you know,
it's not going in the modern world.

722
00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:35.740
Uh,

723
00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:40.740
slavery is a very big thing in a very big part of what happens to population.

724
00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:45.440
We'll talk a little bit about that later.
Well,
let me say it now.
Loans,

725
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:50.230
the topic came up.
What is slavery response to?

726
00:47:51.110 --> 00:47:53.980
It's very relevant to the censure.
Under population.

727
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:57.370
You don't have enough laborers,
so you import

728
00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:00.400
in the middle of Europe,
you know,

729
00:48:00.401 --> 00:48:04.630
we have teaming populations or India or China or you can have an awful lot of

730
00:48:04.631 --> 00:48:08.410
slavery.
No,
there's no land for them to,
to,
to,

731
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:13.300
to be utilized.
Uh,
slaves get used like in the Roman empire,

732
00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:15.400
not as farmers.
There were hordes of,
of,

733
00:48:15.401 --> 00:48:18.220
of Romans peasants that would love to have some land to farm.

734
00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:21.450
They're used in the mines.
There were household slaves,

735
00:48:21.451 --> 00:48:25.910
sex slaves in the minds.
The Arab countries,
uh,

736
00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:30.400
took a lot of slaves from Madec through Madagascar and continental Africa,

737
00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:33.310
household slaves,
sex slaves,
somewhat in the minds,

738
00:48:33.311 --> 00:48:35.800
but they didn't have that many minds.

739
00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:39.610
So slavery is a response to under population.

740
00:48:39.611 --> 00:48:44.611
Where do you get the huge slavery when you discover the new world and how you

741
00:48:44.621 --> 00:48:48.370
have this very thin Indian population in these worlds?

742
00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.610
Largely because we killed him with diseases as you,

743
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:53.560
you either have read or will read.

744
00:48:54.010 --> 00:48:57.460
So we have an underpopulated to underpopulated huge continents.

745
00:48:57.710 --> 00:49:02.670
We've much good land.
Uh,
you first in,
in,
in Western,

746
00:49:02.671 --> 00:49:05.200
in history first you tried to enslave the Indians.

747
00:49:05.201 --> 00:49:07.360
The Indians don't do very well.
They die out.

748
00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:11.350
So you stop that and you import African slaves who managed to stay alive.

749
00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:16.680
So slavery itself is a response to under population that fits exactly into what

750
00:49:16.931 --> 00:49:19.630
I'm talking on.
A,
wherever you see massive slavery,

751
00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:25.020
you're going to find under puppet going to find areas of land that have nobody

752
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:30.630
on them and someone can by military force capture people and forced him to work

753
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:35.500
for themselves.
Okay.
Um,

754
00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:39.460
there's many other,
uh,

755
00:49:39.461 --> 00:49:44.210
reasons why the tropics are hard to farm.
Uh,

756
00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:49.720
where are the grain belts in the world?
What do you know about where grain grown?

757
00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:52.420
Where's it really rich places?

758
00:49:56.550 --> 00:49:57.383
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

759
00:49:58.330 --> 00:49:59.163
<v 0>Anybody.</v>

760
00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:04.880
US where in the u s Midwest.
Upper Midwest,
right?

761
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:07.280
Iowa,
Kansas,
Minnesota.

762
00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:11.900
And does it go from north of the u s yeah.
Yeah.
Saskatchewan,
Alberta,

763
00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:13.460
way the heck up there.

764
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:18.290
You have this fabulous production of grain and you see pictures of northern

765
00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:23.450
Saskatchewan in Canada with a big grain reaper's,
right?
China,

766
00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:26.720
where are the great grain fields of China?
Wheat.

767
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:33.890
I've been Manchuria right?
Goes up the north,

768
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:38.810
the northeast of China is all grain,
all wheat,
way up in dementia and men,

769
00:50:38.811 --> 00:50:42.860
sure it goes up.
It's more or less the same as Alberta and Saskatchewan.

770
00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:47.780
And in the south,
you don't get your great grain growing regions in,

771
00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:52.460
in the tropical regions,
certainly not the desert regions.
You get them.
Uh,

772
00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:53.660
Morocco for instance,

773
00:50:53.661 --> 00:50:58.020
has very productive agriculture right on the coast where it's at wet region.
Uh,

774
00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:00.530
that's not very far north and down.
South African,

775
00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.830
African just doesn't go that far south in South America,

776
00:51:03.831 --> 00:51:06.500
you get it down in Argentina.
So again,

777
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:11.560
so there's something that agricultural gets more productive the further north

778
00:51:11.781 --> 00:51:14.390
you go with a limit.
Of course it doesn't go into the tropics.

779
00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:19.190
And why should that be?
That goes contrary to our expectation.
And again,

780
00:51:19.191 --> 00:51:24.191
the reason is biologically rather simple that during the daytime,

781
00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:28.040
plants take in the sunlight and make sugar,
make energy,
right?

782
00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:33.380
They also respired they also have to run them their own machinery.

783
00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.160
So the also using energy,
using sugar all the time,
the user day,

784
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.510
and they use at night.

785
00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:44.000
Right now the sun goes down and photosynthesis shuts down.

786
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:47.990
But,
uh,
respiration continues.
They have to keep themselves alive at night.

787
00:51:47.991 --> 00:51:51.570
Just as we do.
We don't stop breathing when we go to sleep.
Um,

788
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:55.460
so the ratio between daylight and nighttime,
how much,

789
00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:58.860
how many hours of daylight and how many nighttime is a very important factor in

790
00:51:58.861 --> 00:52:03.020
plant productivity
in the tropics.
Uh,

791
00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:05.570
what's the ratio of daylight to night time?

792
00:52:05.571 --> 00:52:08.990
The whole year round about 12,
12 about equal.

793
00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:13.820
What does it up in Saskatchewan or Manchuria daylight,
daylight,
daylight.

794
00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:15.680
Very little nighttime.

795
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:20.720
So the plants have so many more hours in which they're photosynthesizing and

796
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:23.960
much smaller amount of time where they're not photosynthesizing but still

797
00:52:24.170 --> 00:52:25.003
respiring.

798
00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:29.180
So that's one big factor why you get these green belts going up north.

799
00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:30.403
Also temperature.

800
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:35.600
So how much energy does it take you to just keep yourself alive?

801
00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:39.560
Well,
we've just said all chemical reactions go every 10 degrees.

802
00:52:39.561 --> 00:52:44.180
They more or less double.
So respiration plants,
the warmer they are,

803
00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:48.170
the more respiration they have.
At nighttime,
it's still warm.
So every,

804
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:53.180
everything is working rather fast.
In the tropics,
in Canada,
man,

805
00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:57.140
it's a lot of sun during the day,
but it cools off at night.

806
00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.030
And so respray is a very low level.

807
00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:04.720
So the productivity of a plant is the balance between its photosynthetic

808
00:53:05.091 --> 00:53:07.430
production,
its production,
and its respiration.

809
00:53:07.431 --> 00:53:10.340
It's use of that produce for its own purposes.

810
00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:14.450
And there's a big difference in the ratio in the north from,
uh,

811
00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:17.480
from Iowa to Saskatchewan or from,
uh,

812
00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:23.590
the young seal up into Manchuria that that ratio is just much better than it is.

813
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:24.920
Uh,
in the,

814
00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:29.760
okay,

815
00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:34.560
so we won't continue too much with this.

816
00:53:34.561 --> 00:53:39.400
We could also talk about the diseases that,
uh,
in tropical regions you get,
uh,

817
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:44.430
uh,
malaria,
you get a whole bunch of insect borne diseases.

818
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:47.730
Uh,
CDC flies,
carry sleeping,

819
00:53:47.731 --> 00:53:50.520
sickness and et cetera.

820
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:54.300
One to 2 million Africans die of malaria every year.

821
00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.550
And that's about the same number as aids.

822
00:53:56.551 --> 00:54:00.570
It's malaria and aids are about equally devastating to a population.

823
00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:01.710
Uh,

824
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:06.710
so it's about 11 to 22% of all deaths in Africa or are malaria deaths and yellow

825
00:54:08.431 --> 00:54:12.840
fever,
lush,
Manassas bilharzia,
roundworm hookworm.

826
00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:18.140
The number of parasites that live in tropical regions is enormous and very often

827
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.120
kill.
They kill humans and make them,

828
00:54:21.121 --> 00:54:26.090
they can't go in there to farm because they'll get,
they'll die.
So why,

829
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:30.180
why are the tropics so much more susceptible to disease?

830
00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:35.010
This kind of disease,
insect porn stuff then than the northern regions?

831
00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:39.510
It's a simple factor.
Winter,

832
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:45.150
winter kills insects because the massively very hard for insects to not freeze

833
00:54:45.151 --> 00:54:48.720
to death over the winter.
Tropics don't have winter,

834
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:52.470
so it's a whole class of problems.
They dry out,

835
00:54:52.471 --> 00:54:56.490
the winter is extremely dry and they both desiccate and freeze and it's very

836
00:54:56.491 --> 00:55:00.180
hard.
Organisms kill him in the tropics.
Nice.

837
00:55:00.181 --> 00:55:03.870
All the time in six just have good time and they can evolve.

838
00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:08.100
Is there evolution to attack animals and people?
Uh,

839
00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:13.380
much better.
So all of this really adds up.

840
00:55:16.050 --> 00:55:20.760
Angiography counts and people have to adapt to the geography.

841
00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:25.680
In this case,
the adaptation is to an under population and I'm going to show you,

842
00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:32.030
<v 2>oh,
oh,
oh,
I'm going the wrong way.</v>

843
00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:38.803
Well yeah,

844
00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:44.070
<v 0>this is give you an idea of of how densely pop that Africa is or isn't here or</v>

845
00:55:44.071 --> 00:55:47.710
some European,
some non African places.
Netherlands is,

846
00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:52.790
is one of the most crowded with in the world.
1,010 people per square mile.

847
00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:58.160
Uh,
Japan,
870.
But that's in terms of arable land,

848
00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:01.880
Japan is mostly mountains.
They just have very small areas where people can lend.

849
00:56:01.881 --> 00:56:04.910
So to compare Netherlands offside,
people can live everywhere.

850
00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:06.320
But you want to compare this to that.

851
00:56:06.321 --> 00:56:11.270
They're probably per arable land worth more crowded than Netherlands.
Belgium,

852
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:15.920
same as on India,
China.
And again,
China's same thing.

853
00:56:15.921 --> 00:56:18.500
They have the whole Himalaya mountains in the west,

854
00:56:18.501 --> 00:56:22.580
the whole huge dry regions in the north to bed.
And uh,

855
00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:27.610
I'm Mongolia and,
and the northwest regions.
So this is a way and underestimate,

856
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:31.480
uh,
for China.
Mexico has a lot of desert,

857
00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:34.450
it looks fairly under populated,

858
00:56:34.451 --> 00:56:38.650
but a lot of that is because you've got desert space.
Now you go to Africa,

859
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:44.290
Nigeria,
one of the most densely places is 346.
That's not,

860
00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:47.050
not extremely since since Nigeria,

861
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:51.970
it's all not no mountains,
no deserts.
Uh,
in principle,

862
00:56:51.971 --> 00:56:54.310
all of this land could be used.
So that's a real number.

863
00:56:54.610 --> 00:56:57.760
Whereas the Chinese number,
you should multiply it by like a factor of three.

864
00:56:57.761 --> 00:57:00.340
It's about a third of the Chinese land that's actually Arabelle.

865
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:04.180
So China's Ballpark of thousand in Nigeria is about a third of that.

866
00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:06.910
Kenya is down.
And again,

867
00:57:06.911 --> 00:57:11.770
Kenya is pretty much all livable and they have a little puncture pipe.

868
00:57:11.771 --> 00:57:15.280
They didn't Madagascar's all livable and go is all livable.

869
00:57:15.490 --> 00:57:19.720
Mali and Niger have deserts.
So those numbers have to be,
uh,
corrected.

870
00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:21.580
Congo doesn't have have deserts.

871
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.760
So the point is that the at population density in Africa is a lot less than

872
00:57:27.101 --> 00:57:30.010
other places that we think are,
are,
are,
are,
are,

873
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:33.010
we don't think of Holland is over populated,

874
00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:37.990
but in terms of of just a simple people per hour,
the land,
it definitely is.

875
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:41.020
And so Africans,
again,

876
00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:45.070
we're looking at something that has a big historical component yet be careful

877
00:57:45.071 --> 00:57:47.680
when I'm talking or what era of time I'm talking about.

878
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:51.280
These are modern numbers aren't going to show you.
Uh,

879
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:54.070
but they reflect people's attitudes that have changed,

880
00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:58.330
are appropriate for some time in the past and only change very slowly.

881
00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:03.100
So this is Morocco on the coast.
This is not part of the sub Saharan Africa zone.

882
00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:06.490
This is very,
very integrated into the Mediterranean zone.

883
00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:08.320
Almost everything you can say about its culture,

884
00:58:08.321 --> 00:58:10.000
it's really a Mediterranean culture.

885
00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:13.690
And look what's happened to its fertility over time.
It was very high,

886
00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:15.820
more or less equal to every other place.
Seven,

887
00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:19.930
I don't know how well you can see that 7.2 children per women and that stayed

888
00:58:19.931 --> 00:58:20.590
the same.

889
00:58:20.590 --> 00:58:25.590
But in recent times it's gone down to less than half of that 3.2 and this is not

890
00:58:26.441 --> 00:58:30.070
the most recent data.
I wanted to show you a little bit older data.

891
00:58:30.220 --> 00:58:33.640
It's going down even further in that zone of North Africa.

892
00:58:33.641 --> 00:58:38.641
Tunisia is at a replacement fertility level and north Africa has characteristic

893
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:46.180
of this.
Now I'm going to show you the next country to the south,

894
00:58:46.181 --> 00:58:50.620
which is Molly.
I'm s,
I'm sorry,

895
00:58:50.621 --> 00:58:52.630
nine nine Ni.
Cheryl's as mentally he's also there.

896
00:58:53.110 --> 00:58:55.420
But in Asia is when you go south,

897
00:58:55.421 --> 00:58:58.000
you crossed the Sarah Desert and you're in sub Saharan Africa.

898
00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:02.380
Now look at its fertility.
Say this even a little bit later in time.

899
00:59:02.381 --> 00:59:07.000
And look at its fertility rate hasn't budged at all.
It's,
it's again,

900
00:59:07.210 --> 00:59:10.390
eight,
seven,
eight children in the middle age children.

901
00:59:10.391 --> 00:59:14.020
And it ends up here even more than it was in 1950s.

902
00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:16.810
So it has not changed,

903
00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:21.470
but the number of the fertility rate has not responded to whatever it is about

904
00:59:21.471 --> 00:59:23.300
modern times.
And we'll talk about it a lot.

905
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:27.170
That has closed for charity to go down.
Now,

906
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.800
one thing you can say is,
um,

907
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:35.540
uh,
how many,

908
00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:39.380
how many women don't want to have any more children.

909
00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:42.320
And that of course depends on the number that you already have,

910
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:46.940
but it gets up to starts.
Women have no children,
very,
very few.

911
00:59:46.941 --> 00:59:49.550
Most of them are children that they have one child.

912
00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:52.340
That's enough for two at two children ready.

913
00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:56.630
You have like 40% women race,
Santa Ana to children's enough for me.
Again,

914
00:59:56.631 --> 00:59:59.540
this is Morocco,
uh,
in the Mediterranean zone.

915
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:03.340
And then when you get up to six children,
almost everybody says enough,
you know,

916
01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.880
and the average of the whole country is,

917
01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:09.920
that's like 53.3% more than half of the women,

918
01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:15.170
uh,
say,
okay,
no more children.
And uh,
again,

919
01:00:15.171 --> 01:00:19.010
this data is some years old.
It's even lower now.

920
01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:24.700
And you compare this to Molly and this is the number of women that don't want

921
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:31.250
any more children.
I think the final layer is 8.6 or something.

922
01:00:31.251 --> 01:00:33.950
An enormous difference.
And no matter how many children they have,

923
01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:37.160
even this is eight.
And uh,
sorry,

924
01:00:37.161 --> 01:00:41.900
six and more children still only very few.
About a third of them say,
okay,
six,

925
01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:46.790
six or however many,
I have six and over is enough for me.
So,

926
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:51.860
uh,
let's see.
And this is,

927
01:00:51.861 --> 01:00:56.650
uh,
uh,
in,
in respect of those two.
Um,

928
01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:01.220
so you might say,
well,
uh,
uh,
uh,

929
01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:06.180
Nisha is a very poor country of Morocco,
is not anywhere near support,

930
01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.550
has something to do with like infant mortality.
And so this is indeed Morocco.

931
01:01:10.551 --> 01:01:15.410
And look,
infant mortality has come down quite a bit.
It's,
it's,

932
01:01:15.411 --> 01:01:18.260
it's,
it's getting there.
Uh,
and so you say,
oh,

933
01:01:18.261 --> 01:01:20.590
well that's why Morocco Moroccans want,

934
01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:23.810
want and have fewer children cause they have a better situation with infant

935
01:01:23.811 --> 01:01:24.644
mortality.

936
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:29.570
But then you look at a new share and not,

937
01:01:29.571 --> 01:01:33.860
it's not an,
it is not as good as Morocco,
but it's still come down quite a bit.

938
01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.500
And since then it's come down further.

939
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:40.250
And you'd expect what you'd see some response in the fertility levels to that.

940
01:01:40.251 --> 01:01:45.150
But you don't,
you don't see
it at all.
Uh,

941
01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:50.090
what's the difference?
Uh,
it's not religion,
so both knees share and,

942
01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:54.350
uh,
Rocco is Sunni Muslim.
So,
and as far as I'm aware,

943
01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:59.180
there's no big differences in the interpretation of,
of religion there.

944
01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:04.780
And you see the same story in Christian sub Saharan Africa countries.

945
01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:10.480
This is Tanzania again about the same years and basically no change in

946
01:02:12.321 --> 01:02:15.440
fertility.
A little drop in very recent times.

947
01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:19.320
A Zombie is coming up next Zombie,

948
01:02:19.321 --> 01:02:23.160
it's even went higher and then it's down back to where,

949
01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:24.660
approximately where it started.

950
01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.810
So this is characteristics and not a religious thing.

951
01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:32.520
It's there's something special about sub Saharan Africa,
even South America,

952
01:02:32.521 --> 01:02:35.220
it doesn't look like this at all.

953
01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:38.400
The fruit self Homeric the fertility's is way,
way down.

954
01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.240
There is something quite special about Africa and we're going to have to try to

955
01:02:46.171 --> 01:02:48.180
figure out what that is.

956
01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:55.600
You'll read a really interesting article,
uh,
by uh,

957
01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.110
John Caldwell,
um,

958
01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.820
which talks about a whole culture of,
of reproduction.

959
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:07.140
And again,
Africa is a huge place,

960
01:03:07.141 --> 01:03:10.910
has many different cultures and we're just talking to sub Saharan Africa was

961
01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:14.950
north.
North Africa is a different story.
Uh,
South Africa where you have the,

962
01:03:14.951 --> 01:03:18.750
the European settlement,
that's another different story.
But the bulk of,

963
01:03:18.751 --> 01:03:22.560
of central Africa to some degree fits this.

964
01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:27.000
You have places where you don't have bad soils.
So,
uh,
in the tropics,

965
01:03:27.001 --> 01:03:31.120
Java has volcanoes,
volcanoes replenish the soil.
Uh,
the,

966
01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:36.060
the mountain slopes of Kenya have have good soil from,
from again,
volcanic soil.

967
01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.900
So the stories there are a little different,
but in general,

968
01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:43.440
we're talking about those parts.
In Africa where it's hard to stay alive.

969
01:03:43.441 --> 01:03:45.550
It's hard to get a population,
uh,

970
01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:49.330
going that were the places traditionally underpopulated and adjust.

971
01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:52.300
Now with Western medicine on the popular,

972
01:03:52.301 --> 01:03:55.650
either population rates coming up to where you might consider it crowded and

973
01:03:55.651 --> 01:03:58.830
places like Nigeria now is certainly a crowded.

974
01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.670
Uh,
so

975
01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:05.761
in Africa,

976
01:04:05.761 --> 01:04:10.650
reproduction is at the core of the central core of traditional culture.

977
01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:16.310
And their religious ideas are all tied in very centrally with reproduction and

978
01:04:17.821 --> 01:04:19.930
the lineage itself,
that means your,

979
01:04:19.931 --> 01:04:24.931
your line of ancestors and the prime duty of a human in this cultural setting is

980
01:04:25.891 --> 01:04:27.750
to reproduce lineage,

981
01:04:27.751 --> 01:04:31.770
keep the lineage going is not at all unique to Africa.
In,
uh,

982
01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:36.110
in Indonesia.
I saw there's an awful lot of this going on in Sulawesi.
Oh,

983
01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:41.010
I'll talk about other examples of it.
It's very,
it's very pronounced in Africa,

984
01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:43.650
but non any sense?
Uh,
unique.

985
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:47.730
And the idea is that one of the ideas that when a man dies,

986
01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:51.420
he doesn't just disappear.
We have a nice funeral service and say,
bye bye.

987
01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:55.060
And maybe once a year we come in and give flowers,
uh,
onto the gray.

988
01:04:55.061 --> 01:05:00.061
But we have no sense that that person is still around in these traditional parts

989
01:05:00.811 --> 01:05:05.670
of the world.
Uh,
the person lives on in kind of a shadow,
a shadow world,

990
01:05:05.850 --> 01:05:09.840
but he can communicate with his descendants.
That's not often not very difficult.

991
01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:14.020
And he is dependent on his,
his descendants for sustenance.
Uh,

992
01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:16.860
if they don't feed him and give him what he needs in the afterlife,

993
01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:21.430
he is in big trouble.
And if a man does not have descendants,

994
01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:26.020
then he really doesn't get anything and he dies.
And again,

995
01:05:26.021 --> 01:05:29.980
I saw this in Bali enormously where there was an enormous effort to bring

996
01:05:29.981 --> 01:05:34.660
offerings to,
to the,
the recently dead ancestors.
And they're very,

997
01:05:34.661 --> 01:05:38.230
very sensitive about it.
You've seen Bali,
the women carrying these be on there.

998
01:05:38.231 --> 01:05:38.981
They're beautiful.

999
01:05:38.981 --> 01:05:42.760
And they're beautiful dress and they have these huge platters on their heads,

1000
01:05:42.761 --> 01:05:46.120
filled with the most delicious fruits and arranges just gorgeously.

1001
01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:50.930
And they bring him to the temple and the ancestors,
uh,

1002
01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:52.600
can partake of them.

1003
01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:55.360
And then the next day they come and take it home and eat it because they

1004
01:05:55.361 --> 01:05:59.410
understand that the ancestors are getting spiritual,
not,
not the physical stuff.

1005
01:05:59.411 --> 01:06:03.490
So they leave it there and then the ancestors can take what they get out of it

1006
01:06:03.491 --> 01:06:06.850
and then the humans can take what they get out of it.
So it's not wasteful.

1007
01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:10.190
And you see every store and every house will have a little everyday,

1008
01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:14.230
a little thing out in,
in,
in the front with a little bit of grain and everything.

1009
01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:17.890
And the dogs come buy and eat.
And of course,
the dogs come buy and eat it.

1010
01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:21.330
But that's okay.
The ancestors have taken in,

1011
01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:25.390
the spirits have taken what they want out of this.

1012
01:06:26.530 --> 01:06:30.640
So,
uh,
in temperate zones,

1013
01:06:30.641 --> 01:06:35.530
we associate religion and our culture,
big empires,
big states.

1014
01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:36.820
United States is huge.

1015
01:06:36.821 --> 01:06:40.540
And any Western country in populations is large compared to say,

1016
01:06:40.610 --> 01:06:44.470
a Balinese village or an African village.

1017
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:47.890
And religion is big.
You know,
how many billions of Christians are there?

1018
01:06:47.891 --> 01:06:52.210
How many billions of Muslims are they're Buddhists,
Hindus,
you know,
we got every,

1019
01:06:52.211 --> 01:06:56.500
everything is is big.
Uh,
in Africa in a sense.

1020
01:06:56.680 --> 01:07:01.330
Each family's ancestors are it's gods and both political and traditional time.

1021
01:07:01.331 --> 01:07:04.900
Polk political authority and religion are very,
very local affairs.

1022
01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.910
They're not agglomerated into big things.

1023
01:07:06.911 --> 01:07:11.410
No one expects the people in this village to worship the same as the people,
uh,

1024
01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:14.020
in,
in,
in the next village.

1025
01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:19.360
And so there isn't so much the idea of a central monotheistic type of God,

1026
01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:23.140
which is you use that comes up when you have empires.
We have a central emperor,

1027
01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.690
you have a central God,
but when you don't,

1028
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:30.010
when you're a political thing is just your village.
Again,
traditional times,
uh,

1029
01:07:30.011 --> 01:07:32.920
there's no concept.
There's no need to have the,

1030
01:07:32.921 --> 01:07:37.921
these either central political leaders were central religious gods.

1031
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:43.710
And so in mortality for you is provided by your descendants in mortality.

1032
01:07:44.111 --> 01:07:48.490
It's very local.
It's your own descendants that changes in,

1033
01:07:48.491 --> 01:07:52.810
in western London,
especially in the Muslim Judeo Christian tradition.

1034
01:07:53.140 --> 01:07:57.640
It's the religion.
It's God that gives you a mortality.
It's not your descendants.

1035
01:07:57.790 --> 01:08:00.940
So everybody's interested in mortality.
It's very important,
you know,

1036
01:08:00.941 --> 01:08:02.860
whether you go to heaven or Helen and so forth.

1037
01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:07.750
But the huge shift is whether it's given to you by your descendants,

1038
01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:11.050
whether they take care of you and give you a kind of immortality or it's given

1039
01:08:11.051 --> 01:08:13.450
to you by your big mega religion,

1040
01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.890
which tells you what you have to do in order to gain,
uh,

1041
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:22.310
and mortality.
So when a person dies there again,

1042
01:08:22.311 --> 01:08:24.380
they don't go off to a distant heaven.

1043
01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:28.250
They stay right locally and gradually after a few generations,

1044
01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:30.530
they kind of disappear into the mist.

1045
01:08:30.531 --> 01:08:34.880
And they have a very careful departure.
So in again,

1046
01:08:34.881 --> 01:08:38.900
in Indonesia,
again,
comparing tropical region,
one of the big,

1047
01:08:38.901 --> 01:08:43.130
ours is called Sulawesi or celebes,
as we say,
in Western languages.

1048
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:47.750
And in again,
many different cultures.
But in some of them,
a person dies.

1049
01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:50.240
You don't want to disturb that person because they can,

1050
01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:54.920
they can do bad stuff to you.
So you swat them,

1051
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:55.670
he's going to rot.

1052
01:08:55.670 --> 01:08:58.060
So you've got problems so that you give them swaddling clothes and you sit them

1053
01:08:58.061 --> 01:09:01.490
in a chair,
him or her in a chair,
right in his own bedroom,

1054
01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.490
right where they live in houses,
sort of,
uh,

1055
01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.060
you know that houses and they sit there and,

1056
01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:11.570
and for a long time and gradually as they decay,

1057
01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:14.000
they smell,
they take off the swelling clothes,

1058
01:09:14.001 --> 01:09:17.690
get rid of that and swaddle them up again until they're down to bones.

1059
01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:20.540
And then they're taken up.
So they're not disturbed by that time.
Okay.

1060
01:09:20.541 --> 01:09:22.940
They're ready.
They don't have their flesh anymore.
They're ready to leave.

1061
01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.110
So the taking,
there's big cliffs overlooking the village and there's caves,

1062
01:09:27.111 --> 01:09:31.010
natural caves in the cliff and the dead bodies are brought up there to sit and

1063
01:09:31.011 --> 01:09:35.540
look down over the village.
They're not very far away.
It's,
it's really quite,

1064
01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:36.583
quite wonderful.

1065
01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:42.850
I was in Bali and stumbling around and funny circumstances in a,

1066
01:09:42.851 --> 01:09:46.490
in a cemetery and all these graves were open and I heard,
you know,

1067
01:09:46.491 --> 01:09:46.971
what's going on?

1068
01:09:46.971 --> 01:09:50.120
Are they expecting of the dug an awful lot of graves expecting everybody to die

1069
01:09:50.121 --> 01:09:55.100
soon?
No.
It turns out that uh,
a rich man had just died.

1070
01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:59.240
Now the poor people want to uh,
provide for their,

1071
01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:03.200
their ancestors in the next life,
but they don't have any money.

1072
01:10:03.201 --> 01:10:04.340
They don't have any stuff.

1073
01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.150
So they bury them and they wait until the rich man dies.

1074
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:10.190
Then Richmond has this huge procession.

1075
01:10:10.191 --> 01:10:12.580
They're wonderful things to see with you know,

1076
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:16.640
big caskets and big charities and all this just wonderful prepping and very rich

1077
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:22.030
and the rich man body is thrown into the ocean and all kinds of stuff is thrown

1078
01:10:22.341 --> 01:10:26.900
into the ocean,
uh,
to support this,
this rich man in his afterlife.

1079
01:10:27.230 --> 01:10:31.070
Well,
the poor people and it's quite okay cause very communal culture.
Molly,

1080
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:32.660
very supportive of poor people.

1081
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:36.590
They dig up their bodies and they bring him in at the same time the rich man is

1082
01:10:36.591 --> 01:10:39.020
put into the ocean.
The poor people are putting into the ocean.

1083
01:10:39.021 --> 01:10:43.900
They partake of all of this.
And then what happens next day?
Of course,
the ocean,

1084
01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:46.640
all the coins and whatnot have come up up,

1085
01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:49.040
up on the beach and the rag pickers,

1086
01:10:49.041 --> 01:10:53.600
the really poor people combined collect all this stuff.
So it has the,
this,

1087
01:10:53.601 --> 01:10:57.950
this cultural act of,
of varying rich,
not only,
uh,

1088
01:10:58.260 --> 01:11:01.400
does equalize the afterlife for the rich people in the poor people,

1089
01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:05.060
but the very poorest people who are still alive get some income out of it as

1090
01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:07.220
well as,
of course,
everybody who prepares the funeral.

1091
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:11.390
So it's a wonderful sort of way that everything sort of hangs together as they

1092
01:11:11.391 --> 01:11:16.170
usually do in cultures.
Okay.
Uh,
we will continue,
uh,

1093
01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.030
next time.
