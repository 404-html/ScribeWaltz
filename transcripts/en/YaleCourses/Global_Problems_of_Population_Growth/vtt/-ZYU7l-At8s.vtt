1
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.600
Did I tell you the story when a one of my friends was offered to buy from me.

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.690
So I was in Upper Egypt and,
uh,

3
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.430
I was traveling with a young lady and,
uh,
a third woman,

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.000
a little bit older,
sort of was traveling alone.
It's not terribly comfortable.

5
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:22.380
She asked to join us and said,
that's fine.
So the three of us were sitting there,

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.600
uh,
in near [inaudible] and um,
there was,

7
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:30.600
uh,
two men sitting sort of across the room.

8
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.650
One of them dressed in clearly Arab garb and one restroom rather modern,

9
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.980
you know,
suit.
And at some point,
uh,
the,

10
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.270
the guy in the suit came over,
introduced himself very politely,

11
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.580
and he was a Palestinian and the other man was a Saudi Arabian shake.

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.830
And they had noticed that I had two wives.
And uh,

13
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.170
so the shake had,
uh,
wanted to know,
uh,

14
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.820
would like to purchase the second one,
the older one,
the second wife for me.

15
00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.790
And since it was the somewhat older one,
he thought I wouldn't mind.

16
00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.370
It was very much,
it was,

17
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.290
it was a wonderful scene because as you know,
Palestinians very sophisticated,

18
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:12.380
they've been living with Jews,
you know,

19
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.790
we're basically Europeans for a very long time,

20
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:19.110
so they're just like anybody else.
Uh,
but the,

21
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.610
the Saudi Arabian shake was obviously living not in the modern world.

22
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.750
And this port Palestinian had an intermediate so he was very scared.

23
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.260
And you know how I would respond to what I make a scene with.
I slugged him,

24
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.440
I tried to get him arrested or you know,
any of this sort of stuff.

25
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.700
But of course it was immediately obvious to me what was going on and to,
to,

26
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.820
to my two lady friends.
And so we played it.
Very cool.

27
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.500
And please sit down,
let's discuss this.
You know,
how old,

28
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.890
how old is their shake?
How many wives does he already have?

29
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.600
How many has he divorced?

30
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.210
Does he have any concubines in addition to his wives,
how much money he had,

31
00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.070
et cetera.
Said we have very,
very nice,
polite thing.

32
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.280
And you could just see the intermediary,
you know,
his face.
Just relax.
You know,

33
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.840
cause he was,
he was expecting,
you know,
something terrible,

34
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.190
but everybody played along.
It went off very well.
And in the,
in the,

35
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:13.820
in the middle of this,
um,
the,

36
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.890
the shake calls the intermediary over back to him and they talk something and

37
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:22.860
outcomes a,
a velvet purse given to the Palestinian.

38
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:27.630
Then he gives me as a sign of good,
of good faith on the part of sorta hit.

39
00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:32.040
And he wanted me to have this,
what is it,
a set of Muslim prayer beads,

40
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.620
beautiful cat size stones.
Many not just a champion,
beautiful,
beautiful,
uh,

41
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.140
handiwork and probably very valuable.
I was looking for to bring to yes,

42
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.650
actually last time and I can't find it right now.
Um,
but everything worked out.

43
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.830
The woman paid very great attention to what was going on and uh,

44
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.820
we said politely at the end that we would consider and give them an answer

45
00:02:53.821 --> 00:02:55.640
tomorrow.
And uh,

46
00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.220
in the end she didn't want to be bought even though she was obviously going to

47
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:04.570
have some good chunk of change out of it,
or at least I was.

48
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.390
Okay.
Uh,
the other two,
uh,

49
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.450
things will have to be delayed because Ellie is areas not here.

50
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.670
And we have to add something to know as presentation.
Okay,

51
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:22.870
let's get that.

52
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.660
So last time we were discussing Europe and uh,

53
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.560
we were coming into the,

54
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.760
we start discussed the middle ages and we start with Europe because we have the

55
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:40.600
best data.
We have very,
very good data about lots and lots of things from Europe.

56
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.880
It's not so good from the rest of the world.

57
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.730
And from about for about 500 years,

58
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:52.180
from 1200 to 1700,
the data poor is,

59
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:56.680
the data is a shows a population really didn't rise a terribly much.

60
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.710
They were in some sort of,
uh,
of,
of a Stacy bus.

61
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.490
And the reasons for this,
uh,

62
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.260
where we've discussed a little bit,

63
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.480
we talked about the plague and the plague lasted like 500 years.

64
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.120
Um,
since we're going to skip the to ash,

65
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.790
this is,
um,
oops.

66
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.493
Here we go.

67
00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.210
So remember the plague hit Europe in 1347.

68
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.170
So this table where they have good data starts 200 years later.

69
00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:38.300
The plague has been around for 200 years.

70
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.440
And still there's a number of cases that's not individual,

71
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.250
not individuals with different cities and places in which there was an outbreak.

72
00:04:46.251 --> 00:04:50.660
And we just don't have good records of how many people died.
But 15,
50,

73
00:04:50.661 --> 00:04:55.610
1600,
16,
50,
see,
the plague is dying out slowly.
And there's many,

74
00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:56.331
many theories,

75
00:04:56.331 --> 00:05:00.800
whether people got resistance to it or the rats that carried had died.

76
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.990
Uh,
we're outcome pay out,
competed by another species of rats,
not known,

77
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.270
but the plague did eventually die out.

78
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.540
But from 1347 to 1849 is 500 years where the plague keeps recurring.

79
00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.860
So that was clearly one of the reasons why population couldn't grow.

80
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.480
Then there was violence.
It was constant small level violence.

81
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.490
And then when the Protestant reformation happened to religious wars broke out.

82
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.480
And uh,
according to,
uh,

83
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.630
one of the standard textbooks of European history,
uh,

84
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.010
they ran from 1531 up to 1657.

85
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.340
So another hundred and 30 years of slaughter.

86
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.160
And they rolled around different places in Europe.

87
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.410
And by the time they were done,
the most contested southern Europe,
uh,

88
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.890
stayed Catholic in the very northern became Protestant,

89
00:05:57.891 --> 00:06:00.770
but the middle of Europe was strongly contested.

90
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.610
And so something like a third to a half of everybody got killed,
uh,

91
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.940
in this time because of the religious wars.

92
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.720
This is the period that mall office is describing and we'll come back to office

93
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.500
that Martha's knew about.

94
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.880
This is the history that he understood and we'll come back to what his theories

95
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:20.630
were.

96
00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:25.630
But historians now agree pretty much that productivity of the land,

97
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:28.090
especially agriculture because that was the,

98
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.720
the main occupation was rising very slowly during this period.

99
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.530
But populations also rising very slowly during this period.

100
00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.800
So pretty much the gains in agricultural productivity were balanced by the Games

101
00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:46.880
in population and the average standard of living,
uh,
did not improve.

102
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:49.610
And we'll talk a good bit more about that

103
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.480
now.
Why?
So the question,
uh,

104
00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:58.160
I mean it's pretty obvious why they were not able to improve agricultural

105
00:06:58.161 --> 00:06:58.851
productivity,

106
00:06:58.851 --> 00:07:02.900
why they were not able to significantly improve any other kind of manufacturing

107
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:03.734
code activity,

108
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.090
why they're were not able to do anything to fight these diseases.

109
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.930
And it comes down to that not only was there no science,

110
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.440
scientific knowledge as we currently understand the word scientific,

111
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.830
there really wasn't any particular interest in intellectually in the real world.

112
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.770
Everything was focused on religion and the,
the,

113
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.390
the other world.

114
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.800
So there was not a lot of intellectual energy expended in trying to understand

115
00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:37.010
what was going on around your feet,
so to speak.

116
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.860
And because that all kinds of problems that we take for granted,

117
00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:47.240
all kinds of ways of dealing with the real world,
just we're not even,

118
00:07:47.241 --> 00:07:50.360
we're not really thought about in any serious way.

119
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.590
So sanitation up until the 18th century,

120
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:57.920
up until the 18 hundreds,
actually,
uh,

121
00:07:57.921 --> 00:08:01.570
the sanitation in Europe was just absolutely atrocious.
Uh,

122
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.370
there was no system for disposing of human waste.

123
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:09.680
Nobody bothered to pay attention to what to do with human ways and feces.

124
00:08:09.681 --> 00:08:13.710
We're basically everywhere.
Wherever you went there,
there was someone else's,
uh,

125
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.320
feces
in the 18th century.
Uh,

126
00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:22.010
the city streets everywhere had ditches down the middle of the street.

127
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.310
And that's where the feces got done.

128
00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.070
There were buckets inside the house and some servant or the housewives would

129
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:32.800
take the bucket and dump it into these ditches.
Um,

130
00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.060
and they're also used as latrines.

131
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:37.670
People would just go out there and they didn't have a bucket in the house.

132
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:42.350
They didn't have a house go in and do it in the latrine.
Again,
in each case,

133
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:44.840
I'm going to pick,
I was in Belize,

134
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.620
Belize City and in Latin America and Central America as you know,

135
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:52.940
not that many years ago in the middle of the street as one big latrine in the

136
00:08:52.941 --> 00:08:56.910
stink was just incredible.
Um,

137
00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.200
so,
uh,
now you didn't actually have to,

138
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:04.650
we're not required to actually take your bucket of feces and dumped them in the

139
00:09:04.651 --> 00:09:07.350
street.
You could throw them out your window and,

140
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:12.530
but eventually people did start thinking about that and the issue was not a

141
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:17.820
dumping on someone's head.
And,
uh,
in Edinburgh,

142
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:19.530
Edinburgh in Scotland,

143
00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:23.940
they rang bells at 10:00 PM at night when they figured people should be off the

144
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:28.080
street.
And that was the specified time for dumping excrement out your window.

145
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.910
Some of the older view that were properly brought up for young men who may be

146
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:37.911
told that you should walk on the street side when you're as escorting a young

147
00:09:38.101 --> 00:09:41.970
lady.
Do you know what that's for?
When stuff gets dumped out the window,

148
00:09:41.971 --> 00:09:45.600
it's not to prevent spat splash from cars.
It's,

149
00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:48.720
it's way be way earlier than cars.
It was too,

150
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:51.930
so that when someone dumped stuff out the window,
it would,
uh,

151
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:57.300
the lady would be under some kind of earnings there.
Um,

152
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.650
and it wasn't only the common people,
the poor,
the uneducated,
uh,

153
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:08.700
that we're living in such fills,
it went right up to the royalty.
So,

154
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:12.960
and we have records of this in 1665,
there was a great plague in London,

155
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.390
one of those that I've showed you there.

156
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:20.660
And that's the one that written about by a Robinson Crusoe author,

157
00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.240
Daniel Defoe.
And so king the King Charles the second,
uh,

158
00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:30.160
in his court took his refuge in Oxford University.
Now,
Yay.

159
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.620
I was modeled after a lot of Yale's model after Oxford.

160
00:10:32.621 --> 00:10:35.580
So you have a good image of what it looks like.

161
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.260
And the play goes over.
Took about a year that plays over there.

162
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.800
They went back to London and just left whatever they laughed in Oxford in the

163
00:10:43.801 --> 00:10:48.150
cleaning people came in.
And what did they find?
Excrement everywhere.

164
00:10:48.151 --> 00:10:51.840
They described the excrement in every corner in chimneys and studies in coal

165
00:10:51.841 --> 00:10:55.680
houses,
in sellers,
uh,
just all over the place.

166
00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.720
Now,
some of this information comes from the diary of Samuel Peppers.

167
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.660
How many of you are aware of this?
Some of you,
again,

168
00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:08.610
if you've taken a history or literature,
he was a famous diarist.
Uh,

169
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.700
from that he was England's first secretary of the admiralty,

170
00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:15.450
a member of parliament,
president of the Royal Scientific Society.

171
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:18.660
So he was not your ordinary average guy.

172
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:23.730
He was educated and money and the upper classes,
but he writes it,
he didn't,

173
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:26.550
when he had to dedicate and in the middle of the night,

174
00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:28.670
he didn't bother to go to the privy.
Uh,

175
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.290
he just as positive his feces in the fireplace.

176
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:38.040
So,
uh,
you can see that it was a smelly place to live in.

177
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.120
Now along with that,

178
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:46.470
no concern or no thought about where your deposit,
your excrement,

179
00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:50.140
uh,
the idea of keeping drinking water separate from this action,

180
00:11:50.141 --> 00:11:55.141
it was not in anybody's mind that very often,

181
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.750
if they were public of holes of,

182
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:00.820
of someplace where the public could go to do their thing,

183
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:04.750
then maybe right next to it was a drinking fountain.

184
00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:07.283
Uh,

185
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.850
and in terms of the waste in the streets,
um,

186
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.380
it wasn't just feces,
but everything else was just dumped into the streets.
So,

187
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.410
uh,
England,
especially lots of animals,
you are,
you're a Penn animals on,

188
00:12:21.411 --> 00:12:24.070
on like China.
And,
um,

189
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:29.310
when animals died just left in the middle of the street to rot butchers that

190
00:12:29.441 --> 00:12:30.430
pulled out the end trails,

191
00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:34.670
the guts of the animals and edible parts dump it in the street.
Uh,

192
00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.000
and so the streets were just full of not only human exome,
put the waste of,

193
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:43.760
of all the animals.
And of course the flies and insects lay their eggs in it and,

194
00:12:43.761 --> 00:12:47.830
and,
and grow.
And it's very unsanitary.

195
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:53.710
A dead people were not handled any better than this.

196
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:58.620
As more people died,
the urban cemeteries got filled up.
It was not,

197
00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.000
uh,
so much space.

198
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.290
And so they stopped burying the poor people in properly in cemeteries,

199
00:13:05.530 --> 00:13:07.180
but just what they called poor holes,

200
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:12.450
just a large pits in which piles of bodies were just laid a outside by side

201
00:13:13.481 --> 00:13:16.270
robot row,
by row and row on top of row.

202
00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.730
And they were not closed until they were full.

203
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:24.210
So you had these pits of rotting bodies just festering there in the middle of

204
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:27.220
all the cities that have enough people to Barry.

205
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:32.850
And of course the stench was just overwhelming and the rich people were not

206
00:13:33.881 --> 00:13:37.660
buried in these pits.
But if they were,
it could be buried in cemeteries.

207
00:13:37.661 --> 00:13:39.010
But if they're really important,

208
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:43.990
they bought space in the church crypt or they contributed money and got space in

209
00:13:43.991 --> 00:13:44.980
the church.
Crip,
you know,

210
00:13:44.981 --> 00:13:48.490
many of you have undoubtedly going to churches and in the basement they've got

211
00:13:48.491 --> 00:13:52.300
these crypts of dead people.
And,
uh,

212
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:58.280
again,
guess what they were rotting and,
and strengths.
So the churches,
uh,

213
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:03.660
stank and a one code is that they stank out Parson and congregation that people

214
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:08.440
just couldn't stand to be there

215
00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:14.800
in 1742,
Dr. Johnson,
who you know,
wrote the life of Boswell,
uh,

216
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:20.170
I'm,
I'm sorry,
by his Boswell's life of Johnson.
So He's quoting Johnson,

217
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.740
uh,
describe London as a city quote,

218
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:28.960
which abounds which such heaps of filth as a savage would look on with

219
00:14:28.961 --> 00:14:32.410
amazement.
So,

220
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:34.543
uh,

221
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:41.250
the death rates cities were so unhealthy from all this fills that the death

222
00:14:41.711 --> 00:14:45.520
rates were enormously high and cities did not keep themselves going.

223
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:49.210
It left to itself a city's population would just disappear.

224
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.340
And some estimates are about every generation,

225
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:57.050
about a third of the inhabitants of a city,
wood,
wood,
wood.

226
00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:01.010
I mean,
everybody died.
But the population left of the city just left to itself,

227
00:15:01.011 --> 00:15:03.890
would go down by a third in every generation.

228
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:08.420
And the only reason that cities were able to prosper is that in the countryside

229
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.620
where things were healthier,
just because of space,
there wasn't the demography,

230
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:14.920
there wasn't the,
the crowding,
uh,

231
00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.240
of people that constantly the excess births,

232
00:15:18.241 --> 00:15:22.400
the excess population from the countryside would keep migrating into the cities

233
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.880
because,
uh,
they had primogenitor and England for instance,

234
00:15:25.881 --> 00:15:28.340
only the oldest son could inherit the land.

235
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.440
So younger sons had a migrate into the cities or into the army.
And,

236
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:34.010
uh,

237
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:38.660
that's what kept the city's going as a constant stream of people coming in from

238
00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:39.500
the countryside.

239
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:47.450
Now it's not a London in the great cities and it's not only that part of Europe,

240
00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.960
but we have descriptions of some of the other cities.

241
00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:54.820
And one of them is currently politically a very relevant,
uh,

242
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.250
Jerusalem.
And,
uh,

243
00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.910
now all the great western religions claim that Jerusalem is central to their

244
00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:06.200
religion and they've,
they compete viciously.
They fight viciously over Jerusalem,

245
00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:11.030
and they all claim that they've been interested forever,
you know,
in this.

246
00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:15.670
But in fact,
it was until,
until Napoleon,
uh,

247
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.600
expedition to Egypt in the Middle East,

248
00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:22.100
it was totally ignored as a physical thing from the crusades to Napoleon.
It was,

249
00:16:22.101 --> 00:16:24.980
it was totally ignored in 1840.

250
00:16:24.981 --> 00:16:29.570
It was a tiny town of 15,000 people,
uh,
7,000 Jews,

251
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:30.500
5,000 Muslims,

252
00:16:30.501 --> 00:16:35.360
3000 Christians from the records that we have in a place like that,

253
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:39.950
presumably the,
the seat of,
of the Western religions,
the feces,

254
00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.980
we're 50 feet deep and had been collecting since the destruction of the second

255
00:16:45.951 --> 00:16:49.850
temple by the Romans.
Before the Romans destroyed Jerusalem.

256
00:16:49.851 --> 00:16:54.080
There was some sort of sanitation going on.
Uh,
but uh,

257
00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.540
between them and 1840,
the feces just kept,
kept going up.

258
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.900
Of course,
by the,
in this filth,
everybody was sick.

259
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.930
Basically everyone had malaria.
Malaria was endemic there.

260
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:07.790
When cholera came through,

261
00:17:07.791 --> 00:17:11.330
which you came periodic is 75% of the people would die of it.

262
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.150
And one quote describing this,

263
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:19.480
the sanitary condition of the city of God ensured that any pilgrim who sought

264
00:17:19.821 --> 00:17:24.650
to,
who sought to spend his last days on earth there could look forward to

265
00:17:24.651 --> 00:17:27.350
fulfilling that ideal with great dispatch.

266
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.160
So personal cleanliness,
this was also unknown.
Uh,

267
00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:39.380
we have one professor of medieval history who gives a great lecture and few she

268
00:17:39.381 --> 00:17:43.010
ever gives it as a public lecture that I've seen him give if he ever gives it

269
00:17:43.011 --> 00:17:47.210
again,
absolutely go.
It's called a thousand years without a bath.

270
00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:52.240
So this is in Europe.
Uh,
the Romans,
uh,

271
00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:56.400
we're very careful about personal cleanliness and they built these great big

272
00:17:56.401 --> 00:18:00.880
baths and we visited like the baths of Caracalla in,

273
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.040
in Rome.
A couple of you have,
how about the bath bath?

274
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:08.280
The city in England named after its baths and so forth?
Well,

275
00:18:08.281 --> 00:18:11.200
these are Roman a crane.
So the Romans,
uh,

276
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:16.640
very careful as much as they could in a place like that with personal hygiene.

277
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:20.640
But after the fall of Rome,
the morality changes,

278
00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:24.870
the church takes over and the church wants people to concentrate on their souls,

279
00:18:24.871 --> 00:18:26.100
not on their bodies.

280
00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:31.650
And washing was considered too much a sign of preoccupation with the body.

281
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.360
And especially for women,

282
00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:37.170
it's not good for women to pay too much attention to their bodies.

283
00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.960
Um,
so

284
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.113
<v 2>uh,</v>

285
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.670
<v 0>Europeans at that time boasted,
and you've probably heard this,</v>

286
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.640
that they only washed three times in their lives.

287
00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:51.130
How many of you have heard that once when they're born,

288
00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:55.920
once they get married and once when they die they get washed through and the

289
00:18:55.921 --> 00:18:57.880
rest of that,
not only didn't they wash,

290
00:18:57.881 --> 00:19:02.480
they thought that water that you wash with carry disease contagion,
you know,

291
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.140
various theories and that if you watched,

292
00:19:05.141 --> 00:19:07.180
you would probably get sick from the washing.

293
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:12.490
So the solution was not cleanliness,
the solution to the bad conditions,

294
00:19:12.491 --> 00:19:17.491
but perfume and perfume comes up in this era because people stank so much that

295
00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.890
if they had the money,
they would buy a perfume.

296
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.640
Anybody know why?
Yeah,

297
00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:29.220
<v 2>louder.
Louder.
Some water.</v>

298
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:33.400
<v 0>Was it?
Good question.</v>

299
00:19:33.401 --> 00:19:37.780
Was the water likely to make them sick if they drank the water?
Yes.

300
00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.880
If they washed in the water,
no.

301
00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:44.140
There's very little in temperate zone waters that are going to get through your

302
00:19:44.141 --> 00:19:48.850
skin in a tropical zones that can be parasites in there and they can be

303
00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.350
dangerous.
But in in Europe,

304
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.640
I'm not sort of aware of anything that washing in the water.
We'll,
we'll,

305
00:19:54.641 --> 00:19:56.740
we'll get you,
get you sick.

306
00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:02.680
<v 2>So watch yourself stays on your skin and then leave or something.</v>

307
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.650
<v 0>Yes.
Again,
if you wash yourself,
it stays on your,</v>

308
00:20:08.651 --> 00:20:12.920
your skin and then you eat with your unwashed hands.
Well,

309
00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:17.510
probably what was on there before he washed.
It's going to be worse in general.

310
00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:20.300
I think nobody washed unless something comes off that,

311
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:23.120
that the burden of whatever's on there,
it gets less.

312
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.630
So all of these things are what we modern people think about.

313
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:29.600
And obviously back then,
just these kind of very simple,

314
00:20:29.601 --> 00:20:32.180
straightforward questions.
We're not really,
uh,

315
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:36.380
considered people back then,
George Washington,

316
00:20:36.381 --> 00:20:40.340
King George wore wigs.
Anybody know?
Some of you probably know why,

317
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.200
why they wear wigs.
Underneath the wig was

318
00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:48.470
<v 2>good luck.
Slice</v>

319
00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.410
<v 0>lots of lice.
Shaved heads.
They had lice.
Lice was endemic.</v>

320
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.270
They couldn't get rid of it.
So they shaved their heads.

321
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:58.390
I think we just saw that on television with the John Adams Story.

322
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:03.100
K every cell from Denny,
if you see that TV show Hbo.
Anyway,

323
00:21:03.101 --> 00:21:06.870
he takes off his,
his,
his wig and there he is bald.
Uh,

324
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.000
that was to prevent a lice.

325
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.880
Okay.
So one of the reasons,
uh,

326
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:20.280
one of the major reasons for this lack of population growth for hundreds of

327
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:22.143
years in Europe,

328
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:28.360
just no idea about sanitation,
hygiene,
any of this kind of stuff.

329
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.810
Another aspect which you'll be reading about,
uh,

330
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:35.050
is infanticide.

331
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:39.640
Infanticide was a very large factor in European demography and the rest of the

332
00:21:39.641 --> 00:21:42.600
world is,
it will read about.
But,
uh,

333
00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:48.880
in Europe it was very important.
In the,
uh,
there was always a,
uh,

334
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:54.310
a level of infanticide and,
uh,
various sorts.

335
00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:56.500
But in the 18th and 19th centuries,

336
00:21:56.501 --> 00:22:01.501
that apparently exploded the number of kids that were done away with in Milan.

337
00:22:02.650 --> 00:22:05.680
Uh,
from 1840 to 1860s,

338
00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.460
one third of all children born to married parents.

339
00:22:09.461 --> 00:22:13.750
We're not talking about unmarried situations.
We're left at foundling homes.

340
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:19.300
And,
uh,
in founding homes,
the death rate was near 100%.
Uh,

341
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.200
more than half of all the children born to working class parents were left and

342
00:22:23.201 --> 00:22:27.460
founding homes and almost all the illegitimate children were abandoned.

343
00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.910
And the death rates,
it was a form of infanticide.

344
00:22:30.911 --> 00:22:34.480
You just gave it into a foundling home.
They were taken basically no care of.

345
00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:39.010
They died.
It was out of sight.
And again,

346
00:22:39.011 --> 00:22:43.540
not just the ordinary ignorant person,
but you all know Sean Shock Russo,

347
00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:48.520
the famous French philosophic and wrote a lot that encouraged the American

348
00:22:48.521 --> 00:22:51.940
revolution.
Uh,
this is a quote from him.

349
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.310
My third child was,

350
00:22:54.311 --> 00:22:58.300
does deposited in a foundling home just like the first two.

351
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.170
And I did the same with the two following.
I had five.

352
00:23:02.171 --> 00:23:07.150
And all the arrangements seemed to me so good,
so sensible,

353
00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:10.900
so appropriate that if I did not boast of it publicly,

354
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:16.120
it was solely out of regard for their mother,
that there was no here,

355
00:23:16.121 --> 00:23:18.750
they're,
they're abandoning these children,
uh,

356
00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.030
to almost certain death and it not,

357
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.510
there was just no moral compunction about it whatsoever,

358
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:32.610
aside from absolute abandonment to founding homes or other just leaving them in

359
00:23:32.621 --> 00:23:33.131
the streets.

360
00:23:33.131 --> 00:23:36.790
You'll read about American in England where the kids were just often left in the

361
00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:38.350
streets.
Um,

362
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.940
another mechanism was sending our children to nurse with wet nurses.

363
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:44.703
And,
uh,

364
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:49.340
the death rate of wet nurse children was enormously high.

365
00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.580
So if parents tried to rear their children,

366
00:23:52.581 --> 00:23:57.490
the death rate was about one in six at,
at this,
at this time,
uh,

367
00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.140
but in 18th century,
France,

368
00:24:00.141 --> 00:24:05.090
between a half and two thirds of infants that were set out to nurse died,

369
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.940
uh,
and,

370
00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:14.380
and even in a higher death rate where the so called baby farms in,

371
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:18.800
in the 19th century Europe,
there were,
there's like,
we call him puppy mills now.

372
00:24:18.801 --> 00:24:22.940
There were baby farms and they took in vast numbers of children to presumably

373
00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:27.470
wet wet nurse,
but almost none of them survived.

374
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.070
And as I showed you from these and all kinds of reasons,

375
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:34.070
about a third of children died in infancy.

376
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:41.920
The idea of being a parent and the family idea of child rearing was completely

377
00:24:42.831 --> 00:24:46.100
different.
Uh,
then we now understand.

378
00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:49.550
So the standard thing was a child is born,

379
00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.320
it's almost immediately sent out to wet nurse,

380
00:24:51.321 --> 00:24:53.180
someone that doesn't care about them.

381
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:57.410
A lot was written about wet nurses getting drunk row,
having the baby in bed,

382
00:24:57.411 --> 00:25:00.350
getting drunk,
rolling over on the baby and squashing the baby.

383
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.530
Whether that was an excuse or,
or the real reason for the child's death is,

384
00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:09.680
is unknown.
But they would wet nurse for,
uh,

385
00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.330
for a couple of years.
And then those that were still alive would come back home,

386
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:19.340
uh,
maybe,
uh,
age two or three or something.

387
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.470
And then by age seven,

388
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:26.600
they would be sent back out to work again as an apprentice somewhere.

389
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:31.620
And how many of you read Charles Dickens and David Copperfield and Oliver twist

390
00:25:31.621 --> 00:25:36.260
or what age would they sent out to work?
Seven.
Seven is the standard age.

391
00:25:36.261 --> 00:25:41.261
This is scenes of one of the Dickens' characters going to work in a dye factory

392
00:25:42.471 --> 00:25:46.250
dying cloth and comes out black everyday covered,
uh,

393
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.220
with the dye.
And so that was,

394
00:25:49.221 --> 00:25:54.170
that was quite a standard thing in 1646.

395
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.850
Uh,
they're very rich and very progressive town of Leiden in the Netherlands.

396
00:25:58.851 --> 00:26:02.270
Leiden was one of the most advanced places in Europe.

397
00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.570
Limited the working day to children to 14 hours.

398
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:10.910
Whether the law was obeyed or not,
we don't know.
But children could not do that.

399
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:11.751
And of course,

400
00:26:11.751 --> 00:26:14.810
Charles Dickens is a couple of hundred years later in the 19th century.

401
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:19.430
And apparently in every one of his novels there's some scene of child labor

402
00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:20.503
going on.

403
00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:26.960
Now I'm talking about up to the 18 hundreds,
but this does not disappear.

404
00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.500
Now you look what Europe,
the situation Europe was in an 1800.

405
00:26:30.501 --> 00:26:35.000
Some of the developing countries are currently in so official figures from
India.

406
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:39.080
The government figures say there are 12 million child workers in India,

407
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.800
opponents activists on,

408
00:26:41.801 --> 00:26:46.801
on the labor issue estimate that it's closer to 60 million children in India are

409
00:26:46.921 --> 00:26:49.270
working.
Uh,
the Cha,

410
00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:54.290
they do have child labor laws now in India and they prohibit children under age

411
00:26:55.081 --> 00:26:59.040
14 from working in hazardous jobs.
Uh,

412
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:04.590
when the scandal about gap,
our clothing manufacture gap came out.

413
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:05.543
Uh,

414
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:10.920
the factories that were investigated had children as young as 10 years old

415
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:14.930
working up to 16 hours a day and making the dungarees and a lot that,

416
00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:16.320
that we were.

417
00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.103
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

418
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:22.790
<v 0>So all of this sort of misery,
uh,</v>

419
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:26.040
leads not only physical,
uh,
misery,

420
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.860
but a change in attitude toward,

421
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.030
toward life and death came very easily.
It was very common.

422
00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:36.960
And so life was,
was cheaper and there's no question about it from the,

423
00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:40.230
from the literature.
The life was cheaper than we,
we consider now.

424
00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:46.230
And because children's specialty,
we're so likely to die as well as anyone else.

425
00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:48.810
It was considered an imprudent,
not,
not,

426
00:27:48.811 --> 00:27:53.370
not wise to be particularly affectionate with or emotionally entwined with any

427
00:27:53.371 --> 00:27:56.820
other human being.
Your husband might die immediately or kids might die,

428
00:27:56.821 --> 00:27:58.410
your wife might,
might die.

429
00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:02.640
And so as far as we can tell from the writings of the period,

430
00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.820
what we call an effective relationships with emotional relationships,

431
00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.600
rather cool in this period,
except of course violent anger,

432
00:28:09.601 --> 00:28:11.190
which always pops out.

433
00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:18.640
<v 1>So
going back</v>

434
00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:20.151
<v 0>to this,</v>

435
00:28:20.151 --> 00:28:25.151
so here's all these problems and what did people do about some of these things?

436
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:30.620
And so,
um,

437
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:33.793
<v 1>in</v>

438
00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.860
<v 0>the idea of disease comes from the Greeks and probably farther back than the</v>

439
00:28:43.591 --> 00:28:48.030
Greeks that the body is controlled by four humors,

440
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:52.680
fluids that run around the body.
Something like the chief of,
of,
of Oriental

441
00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:57.900
thought,
uh,
and these four humans must be in balance.

442
00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:02.730
And when you got sick,
the problem was that the humors got out of balance.

443
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:06.120
So one of the things you did was get bled.

444
00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:08.250
That was a standard procedure.

445
00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:13.140
Let the blood flow because of that gets rid of the evil humors.

446
00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:19.490
And George Washington was apparently killed by an excess of bloodletting.

447
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.600
So when he was older,

448
00:29:21.601 --> 00:29:26.580
he got quite sick and the doctors as well while he was sick,

449
00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:30.450
blood five pints of blood out of him and then he died.

450
00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.780
So we take,
when we go to take blood,

451
00:29:33.781 --> 00:29:37.110
they take one pint and they consider that sort of the maximum safe mount for

452
00:29:37.111 --> 00:29:41.590
young,
healthy people.
Here he was old and sick,
five pints.
He dies

453
00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:48.460
his nemesis or nemesis or the George Washington in America and King George the

454
00:29:48.461 --> 00:29:51.970
third in England,
you know the saying mad king George,

455
00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:58.000
you know,
he was mad and he was mad with a genetic disease called Porphyria,

456
00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:00.410
which affects the,

457
00:30:00.411 --> 00:30:04.440
the hemoglobin in the blood and uh,

458
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.840
it caused episodic madness.
So he would be saying then he'd be mad.

459
00:30:07.841 --> 00:30:11.740
He'd be saying that he'd be mad and when he was mad,
what did they do?

460
00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.350
They bled him.
They bled him enormously.

461
00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.170
They tied him to a chair that had all kinds of things to him.

462
00:30:17.410 --> 00:30:21.430
They had no clue either a,
how to handle any of these,

463
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:24.190
these nor of a humane way.

464
00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.760
No idea of a humane way to treat someone who has something wrong with them that

465
00:30:27.761 --> 00:30:31.240
you have no clue what it is or,
or what to do about this.

466
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:34.570
And if you ever want to see that there's a great movie,

467
00:30:34.571 --> 00:30:38.880
the madness of King George about 1995 [inaudible].
They,
it,

468
00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.520
it described this,
this aspect of his life life.

469
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.970
Uh,
so leeches,

470
00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:50.370
another form of this bloodletting was instead of taking a razor blade or blade

471
00:30:50.371 --> 00:30:54.700
and cutting a vein,
which is hard to sew up,
leeches are wonderful.

472
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:59.470
So you,
you stick leaches on you and the blood,
uh,
leeches,

473
00:30:59.471 --> 00:31:04.120
suck out the blood.
And we know this goes back,
at least to the ancient Romans,

474
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.500
and it was practice for 2000 years.

475
00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:12.520
This bloodletting on this ancient theory of the humors,

476
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.640
1860,
we have data in the hospitals just in London.
So in 1860,

477
00:31:18.641 --> 00:31:21.580
that was rule Britannia England was the richest,

478
00:31:21.581 --> 00:31:25.420
most educated ruler of the whole world,
right?
1860.

479
00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:28.210
And the hospitals in one city in London,

480
00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:31.600
7 million leaches were used.

481
00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.350
The idea again being that until

482
00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.110
you know what you're doing,

483
00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:43.300
you don't know what you're doing and just use anything and it's all no evidence

484
00:31:43.301 --> 00:31:46.480
whatsoever that any of this ever helped anybody.

485
00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.480
And of course we now know it was in fact not only didn't help them,

486
00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.290
it made them sicker.
So,
uh,

487
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:57.550
we now have a sort of a rage in America and Europe

488
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.760
for natural medicine,
medicine and,
and,
and its various versions.

489
00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.100
Well this is has very old history.

490
00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:10.660
And so how many know the author Wilkie Collins,

491
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:14.260
moonstone,
woman and white there?
One of the,

492
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:19.080
they're on PBS television all the time.
You,
you've seen them.
Uh,

493
00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:22.480
so he had gout,
which was,
uh,
what happens is,

494
00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:26.830
back then they had a lot of meat.
I had a lot of protein in the blood.

495
00:32:26.831 --> 00:32:31.240
The breakdown product protein is urea.
If you can't,
don't excrete it fast enough,

496
00:32:31.241 --> 00:32:34.480
it's not very soluble.
It crystallizes in your joints.

497
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:36.520
And then every time you move a joint,

498
00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:40.640
the little sharp crystals grind in there and it makes it very hard to move.

499
00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:44.120
And your joints get swollen.
Very,
very unpleasant disease.

500
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:50.180
So what did they do for gout in the Ed?
Later the 1880s,

501
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:54.080
they treated gout with a poultice of cabbage leaves covered with Silk,

502
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:57.770
with oiled silk.
And uh,

503
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:02.150
this particular author Wilkie Collins wrote about it.
That's how we,

504
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:06.320
we know some of the details and it didn't give him any relief whatsoever.

505
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:08.570
Surprise,
surprise.
So what he did,

506
00:33:08.571 --> 00:33:12.230
he turned to opium to dull the pain cause opium really does work.

507
00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.880
It's the basis of morphine and he probably died partly of opium poisoning

508
00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:22.040
because it does other bad things to your system.
Now,
continuing this,

509
00:33:22.041 --> 00:33:26.390
this story of what happened,
you know,
this all relates to death rates in,

510
00:33:26.391 --> 00:33:30.980
in pre scientific,
uh,
times.
So,
uh,

511
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:34.100
your American history buffs,
what happened to President James Garfield?

512
00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:40.130
He was assassinated.
He was shot,
but he wasn't really,
he was shot,

513
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:45.430
but he wasn't really assassinated because he lived like for a year after he was

514
00:33:45.441 --> 00:33:50.340
shot.
So whether you call it an assassination on,
I don't know,
but the,
the,

515
00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:54.080
the bullet went in apparently into his back and lodged and some fat.

516
00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.950
Now fat is not very permeable to anything.

517
00:33:57.951 --> 00:34:01.190
You're just like the bullet largest lump of fat.
The lead doesn't,

518
00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:04.280
the lead poisoning from the bullet doesn't get out.
Nothing much gets out.

519
00:34:04.281 --> 00:34:08.630
So it's not a really dangerous thing to have a,
a bullet,
uh,
in,
in,

520
00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:09.770
in a lump of fat.

521
00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:13.970
But his doctors and some of them were homing at paths,

522
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:16.880
which was the big thing back then,
and some newer aloe paths.

523
00:34:16.881 --> 00:34:19.250
And what those words mean,

524
00:34:20.570 --> 00:34:24.650
you can ask me after after class,
and they had opposing theories.

525
00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:27.080
So many paths thought that whatever was wrong with you.

526
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.560
And so I am telling you the theories,
but everyone was wrong with you.

527
00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:35.060
You should give a little bit of the same thing and that would cure you.

528
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.330
And little bit meant you could dilute it infinitely so that there's actually

529
00:34:38.331 --> 00:34:40.610
nothing in what they were giving you.
Maybe pure water,

530
00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.170
but that was supposed to cure you.

531
00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:45.020
Allopath was supposed to give them something of the opposite.

532
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:48.140
And there's been homes.
You can see every drugstore nowadays,

533
00:34:48.141 --> 00:34:53.010
homeopathic remedy and what that legally means has nothing in it,
you know,

534
00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:58.070
uh,
if that's okay.
And so,
but they had these opposite theories.

535
00:34:58.071 --> 00:35:02.480
And they kept fighting about what to do,
uh,
with,
uh,
this president who was,

536
00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:03.343
was sick.

537
00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:08.440
So what they did is they stuck a metal rods into his wound to try to,

538
00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:13.400
you know,
pull the bullet out,
even though the bullet was new,
doing no danger,

539
00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:17.870
although sterilization,
uh,
had a list or had done his work,

540
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:20.870
it was known already.
These doctors didn't believe in that.

541
00:35:20.871 --> 00:35:23.120
So they stuck in these metal rods,
uh,

542
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:27.680
with no sterilization and,
uh,
it was not,

543
00:35:27.681 --> 00:35:28.251
he of course,

544
00:35:28.251 --> 00:35:31.460
got infected apparently not from the bullet because he lived a year,

545
00:35:31.461 --> 00:35:34.610
but from the metal rods that they kept poking end with him.

546
00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:39.510
Their understanding or their interest in,
uh,

547
00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:45.110
in physiology was so nil that they insisted for reasons that I have not found

548
00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:51.720
that he'd be fed rectally.
So they fed him beef Pujan,
egg yolks,

549
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.430
milk whiskey and drops of opium,
opium recto.

550
00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:00.090
And the problem is the rectum does not absorb food.

551
00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.860
The purpose of the recommendation is to take water out and conserve,

552
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:09.270
conserve water.
So they're feeding in this way.

553
00:36:09.271 --> 00:36:10.740
This is the only way he's allowed to be feed.

554
00:36:10.741 --> 00:36:13.920
It's not healthy to put food in this way.
And so what happens,

555
00:36:13.921 --> 00:36:17.280
what do you think happens?
He loses weight.
How much weight?

556
00:36:17.281 --> 00:36:20.520
You lose a hundred pounds from July to September.

557
00:36:20.521 --> 00:36:23.160
In three months this guy loses a hundred pounds.

558
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:26.940
Does anybody notice this?
Does anybody pay attention to this?

559
00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:31.740
Does anybody have the scientific clue of mine that well I have a theory and I'm

560
00:36:31.741 --> 00:36:34.800
applying that theory and oh my,
it's not working.

561
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:39.540
So maybe my theory is wrong.
No,
that's just not the,

562
00:36:39.541 --> 00:36:41.400
the critical scientific mindset.

563
00:36:41.401 --> 00:36:46.230
They knew that that was the right thing to do and so they would not give up

564
00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.580
their theories and basically it seems he starved to death.

565
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:54.660
You know,
they infected him and starved him to death.

566
00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:00.130
So what happens when new ideas do come out in a,
in a,
in a pre a

567
00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.750
pre scientific ear.

568
00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.680
So one of the current public health measures is you don't eat food with your

569
00:37:07.681 --> 00:37:10.740
hands,
right?
Your mother tells you that all the time,

570
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.140
cause you wash your hands first,
which they didn't do.

571
00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:17.100
But even then you eat with a knife and fork.
What your mother has or,

572
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:20.880
or of your dishwasher has,
has,
uh,
cleaned very nicely.

573
00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:24.960
So Europeans,
of course,
as you've seen from any movie,
uh,

574
00:37:24.961 --> 00:37:27.960
eight with their hands for many hundreds of years.

575
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.950
But at that time the Arabs were much more civilized than we were.

576
00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:36.270
We either Europeans,
uh,
and so,

577
00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:41.070
and the Lavant,
uh,
the,
the,
the Middle Eastern coast,
there were,

578
00:37:41.071 --> 00:37:45.000
Venice had lots of commerce.
They were already eating with knives and forks.

579
00:37:45.001 --> 00:37:47.790
And you know,
you use the fork.
Well,

580
00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:51.780
this was first introduced into the Europe by the Duke of Venice,

581
00:37:51.781 --> 00:37:56.100
the Doge of Venice.
And his wife became aware that the,

582
00:37:56.101 --> 00:37:59.070
the Arab civilization was,
was doing this,

583
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:02.640
this thing of eating with forks and she thought she would introduce it into her

584
00:38:02.641 --> 00:38:06.930
dinner parties.
So she started having forks at,

585
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:11.640
at her dinner party.
And,
uh,
the,
uh,

586
00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.900
there was a,
the cardinals,
uh,
uh,

587
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.730
one of the cardinals at that time was Saint Peter Damien.

588
00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:23.210
And he says that he was just totally opposed to this.

589
00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:28.140
And the idea was that the stuff that you eat are animals.
And plants,

590
00:38:28.141 --> 00:38:31.500
they're God's creations.
And that by using a fork,

591
00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:36.460
she had set herself up above God's creation.
And the quote is,
um,

592
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:38.223
uh,

593
00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:42.970
to touch me with a fork was impious Lee to declare that God's creatures,

594
00:38:42.971 --> 00:38:46.450
we're not worthy of being touched by human hands.

595
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:50.300
And that kind of phrase was repeated,
uh,

596
00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:53.200
all the way into the 17th century.

597
00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.770
And forks came very slowly into Europe,

598
00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:01.990
a lightening rods.
When Benjamin Franklin invented lightning rods,

599
00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:06.640
what was most likely to get struck by lightning?
It was the church steeple,

600
00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.300
right?
Cause they stuck up into the sky and had points.
And as you may know,

601
00:39:10.301 --> 00:39:14.140
if you take physics points,
attract lightning pointy things.

602
00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:18.250
So churches are always getting lightning and burned out.
So he,
uh,

603
00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:22.000
Benjamin Franklin invents the lightening Rod and Oh my God,
the,

604
00:39:22.001 --> 00:39:23.300
the opprobrium that,

605
00:39:23.301 --> 00:39:28.060
that he came under because lightening was obviously a one of God's creations

606
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:30.220
that he was punishing people with it.

607
00:39:30.221 --> 00:39:34.810
Now Benjamin Franklin was interfering with God's punishment.

608
00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:40.900
So going back to the family,
which are relevant to this population,

609
00:39:40.901 --> 00:39:45.370
more than lightning.
Um,
so one of the,

610
00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:49.720
of this whole,
this whole brutal society in which life is very insecure,

611
00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:51.640
people are very violent to each other.

612
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:55.960
They're not careful with their persons or anything like that.

613
00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:01.390
Child rearing practices don't,
don't escape.
Uh,

614
00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:06.690
this whole context in which people lived and the traditional Christian view in,

615
00:40:09.801 --> 00:40:11.170
in the West,
uh,

616
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:15.430
and this is strongly reinforced by Calvinist theology after,

617
00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:19.300
after the reformation,
was that children are born with original sin.

618
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.790
Original sin is the view of human nature.

619
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:26.550
What is human nature considered being these times now we think of human nature

620
00:40:26.551 --> 00:40:28.420
is genes versus environment.

621
00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:33.660
But back then it was original sin and children were born into sin and the only

622
00:40:34.241 --> 00:40:39.220
hope of holding the sin and check was thought to be the most ruthless repression

623
00:40:39.221 --> 00:40:44.221
of child's will and his total subordination to the will of the parents.

624
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:47.860
He was married to him,
to his parents,
to school masters,

625
00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:50.470
and to anyone with authority over him.

626
00:40:51.310 --> 00:40:55.840
Theologians and moralists insisted that parents ruthlessly crushed the wills of

627
00:40:55.841 --> 00:41:00.580
young children by physical force if necessary.
So,

628
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:05.350
and that has political ramifications if you're taught when you're young and your

629
00:41:05.351 --> 00:41:09.130
parents believe that the most moral thing is that you must be obedient.

630
00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.080
You must not have a will of your own.

631
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:14.930
This leads you to believe that authoritarian,
uh,
uh,

632
00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:19.180
political structures are the normal and right way that humans should be

633
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:24.490
governed.
The American puritans are,

634
00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.260
we're very much a part of this.

635
00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:31.680
And the primary concern with respect your childbearing of American puritans was

636
00:41:31.901 --> 00:41:35.810
in making children's sin free enough to merit an afterlife.

637
00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.800
So they threatened totally healthy children by telling them that they would soon

638
00:41:39.801 --> 00:41:44.420
die.
So Jonathan Edwards,
for whom one of the Yale colleges is named,

639
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:46.070
and he was president of Princeton,

640
00:41:46.071 --> 00:41:50.480
he was not president of Yale once I said he was,
I was wrong.
Uh,

641
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:54.950
he lectured a group of children.
I know you will die and little time,

642
00:41:55.310 --> 00:42:00.260
some sooner than others.
Tis Not likely,
you will all live to grow up.

643
00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:04.970
Now,
you know,
children's storybooks,

644
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:08.600
one of the popular children's books was a token for children.

645
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:12.320
Quote,
if other children die,
why,

646
00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:16.670
why may not you sicken and die?
So again,

647
00:42:16.671 --> 00:42:21.360
we try to protect our children nowadays.
You know,
nurture,
loving,
nurture,

648
00:42:21.361 --> 00:42:25.460
tried to protect our children from these uh,
worries.
But back then,
one,

649
00:42:25.461 --> 00:42:30.461
it was a reality and to that reality was used to suppress.

650
00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:36.980
There was called then there their will and subject them to enforcement by the

651
00:42:37.881 --> 00:42:41.610
parents.
And of course this in the literature,
there's a,

652
00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:47.350
this sort of reading of history came about 50 years ago when this was sort of

653
00:42:48.350 --> 00:42:53.060
noticed and there's been a large reaction to it that know some parents at least

654
00:42:53.061 --> 00:42:56.930
were loving during this long stretch of European history.
And of course not,

655
00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:01.970
none of all parents were sort of so brutal to their children.
Um,

656
00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.950
but somewhere the,
uh,
the,
they,
they were,
uh,

657
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:09.050
one of the things was to force a child into the mold,

658
00:43:09.800 --> 00:43:12.650
the behavioral mold that you liked him grow soon to the physical mold.

659
00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.910
So girls weren't supposed to have narrow,
narrow bought us is now our ways.

660
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:18.380
And so there's a,

661
00:43:18.381 --> 00:43:22.220
there's at least one case on record where a girl was put into an iron cage to

662
00:43:22.221 --> 00:43:26.480
squeeze her.
And as she grew older,
uh,

663
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.940
the cage squeeze more and more and she couldn't breathe.

664
00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:32.840
She died of suffocation from being put in this iron cage to mold her physical

665
00:43:32.841 --> 00:43:37.160
body to the shape that was wanted by the parents.

666
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:44.270
And so the conclusion is that life in this,

667
00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:45.823
um,

668
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:52.510
pre modern pre-scientific times was not only sort of miserable in the physical

669
00:43:54.021 --> 00:43:57.830
sense,
but probably also quite miserable in an emotional,

670
00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:02.860
in inward kind of sense that people were not warm and loving to each other very

671
00:44:04.281 --> 00:44:09.130
much,
but,
but,
uh,
very frequently cold and disciplining and,
and,

672
00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:10.970
and controlling kind of people.

673
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:14.960
So,
uh,

674
00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:20.620
so we have some centuries of this period and you can go back to maybe the fall

675
00:44:22.761 --> 00:44:24.410
of the Roman empire when really learning,

676
00:44:24.770 --> 00:44:29.480
really learning about reality in the west kind of stopped with the fall of Rome.

677
00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:33.030
So you have more than a thousand years.

678
00:44:33.031 --> 00:44:36.120
We're sort of no intellectual progress with the Spectra.

679
00:44:36.121 --> 00:44:41.070
Reality is made and then things all of a sudden start to change.

680
00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:44.580
And we're going to talk about that now.

681
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:47.660
Within 200 years,
uh,

682
00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:51.330
the death rate falls dramatically.

683
00:44:51.331 --> 00:44:54.060
And so has the birth rate falls dramatically.

684
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.920
And these changes are sort of the centerpiece of,
of water,
of course,

685
00:44:58.921 --> 00:45:01.530
and demography,
historical demography.
Anyway,

686
00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.100
usually studies called the demographic transition,
the form,

687
00:45:05.101 --> 00:45:08.840
the death rate in the fall,
in the birth rate.
So the,
you'll,

688
00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:13.860
you'll hear this many times because it's so basic that in these periods and old

689
00:45:14.731 --> 00:45:18.930
periods,
the birth rate is very high.
The death rate is very high,

690
00:45:18.931 --> 00:45:23.610
they're about equal.
So population basically grows not at all or very,

691
00:45:23.611 --> 00:45:24.570
very slowly.

692
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.570
So what we're going to talk about now in turn is first the fall,
the death rate,

693
00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:33.360
and the second,
then the fall in the birth rate.

694
00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:37.760
And then the theories that we have to explain,
uh,

695
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:42.270
these enormous changes in the way of what it means to be a human being.

696
00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.013
So,

697
00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:49.033
<v 1>Ooh,</v>

698
00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:52.840
<v 0>what happened?
Uh,
we didn't,
we don't know the causes.</v>

699
00:45:52.841 --> 00:45:55.870
The or we have many,
many third,
maybe we many,

700
00:45:55.871 --> 00:46:00.580
many times know what the causes are.
Uh,
one of those standards,

701
00:46:00.581 --> 00:46:05.020
Standard Textbook of European history says coat one.

702
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:07.450
This is going back to the wars of religion,

703
00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:12.630
which are just before all these changes started happening before Galileo,

704
00:46:12.911 --> 00:46:15.460
for instance,
one thing was clear,

705
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:21.030
130 years of senseless bloodletting in the name of religion inevitably sparked

706
00:46:21.401 --> 00:46:23.800
off a reaction in the minds of intelligent people.

707
00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:29.460
The wars of religion offered fertile soil for the fragile seeds of reason and

708
00:46:29.501 --> 00:46:34.270
science.
People began to realize that religiosity was hostile.

709
00:46:34.271 --> 00:46:37.270
The civilization European says,

710
00:46:37.271 --> 00:46:41.890
because of this period of sort of utter irrationality that the,
the,

711
00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:45.760
the,
the bad results of it were so immediately obvious to everyone.

712
00:46:45.761 --> 00:46:47.320
Everyone was skinning scared,

713
00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:51.160
getting killed by the people in the neighboring town who are of the other

714
00:46:51.161 --> 00:46:52.520
religion.
Uh,

715
00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:57.690
they rejected all of that and we're ready for some sort of a rational attitude

716
00:46:57.970 --> 00:46:58.930
toward things.

717
00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:05.490
And the results of that we can see we're really quite dramatic.

718
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:12.870
So here is what we can reconstruct of life expectancy and going back 8,000 years

719
00:47:16.421 --> 00:47:18.490
ago where the records are very poor,

720
00:47:18.491 --> 00:47:20.470
but it certainly wasn't much better than this.

721
00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:25.830
And there was wavering and probably some slow increase in life expectancy.

722
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:31.710
This just above 20 years of life expectancy is what I showed you in that graph

723
00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:36.130
of CIS Alpine Golf from Roman Times.

724
00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.520
And what I've told you is true of Europe during these,

725
00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.310
these hundreds of years that I've been talking about,

726
00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:46.420
and that stays more or less the same with the perhaps some improvement.

727
00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.540
It doesn't matter whether you're looking at France,
the dotted line,

728
00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:53.170
or you're looking at China.
The solid line,
as far as we can tell,

729
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:58.150
they're pretty much the same until around 1700.

730
00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:03.390
All of a sudden something majorly changes and the the,

731
00:48:03.431 --> 00:48:07.090
the life expectancy goes,
starts going sky high.

732
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.000
So we're talking about not just one of many,

733
00:48:10.001 --> 00:48:14.650
many things that happened in history that you can take all kinds of history

734
00:48:14.651 --> 00:48:18.460
courses about.
But in terms of what it means to be a human,

735
00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:22.420
you finally can stay alive beyond the age of 20 or 25.

736
00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:29.140
And that is such a tremendous change in,
in,
in,

737
00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:34.720
in life that that there's nothing else,
uh,
as important.

738
00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:39.990
And of course a large part of this or reinforced this was child infant

739
00:48:40.301 --> 00:48:42.880
mortality.
And look what happens

740
00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:45.850
back here.

741
00:48:45.851 --> 00:48:50.200
It's going up and down like crazy that it's very high.

742
00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:54.750
There's a quarter of children and this is,
uh,

743
00:48:55.250 --> 00:49:00.220
a European data.
So this is about a fifth to a quarter of children die,

744
00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:04.180
uh,
as,
as children.
And it's out of control.

745
00:49:04.181 --> 00:49:07.750
You can see that they epidemics come through and then times get good and then

746
00:49:07.751 --> 00:49:12.520
something else comes through.
And so it was very variable and very high.

747
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:17.740
And then it starts souping downward.
And not only does it come down,

748
00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:20.260
but it evens out that the,

749
00:49:20.261 --> 00:49:23.800
that we start getting control not only over the overall level,

750
00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:28.870
but all the things which cause these wild swings in it.
So again,

751
00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:32.020
uh,
uh,
an amazing,
uh,
change in,

752
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.010
in what it means to be humans.
Well,

753
00:49:36.850 --> 00:49:40.600
what does this date where things start happening?
1770s.

754
00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:44.470
We're into the enlightenment and you all have probably,

755
00:49:44.471 --> 00:49:45.760
at least in your high school history,

756
00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:51.290
I have heard of the enlightenment and that is the big opening out in Europe of

757
00:49:51.791 --> 00:49:55.710
rational discourse on almost everything.
And everything from,

758
00:49:55.711 --> 00:50:00.340
from science to politics and disease,

759
00:50:00.341 --> 00:50:04.240
for instance,
uh,
was,
uh,

760
00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:07.780
considered divine punishment upon mankind for their sins.

761
00:50:07.781 --> 00:50:12.520
That's a quote somewhere.
Medical research was considered sack religious.

762
00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.120
A dissection of cadavers was objected to because coat,

763
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:18.310
if you cut the bodies into pieces,

764
00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:20.740
what's going to happen to them at the time of the resurrection.

765
00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:25.570
So there all kinds of reasons that you shouldn't do anything to get even the

766
00:50:25.571 --> 00:50:29.270
most basic knowledge of what's inside a human body.

767
00:50:29.271 --> 00:50:33.500
And without that you can't make any progress.
The major,

768
00:50:33.501 --> 00:50:35.390
major event in,

769
00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:41.320
in the enlightenment is Newton's Principia newtons discussion of something that

770
00:50:42.081 --> 00:50:44.360
sounds rather abstract.

771
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:48.170
You know what he was worried about was how the bodies go round in heaven.

772
00:50:48.171 --> 00:50:51.710
That's what everyone was trying to figure out.
That you may remember,

773
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.970
Copernicus had already said that things didn't go around the earth,

774
00:50:55.971 --> 00:50:58.730
but they went around the sun and that was older.

775
00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:01.790
Kepler had gotten the mathematics rights,
so they went around,

776
00:51:01.791 --> 00:51:06.380
not in circles but in ellipses,
but nobody had any explanation for this.

777
00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:09.890
It was a simple theory was great regularity,

778
00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:11.870
but no one had any idea why.

779
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:17.680
Newton's gravitation was what made it rational in the sense of understanding

780
00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:24.380
that it was just as simple force of gravity and people don't always understand

781
00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:28.520
the,
you know,
the story of the apple dropping on his head.
Right.

782
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:33.260
So that the stories that gave him the idea of gravitation,
no,

783
00:51:33.261 --> 00:51:35.960
apparently one,
the story is probably apocryphal totally.

784
00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:40.910
But the import is what everyone was trying to figure out was the heavenly

785
00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:44.750
motions,
the moon around the earth,
the earth around the sun,
the planets around,

786
00:51:44.751 --> 00:51:45.950
all of these sorts of things.

787
00:51:46.610 --> 00:51:51.610
And so he goes to sleep under the tree and the apple falls on his head and he

788
00:51:52.431 --> 00:51:54.200
wakes up and he realizes,
oh my God,

789
00:51:54.201 --> 00:51:58.640
the apple fell on my head for the same reason that the moon is held in orbit

790
00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.630
around the earth.
As you know,
if there was no gravity,
the moon would just,

791
00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:05.750
here's the earth.
The moon goes around,
you shut off gravity,

792
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:07.970
the moon goes off in a straight line forever.

793
00:52:07.971 --> 00:52:12.140
And that was kind of understood already by Galileo that that thing's in motion.

794
00:52:12.141 --> 00:52:14.360
We'll go in a straight line unless you pull them in somehow.

795
00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:17.810
So they knew that the earth,
the moon was constantly falling toward the earth.

796
00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.030
The earth was constantly falling toward the sun.

797
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:23.990
All the planets were constantly flowing for the side that was understood.

798
00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.790
And they knew that Apple's fell to the earth,

799
00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:27.530
but they didn't put the two of them together.

800
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:32.570
The great insight of Newton apparently was realizing that this thing on earth

801
00:52:32.571 --> 00:52:37.571
that we could observe and measure on earth with the same reason that the heavens

802
00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:40.600
worked.
And this,
this was sort of a,

803
00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:45.620
a bombshell that led to the whole theory of,

804
00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:51.950
uh,
of,
of celestial mechanics and,
and gravitation and,

805
00:52:51.951 --> 00:52:55.790
and all of western science really starts from this.

806
00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:01.310
We did 25 years and people were Newton.

807
00:53:01.311 --> 00:53:02.750
Newton was lying eyes during his lifetime.

808
00:53:02.751 --> 00:53:07.450
It was realized what a tremendous achievement.
Uh,
this was,
uh,

809
00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:10.080
and uh,
the,
the,

810
00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.970
the relationship that this is not only the scientific achievement that the,

811
00:53:13.971 --> 00:53:17.450
that the,
the planets orbited by the same forces drops an apple,

812
00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:19.730
but it was previously believed that yes,
well,

813
00:53:19.731 --> 00:53:24.500
events on earth might work by some sort of physical laws.

814
00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:25.980
You had Galileo on that,

815
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:31.160
but heaven was ruled by supernatural laws and now Newton's great insight was no,

816
00:53:31.981 --> 00:53:35.610
they're the same laws that there's nothing special or different about the

817
00:53:35.611 --> 00:53:40.470
heavens that they work by exactly the same laws as stones and Apple's flowing,

818
00:53:40.940 --> 00:53:45.810
uh,
on earth.
This was really a tremendous impetus to,

819
00:53:45.811 --> 00:53:49.890
to realize the power of rationality.
And so within 25 years,

820
00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:53.580
the whole attitude,
everything changes tremendously.
Uh,

821
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:59.280
as the bubonic plague receded for reasons we don't know that I showed you that

822
00:53:59.281 --> 00:54:00.114
data,

823
00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:05.460
then smallpox starts becoming the leading cause of death,

824
00:54:05.461 --> 00:54:08.340
one replacing the other.
So as,
uh,

825
00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:12.960
as opposed to what had gone on before,
which was supernatural ideas about it.

826
00:54:12.961 --> 00:54:16.350
And the 1710s or very shortly after Newton,

827
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:20.340
the royal scientific society again started at the same time,

828
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:21.960
began a search program,

829
00:54:21.961 --> 00:54:26.130
research program to gather information from any place in the world on how

830
00:54:26.131 --> 00:54:28.650
smallpox could be controlled or cured.

831
00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:33.870
Just a new kind of way of dealing with disease that just hadn't been seen
before.

832
00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.700
And so what did they find?

833
00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:40.920
They found that in Turkey that they were inoculating,
uh,
people.

834
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:42.470
And what,

835
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:46.500
what inoculation is the early form is they take someone who has the disease,

836
00:54:46.501 --> 00:54:50.460
they take pus from the disease and what is pus?

837
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:55.760
It's white blood cells that have eaten the virus and bacteria and depending

838
00:54:56.461 --> 00:55:01.050
where the plague or smallpox and have engulfed it and they kill the bacteria,

839
00:55:01.051 --> 00:55:03.300
virus,
the pathogen.
So we have a dead pathogen,

840
00:55:03.301 --> 00:55:08.250
but it's molecules are still there.
And so you can take the pus injected cut,

841
00:55:08.251 --> 00:55:13.251
just cut the skin and put it on a person and hopefully they're not exposed to

842
00:55:13.561 --> 00:55:16.170
any more of the live virus,
but the dead,

843
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:20.910
presuming the white blood cells have killed the virus and you just get their

844
00:55:20.911 --> 00:55:25.911
molecules and that induces an immune reaction and you become immune to this

845
00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:31.800
disease.
Uh,
local governments,

846
00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:36.240
uh,
started,
I'll tell you more about those smallpox in a couple of minutes.

847
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:40.440
Uh,
in 1750s,
again,
this very early time,

848
00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:44.480
local regulations for storage dispose of sewage disposal are,

849
00:55:44.530 --> 00:55:47.880
are getting started.
Uh,
in the 17,
nine days,

850
00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:52.320
the rich start using water closets,
which are toilets a of some sort.

851
00:55:54.030 --> 00:55:57.960
Now only doing introduce vaccination,
but 1796,

852
00:55:58.350 --> 00:56:02.190
they try to make it better.
They don't just say,
oh,
this works by some magic.

853
00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:07.410
They try to figure out what makes it better.
And Jenner discovers vaccination,

854
00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:11.250
which is instead of using pass from a person who had smallpox,

855
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.150
there's a very closely related disease called cow pox,

856
00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:20.310
which a cow maids the milkmaids get very frequently.

857
00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:21.330
And it was notice,

858
00:56:21.331 --> 00:56:24.580
cause they're now observing all these things that these women would get sick,

859
00:56:24.581 --> 00:56:27.610
but most of them would recover.
This was not a lethal disease.

860
00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:31.390
So instead of taking the actual smallpox virus,

861
00:56:31.391 --> 00:56:33.400
which vaccination,

862
00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:38.830
the early inoculation did not always work in you sometime did catch the disease

863
00:56:38.831 --> 00:56:39.664
and died.

864
00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:44.200
Taking it from cow pox rather than smallpox was less dangerous.

865
00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:48.910
But since the,
the viruses are closely related to each other,
um,

866
00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:53.320
there are a lot of,
the molecules are the same and you get it from cow pox,

867
00:56:53.321 --> 00:56:56.140
you get immunity to small parks.

868
00:56:57.340 --> 00:57:00.580
And so these diseases start going down.

869
00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:05.890
And
so,
not only in health,

870
00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:09.530
but it starts the industrial revolution.
Uh,

871
00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:14.380
in 1711,
uh,
James Newcomen,
uh,
events,

872
00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:16.780
uh,
the steam engine.
It's a very,

873
00:57:16.781 --> 00:57:20.910
very inefficient steam engine and it's used only where you have,

874
00:57:20.930 --> 00:57:24.760
can have a very big,
uh,
in placement.

875
00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:29.720
And it's used to pump water out of mines.
Coal is becoming important,
uh,

876
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:33.850
for England to fuel the industrial revolution.

877
00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:37.510
And we have,
mines are underground and water seeps into them.

878
00:57:37.511 --> 00:57:41.140
You've got to suck out the water.
So how do you pump it out?
Well,

879
00:57:41.141 --> 00:57:45.470
he invents the steam engine and then James Watt,
uh,

880
00:57:46.090 --> 00:57:50.050
figures out,
looks at it more scientifically,
more rationally.
And again,

881
00:57:50.051 --> 00:57:54.910
just like inoculation being supplanted with vaccination,
they start improving.

882
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.090
It's not just that something works in our ancestors did it this way and we don't

883
00:57:58.091 --> 00:57:59.500
know why it works.
We don't care.
It works.

884
00:57:59.501 --> 00:58:01.720
We do at the same way our ancestors did.
No,

885
00:58:01.721 --> 00:58:05.410
they keep thinking about what they're looking at,
what they're working on,

886
00:58:05.411 --> 00:58:08.260
any improves it.
And in this case,

887
00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:12.520
what James Watt did is after the steam comes out,

888
00:58:13.330 --> 00:58:15.280
he had a condenser to condense the steam.

889
00:58:15.281 --> 00:58:19.000
So drop the pressure on one side of the piston going out.

890
00:58:19.090 --> 00:58:22.240
So just by taking the condense that,
of letting,

891
00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:25.070
having a way of cooling the steam,
uh,

892
00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:27.610
really improves the efficiency of a steam engine.

893
00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:29.530
And now with a greater efficiency,

894
00:58:29.531 --> 00:58:33.640
you can make a smaller steam engine that works just as well,

895
00:58:33.850 --> 00:58:37.540
and you can put it on wheels and you can start getting the railroad and all

896
00:58:37.541 --> 00:58:41.560
kinds of smaller factories can start using steam engines.

897
00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:44.323
<v 3>MMM.</v>

898
00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:49.430
<v 0>In politics,
this idea is also terribly important.</v>

899
00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:54.080
The previous idea was that of a hierarchical system,

900
00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:59.410
who's God appointing kings being ruling it over nobility and then everyone else

901
00:59:00.081 --> 00:59:02.870
must obey up this chain.

902
00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:08.000
What was Newton's idea that everything obeys the same law.

903
00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.780
Gravity that the son attracts the earth.

904
00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:15.740
The earth attracts the sun equal and opposite.
There's no difference.

905
00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:18.410
The Sun does not rule the universe.
It's not better than you know,

906
00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:22.100
it works by exactly the same rule as the sun and the,
the earth and the moon.

907
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:24.920
The everything acts by the same rules.

908
00:59:24.921 --> 00:59:29.921
There is no need for some sort of central Centi and coordinator of all this.

909
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:35.630
But each individual planet,
each individual body,
all bodies,
apples,

910
00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:40.460
uh,
working by their own laws,
by the same laws as everyone else,

911
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:44.120
the universe works beautifully.
In fact,
it works as,
as it does work.

912
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:49.750
This idea is very consciously taken over into politics and the idea of democracy

913
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:55.220
again,
change that each person acting under his own desires,

914
00:59:55.221 --> 00:59:57.180
his own self interest,
uh,

915
00:59:57.350 --> 01:00:02.350
his own morality can by interacting in the same way the clients too can come out

916
01:00:02.811 --> 01:00:07.550
with a system that works and the original theorists of democracy,
we're very,

917
01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:12.050
very conscious of this shift in the way they looked at the way the universe

918
01:00:12.051 --> 01:00:15.410
works and very conscious of it's uh,

919
01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:21.530
it's their debt to Newton on that in economics,

920
01:00:21.531 --> 01:00:25.150
how many of your economics majors?
Oh,
of the blue.

921
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:28.580
The bus has really taken effect.
We used to have lots of economic majors.

922
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:33.500
So what ends Adam Smith's idea?
The,
the,
the,
the,
the,

923
01:00:33.501 --> 01:00:37.280
the basis of,
of modern economics is Adam Smith's.
That,
no,

924
01:00:37.281 --> 01:00:40.790
you don't need a merch until this government to control everything.

925
01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:46.060
That if each person acts in their own self interest by their own internal rules,

926
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:51.610
then the economy will work just wonderfully and be a more productive,

927
01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.490
uh,
freedom of religion is again the same thing.

928
01:00:55.491 --> 01:01:00.491
Freedom of conscience is a similar kind of idea that each person has its own,

929
01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:05.870
has his own way of working things in that does not destroy the harmony of the

930
01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:06.704
universe.

931
01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:12.330
And so,
um,

932
01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:21.830
we see that this rationality a changes everything about the way humans live.

933
01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:29.790
And one of its most important effects is demography.

934
01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:31.990
That the population,
uh,

935
01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:35.520
stop styling and can start increasing.

936
01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:40.740
And this exactly what happens as all this rational attitude toward death and

937
01:01:40.741 --> 01:01:42.840
towards disease starts taking hold.

938
01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:47.190
The death rate falls tremendously as I've shown you.
The life expectancy goes up,

939
01:01:47.191 --> 01:01:50.370
infant mortality goes down in population,

940
01:01:50.371 --> 01:01:52.530
starts increasing tremendously.

941
01:01:55.130 --> 01:02:00.130
Most people at that time believed that big population was a wonderful thing and

942
01:02:02.451 --> 01:02:03.560
they're very optimistic about it.

943
01:02:03.561 --> 01:02:07.520
And one of the standard ways of judging a government when you saw a country that

944
01:02:07.521 --> 01:02:08.660
had a lot of people in it,

945
01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:11.090
well obviously the government was doing something right.

946
01:02:11.091 --> 01:02:15.500
The king at that time was doing something right because people were able to stay

947
01:02:15.501 --> 01:02:16.334
alive.

948
01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:20.520
If you saw a country with a low population while something was wrong and that

949
01:02:20.521 --> 01:02:23.790
was not necessarily a,
an improper attitude.

950
01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:28.410
And so up until office,
uh,
with some exceptions,

951
01:02:28.490 --> 01:02:31.950
it was generally the idea that there was no limit to population,

952
01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:34.740
that the more the population the merrier.

953
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:39.950
Moses came along and said,
hmm,

954
01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:44.520
there is problems with population.
And um,

955
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:50.330
he had been watching,
uh,

956
01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:55.130
you know,
he,
he,
he collected very good dead.
He read,
you read his stuff.

957
01:02:55.131 --> 01:02:58.520
It's really wonderful to read because it's extremely modern and that he tells

958
01:02:58.521 --> 01:03:01.720
you the data he's collecting.
He analyzed it,
tells you what's,
what he,

959
01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.150
what's wrong with the data,
why,
why he believes it to a certain extent,

960
01:03:05.151 --> 01:03:08.170
but not beyond that.
And,
and all things about the era of the day,

961
01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:12.440
of the date of very,
he's writing is like 1798.
But it reads like a modern,
uh,

962
01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:17.300
phd thesis just about,
and

963
01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.010
his,
his knowledge was,
was the following and it's,

964
01:03:22.011 --> 01:03:23.450
and it's very simple what he said.

965
01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:29.390
He did not say many people bought that as previous people had often said like,

966
01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:32.210
like Edmund Burke,
who's a father of conservatives,

967
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:37.340
that the economic pie is constant.
There's just so much stuff out there.

968
01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:41.690
And the more people you just have to divide the pie smaller and smaller.

969
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:43.910
So that's one way of looking at it.

970
01:03:43.911 --> 01:03:46.630
And then it's perfectly obvious that population is,

971
01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:51.180
is a bad thing cause there's fixed production and you have more people to eat up

972
01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:54.560
that production.
No,
Moses was much smarter

973
01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:00.920
by the time he wrote in 1798,
the enlightenment had started to produce results.

974
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:04.450
He could see that agricultural production,
uh,

975
01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:08.430
was in improving year by year.
Modern methods,
uh,

976
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:11.240
we're modern at that time were beginning to take over.

977
01:04:11.241 --> 01:04:15.500
And he knew that production rose and what he assumed and what he,

978
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:20.060
what he saw from the data was that production rose linearly,

979
01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:22.100
that every year there was sort of,

980
01:04:22.250 --> 01:04:27.140
you could produce a little bit more out of the land.
Now he said,

981
01:04:27.141 --> 01:04:31.040
but what about population?
He said,
in population,

982
01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:35.750
if you have a hundred people,
and they increased by let's say 50%,

983
01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:40.670
that's 150 people.
You've gained 50 people,
but now from the next generation,

984
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:42.680
you again grow by 50%.

985
01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:47.570
You're starting with 150 people you have now you're adding 75 people.

986
01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:51.860
So the graph,
uh,
oh,
I have,
there is blackboard here.

987
01:04:56.730 --> 01:04:57.960
This is time.

988
01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:03.250
This is agricultural product.

989
01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:10.420
And Martha said,
this is growing like this,

990
01:05:10.421 --> 01:05:13.930
which was quite reasonable for his time.
But population,

991
01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.960
no matter where it starts,
grows,

992
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.280
he called it geometrically.
We call it exponentially.

993
01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:26.940
So if it starts that there's just enough food for people to eat,

994
01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:29.283
uh,

995
01:05:29.770 --> 01:05:33.640
then it almost immediately goes above food production.

996
01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:39.340
If it starts even below,
it doesn't matter.
It eventually rises,

997
01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:42.410
catches up with food production and goes beyond it.

998
01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.880
So he believed that there was no doubt that population increases geometrically

999
01:05:49.001 --> 01:05:51.040
or exponentially as,
as we say,

1000
01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:56.340
that means a certain percent a year in increased 1% a year or 2% a year or 3% a

1001
01:05:57.521 --> 01:06:02.020
year.
But remember that's 1% of an increasing number.

1002
01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:05.800
So it's more and more,
whereas agriculture,

1003
01:06:05.801 --> 01:06:10.780
he thought increased linearly by the same fixed amount each year.

1004
01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:15.430
And if that's the case,
you're gonna run into starvation.
So he said,

1005
01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:17.710
since,
uh,

1006
01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:22.150
since population can always outrun productivity,

1007
01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:27.370
eventually you get into trouble that whenever you increase the number of people,

1008
01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:29.080
uh,
if you ever,

1009
01:06:29.140 --> 01:06:34.140
so you're at some sort of status status level where resources fit the

1010
01:06:34.211 --> 01:06:35.050
population,

1011
01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:39.820
but then as you get some increase in productivity,

1012
01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:44.950
it allows a rise in population only to match that.

1013
01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:49.920
But then the greater number of people eat up that increase in productivity is

1014
01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:52.600
right back down to where you started with.

1015
01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:58.740
So his idea was that increasing population was not a good thing.

1016
01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:02.400
It could not lead to any improvement.
Uh,

1017
01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:06.100
if it Outran your productivity gains.

1018
01:07:06.490 --> 01:07:11.080
And this led to all kinds of what we now consider very conservative and even

1019
01:07:11.081 --> 01:07:14.590
retrogressive political ideas.
So poor laws,

1020
01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:16.270
he was initially against poor laws.

1021
01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:19.690
There's no sense to keep the poor live because if you keep them alive,

1022
01:07:19.691 --> 01:07:22.780
they're going to reproduce and make even more children.

1023
01:07:22.781 --> 01:07:27.110
And you're right back to where you started from.
Uh,

1024
01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:32.110
so he was a strong conservative,
uh,
in,
in,

1025
01:07:32.170 --> 01:07:33.040
in that sense.

1026
01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:38.130
He later changed his mind as he got smarter about things he was also aware of,

1027
01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:42.280
even though population could increase like this maybe.

1028
01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:46.210
And he was aware that people were smart enough to stop this in some way.

1029
01:07:46.450 --> 01:07:50.350
So he knew about various methods of contraception,

1030
01:07:50.351 --> 01:07:55.330
withdrawal and so forth and various perverse sexual practices.

1031
01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:57.910
Uh,
but he was so opposed to them.
Marley,

1032
01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:01.840
as was everyone else in his time that you should not control reproduction,

1033
01:08:01.841 --> 01:08:05.080
that that was immoral.
But he said,
no,
people are never going to do that.

1034
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:10.500
That what happens to balance it is not people themselves controlling this in a

1035
01:08:11.681 --> 01:08:16.640
very rational way,
which he thought was not possible at that time.
Uh,
but,

1036
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:18.590
uh,
family would come in,

1037
01:08:18.591 --> 01:08:21.320
disease would come in and whenever your population got too big,

1038
01:08:21.321 --> 01:08:24.260
people would get very poor.
They were open to some disease.

1039
01:08:24.261 --> 01:08:28.550
The disease would wipe you out.
So either starved directly,
immediately from,

1040
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:29.510
uh,

1041
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:34.190
too much the population getting ahead of agricultural productivity,

1042
01:08:34.191 --> 01:08:38.720
you gonna starved or you've got so weak that diseases come through and wipe you

1043
01:08:38.721 --> 01:08:43.370
out.
Okay.
We will,
uh,
time is up.

1044
01:08:43.790 --> 01:08:46.010
We will continue onward next time.
