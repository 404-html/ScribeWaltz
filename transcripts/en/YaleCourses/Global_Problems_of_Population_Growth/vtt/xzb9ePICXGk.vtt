1
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.090
It's the the space to produce food and to supply them.

2
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.363
All rich.

3
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.090
Performers limited resources for survival and yet we are increasing our

4
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:35.010
population is important because.

5
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.760
Demand is at the root of our most critical environmental process.

6
00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.453
On this map.

7
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.700
Population growth will be recorded from year one to the budget and then

8
00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:04.550
projected that it would hit a 20 point population in total.

9
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.710
That location of the could five dollars each of which represents one million

10
00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:10.864
people

11
00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.530
is going to reference points are provided by the images on the right.

12
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.823
<v 1>Japan.</v>

13
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.613
<v 2>He turned this down.</v>

14
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.180
<v 3>Well I think you got the message</v>

15
00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.090
that I was actually going to show you.
This is the end of the course.

16
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.950
To show you the beginning of the course a little video but it was not.

17
00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.680
<v 4>Not in the right format.
And it shows our favorite dung beetles copulating.</v>

18
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.060
And.
It's very it's very graphic.

19
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:19.180
And it looks just like humans with the same rhythm everything same motions.

20
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.770
So and the message of the course was this is what this course has been about.

21
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.320
Start with insects doing their thing and end up with humans doing their thing.

22
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.920
And in between nothing really has changed the desire to engage in sex has not

23
00:06:36.821 --> 00:06:40.540
changed the quest for status to determine sex.

24
00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.710
I mean we we've had this over and over again in the chorus and I hope you

25
00:06:44.711 --> 00:06:48.910
realized by now that we've discussed so much from the Princeton Project and

26
00:06:48.911 --> 00:06:53.911
other projects how much social acceptance is an important part of fertility that

27
00:06:56.801 --> 00:07:01.060
people determine their own fertility a lot because of what is the acceptable

28
00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:03.400
norm in the community.

29
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:07.390
And aside from the direct status of having a lot of sons and a big family gives

30
00:07:07.391 --> 00:07:12.391
you big status because of protection and political power from a large family and

31
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.340
economic security.

32
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.450
But it's all tied in with status.

33
00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.550
Well I think I mentioned to you that for instance in Bangladesh they looked at

34
00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:26.740
fertility as a function of religiosity.

35
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:31.870
And one factor that had some effect was the religiosity of the particular
family.

36
00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:34.840
But the much bigger effect was the religiosity of the community.

37
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:38.980
It's all community acceptance it's all status.
And we just.

38
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.430
That comes directly from the chimpanzees.

39
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.820
And of course you aware that a vast percentage of human consumption spend and

40
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.320
more.

41
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.220
The richer you get the more of it is is status consumption in the Mercedes and

42
00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:58.210
the Ford is basically status in that kind of thing

43
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:05.420
so you've also seen that between groups the hostility between groups has not

44
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:09.340
basically not changed since.
A simple chimpanzees.
The.

45
00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.950
The maltreatment of females the battering of females among chimpanzees the

46
00:08:13.951 --> 00:08:18.150
battering of females among humans.
It's all stayed about the same.

47
00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.490
So if I could have shown you that that video you'd have gotten the message that

48
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:26.460
why did it.

49
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.450
Also why this is a biology course or at least part of the reason is because the

50
00:08:30.451 --> 00:08:33.990
fundamentals of almost everything that we've talked about on the same set of

51
00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:39.380
behavioral propensities that are apparently wired into us in some way since our

52
00:08:39.511 --> 00:08:41.280
chimpanzee days.

53
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:46.160
OK so this last this video that you did see.

54
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:53.940
The main point is that the situation we are in now with respect to population is

55
00:08:53.941 --> 00:08:56.700
totally unprecedented in the history of humanity.

56
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.370
There's just never been anything like it.

57
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.880
And you also know something about the future.

58
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:17.963
Will come.

59
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.210
<v 5>Oh that might help to put it.
Here we go.
Here we go.</v>

60
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.710
<v 4>But
that video was made in.</v>

61
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:45.420
I wrote that and I think 1990 and the projections the the actual numbers are

62
00:09:46.341 --> 00:09:50.930
pretty good for their projection.
Oh this is not.

63
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.150
None of it and I'll show you the situation.

64
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:54.500
<v 6>OK good.</v>

65
00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:58.350
<v 7>Why is this the there
Kohei</v>

66
00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.550
No it should work.
OK so.

67
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.780
<v 3>What's usually these are the projections that the U.N.</v>

68
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.980
has put up for the future of population.

69
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:39.170
So I think I showed you the early in the course when I was discussing

70
00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:44.171
quantitative methods the US Census Bureau projection and that more or less

71
00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:46.430
mimics this one.

72
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:51.980
But the UN shows you that there's a range they do not know what's going to

73
00:10:51.981 --> 00:10:52.814
happen.

74
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.930
And so they give you a range of possibilities for the future and they do not

75
00:10:56.931 --> 00:10:58.820
call them predictions at all.

76
00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:04.090
They are simply projections meaning that if X Y Z or Q happens then this will be

77
00:11:05.571 --> 00:11:10.520
the course of population but they don't say which of these things is going to

78
00:11:10.521 --> 00:11:11.840
happen if any of them.

79
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:17.410
So what would you consider in terms of say fertility what would you consider the

80
00:11:19.431 --> 00:11:23.480
most conservative projection.
We know what's happened in the past.

81
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.410
We know what the status is today what you're how shall we make our future

82
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:28.843
projection.

83
00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:34.330
Fertility staying the same fertility going up fertility going down.

84
00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.860
Things down.
OK.
So the U.N.
That's one of the projections.

85
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.760
To my mind the most conservative projection is that whatever we're at today

86
00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.570
that's what we we continue to be at.

87
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:51.660
It's in the sense that's what I think conservative means that you preserve

88
00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:52.650
what's been in the past.

89
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:57.890
<v 8>Well that's this projection that the fertility that the world is at today</v>

90
00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.590
continues just just as it is.

91
00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.160
And the projections carried out to 2050 and assuming that we are where we are it

92
00:12:09.001 --> 00:12:11.490
will be population will be 12 billion.

93
00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.310
We're now about six point seven billion.

94
00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:20.780
Population will be not quite double what we are now and rising ever faster.

95
00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:28.220
So that's that's the status quo assumption.

96
00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:33.270
The other assumptions are optimistic that things will that fertility will come

97
00:12:33.271 --> 00:12:36.750
down and they're not unreasonable assumptions and the reason why some of you

98
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.070
chose fertility coming in because fertility has been coming down so it's not a

99
00:12:41.071 --> 00:12:46.071
it's not a crazy presumption but how much is it going to come down.

100
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:50.880
So the U.N.
gives you three possibilities.
So.

101
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.310
This projection

102
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:58.980
which they called the high projection assumes that fertility will come down

103
00:12:58.981 --> 00:13:02.630
another half of a child right now.

104
00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:07.850
This was based on the average fertility between 2000 2005 who's got 2.8 children

105
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:10.950
2.8 five children.

106
00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:15.570
And they're presuming in this projection that it'll come down another half a

107
00:13:15.571 --> 00:13:16.404
child for every.

108
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:21.120
The average for everyone on earth to two point three five still above

109
00:13:21.121 --> 00:13:25.930
replacement level fertility with that degree of optimism that comes out another

110
00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.640
half a child population keeps increasing not as fast as this.

111
00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:34.230
And by 2050 we get to roughly 11 billion.
And it's pretty much going up.

112
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:35.850
In a straight line.

113
00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:40.530
Now you can get a little bit more optimistic and say well it's going to come

114
00:13:40.531 --> 00:13:45.000
down a whole child's worth.
And that's this

115
00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:50.370
scenario here now or at one point eight five.

116
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:55.350
The whole world has come down to a quarter of the replacement of all fertility

117
00:13:55.351 --> 00:13:56.940
as you know is two point one children.

118
00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:02.210
So one point eighty five is a quarter child below replacement fertility.

119
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:07.910
And you can decide for yourself how much optimism is involved in assuming that's

120
00:14:08.941 --> 00:14:09.774
going to happen.

121
00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:15.620
But if that's the case then population is like 9 billion in 2050 and continuing

122
00:14:18.811 --> 00:14:23.070
up but clearly beginning to level off at that time.

123
00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.930
Now they get really optimistic and they do this

124
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.850
this line.
And that's it drops a child and a half.

125
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.500
In this short amount of time.

126
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.480
<v 9>And that goes down to one point three five children per woman way below</v>

127
00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:44.500
replacement fertility and that's for the whole world.

128
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.250
The assumptions are the.

129
00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:54.420
<v 10>What is going on</v>

130
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.130
sorry about this I don't know what's problematic here today.

131
00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:20.850
<v 8>So these are the the UN's own statement of its of its assumptions the constant</v>

132
00:15:22.811 --> 00:15:26.740
fertility one footnote remains constant at that average of more or less two

133
00:15:26.741 --> 00:15:27.910
point eighty two point eighty five.

134
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.570
The high fertility assumption they're calling a reduction from now high.

135
00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.530
The high fertility.

136
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:36.970
Two point three five children medium one point eight five one point three five.

137
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.780
And then they have a really miraculous something the instant replacement

138
00:15:40.781 --> 00:15:45.340
assumption which they don't bother to graph which is each country immediately

139
00:15:45.341 --> 00:15:49.840
like tomorrow comes down to just the birth rate that will replace its population

140
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.180
no more no less.

141
00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.000
So what what should we notice about these things.

142
00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.610
Obviously they're pretty arbitrary assumptions.

143
00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.150
No one knows what's going to happen in the future.

144
00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.080
No one claims to know what's going to happen in the future.

145
00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:09.340
<v 3>And it's a sign that</v>

146
00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.590
you know we don't we just don't know enough about this issue.

147
00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:19.620
I mean I've told you a lot of what's the basic stuff that's known but we have we

148
00:16:19.871 --> 00:16:22.920
do not know enough to really predict you.

149
00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:25.410
We asked at the beginning in the course the middle of the end of the course and

150
00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.720
why has fertility been coming down.
What are the determinants of fertility.

151
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.430
And you've gotten a whole lot of answers.

152
00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.970
If we knew the answer for sure we would be able to predict.

153
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.810
But the future is not terribly predictable.
OK.

154
00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:43.510
<v 8>So these are projections not not predictions.
They've got a huge range there.</v>

155
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.110
From about 8 billion to about 12 billion.

156
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.220
That's an uncertainty not terribly distant future 50 percent.

157
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:55.810
That's a very very large degree of uncertainty.

158
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.150
Only the most optimistic assumption this last one.

159
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:06.690
Only the most optimistic projection has population decreasing by 2050.

160
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:13.170
<v 3>All the other assumptions show it continuing to increase right through 2050 with</v>

161
00:17:13.361 --> 00:17:17.530
no no statement about what might or might not happen beyond that

162
00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:24.830
so in the medium Variant This is the one that they call the Medium Variant.

163
00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:29.270
And because they use that word medium the press sort of takes this as well the

164
00:17:29.271 --> 00:17:33.260
most likely something you and does not say anything about the likelihood of any

165
00:17:33.261 --> 00:17:37.520
of these estimates.
But take your choice

166
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:44.050
in this rise that we're now increasing it like 70 19 2000 up to 2007 the average

167
00:17:47.301 --> 00:17:51.200
rise was about 78 million a year.

168
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:56.710
In this scenario by 2050 its population is still increasing by 30 million a

169
00:17:57.801 --> 00:17:58.460
year.

170
00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:02.450
So that's their Medium Variant as far out as they're willing to even project not

171
00:18:02.451 --> 00:18:07.451
predict but even to project population still increasing by 30 million a year.

172
00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.230
I keep saying these are optimistic.

173
00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.830
Remember none of these assume that fertility starts rising again.

174
00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.790
We haven't had a fall in fertility.

175
00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:25.490
And there are certainly reasons to believe that if the world that we've had a

176
00:18:25.491 --> 00:18:30.070
fall in fertility and we've also had really rather great progress in the world

177
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.100
say since the end of World War 2 I mean people are staying alive they're getting

178
00:18:34.101 --> 00:18:39.101
more educated or parts of the world China India Indonesia are just unbelievably

179
00:18:40.791 --> 00:18:45.050
richer than than they used to be although still very poor and pockets of real

180
00:18:45.051 --> 00:18:46.640
poverty exist.

181
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:51.050
I mean most of the world has just improved tremendously both in the rich

182
00:18:51.051 --> 00:18:55.520
countries the West Japan and in the poor countries.

183
00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:01.120
If you had to choose a date that you would like to be alive but you couldn't

184
00:19:01.701 --> 00:19:06.260
choose who you would be or where you would be the only reasonable date to choose

185
00:19:06.261 --> 00:19:11.261
is now because because the average human being on earth was worse worse worse go

186
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.070
going back as far as you want.

187
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.390
Now if you could choose to be a rich person that's maybe another story but if

188
00:19:20.391 --> 00:19:23.930
you if you just would be randomly seated anywhere you choose to be now.

189
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.380
So things have been getting better.
There's no question about it.

190
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:33.700
<v 4>If things continue to get better we it's very reasonable presume that one of</v>

191
00:19:35.421 --> 00:19:40.421
these maybe not this curb but one of these more optimistic curves might take

192
00:19:41.211 --> 00:19:42.044
place.

193
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:47.290
But there are a lot of reasons why things may not continue to get better and in

194
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:53.290
the paper that segments of a paper that I wrote I list a number of them.

195
00:19:55.010 --> 00:20:00.010
One that I listed was economic collapse and I was talking about the fairly small

196
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:05.290
economic collapse in Asia in 1997 which had happened at about that time.

197
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.860
And I did not envision as did no one.
You know this.

198
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.670
We have really no global kind of a mega crash.

199
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.460
And will we recover or not.
Who knows.

200
00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:21.620
But if economic progress is one of the things that's required or economic

201
00:20:21.621 --> 00:20:26.390
increase is one of the things that's required for population to keep coming down

202
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.420
then the global economy.
Who knows what's going to happen.

203
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.950
It may very well turn around.

204
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:37.300
Religious fundamentalism is is another thing that we know that it's not a

205
00:20:37.761 --> 00:20:42.761
particular religion Christianity or Islam or or or Judaism that matters but it

206
00:20:44.241 --> 00:20:48.260
is the religiosity the degree to which people are religious in whatever their

207
00:20:48.261 --> 00:20:52.280
religious tradition is.
That latter makes a difference.

208
00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:57.320
And religious fundamentalism is basically increasing all across the world

209
00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:04.090
including the United States because I read an article that Notre Dame is one of

210
00:21:04.311 --> 00:21:06.620
the great Catholic universities in America.

211
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:10.730
And the priests a number of the priests that of the order that founded Notre

212
00:21:10.731 --> 00:21:15.731
Dame and still run it didn't want the President Obama was invited to be

213
00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.200
the speaker at graduation this year.

214
00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.260
And the priests didn't want him to be because he's pro-abortion.

215
00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:29.980
So the conservatism in at one end of the spectrum of all religions is is there

216
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.350
and increasing.

217
00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:38.570
You see the Taliban which at one end of the Islamic spectrum they are powerful

218
00:21:38.571 --> 00:21:42.200
now increasingly powerful not only in Afghanistan but now in Pakistan.

219
00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.630
And I know you've been reading the newspapers but there they have now taken a

220
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:50.750
provincial big city or capital.

221
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:55.790
It's like 13 and 30 miles or something from Islamabad the capital of Pakistan.

222
00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:01.330
So they're they're increasing the population of Orthodox Jews in Israel because

223
00:22:01.551 --> 00:22:06.551
they reproduce so much faster than everyone else is is very close to overtaking

224
00:22:06.891 --> 00:22:11.450
the population of more moderate Jews and the Palestinians and the Orthodox Jews

225
00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:16.930
in Israel are having a battle to see who can increase their their fertility fast

226
00:22:16.941 --> 00:22:21.850
enough to sort of out reproduce the other and et cetera.

227
00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:26.830
Another factor is the decline in support for international family planning

228
00:22:26.831 --> 00:22:31.831
programs as you're undoubtedly where the population explosion which was very hot

229
00:22:32.531 --> 00:22:37.180
issue for the press and for all kinds of activists organizations in the 1960s

230
00:22:37.181 --> 00:22:39.760
and 1970s has just fallen off the map.

231
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.900
Our own school of environmental studies here forestry does not have a single

232
00:22:43.901 --> 00:22:48.901
person that pays any attention to human population courses like this are taught

233
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:53.280
basically nowhere else and very few places elsewhere.

234
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:57.640
Environmental organizations won't go near the population issue.

235
00:22:58.450 --> 00:23:03.450
And so governments not under any pressure from the citizens are reducing their

236
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:06.490
support of family planning.

237
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:11.500
And this has already happened in large degree as well as a lot of other good

238
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:12.850
good programs.

239
00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:17.440
And with the economic problems of all governments now it's going to be even

240
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:21.150
further
not economic

241
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:24.540
exacerbate social problems

242
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.180
Vega said.

243
00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:33.710
<v 11>So do do economic problems exacerbate social problems so that people will want</v>

244
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:35.970
to more control their fertility government.

245
00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:42.480
<v 3>So what you say is really but the opposite of everything that we've sort of said</v>

246
00:23:42.481 --> 00:23:46.590
in the course that's when things are getting better that when when people come

247
00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:51.591
from being except for land availability that when when infant mortality goes

248
00:23:51.601 --> 00:23:55.950
down people reduce their birthrate when education is available people reduce

249
00:23:55.951 --> 00:23:59.790
their birthrate when countries get richer people reduce their birthrate.

250
00:24:00.270 --> 00:24:04.490
So no it's exactly the opposite of that.

251
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.970
You should take definitely take that away from from this call that good things

252
00:24:08.971 --> 00:24:12.870
happen when things are already getting getting better and the reduction in

253
00:24:12.871 --> 00:24:16.080
fertility.
Goes along with.

254
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:19.740
I didn't say cause but goes along with an improvement in every kind of condition

255
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.200
that that you can count and when the economy goes by I mean and then in the 1997

256
00:24:27.391 --> 00:24:32.391
Asian crisis a lot of women working the cities and not having at factories and

257
00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:34.830
sewing and so were not having children.

258
00:24:35.670 --> 00:24:38.480
They lost their jobs and went back to the villages and guess what they did and

259
00:24:38.481 --> 00:24:40.110
they started having children.

260
00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:45.480
So it's improvement in the situation that that gets fertility down

261
00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:48.063
because.

262
00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.110
<v 4>OK excellent.</v>

263
00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:01.500
So what her question was because this is a short term more of an economic shock

264
00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:03.670
than a depression.

265
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:08.680
Maybe people will temporarily reduce their fertility.
And that's.

266
00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.340
That's a wonderful
observation.

267
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.100
And economists really don't know how to answer that.

268
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.650
So when I when I started teaching this course I taught the CO taught it with the

269
00:25:20.651 --> 00:25:25.651
professor of economics and he was teaching sort of the economic determinism this

270
00:25:26.741 --> 00:25:30.940
is really what he believed and he thought that as countries come up economically

271
00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:35.350
fertility will come down.
More or less automatically.

272
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:39.640
And he was of the mind that development is the best contraceptive I've shown
you.

273
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:43.910
Since then the data has shown I think clearly shown that's not not the case.

274
00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:45.350
But that was his belief then.

275
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.170
<v 12>Then comes this 1997 economic collapse in Asia.</v>

276
00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.010
And I go up to this professor who I was not teaching with anymore.

277
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:59.400
He says I say to him hey gee here's this economic collapse in Asia.

278
00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:01.840
What do you think will happen.

279
00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:07.920
And he said to me I think fertility will go down which is what you're saying

280
00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:09.820
because conditions are getting worse.

281
00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.920
And what you're saying and I was shocked and I said but I won't say his name.

282
00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.920
But that's exactly the opposite of what you're taught in the course.

283
00:26:18.850 --> 00:26:23.260
And what he said to me was I think the theory is flexible enough to accommodate

284
00:26:23.261 --> 00:26:27.370
both results which means the theory didn't predict anything.

285
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.640
If you can predict this and then the opposite.
It doesn't predict anything.

286
00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:32.320
So we don't know the answer to this.

287
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.960
I mean first of all we don't know if this is a temporary economic collapse.

288
00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:39.460
Mean we hope it is but no guarantees.

289
00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:44.940
<v 5>And the the the data to figure out the inventory what's short term which is</v>

290
00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:49.540
undefined and what's long term which is undefined very difficult to do.

291
00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:54.220
You may be right.
You may be wrong.
I think we just can't be certain about that

292
00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:00.350
and of course the other factor which could cause things to go to hell in a

293
00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:01.193
handbasket

294
00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:08.220
is environmental collapse that if the environment gets bad things start getting

295
00:27:09.371 --> 00:27:09.940
used up.

296
00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:14.940
If people really start starving or losing not having water or whatever the

297
00:27:15.731 --> 00:27:19.480
environment will do first and we'll talk maybe a little bit about what might

298
00:27:19.481 --> 00:27:23.830
happen first.
Then again things could go backwards very very fast.

299
00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:25.203
So

300
00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.950
none of this is our predictions that I'm saying.

301
00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.750
I'm just saying that here's all this optimism.

302
00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:37.480
All of these except the top the constant among all of those are optimistic

303
00:27:37.481 --> 00:27:39.610
presumptions that may take place.

304
00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.720
<v 4>But there's just as many reasons to think that no things will turn around and</v>

305
00:27:43.721 --> 00:27:46.420
fertility will go back up and we just don't know

306
00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.133
the future

307
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:56.710
but what we we can't say that by all is any kind of reasonable assumption for

308
00:27:57.331 --> 00:28:02.331
the next 40 years at least we're in for a very significant increase in

309
00:28:02.551 --> 00:28:05.190
population that is going to happen.

310
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:11.220
So how does how does one concept I am trying to make this lecture at least

311
00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:12.480
somewhat about the environment.

312
00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:18.260
How does one relate this population increase to environment to environmental

313
00:28:19.141 --> 00:28:23.970
destruction to decay of the environment.
This is not an easy question.

314
00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:29.330
There are so many variables between human population and and environmental

315
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:33.420
destruction that it's hard to pick out what's just

316
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:37.130
due to due to the population.

317
00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:43.150
And the simplest statement that you can make is that the total human

318
00:28:43.151 --> 00:28:48.151
environmental footprint footprint is and is an idea come up by I get some invite

319
00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:51.460
I don't know is there a name attached to who came up with the use of the word

320
00:28:51.461 --> 00:28:52.294
footprint.

321
00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:57.480
Anyway the idea of the total environmental impact impact of an individual city a

322
00:28:57.971 --> 00:29:02.971
country an industry whatever the environmental footprint is what's said and in

323
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:08.290
the simplest way of thinking about it the environmental footprint is

324
00:29:08.291 --> 00:29:12.280
proportional the number of people each people on earth have an average
footprint.

325
00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:17.600
The more people the bigger the footprint and that holds it any any level any

326
00:29:19.121 --> 00:29:23.170
assumptions you want to put on it more people bigger footprint.

327
00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.180
<v 8>So that's that's fairly obvious</v>

328
00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:28.780
but it's not doesn't tell you an awful lot.

329
00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:33.930
And so many years ago a guy named John Holdren proposed on sort of a expansion

330
00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:41.460
of that idea and he is now Obama's the director of the Office of Science and

331
00:29:41.471 --> 00:29:44.230
Technology just recently appointed by President Obama.

332
00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:49.560
So at least you have now have someone in power who thinks about population and

333
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:55.410
what he came up with as was this equation the impact the environmental impact.

334
00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:01.120
He breaks it down and says you don't have to worry only about population but how

335
00:30:01.121 --> 00:30:04.810
rich is that population.
That's the difference when rich people and poor people.

336
00:30:05.290 --> 00:30:08.980
What about the technology involved.
So.

337
00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:14.860
Affluence is that we clearly know that rich people consume a lot more than poor

338
00:30:14.861 --> 00:30:19.030
people between the poorest groups on Earth and the riches are a factor of

339
00:30:19.031 --> 00:30:23.050
something like 40 depending on how poor you want to go and how rich you want to

340
00:30:23.051 --> 00:30:27.940
go that number can be almost anything but 40 is a reasonable number to keep in

341
00:30:27.941 --> 00:30:30.430
mind.
So affluence is certainly important.

342
00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.050
The amount of money your population has and technology.

343
00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:40.500
So nowadays if we want to knock down a forest we use bulldozers and chain saws

344
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:46.960
you know chain saws that'll cut down a 40 foot tree with one swipe and clearly

345
00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:51.010
that technology allows you to have a much greater impact than if you're going

346
00:30:51.011 --> 00:30:56.011
out there with a little hand hatchet or maybe even a stone axe to try to chop

347
00:30:56.501 --> 00:31:00.280
down your tree.
The amount of technology that one has

348
00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:07.080
clearly makes a tremendous difference in how much destruction you can do

349
00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:14.310
what you should notice is that like all so this is symbolized by IPART.

350
00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:19.370
The impact as population affluence technology or multiply together you should

351
00:31:20.281 --> 00:31:23.790
keep in mind that this is a tautology tautology means something which is always

352
00:31:23.791 --> 00:31:26.490
true.
The equation is always true and you just see that.

353
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.910
You define population just people.

354
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:34.350
Affluence is the income per person number of dollars that person has.

355
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:39.710
And technology is defined in this nice way of the impact per dollar spent right.

356
00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:45.380
So that's the how you're defining these terms how you're measuring these terms

357
00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:50.430
and you'll just notice that if you if you cross multiply the persons and persons

358
00:31:50.431 --> 00:31:54.540
cancel out the dollars and dollars cancel out your equation ends up that the

359
00:31:54.541 --> 00:31:59.540
impact is equal to the impact.
So that's a sign of a true equation true here.

360
00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:03.450
No no.
It's a tautology it's always always the case.

361
00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:09.920
And I should show you that for instance this is standard thing out of Science

362
00:32:10.951 --> 00:32:14.460
magazine one of their stories about population and what are they doing impact.

363
00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:19.490
Here's the first thing that last impact per dollar so that in this case the

364
00:32:19.741 --> 00:32:23.560
impact there is carbon budget.
So they're talking about the carbon budget.

365
00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:28.580
They even use the word budget for that and it's for each U.S. dollar.

366
00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:32.380
This is a global figure they're going to give you but they're calculating it in

367
00:32:32.381 --> 00:32:37.381
U.S. dollars for each each dollar spent on something in the world.

368
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.150
How much carbon is used.

369
00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:44.510
And so that's kilograms of carbon per dollar and it's about now about a quarter.

370
00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:50.310
And it's changed somewhat over time but not enormously.

371
00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:52.080
So it's gotten better.

372
00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:55.890
This is this is the lower the number the better that for each dollar of stuff

373
00:32:55.891 --> 00:33:00.891
that you buy there's basically less carbon used to make it so that.

374
00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:07.020
So this kind of way of thinking about environmental impacts is now actually

375
00:33:09.181 --> 00:33:14.181
rather standard and you really can't avoid this kind of thinking.

376
00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:20.850
<v 4>One of the real important things about this that people make mistakes on all the</v>

377
00:33:21.581 --> 00:33:26.581
time is that the factors multiply that you don't add the population plus the

378
00:33:27.491 --> 00:33:30.790
affluence plus the technology you multiply them.

379
00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:35.380
And one of the there's a very important book so I think it's called not

380
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:39.190
something new under the sun.
And the guy who wrote it

381
00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:45.810
Yale tried to hire him as our environmental historian and he was adding these

382
00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:51.691
factors and making all kinds of totally wrong conclusions and saying that well

383
00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:57.290
the rate of growth of affluence is so much and the rate of growth of population

384
00:33:57.291 --> 00:33:57.730
is so much.

385
00:33:57.730 --> 00:34:01.630
So this one is more important than that one just saying utter nonsense because

386
00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:06.490
he didn't realize the importance of the fact that there was ever anything per

387
00:34:06.491 --> 00:34:08.860
capita is multiplied by the total population.

388
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:13.240
To get your global impact in the global impact is something you're interested in

389
00:34:13.241 --> 00:34:16.420
the total impact the total amount of carbon dioxide not increased so much how

390
00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:21.421
much carbon actually I put into the air but how much the 6 7 billion of us put

391
00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.970
into the air
OK.

392
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:30.610
Now the equation looks simple and it's always true and.

393
00:34:31.730 --> 00:34:36.730
<v 3>And yet it's not as straightforward as as one would like because people take</v>

394
00:34:37.711 --> 00:34:42.711
something beyond the total logical fact of it being true with this as I've

395
00:34:43.021 --> 00:34:46.680
describe it what this makes you think it's well an increase in population is

396
00:34:46.681 --> 00:34:51.510
always bad it always increases the impact an increase in affluence is always bad

397
00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:55.830
it always increases the impact and improvement in technology is always bad.

398
00:34:55.950 --> 00:35:00.950
It increases the impact that's not not true that as people get richer as

399
00:35:03.571 --> 00:35:08.571
affluence goes up they tend to spend a somewhat larger fraction of their income

400
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:13.680
on environmental issues that once you have a nice house and life nice car nice

401
00:35:13.681 --> 00:35:17.490
school nice clothing you may actually want to breathe nice nice air and look at

402
00:35:17.491 --> 00:35:20.340
something green and have a park to go walk into.

403
00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:25.850
So rich people do indeed spend more than poor people on environmental issues.

404
00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:33.150
So affluence can work both ways.
And that's very important to remember.

405
00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:38.660
However you have to step back a little bit and say well in the world what

406
00:35:38.881 --> 00:35:43.881
fraction of our increasing affluence have we actually spent on the environment

407
00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:48.240
and the increase.
We've spent a very small fraction of it.

408
00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:53.540
So in fact the overwhelming dominant effect of our affluence has indeed been to

409
00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:00.000
have a greater impact on the environment.
And we've ameliorate that a little bit.

410
00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:04.770
I mean very noticeable the rivers in America rich place rivers or really a lot

411
00:36:04.771 --> 00:36:09.030
of rivers have been cleaned up.
A lot of smog has been cleaned up.

412
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:12.210
So we have made progress in certain very visible ways.

413
00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:16.350
We've exported a fair amount of our environmental concerns to other parts of the

414
00:36:16.351 --> 00:36:20.640
world by having them manufacture stuff and bringing it in here and bringing

415
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:24.420
knocking down their forests to bring in wood and so forth and the Chinese and

416
00:36:24.421 --> 00:36:28.260
the Japanese have done just the same kind of thing.

417
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:34.520
Similarly with technology it doesn't always work one way that yes technology

418
00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:39.570
allows you to blow off a mountain top to get some coal.

419
00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.960
<v 5>You know you've seen these these horrific pictures of West Virginia and so forth</v>

420
00:36:42.961 --> 00:36:46.680
where a beauty you know more or less beautiful mountain that's covered in trees

421
00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:51.690
and look you're just gone and all that mount up becomes slagging pollutes rivers

422
00:36:52.351 --> 00:36:54.360
and acidifying rivers and does horrible things.

423
00:36:54.810 --> 00:36:57.150
You have this ugly scarred up land.

424
00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:02.460
So technology does that but also improvement of technology brings with the

425
00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:03.360
mining of copper.

426
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:08.780
So when you replace copper wires with fiber optics they're made of glass and

427
00:37:10.201 --> 00:37:15.201
glass is made from sand and the harvesting of sand doesn't do an awful lot of

428
00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:20.310
environmental destruction so that's an improvement in the environment.

429
00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:22.440
And there's a number of examples

430
00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:25.793
of that.

431
00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:31.460
And again you have to ask how cars are current push now to make cars that use

432
00:37:32.161 --> 00:37:37.161
less gas so that the good that it does use it gets you how many to drive a mile

433
00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:42.500
you use less gas not enormously less but but somewhat less so technology can

434
00:37:44.551 --> 00:37:46.830
help you.
And again the standard questions.

435
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:52.350
Has our improvement technology over the last 20 30 40 50 years whatever time

436
00:37:52.351 --> 00:37:56.130
window you want or deal with has this allowed us to do more environmental

437
00:37:56.131 --> 00:38:00.900
destruction of of the earth or have we used enough a biggest a big enough

438
00:38:00.901 --> 00:38:05.901
fraction of it to improve the environment ah ah ah efficiency of use of the

439
00:38:06.151 --> 00:38:08.950
environment that the things have gotten better.

440
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.900
<v 3>And the answer is there's no question about what's happened</v>

441
00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:19.700
because you see in this again this is more CO2 stuff that here is the sources of

442
00:38:20.851 --> 00:38:25.320
CO2 addition into the air which is a very good index of what's happening the

443
00:38:25.321 --> 00:38:30.321
total economy and what you see is the land the land use so land adds into the

444
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:34.590
CO2 by

445
00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:42.360
where know deforestation and using wood for timber and everything.

446
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:49.550
<v 8>So the amount the land use the changes in land use has not enormously changed</v>

447
00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.370
the width of that line is more or less the same over time.

448
00:38:53.730 --> 00:38:57.570
So the change in land use is putting about the same amount of carbon into the

449
00:38:57.571 --> 00:38:59.230
air as before.

450
00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.520
There's a little bit of other emissions which we don't have to worry about but

451
00:39:02.521 --> 00:39:06.420
fossil fuel combustion has just gone up up up up.

452
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:11.000
<v 9>So whatever the balance of our affluence and our technology whatever the balance</v>

453
00:39:11.290 --> 00:39:15.210
but we can see that as the balance of our use between using it to ameliorate the

454
00:39:15.211 --> 00:39:20.211
environment versus messing up the environment OK we'll come back to the slide if

455
00:39:23.401 --> 00:39:26.280
we have a chance.

456
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:33.783
The.

457
00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:39.240
In terms of the efficiency that first factor the well not the first factor the

458
00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:45.440
the dollars per carbon use that is here actually the carbon use per dollar is

459
00:39:47.201 --> 00:39:52.201
quite interesting that it has been coming down from 1970 it was about a third of

460
00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:57.940
a kilogram of carbon per dollar and that's come down to now something like a

461
00:39:57.941 --> 00:39:58.774
quarter.

462
00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:03.430
<v 8>Of a kilogram per dollar spent.
And that's just carbon.</v>

463
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.340
So you multiply that likes by almost 4 2.

464
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.630
If you want to measure in CO2 because carbon is about one quarter of each CO2

465
00:40:10.631 --> 00:40:11.380
molecule.

466
00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:16.150
So it's basically we know for each dollar spent we

467
00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.990
put out two pounds a kilogram of carbon.

468
00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:24.340
So every time you go and buy something just you give them a dollar and say

469
00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:28.750
that's two pounds of carbon coming into carbon dioxide I'm putting into the

470
00:40:28.751 --> 00:40:32.890
atmosphere it's it's a not crazy way of thinking about things.

471
00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:39.100
So what is worrying people now is that this has been a pretty good decline but

472
00:40:39.101 --> 00:40:43.540
actually this is now turning out to be more significant than people thought the

473
00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:44.890
rate of decline here.

474
00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:49.960
That's declining efficiency of use of carbon was about one point three percent a

475
00:40:49.961 --> 00:40:54.520
year.
It's no longer declining and this seems to have have continued.

476
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:59.770
<v 4>It's now going up by three point three percent three tenths of a percent a year.</v>

477
00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:05.010
So it looks like the that we've we've picked the easy apples the easy the low

478
00:41:05.471 --> 00:41:10.060
hanging fruit as they say in improving our carbon efficiency and now we may be

479
00:41:10.061 --> 00:41:12.000
getting worse again

480
00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:15.443
OK.

481
00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:21.020
<v 5>So all of that is about how to think.</v>

482
00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:27.360
Well now one of the one of the ways of putting in a quantitative view of the

483
00:41:28.111 --> 00:41:32.100
relationship between population and the environmental impact.

484
00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:39.900
So there's many many other considerations the relationship between population

485
00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:41.093
and impact.

486
00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:46.490
One is the expansion of humans into almost every habitat on Earth.

487
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:50.250
There's almost no no limit to this.

488
00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:55.700
So I'll show you some limiting some extreme cases of this.

489
00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:59.760
Now what's going on it's something that Malta's talked about.

490
00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:04.830
Remember we described what Malta said living in England just about eighteen

491
00:42:04.831 --> 00:42:09.030
hundred and.
The population was increasing.

492
00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.700
And what did they do.

493
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:15.150
So they were farmland the best farmland was already farmed.

494
00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:20.510
But as there were more farmers the farmers had to move on to more marginal land

495
00:42:21.400 --> 00:42:23.140
less good land.

496
00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:28.590
And what he was thinking was that there's a law of diminishing returns that you

497
00:42:29.261 --> 00:42:32.860
have farmers on good land they're producing so much performer and it's fairly

498
00:42:32.861 --> 00:42:37.230
good England was not a very poor place as population increases.

499
00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:42.260
They have to move on to drier land swap your land Hillier land and the the

500
00:42:44.201 --> 00:42:48.430
production per farmer for these new farmers is less than those that had the best

501
00:42:48.431 --> 00:42:51.610
land.
So while the total production grows.

502
00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:55.550
And remember Malta showed a linear rise in total production.

503
00:42:55.640 --> 00:43:00.640
Now with new people total production grows but population is growing like this

504
00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:04.900
since each new person produces less than an old person.

505
00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:09.700
He has to farm on worst land then that then the earlier farmers the average

506
00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:11.890
productivity goes down.

507
00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.300
And that is the thing that has happened all through history that of course

508
00:43:16.301 --> 00:43:20.900
humans when they have a choice of land when there's not crowd or when nobody

509
00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.000
else's is standing around they choose the best land the easiest to get along

510
00:43:26.321 --> 00:43:28.870
with to get to survive in.

511
00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:35.310
But then what happens is people move out into less good land.

512
00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:43.770
The pictures I'm going to show you are from Niger which is in SA hell just south

513
00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:48.830
of the Sahara Desert it actually sticks up into this horrid desert.

514
00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:54.420
And this is a province of Niger called Isaac and it's a huge province because

515
00:43:56.561 --> 00:44:00.580
there's not many people there.
It's a big thing right on the edge of the Sahara.

516
00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:03.640
The population is fifty thousand people.

517
00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:10.020
And in the dry season they have two wells in the hole for that whole huge

518
00:44:11.111 --> 00:44:12.030
territory for that hole.

519
00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:16.990
All those 50000 people there are only two wells and only one of them works works

520
00:44:16.991 --> 00:44:19.870
regularly during the rainy season.

521
00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:23.050
Think this and this is what it looks like in that country.

522
00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:27.890
They have you can see there's there's there's no no no water nothing nothing

523
00:44:27.891 --> 00:44:28.740
would grow on the ground.

524
00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:34.000
Some of the trees that can survive grass doesn't survive this it's too small and

525
00:44:34.001 --> 00:44:35.350
when it loses water it's gone.

526
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:39.850
Trees can store water basically and survive fairly long periods of drought to

527
00:44:39.851 --> 00:44:44.851
get some what's called scrub since scrub forest in the wet season.

528
00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:49.540
They're very joyous.
They have lots of water

529
00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:53.170
they think lots of water.

530
00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:58.240
<v 13>But this is the amount of water that they have and the people use it for all</v>

531
00:44:58.241 --> 00:45:02.000
their their functions.
The animals I know you can see an animal back here.

532
00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:07.020
<v 5>The animals use it to drink and relieve themselves and here's girls washing in</v>

533
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:10.023
this water.

534
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:14.320
And this this is in the good time of the year.

535
00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.680
This is this is the water that they have to survive on

536
00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:21.260
the dry season is nine months long.

537
00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:25.030
<v 14>You have some rain not a lot but some rain for three months.</v>

538
00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:30.600
Then the dry season is nine months long and then late this is the labor value of

539
00:45:33.491 --> 00:45:34.324
children.

540
00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:39.480
These young girls must travel 35 miles to one of the two wells that are

541
00:45:40.631 --> 00:45:43.780
available.
That's the average depending on where they live that they go.

542
00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:46.400
They have to walk.
No no mechanized transport.

543
00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:50.500
They walk 35 miles and they can carry back only enough water.

544
00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:53.770
So their families can drink one glass a day.

545
00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:58.720
Remember we used to be told it's now shown to be not really scientific.

546
00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.640
Drink eight glasses of water every day.

547
00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:05.170
<v 5>They're living on one ace one eighth of that amount of water</v>

548
00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:11.380
so you have to ask yourselves why do people live in such a God forsaken place.

549
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.730
You know this life is so hard and so miserable.
And what's the answer.

550
00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:19.800
The better places have somebody in them.
Already.

551
00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:25.000
So the story if you can do these sort of anthropological history is virtually

552
00:46:25.001 --> 00:46:30.001
always that this time at one point lived in some much nicer place.

553
00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:35.470
But some tribe got more populous got stronger in one way or another was more

554
00:46:35.471 --> 00:46:40.471
vicious and they got pushed out of what was their original Aboriginal fairly

555
00:46:41.051 --> 00:46:45.760
decent land onto more marginal land.

556
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:50.050
And so while they may have been living there now for hundreds of years in a

557
00:46:50.051 --> 00:46:54.160
sense it's not their own choice to live on such a miserable part

558
00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:56.543
of the world.

559
00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:03.370
<v 13>When you read and I think in the war before civilization I gave you some</v>

560
00:47:03.371 --> 00:47:08.020
readings in this book which calculated all the violence it described some people

561
00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:12.580
some peoples that had been pushed out into these marginal lands by stronger

562
00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:17.650
peoples it gives you a number of examples of that.
And of course the big example.

563
00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:22.730
But big modern example is in America that the European settlers pushed the

564
00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:28.330
American Indians the Native Americans into horrible lands.

565
00:47:28.890 --> 00:47:33.880
The stories of pushing the Cherokees from nice farmland nice productive land and

566
00:47:33.881 --> 00:47:38.881
say North Carolina and putting them to Oklahoma which is half drive or or the

567
00:47:39.041 --> 00:47:42.130
Apaches various Indians pushed them off into the desert.

568
00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:47.350
So you go see how miserably a lot of the the American Indians now live in the

569
00:47:47.351 --> 00:47:48.430
Navajo reservations.

570
00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:51.340
<v 5>And so friends say Oh my God why do they want to live there.</v>

571
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:55.910
And they didn't they didn't want to live there.
They weren't given a choice.

572
00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:58.180
They were pushed pushed out

573
00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:04.360
so it and we're talking about dryness which is one of the things that people

574
00:48:04.361 --> 00:48:07.090
just happen we can't exist without water.
So this is really

575
00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:13.030
the border of existence but where it's very wet you remember you read in

576
00:48:13.031 --> 00:48:18.031
Bangladesh that people living on the mudflats and the monsoon come season comes

577
00:48:18.341 --> 00:48:21.700
in the water rises or a flood comes and they're just washed out.

578
00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.520
Those people didn't choose to live there.
There's no a land anywhere else.

579
00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:28.750
So they they do whatever they can.

580
00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:33.400
The Eskimos that live up on the polar ice cap there's some Eskimos that are

581
00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:39.060
constant apparently constantly on the ice ice cap and don't have a base on land.

582
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:46.980
So when we think of people living in these very marginal circumstances one

583
00:48:50.321 --> 00:48:51.490
attributes I mean this famines.

584
00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:55.780
The people live in this region have famines every so often there's great drought

585
00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:59.630
as you know right now parts of Africa have had terrible drought.

586
00:48:59.650 --> 00:49:02.260
California has a terrible drought.

587
00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.740
The Colorado River basin is having drought.

588
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:11.190
So when this happens it's always when then the people get into great trouble and

589
00:49:11.661 --> 00:49:16.490
they can easily starve to death and some advanced country may or may not send

590
00:49:16.491 --> 00:49:19.790
them food and sending them food has its own problems.

591
00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:26.890
But it's always attributed to environmental variability to climatic troubles and

592
00:49:28.221 --> 00:49:33.110
no one ever asked the question why have these been people been pushed into this

593
00:49:33.111 --> 00:49:34.700
incredibly inhospitable region.

594
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:39.830
I mean part of the ecology of that region is you're going to have droughts every

595
00:49:39.831 --> 00:49:43.580
so often and sometimes going to last for years and be very severe in

596
00:49:43.581 --> 00:49:47.720
California's has the drought in California has now lasted for years.

597
00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:52.633
So

598
00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:58.530
everything in the environment the regime the population environment is circular

599
00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:02.520
that people affect the environment then the environment comes and bites them

600
00:50:02.521 --> 00:50:05.590
back if it comes back to them.

601
00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:11.590
And water is one of the is one of the key things and probably what will give out

602
00:50:14.691 --> 00:50:17.600
first when we really reach environmental limit.

603
00:50:17.630 --> 00:50:22.370
It will almost certainly be fresh fresh water in a lot of information that you

604
00:50:22.371 --> 00:50:26.210
can get on this very easily it's it's not secret at all.

605
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:32.140
There's two sources of water that humans can use which is freshwater you can

606
00:50:33.231 --> 00:50:36.820
desalinate salt water but the energy costs are enormous.

607
00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:41.880
So it's not unless you're an Arab sitting on an oil well you really can't do it

608
00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:43.700
any reasonable way.

609
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:49.030
So this renewable water which is rainwater that when it rains that is renewable

610
00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:52.970
there's a cycle of it goes up into the atmosphere and comes back down as rain.

611
00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:57.080
So you have renewable water coming eventually into rivers and in one way or

612
00:50:57.081 --> 00:51:01.010
another you tap the rivers and then there's mined water.

613
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:06.170
When you do mine it just like you mined coal you dig down and you suck up the

614
00:51:06.171 --> 00:51:11.171
water and the greatest productivity of a lot of the the farm regions of the

615
00:51:13.971 --> 00:51:16.160
world is comes from mined water.

616
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:21.430
So the big the Midwest of the U.S. especially as you get further west it is not

617
00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:23.210
have enough rainfall.

618
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:28.480
So they use mined water and you probably have heard that the reason they can use

619
00:51:30.561 --> 00:51:35.150
mined water is that underlying our Midwest is what's called the Ogallala Aquifer

620
00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:39.590
Ogallala is a name of one of the Indian groups that used to live there the

621
00:51:39.591 --> 00:51:44.591
Ogallala aquifer and the farmers all over the West they're just sink down a tube

622
00:51:45.371 --> 00:51:48.290
and and suck up the water.

623
00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Well you have to think of you know being as scientists always want to know how

624
00:51:55.791 --> 00:51:57.620
why where all this kind of stuff.

625
00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:03.010
And since a kid you read about you know artesian wells and wells under water and

626
00:52:03.081 --> 00:52:06.020
then eventually ask yourself how does water get into rock.

627
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:11.750
And the reason it that way is it drips in there.

628
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:17.330
And the Ogallala Aquifer actually filled from the melt off of the last ice age

629
00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:21.740
prior to the peak of the last ice age was about eighteen thousand years ago.

630
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:25.720
And then it took about eight thousand years to melt till something like 10000

631
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:26.350
years ago.

632
00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:31.310
It was very approximate numbers but for eight thousand years ice was melting the

633
00:52:31.311 --> 00:52:34.310
water of the ground was soggy and drip drip drip.

634
00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:39.500
Rock is never totally solid and is always somewhere some little crack in the

635
00:52:39.501 --> 00:52:44.501
water slowly drips through the cracks and goes in in any kind of you know when

636
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:49.160
the rocks get folded there's there's caverns in there and any kind of space

637
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:51.380
eventually water will find its way.

638
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:55.730
Japan if you've ever paid attention to the roof on your house you know the water

639
00:52:55.731 --> 00:52:58.640
gets in no matter what what you do.

640
00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:04.250
So it's it's the filling of these aquifers is I don't know.

641
00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:08.480
I can't when that ice age started but something and it took eight thousand years

642
00:53:08.481 --> 00:53:11.810
to fill but that depended on a glacier which was there for the previous ten

643
00:53:11.811 --> 00:53:12.644
thousand years.

644
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:17.800
So we're talking about a resource that is one of the shorter term resources and

645
00:53:18.681 --> 00:53:21.560
it's something like it fills in thousand years.

646
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:27.170
Now we're sucking it up in decades and it's very much

647
00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:31.160
going going way down.

648
00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:35.090
And there were some slides that the reason I was a little late I could not find

649
00:53:35.091 --> 00:53:38.340
the slides this morning I had them yesterday and I don't know where they went.

650
00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:43.360
So I didn't put them on but they showed some interesting kinds of things that

651
00:53:44.691 --> 00:53:49.691
when you're sitting on top of this aquifer you've got the rock and the water is

652
00:53:49.731 --> 00:53:53.840
there Water's in compressed bowl so it holds up the rock you suck out the water.

653
00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:55.220
There's now a space there.

654
00:53:55.590 --> 00:53:58.610
And what happens the rock starts crumbling and falling down.

655
00:53:58.910 --> 00:54:03.910
What happens is the land actually falls and the pictures that I that I could not

656
00:54:04.191 --> 00:54:09.170
find show first from Houston Texas a farm there.

657
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:14.200
And it's shows you a pump just a concrete platform with a pump and you know

658
00:54:14.661 --> 00:54:15.800
where the land was.

659
00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:21.100
And then the land is several feet beneath that the land is just shrunken has

660
00:54:22.611 --> 00:54:23.444
collapsed.

661
00:54:24.170 --> 00:54:28.670
And the second picture I want to show is Galveston Texas not so far from
Houston.

662
00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:34.240
Now the land has has fallen again all due to irrigation but they're near the

663
00:54:34.341 --> 00:54:34.970
sea.

664
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:39.410
So the saltwater has come in and now what used to be good agricultural land is

665
00:54:39.411 --> 00:54:43.100
now flooded with a Gulf of Mexico from that region.

666
00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.500
You're shaking your head.

667
00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:50.830
Maybe she knows but the most impressive picture comes from the San Joaquin

668
00:54:51.321 --> 00:54:53.240
Valley of California.

669
00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.820
Now you have problem that's where all our fruits and vegetables come from that's

670
00:54:58.821 --> 00:55:03.170
that's the huge source of American food supply and probably almost all of you

671
00:55:03.171 --> 00:55:07.690
today have already today eaten something that was farmed and locking anybody

672
00:55:07.691 --> 00:55:11.410
from that part.
No.
Nobody nobody from.
We don't have to.

673
00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.310
We don't have enough farmers at all.

674
00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:18.520
Well this is a picture of a poll that they put in to measure the drop of the

675
00:55:18.521 --> 00:55:19.354
land.

676
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:24.010
What you see is this very large poll and a man man is sort of down here and.

677
00:55:24.450 --> 00:55:29.450
And what the poll is is the top of the polls where the land was in I can't here

678
00:55:30.190 --> 00:55:34.540
like nineteen fifty seven or something like that.

679
00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:39.900
And the land has dropped 30 feet in that time and the man is now you know five

680
00:55:40.001 --> 00:55:44.980
and a half foot man or six foot man is a small fraction of this but it's really

681
00:55:44.981 --> 00:55:46.810
a shocking kind of photo.

682
00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:50.860
And of course the agricultural activity in the valleys of California has only

683
00:55:50.861 --> 00:55:51.770
increased since then.

684
00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:56.650
The amount of water pump has increased and the land keeps falling at a very

685
00:55:56.651 --> 00:56:00.340
noticeable rate.
So it's very graphic

686
00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:02.923
thing.

687
00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:08.310
So now from when you suck out the water it takes quite a while for the for these

688
00:56:09.481 --> 00:56:13.930
the rock to sort of collapse and fall down because it's got some structural

689
00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:14.913
strength to it.

690
00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:20.230
So if you can see that how much the land has fallen you can just imagine how

691
00:56:20.231 --> 00:56:25.231
much the water table itself has held many times more than the actual land has

692
00:56:25.721 --> 00:56:30.040
fallen.
And in some places you can measure this fairly readily.

693
00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:35.640
So in parts of Texas and Arizona water tables have dropped hundreds of feet even

694
00:56:37.091 --> 00:56:38.590
in northwest of Chicago.

695
00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:43.920
There's been 200 to 300 foot drop in the water table just sucking it out three

696
00:56:46.091 --> 00:56:50.980
quarters of Texas is irrigated area.
Water tables are falling.

697
00:56:51.730 --> 00:56:52.960
And this is true all over the world.

698
00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:56.410
I mean not states is very technological so we do a lot of drilling.

699
00:56:56.830 --> 00:57:01.830
But the North China Plain which is again where the wheat in China is grown drops

700
00:57:02.831 --> 00:57:05.110
40 inches every year.

701
00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:10.740
Tamil Nadu in India southern India another very productive part of a 100 inches

702
00:57:11.231 --> 00:57:15.190
a year.
The the the water tables are are falling.

703
00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:21.900
The there's just just a study that that that just came out this in February

704
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:29.440
which measures the groundwater levels that are coming under the water coming out

705
00:57:29.441 --> 00:57:30.274
the Himalayas.

706
00:57:30.490 --> 00:57:35.490
So the Himalayas as you know sit right in the center of Asia and the yellow

707
00:57:36.851 --> 00:57:40.430
river and the Yangtze River sort of feed China.

708
00:57:40.930 --> 00:57:45.930
And you have the Helmand River feeds Afghanistan the Indus River feeds Pakistan

709
00:57:47.141 --> 00:57:49.180
and the Ganges River feeds North China.

710
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:54.490
And you've got the Ganges goes into Bangladesh.

711
00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:59.520
The problem the Petra of the Magna all feed Bangladesh area then you have the

712
00:58:00.041 --> 00:58:05.041
Mekong and the slowing and the Irrawaddy which do Vietnam and Thailand and

713
00:58:06.491 --> 00:58:08.290
Cambodia and Burma.

714
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:13.950
So all of these come out of the Himalayan Mountains in what's happening the

715
00:58:16.121 --> 00:58:21.121
groundwater in these regions is going down two to four metres a year.

716
00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:26.550
So that's six to 12 13 feet every year.

717
00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:32.160
<v 14>The water table goes down Venice is sinking for similar reasons that this much</v>

718
00:58:34.751 --> 00:58:39.610
smaller only nine inches in the whole century Bangkok is thinking 13 centimeters

719
00:58:39.611 --> 00:58:43.810
a year.
Mexico City.
Down to I hope I have those slides here.

720
00:58:44.620 --> 00:58:45.453
No.

721
00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:47.533
<v 6>Forget it.</v>

722
00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:54.550
<v 5>Mexico City is sinking and in a drastic way and there's a sense of so prominent.</v>

723
00:58:56.630 --> 00:59:00.620
There's very good data from Mexico City so Mexico City put in a subway.

724
00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:02.420
We have wonderful subway.

725
00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:07.550
If you had a young lady with me when I was in the subway and such getting

726
00:59:07.551 --> 00:59:12.380
squeezed you get groped in the Mexico City subway.
But they laid it flat.

727
00:59:13.070 --> 00:59:18.070
But now with the with the ground the sucking out the water the ground is sinking

728
00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:19.430
and it doesn't sink evenly.

729
00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:24.580
So now that the subway is like this and some of it that was underground is now

730
00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:30.580
aboveground because the ground is just sunken away from from the subway

731
00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:36.260
the sewers and the water supply have exactly the same problem.

732
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:40.070
<v 14>Oh
water pipe in Mexico City.</v>

733
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:46.030
The city itself has sunk 30 feet from from when this was the subways really

734
00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:52.060
originally put down water pipe that was like laying flat on the ground in 1934

735
00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:54.980
is now 26 feet over everyone's head

736
00:59:56.800 --> 01:00:00.320
in some suburbs are sinking about two feet.
Every year.

737
01:00:09.090 --> 01:00:13.280
<v 5>Because it's all it's uneven and I don't really know the answer to that it's</v>

738
01:00:13.281 --> 01:00:16.160
getting why doesn't everything sort of just sink evenly it just doesn't happen.

739
01:00:16.340 --> 01:00:18.560
<v 15>So a flat subway ends up like this</v>

740
01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:24.810
yeah I do.

741
01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:28.560
<v 14>I don't know how they arrange that Paul.
You think everything would sink.
Yes.</v>

742
01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.590
I don't know.
They may I don't know.
I just don't know the answer.

743
01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:38.270
In Mexico City the water supply as more water is pumped.

744
01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:43.420
Of course to the city the rate of pumping is facets of the city sinks faster and

745
01:00:44.610 --> 01:00:47.130
there's the pipes eventually get twisted.
They rupture.

746
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:52.430
There's now 40000 repaired ruptures that they repair each year and many more

747
01:00:53.581 --> 01:00:57.540
that they that they they are not even reported and they don't get around to

748
01:00:57.541 --> 01:00:58.374
repairing them.

749
01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:03.650
And apparently one third of the water in the system leaks out and a lot of the

750
01:01:04.471 --> 01:01:07.070
city lies below the sewer lines now.

751
01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:12.590
So the sewage doesn't leave the city anymore collects in pools and they have now

752
01:01:13.711 --> 01:01:18.690
had to construct vast pumping stations to pump it out the sewage back out from

753
01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:21.930
from these pools.
They have

754
01:01:23.740 --> 01:01:25.930
they're building a whole new much deeper sewage system.

755
01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:28.870
They're building a hundred twenty four miles of 80 foot sewers.

756
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:33.670
<v 16>Okay.
That's enough.
I think you get</v>

757
01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:36.700
the message here.

758
01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:42.160
<v 4>When they have a few more minutes so I put in your reading and just something</v>

759
01:01:43.181 --> 01:01:46.450
that you may think well why did you put that in is how much is being paid for

760
01:01:46.451 --> 01:01:49.060
caviar and fission and things like that.

761
01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:53.500
And it is part of a longer piece that I'm not going to have time to talk about.

762
01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:58.540
But there's a lot of fish in the sea but a lot of lot of people that want to eat

763
01:01:58.541 --> 01:01:59.374
fish.

764
01:01:59.380 --> 01:02:04.210
So fishing is one of those industries that's really just cleaning out the sea of

765
01:02:04.211 --> 01:02:08.680
fish when there were small boats.
Things are OK.

766
01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:13.740
The fish could regenerate but now Korea and East Germany and Japan have these

767
01:02:15.101 --> 01:02:19.540
huge huge ships that have Miles their nets or miles and miles long and they just

768
01:02:19.541 --> 01:02:24.230
suck everything out of the sea so the fish are disappearing.

769
01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:29.880
And you'd think that economically that as the fish disappear.

770
01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:36.540
And even when they can't reproduce themselves it would get the uneconomical to

771
01:02:37.211 --> 01:02:39.780
catch the fish anymore.

772
01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:42.910
<v 3>But in actual fact what happens is that</v>

773
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:48.640
in the fishing there's there's presumably good fish that people like to eat.

774
01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:53.590
And what happens is as those get fished out you go down to the next level of

775
01:02:53.591 --> 01:02:57.890
fish and if you go into restaurants while you see this every couple of years

776
01:02:57.891 --> 01:03:00.730
there's some new fish on the menu that I've never heard of.

777
01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.220
Have you had had that experience.

778
01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:07.330
And that's because the fish that you eat 2 3 years ago are now gone because

779
01:03:07.331 --> 01:03:10.150
they've been fished out.
So the quality of the fish goes down and down.

780
01:03:10.990 --> 01:03:15.990
But that is people if people have money they still want to buy the better

781
01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:17.350
quality fish.

782
01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:22.560
And it turns out they will pay almost anything for this the better quality fish.

783
01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:29.220
<v 5>And so what happens is that instead of the economics working for you that as it</v>

784
01:03:29.351 --> 01:03:32.560
gets more expensive to catch fish you led off on the fish.

785
01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:37.810
The price of the fish goes up.
So it's still worthwhile to catch those fish.

786
01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.770
And what happens then that the because of that economics the pressure to catch

787
01:03:41.771 --> 01:03:45.310
these fish to extinction keep keeps up there.

788
01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:49.480
And some of the outrageous prices that I that I gave you.

789
01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:53.260
That's the point of of that kind of stuff.

790
01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:55.870
OK.

791
01:03:55.870 --> 01:04:00.870
So what you should realize is that environmental destruction is essential.

792
01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.940
Most of it is a lot of it is irreversible loss of species is irreversible.

793
01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:08.860
And if you want to wait a hundred million years yes some species will

794
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:13.150
differentiate you'll get new species but that's basically reversible so things

795
01:04:13.151 --> 01:04:18.151
like fishing out various species in the sea so that they don't recover is an

796
01:04:18.941 --> 01:04:23.941
irreversible kind of thing loss of habitat is generally irreversible.

797
01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:29.590
Then I think I described you northeast of Brazil where or all of Brazil of any

798
01:04:29.591 --> 01:04:34.030
jungle region where the whole ecosystem is kept going by the matter of fungi

799
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:38.560
that recycle the nutrients in in the jungle.

800
01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:43.300
When you cut down the trees the sun beats down kills the fungi you no longer

801
01:04:43.301 --> 01:04:47.110
have this map of fungi.
So now something falls into it.

802
01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:51.070
It doesn't get decomposed the nutrients don't go back into the trees and the

803
01:04:51.071 --> 01:04:55.720
whole land dries out and becomes what they call ladder right which is hard soil

804
01:04:56.050 --> 01:05:01.050
hard like like rock soil and it's not clear that that ever ever can recover fish

805
01:05:04.961 --> 01:05:05.794
stocks.

806
01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:11.410
They the cod stocks decline like 20 30 years ago and they really have not come

807
01:05:11.801 --> 01:05:15.070
back even though they've really cut down the fishing and banned it mostly.

808
01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.470
They're not they're not coming back.

809
01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:22.330
This apparently too small of a population for the reproduction system

810
01:05:24.010 --> 01:05:24.880
to work well

811
01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.960
because this is irreversible because this is very important point because

812
01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:36.220
environmental damage is irreversible as population increases as the world

813
01:05:36.221 --> 01:05:39.220
economy increases the pressure on the environment gets worse and worse.

814
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:44.910
You can imagine a nice scenario where eventually population comes down and maybe

815
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:46.840
some of the pressure is let off.

816
01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:50.740
But what you have to worry about is that peak because the things that are going

817
01:05:50.741 --> 01:05:55.690
to disappear irreversibly your species your habitat your so forth depend not on

818
01:05:55.691 --> 01:06:00.260
the level now but on the maximum demand that once the maximum once.

819
01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:02.620
And if the maxim down comes off it's OK.

820
01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:07.860
So what we have to worry about is this peak issue of population and other

821
01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:11.950
demands on the environment.

822
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:16.630
And it's this peak issue that becomes important.

823
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:20.470
We've seen the great range of variability and the U.N.

824
01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:25.830
projections we could reach a peak at a billion more people or 2 billion or 3 or

825
01:06:26.421 --> 01:06:31.421
4 or 5 or 6 or 7 8 or 12 or so who knows how many more billions and which of

826
01:06:32.061 --> 01:06:37.010
those curves happens is not gonna be a random event it depends on what humans do

827
01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:38.053
right now.

828
01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:43.600
And because of momentum the people that are born now are going to have children

829
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:49.510
and they're there they're a cumulative factor in the environment.

830
01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:54.970
So whatever the birth rate now is whatever the population growth rate is now if

831
01:06:55.071 --> 01:06:59.240
that eventually stops is the momentum for another 100 or 150 years and I showed

832
01:06:59.241 --> 01:07:03.260
you the data from various countries showing that even after they reach

833
01:07:03.261 --> 01:07:08.261
replacement level fertility their population grows for another 100 years or so

834
01:07:08.271 --> 01:07:08.960
forth.

835
01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:13.960
So again what we do now determines the maximum environmental destruction that's

836
01:07:14.570 --> 01:07:15.500
that's going on.

837
01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:20.720
And I think one of the most important points is that environmental solutions are

838
01:07:20.721 --> 01:07:21.554
difficult.

839
01:07:21.630 --> 01:07:26.280
It is not an easy job to fix the environment like global warming.

840
01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:29.720
There's huge arguments whether we should try to prevent it or should we just try

841
01:07:29.721 --> 01:07:32.810
to adapt it.
And I think half your course is in the forestry school.

842
01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:36.680
Ah no it's better to let it happen and it's going to be cheaper to adapt to it.

843
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:38.820
And the other half of the courses thing it's a horrible thing.

844
01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:43.840
We've got to try to prevent it and mostly like using solar power wind power the

845
01:07:45.051 --> 01:07:49.400
costs of nuclear power even the costs are so very high that with current

846
01:07:49.401 --> 01:07:54.050
technology the alternatives are not really not feasible.

847
01:07:54.290 --> 01:07:57.170
So what's happening is China is building a new coal plant every week.

848
01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:00.620
They're just they're not they would love to reduce their pollution they've done

849
01:08:00.621 --> 01:08:04.490
whatever they can but they have their population still growing that huge poor

850
01:08:04.491 --> 01:08:06.740
population.
They need the energy.

851
01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.560
They have no choice now but to build power plants.

852
01:08:09.590 --> 01:08:12.650
And what do you tell the Chinese to know your people should should keep being

853
01:08:12.651 --> 01:08:15.680
poor don't build the coal power plants.

854
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:19.310
Well we don't say that and they're not going to do it anyway because their

855
01:08:19.311 --> 01:08:22.580
people demand some decent standard of living which requires energy.

856
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:25.700
So look CO2 in the air goes crazy.

857
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:31.960
So if there are no easy fixes for the environment from from that kind of side

858
01:08:34.071 --> 01:08:36.440
it's a really very hard job.

859
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:43.150
<v 4>The only success that one can really claim in the last say 50 years for what you</v>

860
01:08:44.541 --> 01:08:48.140
might call the environmental movement is the population is on the population

861
01:08:48.141 --> 01:08:48.974
front.

862
01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.040
You've seen I've shown you many many times that in around the Third World store

863
01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:58.280
up till 1950 1960 the birth rate was 6 7 8

864
01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:01.790
people per children per woman.

865
01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:05.710
And now it's dropped to below half that in fact about 2.8.

866
01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:10.750
So it's something like less than a half of that often enormous progress in that

867
01:09:12.230 --> 01:09:13.063
area.

868
01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:18.170
I've shown you again in many different ways that people want fewer children than

869
01:09:18.171 --> 01:09:22.280
every country every developing country of the world that you ask how many they

870
01:09:22.281 --> 01:09:26.330
want you ask you find out how many they have that in every country the number

871
01:09:26.331 --> 01:09:30.470
that they're having is above what they want and massive affects us like Bolivia

872
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:35.090
which is not one of your most advanced countries and universally around world 70

873
01:09:35.091 --> 01:09:38.150
80 percent of the women want to not have children.

874
01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:41.530
70 percent just totally don't want another 10 percent.

875
01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:44.180
Well not in the next two years.

876
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:49.570
So the technology we have condoms are not wonderful.

877
01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:51.030
Birth control pills are not wonderful.

878
01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:55.010
It's not wonderful but it's it's good enough to do the job.

879
01:09:55.430 --> 01:10:00.430
So population is is is the rare issue where a lot has been done and a lot can be

880
01:10:02.121 --> 01:10:02.780
done.

881
01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:06.200
We don't have to win the hearts and minds of the people they're ready telling us

882
01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:10.010
they want fewer children than they're having.
We don't need new technology.

883
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:14.150
It's dirt cheap compared to the compared to like getting rid of carbon in the

884
01:10:14.151 --> 01:10:18.710
atmosphere or reducing its but dirt cheap in a cycle of pills on the world

885
01:10:18.711 --> 01:10:21.770
market is 80 cents a diaphragm is a buck and a quarter.

886
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:27.170
I mean we're talking dirt cheap and the medical knowledge to provide these

887
01:10:27.171 --> 01:10:30.620
things is almost at the Barefoot Doctor level so you don't need very highly

888
01:10:30.621 --> 01:10:35.120
trained personnel and as I mentioned to labor and even educated labor in their

889
01:10:35.121 --> 01:10:38.990
developing countries is cheap.
So

890
01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:46.120
so so of all the possible things one can do to improve the environmental

891
01:10:46.341 --> 01:10:51.341
situation looks to me like encouraging the continued decline of fertility is is

892
01:10:53.031 --> 01:10:54.710
the is the easiest thing.

893
01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:59.450
<v 11>You don't have to spend a lot of money.
Most of the people in the world will be.</v>

894
01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.550
Yeah.
Rah rah.
I want that.

895
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:06.620
And and we've seen from Ryerson lecture here that with a very little bit I mean

896
01:11:06.650 --> 01:11:11.650
he puts on one soap opera you know which runs four to three times a week for

897
01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:16.550
like a year which is significant but very small intervention and very cheap.

898
01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:20.430
<v 5>And the number of people going to family planning clinic doubles and triples and</v>

899
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:24.660
in just incredible amount of progress with a very small input.

900
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:28.600
So this is very very doable thing.
And we have a long way to go.

901
01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:33.670
The fertility as I've said has come down from six seven eight to two point six

902
01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:38.760
as a global average but two point six is still a 30 percent increase every

903
01:11:38.801 --> 01:11:39.634
generation.

904
01:11:39.850 --> 01:11:44.850
So population growth under showed you is about a billion people every 13 years

905
01:11:45.761 --> 01:11:48.670
now.
And it's still very high.

906
01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:53.880
Bringing it down further is probably the only feasible reasonable realistic

907
01:11:54.881 --> 01:11:59.881
thing that one can do to two massive I mean but the environment is going to hell

908
01:12:00.431 --> 01:12:03.080
in such a massive rate.
We need some massive change.

909
01:12:03.370 --> 01:12:08.080
And I don't think anything else comes close to what you can do with population.

910
01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:14.810
I challenge environmentalists all the time and say look every 13 years is

911
01:12:15.221 --> 01:12:18.520
another billion people add up all the environmental

912
01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:23.770
environment all the conservation that environmentalists have ever done or the

913
01:12:23.771 --> 01:12:28.771
restoration at that I compare that to a footprint of a billion people in 13

914
01:12:29.021 --> 01:12:32.890
years.
It's not in the same year just not in the same ballpark.

915
01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:36.700
And yet that message doesn't doesn't get through.

916
01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:42.670
There's a wonderful quote and this is maybe the cameras don't even want it that

917
01:12:43.710 --> 01:12:47.740
the Peter Beard who's one of the most famous conservation writers in Africa and

918
01:12:47.741 --> 01:12:51.340
he's very outspoken and does not use polite language all the time.

919
01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:53.050
This is a quote from him.

920
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:57.370
<v 17>I broke my ass to do these conscientious books he did all kinds of books on the</v>

921
01:12:57.371 --> 01:13:01.750
environment in Africa but the public is not getting it at all.

922
01:13:02.230 --> 01:13:07.230
You showed them photographs of 30000 carcasses with the ivory tusks still in

923
01:13:07.631 --> 01:13:08.140
place.

924
01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:12.550
That's eleven thirty thousand ivory elephants and the tusks are still in place

925
01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:16.570
and they tried to tell you that we should prosecute poachers as if that.

926
01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:17.643
That was the issue.

927
01:13:17.770 --> 01:13:22.060
Doesn't anyone realize that people are hungry and using these animals for food.

928
01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:24.340
People still think it's wild Africa.

929
01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.300
Doesn't anyone realize that this is all about population pressure.

930
01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:32.680
What the new uses the F word what the f is going on out there in the

931
01:13:32.681 --> 01:13:36.970
conservation world.
He capitalizes Connors as as as as for con job.

932
01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:41.650
Nothing but lies fundraising lies and I think we are.

933
01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:45.470
<v 5>I mean he's overstates things and as you know that's one of my pedagogical tools</v>

934
01:13:45.471 --> 01:13:49.990
is to engage somewhat an overstatement.
You remember it though.

935
01:13:50.950 --> 01:13:55.840
And so you know that the whole environmental movement has got its head in the

936
01:13:55.841 --> 01:13:59.920
sand about the one thing that that could really probably make a big difference.

937
01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:04.000
So just to conclude Nike that the Earth is in a big race.

938
01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:07.830
You have shown your population is increasing environmental problems are

939
01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:12.840
increasing but fertility is coming down depending on how these two

940
01:14:14.290 --> 01:14:18.940
countervailing forces work in the future we will either come to a smooth landing

941
01:14:18.941 --> 01:14:23.590
a soft landing that fertility will come down fast enough that takes the pressure

942
01:14:23.591 --> 01:14:28.591
off the increasing environmental issues or it won't or if population won't come

943
01:14:29.801 --> 01:14:33.490
down fast enough and then we're off into who knows what.

944
01:14:34.030 --> 01:14:38.320
So that's I think that what to take away from this course the tremendous race

945
01:14:38.321 --> 01:14:43.321
between the increase of population billion people will every 13 years the

946
01:14:43.841 --> 01:14:48.841
decline in fertility decline since 1960 and about 40 50 years and climbed to

947
01:14:49.211 --> 01:14:54.120
more than half.
How is that race going to be won and what do we conclude.

948
01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:58.690
Which side is going to win that race and what can we politically what can we do

949
01:14:58.691 --> 01:15:03.220
about it.
OK.
Have a good summer.
Have a good chat.

950
01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:06.070
About.
