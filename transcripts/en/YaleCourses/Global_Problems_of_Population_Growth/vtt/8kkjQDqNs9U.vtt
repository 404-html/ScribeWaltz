WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.720
Okay,
last time.
Okay.
Everybody piped down.

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.220
So last time we discussed two factors that limited,

3
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.180
uh,
that retarded and limited your progress.
Remember I,

4
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.860
I'm describing that Europe was in a pretty bad situation.
Uh,

5
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.890
one was sort of mental,
cultural.

6
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:30.891
There was a mindset that largely focused on the supernatural and did not have

7
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:36.720
that mindset to question received wisdom and to test whatever they believed

8
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:39.570
against what they saw in reality.

9
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.830
The second was of food and population balance that left vast numbers of people

10
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.780
in conditions of near starvation.

11
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.130
Around 1750 rounds,

12
00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:59.100
1700 Europe started to outgrow these limitations.

13
00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.940
And we started talking about that last time we saw how the scientific revolution

14
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.220
given great impetus by Newton.
He wasn't the only one,

15
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:11.070
but the hit the fabulous success in,

16
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:15.150
in explaining the universe that Newton's three very simple laws.

17
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:18.960
We learned that certainly in high school,
if not in junior high school,
uh,

18
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.060
explain how all the heavens work.
And that was an amazing,

19
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.940
uh,
uh,

20
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.720
creation of the human mind and had tremendous import and started,
uh,

21
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.380
what's been called,
uh,
uh,

22
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.520
the enlite,
the enlightenment.
So that that's sort of sea change,

23
00:01:42.521 --> 00:01:46.830
the mental set and into something more progressive.
And then as you've read in,

24
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:48.180
I hope in your course packet,

25
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.040
the introduction of foods from America sort of cut down,

26
00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.840
uh,
got rid of the physical limitation on,
on,

27
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.950
uh,

28
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.950
population and economic wellbeing in Europe that the amount of food went way up.

29
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.930
And so this,
especially the food increased the European population.

30
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.700
There's all kinds of different numbers available,
but,
uh,

31
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.150
anywhere from 62% up to a doubling of the European population due to the

32
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:24.900
introduction of,
of European foods.

33
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.760
Now the standard belief about population and fat time is that population is a

34
00:02:31.801 --> 00:02:35.580
wonderful thing.
And,
uh,
John Jacques Rousseau,

35
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:39.510
who we've talked about who was abandoning his own children by the Carload to

36
00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:44.100
control his individual families,
the number of children they had to cope with.

37
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.560
Uh,
in terms when he thought about the grand,
the,
the,
the political system,

38
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.830
he said that government under which the citizens do most increase and multiply

39
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.830
is infallibly the best.
Similarly,

40
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.120
the government under which your people diminish as a number and wastes away is

41
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:04.954
the worst.

42
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.360
And so he's very clear that not only is high population good,

43
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.930
but it's infallibly good.
Benjamin Franklin,

44
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.520
around 1751 argued about this.

45
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.730
There were upwards of 1 million English soles in America is before the

46
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:27.910
revolution,
the mill,
this million doubling suppose,

47
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:29.740
but once in 25 years,

48
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.030
which is not a bad estimate of the doubling time of American population at that

49
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:34.211
time,

50
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:39.211
do largely due to immigration doubling once every 25 years within and another

51
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.160
will in another century be more than the people of England.

52
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.880
What an expression of power that will be.

53
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.480
And the realization of American increase in numbers and therefore increase in

54
00:03:55.421 --> 00:03:59.740
power was very important in the history of that time after the French and Indian

55
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:04.300
war before our revolution,
that you know of the settlement,
that the English got.

56
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.990
Canada and the friend,
which was barren,
wasn't worth very much at the time.

57
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.120
And the French kept the islands in the Atlantic,
which were very rich,

58
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:16.690
sugar and plantations slavery of course.
Uh,

59
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.050
the French kept those and the English took Canada.
Why?

60
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:23.650
To keep the Americans in check because they knew that the Americans would get,

61
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.720
uh,
get very strong.

62
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.850
Thomas Jefferson often said population is power.

63
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.960
So in 1800,
when the U S is only 10 years old,

64
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.030
so very fragile in terms of our,
our,
our strength,

65
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.560
our military strength and everything like that.

66
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.120
Napoleon had recently a Spain had owned Louisiana,

67
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.180
which was the whole vast territory to the west of of the 13 colonies and during

68
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:55.840
the Napoleonic wars and Napoleon,
uh,
got charge of them.

69
00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.230
And so he was going to send a French troops there to occupy Louisiana because

70
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.170
they were such a big and important territory.
But the US of course objected.

71
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.350
We were having this huge population growth,
immigration,

72
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:11.990
they were flooding over the Appalachian mountains into the territories and the

73
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.870
next boundary with the Mississippi River.

74
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.270
And America did not want any of the European powers are taking control there.

75
00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:25.230
The French ambassador in stay in America realized that America was growing so

76
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:29.410
rapidly and empower knee,
foot and Napoleon site he did send troops were stupid,

77
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.850
but at no point would lose the war.
So this guy was very clever.
He did one thing,

78
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.860
he sent him Napoleon,

79
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.480
a summary of the American census of 1800 [inaudible] remember that in the

80
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:42.520
constitution we have to take a census.

81
00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.750
It was one taken in 1800 and it showed such a great rate of American population

82
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:50.380
increase that that's all he had to send.

83
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.190
It showed that the u s population was doubling every 22 years,

84
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.190
not the 25 that Benjamin Franklin had estimated.

85
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.950
Napoleon got the message immediately.

86
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:04.490
There was no way that France was going to be able to hold Louisiana,
uh,

87
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.550
against American objections.
So what of Napoleon do

88
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.390
sold it?
Sold it to us for a pittance.

89
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.530
Basically a Petten's cause he knew he could not hold it.
The power of population.

90
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.810
Now why did governments love large populations?
Why was it power?

91
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.370
Two things.
One,
a lot of men.
And what do you do with men?

92
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:30.470
Take him into the army.
So you have big military power also more people,

93
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.850
far more land,
produce more food and other goods.
And then what can you do?

94
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.773
You can tax it.

95
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.430
So the governments get a lot of tax and a lot of people if they have a big

96
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:43.290
population.
So,
uh,

97
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.940
it was sort of no question in anyone's mind that,
uh,
uh,
that are,
uh,

98
00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.990
on a big and growing population was just a wonderful sort of thing.

99
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.730
What they didn't realize is one of the things that I'm trying to get across in

100
00:06:55.731 --> 00:07:00.470
this class,
that that system works,
uh,

101
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:04.880
for a situation where you have no limitation on land or resources.

102
00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.013
It's like I've been,

103
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.110
I was describing for Africa where the population was small and land was large,

104
00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.730
then population is,
can be a benefit in the way just described.

105
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.370
But the reality for Europe especially was different.
Uh,

106
00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.470
after 1750,
again,
largely due to the American foods,
uh,

107
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.440
people filled the European countrysides to overflowing capacity.
This,

108
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.460
these are quotes from him from various sources.

109
00:07:34.461 --> 00:07:37.970
Back then mountain spilled over with people.

110
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.390
Cities grew and the plane's became full.

111
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:47.350
But this increase in population brought more mouths to feed population rose and

112
00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:51.110
the resources could not match the population.

113
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:55.280
So when you have more consumers than goods.

114
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:57.710
So law of supply and demand prices,

115
00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:02.030
rose people couldn't afford what they previously could afford and poverty

116
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.893
deepened.

117
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.280
So in this period in Europe,

118
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.690
people often move,

119
00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:13.691
migrated seasonally to get jobs because they didn't have enough income from

120
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:16.220
their own land.
They would go to where some harvest,

121
00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.010
they were needed to harvest or needed to work on a building project.

122
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.140
But at this time,

123
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.320
this population and people wandering around looking for some sort of work,
uh,

124
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.360
increased so much that the line between migration and vagabonds [inaudible]

125
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.600
becoming just a vagabond,
uh,

126
00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:38.690
was crossed by hundreds of thousands of Europeans that were just wandering

127
00:08:38.691 --> 00:08:42.650
around looking for some kind of work to keep them alive for a little bit longer.

128
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:48.650
And this was written,
noticed and written about a lot at the time.
Uh,

129
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:52.740
they flooded the highways roads we're opening up at the time they,

130
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:57.120
they flooded the highways of France,
Germany,
the countries,
all of these places.

131
00:08:57.121 --> 00:09:00.600
This was noticed children at the time.
Again,

132
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:04.920
you read this crowded orphanages and founding homes,
women and children,

133
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.340
very large number of beggars arose at this time.

134
00:09:08.341 --> 00:09:12.740
Women and children begged on church steps,
roadsides.

135
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.920
Uh,
this problem of poverty,
as I've mentioned,
was uh,

136
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:25.430
much observed,
much worried about,
much comment to the pond.
And in fact,

137
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.510
all of the,
the great intellectuals of the day whose names we still know,

138
00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:34.330
commented upon it,
you'll know Edward Gibbon given,
wrote the

139
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:37.520
decline and fall of the Roman Empire,

140
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.560
one of the most famous peep intellectuals of that time right after that he wrote

141
00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.540
in the civilized world,

142
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:49.130
the most numerous class is condemned to ignorance and poverty.

143
00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.700
Why were people poor?
Well,

144
00:09:52.701 --> 00:09:56.690
the general consideration then they were poor because they were in some way

145
00:09:56.691 --> 00:10:00.440
deficient.
And the idea was that God had given some people,

146
00:10:00.441 --> 00:10:01.880
kings and aristocrats,

147
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.930
the abilities and the capability to rule and all the others were relegated to

148
00:10:05.931 --> 00:10:09.770
the lower classes.
They just didn't,
they had bad heredity.

149
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.070
They were lazy,
they were quoting the wrong sort.

150
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.130
They were inherently incapable that they're there.

151
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.190
Nature or human nature,

152
00:10:19.191 --> 00:10:23.780
they didn't really have a genetic ideas back then was to be incapable of leading

153
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.130
the good kind of life.
Well,
this was a nice theory.
And,
and,

154
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:32.660
and the people who are upper class enough to get an education right about it,

155
00:10:32.661 --> 00:10:35.030
could live comfortably with that theory.

156
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:39.530
But then America opens up for colonization and guess what happens?

157
00:10:39.531 --> 00:10:43.460
Who moves to America,
the poorest people,
especially from England,
right?

158
00:10:43.461 --> 00:10:47.480
The lower classes and moved to Australia,
isn't it late somewhat later time.

159
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.380
And then they empty out.

160
00:10:48.381 --> 00:10:51.830
The prison's going to Australia's have really the lower classes.

161
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.450
And what happens to America as,
as I've just showed you,
the people work hard,

162
00:10:56.451 --> 00:10:59.270
they're industrious,
they make a lot of money,
they get ahead,

163
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:02.150
everything looks very good in America.

164
00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:06.710
And so the theory just didn't fit observation.
And as I've mentioned,

165
00:11:06.711 --> 00:11:09.890
people are by now paying attention to what's around them.

166
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:15.190
And this idea that Americans had been so poor in England but they moved to

167
00:11:15.351 --> 00:11:19.520
America and things get better.
So the question arose,

168
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:24.230
why would the poor so poor in England?
You know,
kind of an obvious question.

169
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.420
And again,
not the first time that this question had been asked.

170
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:33.950
The Bible,
and again,
I,
I sorry for keep referring to religion,

171
00:11:33.951 --> 00:11:37.340
but you cannot just cannot discuss western intellectual history without,

172
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:42.260
without going that cause that was the basis of the way people thought.
So,

173
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.620
uh,
what the Bible says,
Ecclesiastes these,

174
00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:50.410
when goods increase they are increased that eat then.
So as you,

175
00:11:50.411 --> 00:11:51.440
if you have more stuff,

176
00:11:51.441 --> 00:11:55.690
population grows and they eat the food very close to what we'll see.

177
00:11:55.700 --> 00:12:00.130
Martha's uh,
says later,
Edmund Burke,

178
00:12:00.131 --> 00:12:05.131
who is now considered the father of conservative political philosophy.

179
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:12.190
The laboring people are only poor because they are numerous numbers in their

180
00:12:12.191 --> 00:12:16.060
nature imply poverty in a fair distribution.

181
00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:21.070
But liberals who say no eat share equally in a fair distribution among a vast

182
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:23.590
multitude,
none can have much.

183
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:27.940
So he was talking against spreading the wealth because under that condition,

184
00:12:27.941 --> 00:12:30.520
if you spread the wealth,
everybody is extremely poor.

185
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.220
So those kinds of thoughts started people thinking about the relationship

186
00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:39.760
between population and resources.
What,
what was that?

187
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:43.210
This is sort of a fairly new way of thinking about things.

188
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:47.380
And where do they turn to?
Again,
in the spirit of the enlightenment,

189
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.100
science was the leading source of intellectual,
uh,

190
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.030
new ideas and natural history was going on.

191
00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:59.650
Who was getting going at that time studying of plants and animals in their

192
00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:04.300
natural habitats,
just like all your ta for this course.

193
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.750
And so Adam Smith,
among others,

194
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.300
pay great attention to what the naturalists were saying in the wealth of
nations.

195
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.870
1776,

196
00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:19.530
every species of animal naturally multiplies in proportion to the means of their

197
00:13:19.661 --> 00:13:24.490
subs.
Subsistence and no species can ever multiply beyond it.

198
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.860
And then he exploded,
says,
ma'am,

199
00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.230
like all other animals naturally multiply in proportion to their means of

200
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:37.470
subsistence fisheries immediately applying an ecological law from the study of

201
00:13:37.781 --> 00:13:39.880
animals to people.

202
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:47.180
Well,
how fast can humans multiply?
David Hume,
uh,

203
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.770
another one of the luminous philosopher,
1742,

204
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:55.480
almost every man who thinks he can maintain a family will have one.

205
00:13:56.140 --> 00:14:00.760
And the human species at this rate of propagation would more than double every

206
00:14:00.761 --> 00:14:04.870
generation.
Adam Smith again,

207
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.360
got some of the problem.
He realized that,
uh,
in,

208
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.340
in if wages increased,
if,

209
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:16.570
if things started to get better and wages increased,
uh,

210
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:18.820
this would lead to an increase in population.

211
00:14:18.821 --> 00:14:20.830
He explicitly says if people have more money,

212
00:14:20.831 --> 00:14:24.550
they're going to be able to feed their children more and they will stay alive

213
00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.320
and,
uh,
there will be a decline in mortality and the population will grow.

214
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:34.300
But he so very surprised it did not close the circle and did not never

215
00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:39.301
apparently realize that this growth in the population would be more competitors

216
00:14:39.731 --> 00:14:44.560
for the jobs and would push,
uh,
wages back down again.

217
00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.930
So that was the great achievement of office and all this interest in what is the

218
00:14:49.931 --> 00:14:53.480
cause of poverty.
Uh,
and there are many other things.

219
00:14:53.481 --> 00:14:58.130
There was an enclosure movement in England at the time where the lands on which

220
00:14:58.131 --> 00:15:02.660
the peasants had lived were being closed in and controlled by the,
uh,
by the,
the,

221
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:06.350
the,
uh,
squire is the country squires.
And so with a lot of other things going on,

222
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:10.550
but this was the kind of argumentation that was going on at the time.

223
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:16.880
So more office was the one that realized that population and wages and

224
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:19.490
mortality,
we're in a negative,

225
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.950
what we now call a negative feedback loop,

226
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:26.540
that if late wages increased,
as I've just said,

227
00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.810
then population grows and a population grows.

228
00:15:29.811 --> 00:15:34.520
The competition for jobs and for food and for everything else pushes wages back

229
00:15:34.521 --> 00:15:37.610
down or pushes prices back up.
So if you earn the same,

230
00:15:37.611 --> 00:15:41.750
you're still getting less.
So in short,

231
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.080
although the population could grow and the economy on a gross scale,

232
00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:52.310
the there could grow the per capita income he basically said could not grow.

233
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.900
And so in the strongest in the strongest statement of this,

234
00:15:56.901 --> 00:15:59.220
and he went through many additions with many different,
uh,

235
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:01.610
statements from the strongest statement.

236
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.970
Economic progress is basically impossible looked at from the point of view of

237
00:16:07.251 --> 00:16:11.330
per capita income,
the living standards of the average person.

238
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.790
Most of the very clever and thought more deeply about it.

239
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:21.850
And he was aware of two contradictory changes that were happening throughout the

240
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:23.960
18th century.
He's right,

241
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:27.890
he writes to 1798 at the end of the 18th century,

242
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.380
as I've mentioned.
And you've read,

243
00:16:30.381 --> 00:16:35.080
there's no question that agriculture was improving,
not only American foods,
uh,

244
00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.530
but also,
uh,

245
00:16:36.531 --> 00:16:40.370
agronomy was coming in as a science and people were learning even with the same

246
00:16:40.371 --> 00:16:44.570
crops to improve the crops,
to improve their livestock,
to fertilize better,

247
00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:49.400
to rotate fields better.
They were learning,
uh,
to,
to grow more,

248
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:54.140
more food.
And so nevertheless,

249
00:16:54.141 --> 00:16:58.310
even though there was more food around poverty was growing and that was also

250
00:16:58.311 --> 00:17:02.510
very clear at the time.
And so he,
he,

251
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:07.250
his argument is based on a few very simple kinds of statements,
uh,

252
00:17:08.570 --> 00:17:13.570
contrary to some previous thinkers who in envisioned other later in population

253
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:18.530
and resources as there's a fixed amount of resources that there's a pie.

254
00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.350
We now use the expression pie,
this pie.

255
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.840
And depending on how many people there are,

256
00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:27.170
you divide the pie into smaller and smaller slices.
The more people,

257
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.210
the smaller slices of the pie,

258
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.330
that is completely wrong and never has been correct.

259
00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.940
All people do some,
uh,
kind,

260
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.320
kind of work and in the pie grows with each person.

261
00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.670
Some the pie grows to a certain degree.
And the question is how,

262
00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:49.920
how much does the pie grow?
So for instance,

263
00:17:49.921 --> 00:17:54.450
again in the United States,
the time we've had these vast lands to the west,

264
00:17:54.451 --> 00:17:59.451
we were killing or had killed the Indians and they were very few of them anyway.

265
00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:05.100
So that allowed each new person.
So as population grows,
again,

266
00:18:05.101 --> 00:18:07.230
when you have no limitation of resources,

267
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:12.150
a new family is living on the frontier,
the frontier becomes crowded.

268
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.750
American population was growing very fast.
They were having lots of kids,

269
00:18:15.751 --> 00:18:18.180
lots of immigrants where the new people go to,

270
00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:22.350
they just move some miles to the west and they got a beautiful new farm and the

271
00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:25.560
land is just as good as what was left behind.

272
00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:30.120
And they grow as much as the PR as are farmers that they left behind.

273
00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:34.380
So the population increases,
the gross economy increases,

274
00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:39.390
and the per capita standard of living does not decrease because this guy has the

275
00:18:39.391 --> 00:18:44.040
same amount of resources as the previous generation hat.

276
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:47.730
But this was not the condition in Europe

277
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.640
or in England or the rest of actual all across Eurasia.
Here,

278
00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.940
the law of diminishing returns take effect because land starts to be limiting.

279
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:03.210
When land is limiting,
people are naturally smart.

280
00:19:03.211 --> 00:19:07.860
What do they do with this beautiful land,
fertile land by a river?
Of course,

281
00:19:07.861 --> 00:19:12.390
they farm that first,
right?
And so as population grows,
that gets taken up,

282
00:19:12.391 --> 00:19:17.391
all the good land comes under the plow and as good population keeps growing,

283
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:22.050
well the next set of people have to go to more or less good land,

284
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:25.020
maybe dry or land,
maybe hillier or land.

285
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:30.180
And their productivity is not quite as good as the previous group that got the

286
00:19:30.181 --> 00:19:34.890
best land.
Population keeps growing and people have to move,

287
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:35.670
um,

288
00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:40.590
high on the mountain tops into dry areas and to desert areas and to swampy areas

289
00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:45.860
in all kinds of areas where their production is not going to be as high.

290
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.760
So the average income from say farming,
uh,

291
00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:55.590
decreases as you use less good land.

292
00:19:55.950 --> 00:20:00.300
And so things conditions get worse.
And finally,

293
00:20:00.301 --> 00:20:04.170
all the land is used up and there's no land for farmers whatsoever.

294
00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.790
So this is the law of diminishing returns.

295
00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.600
And if you're travel around,
uh,

296
00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.840
you can really see the law of diminishing returns happen or a mix of how people

297
00:20:18.421 --> 00:20:23.340
always do some work.
But when there isn't much resource to take advantage of,

298
00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:28.590
uh,
they can accomplish very little.
So,
uh,

299
00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.360
quite a few years ago I was traveling in the highlands of,

300
00:20:31.361 --> 00:20:35.340
of Livia and Peru and a lot of native Indian markets,

301
00:20:35.341 --> 00:20:39.870
they're very colorful,
you know,
tourists love to go to them,
but you watched the,

302
00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:44.871
the ladies sit down and have a blanket in front of them and they display their,

303
00:20:46.141 --> 00:20:50.600
their,
their wares and they had totally agricultural and they'll have maybe a,

304
00:20:50.601 --> 00:20:54.670
a few fruits and a little bit of this and a little bit of that.
And they have,

305
00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.250
you know,
almost nothing,
almost no stock on the blanket.

306
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.300
So they've grown this over the past six months or something.

307
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.200
They've walked all the way,
maybe even days to get to a market.

308
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:07.090
And then they have very little to sell.

309
00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.590
And even if they could sell everything that they brought at some sort of a

310
00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:13.730
profit,
they didn't have enough there.

311
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:17.020
The total amount that they would take home was still very,
very little,

312
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.860
but they were producing some,
but not very much.
Uh,
in the cities.

313
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:25.770
I've tell you one story.
So I was in,

314
00:21:25.771 --> 00:21:30.771
in Lima improve this same trip and a lot of street vendors doing,

315
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:31.571
doing stuff.

316
00:21:31.571 --> 00:21:35.870
And I saw one guy had a pair of socks up there and he had some sort of a,

317
00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:39.250
a knitting needle or something like is holding up the sock.

318
00:21:39.251 --> 00:21:41.350
And as he was talking to the crowd,
chatting,

319
00:21:41.351 --> 00:21:45.270
the socket is knitting needle and he's saying,
you can't destroy this hockey.

320
00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.310
Can't just try this.
I get to last the rest of your life,
bash,
bash,
patch.

321
00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:51.160
And I'm watching him for awhile and I'm skeptical,
you know.

322
00:21:51.161 --> 00:21:55.300
But [inaudible] seemed okay.
So the poor guy,
I bought the pair of socks,

323
00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:00.220
that socks,
you couldn't,
I could not destroy them.
I used them for about 20 years.

324
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.710
So it was really true.
So he was,
you know,

325
00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:07.300
making some sort of a meager living,
but it wasn't good.

326
00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:12.310
If he had better jobs,
if there were more resources that he could utilize,

327
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.620
uh,
uh,

328
00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:19.090
his low wages would not drag down the average.

329
00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:22.630
And you must realize,
of course,
that when one says a phrase like that,

330
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.630
that he could,
there were resources that he could utilize,

331
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:30.070
brings up a vast consideration of power and everything else,
you know,

332
00:22:30.071 --> 00:22:33.510
what are the resources and who gets to utilize them.
And so what,

333
00:22:33.511 --> 00:22:38.170
so to it's a much more,
you know,
and of course is say a little bit and as much,

334
00:22:38.171 --> 00:22:43.000
much more to say about all of these things.
So,

335
00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:47.470
uh,
the,
the law of diminishing returns,
uh,

336
00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.040
reduces,
uh,
the average productivity,

337
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.590
but then there's a countervailing trend,

338
00:22:53.591 --> 00:22:56.620
which he also was aware of that I've just mentioned,

339
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.680
that the productivity of the land was increasing again,

340
00:22:59.681 --> 00:23:03.610
through the new foods and new agricultural,
uh,
technologies.

341
00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:08.730
And these two factors work in opposite directions and more office had to make

342
00:23:09.041 --> 00:23:14.041
some sort of a guess as to how these two factors would balance out,

343
00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:15.970
which would predominate.

344
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:20.530
Would the introduction of new technology improve faster than the law of

345
00:23:20.531 --> 00:23:23.020
diminishing returns?
Uh,
decreased it.

346
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:28.230
And his conclusion was that technology would be somewhat stronger than the law

347
00:23:30.671 --> 00:23:31.930
of diminishing returns.

348
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:36.460
So that total productive per capita productivity and total productivity would

349
00:23:36.461 --> 00:23:38.830
indeed keep increasing,

350
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.890
but he thought it would increase sort of at a constant sort of a,

351
00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:47.430
of a rate and in graphs terminals.

352
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.260
<v 1>Let's see if I can get right to this graph.</v>

353
00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:03.490
<v 0>So here is,
you'll see the rest of it.</v>

354
00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:06.260
This is the standard kind of guff about mall office.

355
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:11.500
Here is the way he thought that resources mostly uh,
food in his,

356
00:24:11.501 --> 00:24:13.990
in the case at the time he was talking about,

357
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:19.470
he thought they would increase in the more or less a regular way per every year.

358
00:24:19.481 --> 00:24:20.590
If you consider these years,

359
00:24:20.591 --> 00:24:25.210
every year would increase by about the same amount he called that an arithmetic

360
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:29.440
growth.
We now call it a linear growth.

361
00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:31.893
Um,

362
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:37.230
but he and everyone else knew that population can grow faster than that.

363
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:42.870
So you probably understand a little bit about exponential growth of each couple

364
00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:46.470
has four surviving children,
not unreasonable.
And when there's a,

365
00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.600
when there's a moderate amount of food and then these children have foreign.

366
00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.350
So on.

367
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:55.350
The population does not grow for six eight 10 12 linear kind of thing.

368
00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:02.370
It grows four eight 1632 64 you're used to counting this way from bits that's

369
00:25:04.391 --> 00:25:09.391
called exponential growth where each generation a doubles or improves by some

370
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:11.013
percentage.

371
00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:16.290
I've just made this graph at growing 10% a year and no matter where you stand

372
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.120
and the growth is like that,

373
00:25:19.121 --> 00:25:22.570
that's an exponential curve and all exponential curves look,
look,
look like that.

374
00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.130
You can change your scales,

375
00:25:24.131 --> 00:25:28.480
but they all look exactly like that and it doesn't matter where you start,

376
00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:29.920
you can start uh,

377
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:34.750
in England where these two curves would be pretty much matched at the time

378
00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.370
Martha was writing.

379
00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:41.970
Or you can start in America where resources are way above population at the

380
00:25:43.031 --> 00:25:44.980
beginning,
but then you just wait.

381
00:25:44.981 --> 00:25:49.150
America's starts filling up more and more rapidly.
As the population grows,

382
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.630
10% of a large population adds more people in a year,

383
00:25:52.631 --> 00:25:54.580
then 10% of the small population.

384
00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.850
So as time goes on the increment per year,

385
00:25:57.851 --> 00:26:02.851
it gets bigger and bigger and eventually it outruns a resource growth.

386
00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:10.380
So this is Martha's is mathematical formulation of his ideas and he believed it

387
00:26:12.341 --> 00:26:17.341
to be an inevitability that this was an iron law of economics and that you

388
00:26:17.591 --> 00:26:19.450
couldn't avoid this.

389
00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:24.690
And so human population was doomed to per capita misery kind of thing.

390
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:27.633
<v 1>And</v>

391
00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:31.670
<v 0>he put it in this particular mathematical form.
But as you can see,</v>

392
00:26:31.671 --> 00:26:36.350
the mathematical form doesn't really matter as long as population can grow

393
00:26:36.351 --> 00:26:40.280
faster than resources,
you're eventually going to get into this situation.

394
00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:45.060
Even if population goes linearly,
if it grows at a faster pace than resources,

395
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.350
you're back into this situation.
So the idea,

396
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:54.330
the simple idea is that population can grow faster than resources.

397
00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:56.880
And I think that's for sure.
True.

398
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:03.660
So Martha's was,
was,
uh,
certainly,
uh,

399
00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.840
partly correct.
He was right and he was also wrong.
And he has been,

400
00:27:09.841 --> 00:27:12.780
you've probably heard most of this always gets discussed,
you know,

401
00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:13.940
since he wrote it.
Now,

402
00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:18.570
big subject of controversy and I think the current sort of fashion is to,

403
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:19.830
is to put them down.
How many,

404
00:27:19.831 --> 00:27:23.700
how many people have heard discussions of morphus and in how many does he come

405
00:27:23.701 --> 00:27:27.180
out?
Well.
Yeah.
How many does it come out badly?

406
00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.660
Well,
it's about split.
Okay.
Yeah,

407
00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.070
in certain kinds of circles.
Uh,
it's very,

408
00:27:35.071 --> 00:27:38.010
it's unfashionable to be a Malthusian and nowadays,

409
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.190
so he was right and he was wrong.

410
00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.610
And what was he right about first he had apparently,

411
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:49.050
although the historians argue about this quite an accurate description,

412
00:27:49.051 --> 00:27:53.400
this Malthusian situation is an accurate description of Europe from say about

413
00:27:53.401 --> 00:27:57.450
1200 to almost until into the 17 hundreds.

414
00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:59.400
So for about 500 years,

415
00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:04.230
a very strong arguments can be made with whatever data is available that Europe

416
00:28:04.231 --> 00:28:07.260
was in this Malthusian trap.
It also is,

417
00:28:07.261 --> 00:28:12.240
I'll as I'll show you in a minute,
that as the industrial revolution took hold,

418
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:17.570
he was still right for almost another century and then things changed and he

419
00:28:18.991 --> 00:28:21.960
didn't have this,
he had a crystal ball,
he was pretty good,

420
00:28:21.961 --> 00:28:24.300
but he didn't have a real modern model,
crystal ball.

421
00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:26.970
So there are two things that he did not

422
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:32.640
foresee.
He lived at the very beginning,

423
00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:36.810
very beginning of the industrial revolution and didn't really realize its power.

424
00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:39.450
So when he saw it,
he thought production of all sorts,

425
00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:44.250
not only agriculture would increase kind of linearly,
that constant,

426
00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:46.140
constant increments every year.

427
00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:51.300
But in fact the way it has turned out is that not only can population increase

428
00:28:51.301 --> 00:28:54.630
exponentially,
but production can increase exponentially.

429
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.740
And for the same reason basically that when you produce,

430
00:28:58.741 --> 00:29:00.750
if you're in this scientific,
this

431
00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:07.170
post enlightenment era where we know science makes life better,

432
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:11.340
um,
then as your economy increases,

433
00:29:11.341 --> 00:29:15.570
you have more money and you devote a certain fraction of it to research,

434
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:20.430
to a technology.
And so as your economy grows every year,

435
00:29:20.431 --> 00:29:22.650
you put more and more money into research.

436
00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:27.510
So in the same way that if it's a percentage of your total income,

437
00:29:27.511 --> 00:29:31.380
total national income or something that you invest and you get a good product

438
00:29:31.381 --> 00:29:36.150
out of it,
then just like population every year you will have more income,

439
00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.070
more gross national product,

440
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:41.410
more when you invest a certain fraction that you have more.

441
00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:45.130
And also technology and science grows exponentially.

442
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.170
So what happened,
uh,
is that eventually,

443
00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:51.243
uh,

444
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000
technology grew production just as fast as population and in fact somewhat

445
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:00.910
faster than population.

446
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.980
So we sort of realize that when we say that our economy grows like 2% a year,

447
00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.660
we don't say,
we sometimes say it grew by a million,
$100 million a year,

448
00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:14.020
something like that.
But more often,
which is a linear statement,
100 million,

449
00:30:14.021 --> 00:30:16.540
a hundred million,
hundred million,
but he just say 2%.

450
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:21.730
The next year you have 2% of 102% and the next year or 2% of 104%,

451
00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.580
it grows faster and faster.

452
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:31.210
And again,
this kind of percentage increase in,
uh,

453
00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:36.040
technology and production has exactly the same limit as population.

454
00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:40.480
That there must be no external limits,
no resources,
uh,
that are limiting.

455
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:45.150
And now of course,
we realize we do have to worry about,
uh,

456
00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:49.240
the limits of the environment.
And people have multiplied.

457
00:30:49.241 --> 00:30:52.840
People have basically filled up the earth.
And,
uh,

458
00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:56.440
the reason we're using everything that looks like we're using virtually

459
00:30:56.441 --> 00:31:01.030
everything that humans can use and there's not much left.
So the question is,

460
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:06.110
you know,
can we continue to increase our production tingling?

461
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.540
And we don't know the answer to it.

462
00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:14.470
Second thing that Moses didn't foresee was a big drop in the birth rate.

463
00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:19.890
And uh,
he again acting sort of as a,

464
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:24.990
in the Newtonian mode of pronouncing scientific laws that were in viable and

465
00:31:25.841 --> 00:31:30.130
inevitable.
He said the sex drive was an instinct.
People liked sex

466
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.620
and that would not go away.
So they would keep reproducing.

467
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.230
Now he was also aware of contraception.

468
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:41.020
People were doing various things even at that time.

469
00:31:41.021 --> 00:31:45.670
And it was certainly an awareness,
but he was so,
he was a minister.

470
00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:50.410
He was so morally opposed to that that he just would not really consider that

471
00:31:50.411 --> 00:31:52.930
people would ever do that.
Uh,
so he,

472
00:31:52.931 --> 00:31:57.640
he dismissed that kind of idea.
So what,

473
00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:01.600
what happened that in some sense makes him wrong,

474
00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:05.140
is that after about another hundred years after he writes,

475
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:10.320
production increases enough to keep up with population and the birth rate starts

476
00:32:10.841 --> 00:32:14.410
dropping.
And we're going to talk about,
uh,
both two days.
Those,

477
00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:15.580
both of those things,

478
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:21.840
when you think about Martha is going into these discussions that this strict

479
00:32:22.271 --> 00:32:25.700
formulation of his ideas that,
you know,
does,

480
00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:29.230
we can't make any economic progress and disasters eminent.

481
00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:33.970
That's clearly not the case.
But if you just slightly rephrase,
uh,

482
00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:35.433
his,
uh,

483
00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:40.470
questions and ask not whether you have a dead stop to population growth,

484
00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.130
to,
uh,
economic growth,

485
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:47.180
but they're in those countries and those places with very dense populations,

486
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.140
even though economic growth is,
is present there,

487
00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:56.380
would the people be better off with a less,
a lesser population is more,

488
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:59.170
right?
Not In the extreme,
but in the,

489
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:04.160
in the reality that you can,
even in very dense populations,

490
00:33:04.161 --> 00:33:05.690
you can have some economic growth.

491
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:08.720
But would the people be better off if they had less,
uh,

492
00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:10.880
a lower population?

493
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.780
And then instead of asking the other amount of care,

494
00:33:14.781 --> 00:33:19.170
instead of asking where the food is,
your limiting factor,
uh,

495
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:23.800
asking whether the environment is your limiting factor and that,
uh,

496
00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:28.090
with those rather small changes in,
in,
in what he said,
uh,

497
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.630
makes Martha's as relevant today as,
as at any time.

498
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:37.780
So,
all right,
so let's look at some of the things that,
that,

499
00:33:37.781 --> 00:33:41.100
that I've been talking about.
Uh,

500
00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:46.190
this,
I think I could.

501
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:51.320
So you've all seen that you've seen this graph before,

502
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:55.490
and remember this is for Roman times,

503
00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:58.070
but characteristic up too from way,

504
00:33:58.071 --> 00:34:03.071
way back into almost into the 17 hundreds and a thousand females are born,

505
00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:04.970
not very different for males.

506
00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:10.210
Most of them die about half of them die as infants than childbirth and they keep

507
00:34:10.641 --> 00:34:13.510
dying.
And eventually there's very few left.
This is the,

508
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:17.630
this is the number that are born and the number that are left.

509
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.430
So the reason I show this again is because there's one number here that I didn't

510
00:34:22.431 --> 00:34:23.270
describe before,

511
00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:27.500
but it's one way of characterizing this easier row is easiest,

512
00:34:27.501 --> 00:34:29.330
is for the expectancy of life.

513
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.800
How long you're gonna live at age zero at your birth.
You know,

514
00:34:33.801 --> 00:34:37.130
when a child is born,
how long do you expect them to live?

515
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:41.570
Of course that may be,
say 70 years old nowadays,

516
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:46.580
but my mother for instance,
is 97.
And so her life expectancy is like 102.

517
00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:50.570
So the life expectancy depends on when you're measuring it.

518
00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.180
And so this is life expectancy at birth.

519
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:58.510
And at this time it was just under 21 years of age.

520
00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:02.390
And we've seen,
uh,
here that

521
00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.260
when the live,
the,
the,

522
00:35:05.261 --> 00:35:08.330
the death rate is such to have this kind of a life expectancy,

523
00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:12.290
that's something like a third of the women are doing all the reproducing because

524
00:35:12.291 --> 00:35:15.620
the others are dead.
And if it's a third,

525
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:19.070
they have to have a six children to keep the population going.

526
00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:21.240
But since a lot of that third,
uh,

527
00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:25.640
is infertile or sick or unmarried or whatever,
uh,

528
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.900
the average has to be six.
The women who actually can reproduce,

529
00:35:29.901 --> 00:35:34.160
have to produce a lot more.
And it turns out that,
uh,

530
00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:37.830
that's about the limit that much with,
uh,

531
00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:42.390
with the expectancy of life,
uh,
of much less than that,

532
00:35:42.391 --> 00:35:47.070
much less than 20 or you maybe get it down to 20,
uh,
your,
your,

533
00:35:47.071 --> 00:35:51.840
your group,
your,
your population goes extinct.
So think,

534
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:52.770
think mathematically,

535
00:35:52.771 --> 00:35:57.771
just a little bit that if the average lifespan is 20 years,

536
00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:01.620
then every one of those 20 years in equal number,
every,
every year,

537
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:06.510
one 20th of the population is going to die.
And one 20th is 5%.

538
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:10.280
So you can think of of 5%,
uh,

539
00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.490
death rate as sort of the,

540
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:18.240
the maximum death,
5% of the population dies every year.

541
00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:22.550
It's kind of a maximum that humans Khasis can sustain more than that.

542
00:36:22.551 --> 00:36:25.290
And you have a lower,
a lower easy arrow,

543
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:29.670
your population goes out of existence.
Uh,

544
00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:35.100
as time goes on,
I've shown you this slide.
Also,

545
00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:39.750
conditions get a little better.
So here is the way this graph,

546
00:36:39.751 --> 00:36:43.670
this is rather stylized.
We don't have great data to make such a con and graph,

547
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:47.850
but this shows the life expectancy.
But to train 20 and 25 years,

548
00:36:47.851 --> 00:36:50.550
which we think is more or less the,
the,
the,

549
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:53.670
the characteristic of humans for a long time.

550
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:57.240
And then very slowly over thousands of years it gets better.

551
00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:01.380
And up here you may be at 25%.
So at 20,

552
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:06.090
I'm sorry,
25 years,
so 25 years.

553
00:37:06.091 --> 00:37:08.250
If people are going to live on average 25 years,

554
00:37:08.251 --> 00:37:13.230
that means one 25th of them die every year.
One 25th is 4%.

555
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:17.340
So when you see a death rate of 4%,

556
00:37:17.341 --> 00:37:21.450
which can be expressed as 40 per hundred,
uh,
sorry.
Uh,
yeah,

557
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:26.510
40 per hundred or 444 per hundred or 40 per thousand.

558
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:32.310
Did I say 40%?
I meant 4%.
Sorry.
So,
so what,

559
00:37:32.311 --> 00:37:37.311
what has happened over these thousands of years is that we managed to keep 1%

560
00:37:37.951 --> 00:37:41.490
more people alive every year.
From here we're keeping,

561
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:46.820
the death rate is maybe 5% a year and the death rate here is maybe 4% a year.

562
00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:52.440
So keep those numbers in mind as a primitive kind of minimum,

563
00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:54.870
say using say the 25,

564
00:37:55.050 --> 00:38:00.050
that 40 per thousand deaths and the population is going to be fairly stable,

565
00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.850
so 40 per thousand births.

566
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:08.270
So that's that what was going on through most of human history.

567
00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:15.240
Um,
now if you look at the actual numbers for Europe,

568
00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:21.860
you see that Eastern Europe has,

569
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.920
uh,
uh,
this is the crude.
This is the death rate of not 40,
uh,

570
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:31.020
per thousand,
but 38 per thousand here.
Very,

571
00:38:31.021 --> 00:38:36.021
very little bit better than the rate at which you really can't keep your

572
00:38:36.791 --> 00:38:38.650
population alive anymore.

573
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:43.860
And this continues in eastern Europe till like 1860 to the civil war time.

574
00:38:43.991 --> 00:38:47.320
This is the civil war in America.
UH,
Russia,
slow freeze.

575
00:38:47.321 --> 00:38:49.480
It's surfs at about this time.

576
00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:53.800
You've got a lot of the great Russian authors and the musicians are starting at

577
00:38:53.801 --> 00:38:57.820
around that time.
So in eastern Europe,

578
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:03.580
the,
if,
if you measure standard of living by the death rate,

579
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:07.960
the death rate has improved very little over the 40 or 50,

580
00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:11.370
not 50.
It's from thousands of years ago,
uh,

581
00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:13.660
than the 40.

582
00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.890
And then modern saying takes over and it falls very slowly.

583
00:39:19.330 --> 00:39:24.240
Western Europe where the enlightenment a hit hit first,
uh,

584
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.500
is doing better this time.

585
00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.830
And the line is sort of where a gang has con their line between East and Western

586
00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:34.180
was basically where a gang has gone.
The Mongols occupied Europe,
uh,

587
00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:39.420
that here in 1800 western Europe already has a death rate down to 28.

588
00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:41.800
Remember I told you in the 17 hundreds,

589
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.170
the western foods come in and things start getting better.

590
00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:48.430
So the death rate has been dropping at least all during the 17 hundreds.

591
00:39:48.431 --> 00:39:52.690
And depending on what his story,
new read,
uh,
possibly before the 17 hundreds.

592
00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:57.460
So Eastern Europe a hundred years later,

593
00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:58.350
this is 1800,

594
00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:03.370
this is 1890 eastern Europe is a hundred years behind western Europe more than a

595
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:07.240
hundred years,
but Europe has already,

596
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:12.160
western Europe has progressed somewhat and at this level the population is

597
00:40:12.161 --> 00:40:15.550
increasing quite rapidly.

598
00:40:17.620 --> 00:40:20.410
So during this period,
uh,
again,

599
00:40:20.411 --> 00:40:24.730
population's increasing resources and production are increasing somewhat,

600
00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:29.920
but the balance is not in favor of,
of standard of living.

601
00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.890
So,
uh,
for instance,
food,
uh,

602
00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:39.010
grain accounts for during this beard back 80% of the calories of the poor.

603
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.710
And even for the upper classes who had more meat and eggs and this kind of
stuff,

604
00:40:42.711 --> 00:40:47.170
there's about 50%.
So you can look basically at a,
uh,

605
00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:52.470
grain prices and wages in grain prices and tell how the people were living.

606
00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.310
So in Strasbourg,
uh,
which is a very favorably situated,

607
00:40:57.311 --> 00:41:01.810
fertile land on the Rhine,
just on the border between Germany and France.

608
00:41:01.811 --> 00:41:05.160
Sometimes it's Germany and sometimes it's France.
Uh,

609
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.570
between 1400 and 1500,
for instance,

610
00:41:07.571 --> 00:41:12.571
the amount of work needed to purchase a month or a month worth of wheat was in

611
00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:15.910
the range of 60 to 80 hours.
This is so in,

612
00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:20.050
in just before the reformation,
for instance,

613
00:41:20.051 --> 00:41:24.190
60 to 80 hours by 15,
14 populated,
already increased.

614
00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:27.520
It had risen to over a hundred hours and it doesn't,

615
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:32.140
and then it keeps going and it doesn't come back down to 100 hours until the

616
00:41:32.141 --> 00:41:37.030
1880s.
So we're talking very,
very late.
The people are,

617
00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:40.370
are not,
not living better.
Uh,

618
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.590
the wages of German workers,

619
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:45.830
again measured in grain because prices go up and down,

620
00:41:45.831 --> 00:41:49.850
but how much grain can you buy with your work as the important number fell

621
00:41:49.851 --> 00:41:53.720
roughly 50% between 1,516 50.

622
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:58.550
The percentage of males in Frankfurt in Germany with enough property to be

623
00:41:58.551 --> 00:42:01.610
citizens fell from 75% in 17,

624
00:42:01.611 --> 00:42:05.630
23 to 33%.
In 1811.

625
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:11.200
We're watching the population get impoverished massive unemployment in Germany

626
00:42:11.931 --> 00:42:14.630
because wages to fall below subsistence levels,

627
00:42:14.631 --> 00:42:19.631
especially in the 1840s and living standards in Germany showed no signs of

628
00:42:21.231 --> 00:42:24.260
improvement before 1850 at the earliest.

629
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:29.090
So we're talking very modern times,
well into the industrial revolution

630
00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:35.480
and things are not getting,
getting better.
You look at per capita income,
again,

631
00:42:35.481 --> 00:42:38.210
population's growing,
the total national economy is growing,

632
00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:43.040
but per capita you're not improving.
In England,

633
00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:47.900
buying power started falling in the 15 hundreds and didn't recover to that level

634
00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:52.880
until well into the 19th century in Paris.

635
00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:56.400
Uh,
bread consumption did not increase per capita,

636
00:42:56.401 --> 00:43:01.401
but did not increase between 1637 in 1854 pasture land didn't increase.

637
00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.950
So the same amount of meat basically,
uh,

638
00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.310
was produced with some improvement because of some calibrating a,

639
00:43:10.311 --> 00:43:14.870
but now it was divided among more people.
And not only that,

640
00:43:14.871 --> 00:43:18.920
but because potatoes had come in and potatoes could keep more people alive.

641
00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:23.990
A lot of pasture land was taken away from pasture land and put into potatoes.

642
00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.500
So basically,
uh,

643
00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:30.320
meet became very scarce in European diets.
And again,

644
00:43:30.321 --> 00:43:33.350
it decreased between the late Middle Ages in 1800.

645
00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:37.490
It doesn't start recovering.
A forest did not increase,

646
00:43:37.491 --> 00:43:40.640
in fact were cut down to have more land for agriculture.

647
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:45.170
So would become scarce for housing,
for heating,
uh,
for,

648
00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:47.720
for heating houses.
We're building housing and so forth.

649
00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:55.120
And so what happened during this period is that people standard of living was

650
00:43:56.301 --> 00:43:59.450
going down.
They managed to stay alive.
They had to work harder and harder.

651
00:43:59.451 --> 00:44:03.770
The hours that they work to get to maintain themselves alive,
uh,

652
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:08.450
kept increasing.
And yet they didn't make any progress.

653
00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.900
And so we're talking about Ballpark,

654
00:44:11.901 --> 00:44:14.870
a hundred years into the industrial revolution,

655
00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:17.030
which we now that's what you're learning in high school.

656
00:44:17.031 --> 00:44:21.830
The industrial I've learned in such a wonderful thing and an improved incomes

657
00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:25.520
and the modern world is true to the industrial revolution.
But in actual fact,

658
00:44:25.521 --> 00:44:29.450
the data shows that's really not the case.
That for about a hundred years,

659
00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.570
the industrial revolution,
uh,
or making tremendous progress.

660
00:44:33.571 --> 00:44:36.270
And then total national economies are growing very big.

661
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:40.800
The per capita income of all,
but the very upper classes doesn't really grow.

662
00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:45.150
And so by this time,
of course my office is dead and,

663
00:44:45.151 --> 00:44:49.470
but we know he's been laughing in his grave because he was very controversial.

664
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:50.910
Uh,
when he was alive,

665
00:44:50.911 --> 00:44:55.200
he was very controversial and it really wasn't until the Irish potato famine

666
00:44:55.290 --> 00:45:00.290
about which you've read and massive numbers of people died for a lack of

667
00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:05.820
resources,
a bug guy killing the potatoes.

668
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:10.770
Then people said,
oh yeah,
maltose was right.
And then it kept going.
So,

669
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.113
uh,

670
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:17.040
his idea that progress could be just eaten up by population growth turns out to

671
00:45:17.041 --> 00:45:19.600
be a characteristic of,

672
00:45:19.601 --> 00:45:24.150
of many hundreds of years of European history and the rest of the world also.

673
00:45:24.151 --> 00:45:24.984
Of course,

674
00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:30.300
now an amazing thing happens in this to start changing the story.

675
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:35.910
And it happens in France.
I mean,
what happens?
The French,
which looked up until,

676
00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:40.050
uh,
about 1800,
17,
50 or so,

677
00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:44.400
look like any other population in Europe,
they had lots and lots of children,

678
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.130
but then they stopped having a lot of children.

679
00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:51.030
It just came out of the blue a and what change?

680
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:55.350
The age of marriage didn't change a lot.
So that wasn't the cause of it.

681
00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:58.200
The age at first,
first birth didn't cause a lot.

682
00:45:58.201 --> 00:46:02.940
They weren't getting married then delaying childbirth that stayed about the
same.

683
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:07.200
The interval between babies didn't change very much.

684
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.760
So they were not,
uh,

685
00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:13.290
using a much control within marriage.

686
00:46:13.291 --> 00:46:16.770
Apparently once they got married and they just started popping out babies,

687
00:46:17.970 --> 00:46:21.540
but they stopped having children at a young age.

688
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:26.190
So the age of land,
while the age at first birth doesn't change much.

689
00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.070
The agent last birth changes by 10 years.

690
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:33.570
Families stop having children about 10 years earlier,

691
00:46:33.571 --> 00:46:38.571
chopping out a very large fraction of their fertile years.

692
00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:43.080
And this behavior is called stopping behavior.

693
00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:46.470
And we see it all around the world eventually.

694
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.090
Well no one understood what was going on,
but they were horrified.
They knew,

695
00:46:51.091 --> 00:46:52.790
they knew it was happening.
It was a,

696
00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:56.400
people are well aware of it and there were quite horrified by it.

697
00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:01.560
So any of you have watched television know that John Adams and his wife,
Abigail,

698
00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:06.930
uh,
went to Europe about that time?
I think it was 1782.
And,

699
00:47:06.931 --> 00:47:11.100
uh,
she especially was distressed at the French people's quote,

700
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:13.650
feeble commitment to family life,

701
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:18.420
exemplified by the French families only having three or four children rather

702
00:47:18.421 --> 00:47:19.680
than the age or 10 that,

703
00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:23.730
that you were supposed to have Americans at the time we're having eight or nine,

704
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:27.760
they were equally horrified.
This is again from the Adams,

705
00:47:27.761 --> 00:47:30.850
they equally horrified by the French upper classes,

706
00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:35.260
easy acceptance of adultery.
This they found was,

707
00:47:35.261 --> 00:47:37.480
and this is John Adams speaking,
uh,

708
00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:41.440
indication of the general moral and social disintegration.

709
00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:46.780
He said the French are not a moral people.
So,

710
00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:48.003
uh,

711
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:53.400
what happens is all this behavior which was wildly decried by everyone within a

712
00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:58.310
century after France,
uh,
starts doing it,
all of Europe,
uh,

713
00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:03.250
takes off and starts doing the same thing.
So here is

714
00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.090
a graph of that.

715
00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:11.560
This graph starts in a year and we'll talk about it later,

716
00:48:11.561 --> 00:48:15.580
where fertility is already dropped by about 10%.
And here's France.

717
00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:21.120
And this dates that when the fertility changes already been going on to the

718
00:48:21.821 --> 00:48:25.570
1820s,
but it's actually started before that.

719
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:28.750
And then every other country in Europe starts dropping its fertility.

720
00:48:28.751 --> 00:48:33.550
Within this period.
And it goes down by,
uh,

721
00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:38.560
in,
in this space of time by by 30% and enormous change.

722
00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:43.150
So even though France starts it early and everybody is horrified by it,

723
00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:48.220
in fact,
everybody starts copying this.

724
00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:54.280
Um,
and then this is Europe,
but in another century,

725
00:48:54.281 --> 00:48:57.520
Asia and Latin America is follow suit.

726
00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:04.380
So this is really a major change in what it means and how one lives life as,

727
00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:07.090
as a human being.

728
00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:12.040
So I've stressed or the biology of reproduction that there of course we have a

729
00:49:12.041 --> 00:49:14.720
biological drive to,
to,
uh,

730
00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.430
to keep having sex in there that produces children.

731
00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:22.660
The culture or the culture or the religion presses upon people to keep their,

732
00:49:22.661 --> 00:49:25.900
their birth rates up.
And this goes on for them.

733
00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:30.910
Thousands and thousands of years of human history until the [inaudible],

734
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:34.210
the late 18 hundreds,
early for France,

735
00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.590
and then all of a sudden all around Europe and then later in the world of this

736
00:49:38.591 --> 00:49:42.770
very fundamental way of being a human,
uh,

737
00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:43.930
changes.

738
00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:49.720
So the big question in demography since this was noticed a long time ago,

739
00:49:49.721 --> 00:49:54.460
is what caused this change?
Why did all of a sudden,
uh,

740
00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:59.350
w w with no,
you know,
why did this,
all this all happened?

741
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:04.720
The people at the time were absolutely dumbfounded and dumbfounded,

742
00:50:04.721 --> 00:50:08.550
especially that it should happen in France because at that time,
Francis,

743
00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:12.520
at the height of its power,
it was the,
about the richest country in Europe.

744
00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:16.490
It was the most powerful.
It was the most advanced and learning,
uh,

745
00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:19.760
all the philosophic where there,
the encyclopedia was there,
you know,

746
00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.930
it was the top of the world.
And,
you know,
why,

747
00:50:22.931 --> 00:50:24.940
should of all places on earth,

748
00:50:24.941 --> 00:50:29.210
the richest people on Earth Start,
stop,
uh,

749
00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:34.310
having children.
And,
uh,
now that it wasn't important,
at that time,

750
00:50:34.311 --> 00:50:35.870
it wasn't considered to be important.
But of course,

751
00:50:35.871 --> 00:50:37.610
France has a totally Catholic country.

752
00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.230
And so why should a Catholic country be the first one a and way ahead of

753
00:50:42.231 --> 00:50:46.160
everyone else?
Uh,
to reduce its first first rate?

754
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.490
So historians have come up with all,
we don't know the answer,

755
00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:54.620
but let me tell you that right out.
Uh,
but historians do have lots of answers,

756
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:57.520
uh,
for it.
And,
uh,

757
00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.950
one of the reasons for the French fertility decline,

758
00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:05.870
why in the moral and religious reassessments that occurred in the tumultuous

759
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:10.520
years of the French Revolution.
And for sure a moral,
uh,

760
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:15.110
re,
uh,
realignment was certainly taking place.

761
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:20.330
How many of you know the madame Bovary the novel and what's it a novel?

762
00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.010
What's the central piece of the novel?

763
00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:25.113
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

764
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:28.900
<v 0>it's an adulterous affair,
right?
So here,
here's a woman,</v>

765
00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:34.030
a young married woman has a child and she has a perfectly nice husband who

766
00:51:34.031 --> 00:51:35.920
adores her and is quite permissive.
You know,

767
00:51:35.921 --> 00:51:40.630
she really has nothing objective to complain about,
but she considers him boring.

768
00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:46.300
And so she takes an exciting lover or series of,
of lovers.

769
00:51:46.450 --> 00:51:48.250
And so I'm not going to give away the plot,

770
00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:53.710
but the book was taken as a justification for having extra marital affairs.

771
00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:57.310
Now that's okay for men and women has been okay for Matt,
but here's a woman,

772
00:51:57.970 --> 00:52:02.580
him trusting me,
this,
this,
this flow.
Baird justifying a woman's having,
uh,

773
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:05.710
uh,
an extra metal fair,
not because the husband was beating her or anything.

774
00:52:05.711 --> 00:52:10.390
It's perfectly decent guy.
So that was considered terrible.

775
00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.033
And,
uh,

776
00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:16.060
he was promptly arrested and prosecuted by the government for code of fronting

777
00:52:16.061 --> 00:52:20.080
religious morality.
And of course that was very good for sales of the book.

778
00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:24.730
So everybody read that book,
including a lot of us still at Yale.

779
00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:29.220
So,
uh,
people were,
uh,

780
00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:32.980
the rest of Europe are well aware of the French lead in this and an English

781
00:52:32.981 --> 00:52:33.850
speaking countries.

782
00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:38.410
France was blamed for the problem and especially French novels.

783
00:52:38.770 --> 00:52:43.390
And they were,
they were,
they were,
they were corrupting a,
our people.

784
00:52:43.391 --> 00:52:47.020
They were fomenting extramarital liaisons and by implication,

785
00:52:47.021 --> 00:52:48.400
the use of contraception.

786
00:52:50.650 --> 00:52:54.910
But this spreads very rapidly.
So who knows the plot of Anna Karenina,

787
00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:01.180
an adulterous affair,
right.
And again,
her husband wasn't quite as nice as,
as,

788
00:53:01.330 --> 00:53:06.030
as Bovary.
Uh,
he was kind of a stiff guy,
but he wasn't beating her.

789
00:53:06.031 --> 00:53:10.770
And you know,
he wasn't really a bad guy.
She goes off and has a wild affair.

790
00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:14.220
And that Warren piece in endocrine hormone and the brothers Karamazov,
you know,

791
00:53:14.221 --> 00:53:19.221
one of the three greatest Russian novels are exactly on this same mode as full

792
00:53:20.791 --> 00:53:22.900
Bayer.
And they're all,
uh,

793
00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:28.280
really talking about this change in attitude toward fertility and sexuality that

794
00:53:29.791 --> 00:53:32.910
was overcoming Europe at this time.

795
00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:37.290
So much later,

796
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:41.130
not that much later after the European fertility transition was over,

797
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:45.690
which only lasts till about 1930 by nine it starts in 1870.

798
00:53:45.691 --> 00:53:46.530
You'll see these dates,

799
00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:50.220
the fertility drops out except for France starts in about 18,

800
00:53:50.221 --> 00:53:52.500
17 is all over by 1930.

801
00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:56.190
And social scientists start thinking about this fertility rob,

802
00:53:56.370 --> 00:54:01.050
but not in moralistic terms anymore,
not how it was ruining our morals,

803
00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:05.160
but in terms of sort of quantifiable explanations.

804
00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.030
And so the major,
you know,
again,
and asking this,

805
00:54:09.031 --> 00:54:12.360
which is probably the most important question in all the social sciences,

806
00:54:12.361 --> 00:54:13.110
you know,

807
00:54:13.110 --> 00:54:17.400
most the most important change in how it is to be a human and

808
00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:20.760
what is the cause of this.

809
00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:24.600
So they did a very massive project and we'll have a guest speaker who is one of

810
00:54:24.601 --> 00:54:29.250
the main,
uh,
people in this Michael title mound that they,

811
00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:30.080
they,
they,

812
00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:33.300
they set up what they call an office of population research and they divvy to

813
00:54:33.301 --> 00:54:37.710
every graduate student got a different country in Europe and he went into that

814
00:54:37.711 --> 00:54:41.850
country and looked at all the provincial records and dug out everything they

815
00:54:41.851 --> 00:54:42.684
could find.

816
00:54:43.050 --> 00:54:47.670
And they got massive statistics on everything they could figure out about every

817
00:54:47.671 --> 00:54:49.470
province in Europe and not only western Europe,

818
00:54:49.471 --> 00:54:52.680
but all the way across Europe into Russia.

819
00:54:53.250 --> 00:54:57.900
And so it was the most,
probably the most massive social science,
uh,

820
00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:01.080
investigation that that ever took place.

821
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:04.110
And,
uh,

822
00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:10.280
what had come up by that time already was kind of a Schema of what's what we now

823
00:55:12.571 --> 00:55:14.280
called the demographic transition.

824
00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:19.020
So I've shown you how the death rate,
there's,
there's no particular dates.

825
00:55:19.021 --> 00:55:23.310
This is sort of very generalized kind of idea that the death rate,

826
00:55:23.311 --> 00:55:28.020
the first thing that happens at home is that the death rate falls,
right.

827
00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:32.490
And then at some time later,
the birth rate falls.

828
00:55:32.491 --> 00:55:35.880
And I lastly this,
early on I just grabbed it,

829
00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:39.900
dropping the death rate and now we see that sometime later the birth rate

830
00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:44.640
happens.
Well,
what happens in between is this population growth.

831
00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:48.840
In old times,
the birth rate was very high in the death rate was very high,

832
00:55:48.990 --> 00:55:51.600
but they're pretty,
nearly matched.
The little bit of different.

833
00:55:51.601 --> 00:55:55.560
So population does grow,
but it grows very slowly.
When it's all over,

834
00:55:55.830 --> 00:55:59.400
the birth rate is low and the death rate is low.
Again,

835
00:55:59.401 --> 00:56:02.220
there's a little difference in population grows slowly or nowadays,

836
00:56:02.221 --> 00:56:03.054
and a lot of Europe,

837
00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:07.620
the birth rate goes below the death rate and population decreases somewhat

838
00:56:07.621 --> 00:56:10.680
slowly button.
There's no super rapid change here.

839
00:56:10.681 --> 00:56:12.330
There's no big rapid change here,

840
00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:17.400
but in between the death and the death rate falls and the time and the birth

841
00:56:17.401 --> 00:56:18.240
rate falls,

842
00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:23.720
all of this is population growth because the birth rate is above the death rate.

843
00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:29.740
So this is the period of the population explosions and the first of these

844
00:56:29.741 --> 00:56:32.860
populations versions was in Europe,
not in the poor countries,

845
00:56:32.861 --> 00:56:37.150
not in the developing world,
but in the richest part of the world at that time.

846
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:38.890
Which was huge was Europe.

847
00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:43.720
The same Schema is supposed to apply uh,
later on.

848
00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:47.260
So this is uh,

849
00:56:48.610 --> 00:56:53.610
as an empirical generalization medium that some countries fit this.

850
00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:57.310
Nobody is terribly far from this,

851
00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:01.690
that the birth rate and the death rate always go down in some relationship to

852
00:57:01.691 --> 00:57:06.260
each other.
But the question which arises is,
is it,

853
00:57:06.261 --> 00:57:10.240
is the correlation good enough that the death rate actually co the dropping the

854
00:57:10.241 --> 00:57:13.870
death rate actually causes the drop in the birth rate.

855
00:57:14.350 --> 00:57:19.350
And the theory runs in a rather obvious way that parents know how many children

856
00:57:20.231 --> 00:57:24.550
they want.
They know roughly how many children and they can keep alive,

857
00:57:24.551 --> 00:57:27.070
how much farm land they have to give them to inherit,

858
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:31.270
how many they need to take care of them in their old,

859
00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:36.540
old age when the death rate is very high and not only high but very variable.

860
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:40.870
I showed you last time in Sweden though,

861
00:57:40.871 --> 00:57:44.380
the death rate going up and down when the death rate is high in variable,

862
00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:46.600
you don't know if you have a lot of children,

863
00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:49.420
you don't know how many are going to survive.

864
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:54.630
So you need not only as many children's you want and taking into account the

865
00:57:55.061 --> 00:57:58.180
death rate,
but in taking into account the variability of the death rate,

866
00:57:58.181 --> 00:58:01.690
what if an epidemic comes through when my kids are young?

867
00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.960
So you have to have a lot of children,
uh,

868
00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:08.740
in order to ensure that in your old age you'll have some to take care of you

869
00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:14.050
as the death rate falls people gradually real.
The I,

870
00:58:14.051 --> 00:58:18.100
the theory is that people gradually realize this and they reduced their

871
00:58:18.101 --> 00:58:22.990
fertility because they don't need to to bear so many children in order to have

872
00:58:22.991 --> 00:58:25.450
so many left at the end because the children,

873
00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:29.470
they start getting confidence that the children are not going to die.

874
00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:34.270
So this is a lovely theory.
And how many of you have have heard that?

875
00:58:34.271 --> 00:58:36.960
Some version of that?
Yeah.
No,
it's one of the,

876
00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:41.560
you'll see it as about 10 standard versions,
theories about why fertility falls.

877
00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.140
This is number one,
that,

878
00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:47.800
that it's the fall in the death rate causes the fall in the birth rate.

879
00:58:48.070 --> 00:58:48.910
So now we're going to,

880
00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:54.010
this is look and see how accurate that this is.

881
00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:56.650
So this is uh,

882
00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.920
Norway actually and here is the death rate.

883
00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:07.240
This black line from Norway and it starts falling from about,

884
00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:08.383
uh,

885
00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:13.890
middle of the 17 hundreds and pretty continuous fall during all this time right

886
00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:19.810
here is the birth rate pretty constant across here.

887
00:59:19.930 --> 00:59:22.350
And then it finally starts falling,
uh,

888
00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:26.630
in its 1900,
I think.

889
00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:31.900
So there's a long a time period between when the birth rate starts falling and

890
00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:33.411
when the,
sorry,

891
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:36.980
when the death rate starts falling and when the birth rate starts flowing.

892
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:38.840
The difference between those coats is,

893
00:59:38.850 --> 00:59:42.710
is this line here that all of this is population growth.

894
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:47.270
And in this period here where the death rate is quite a ways down,

895
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:49.850
but the birth rate hasn't responded very much yet.

896
00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:54.500
The Norwegian population grows by this,
this amount.

897
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:57.080
So that standard,
that's the way it's supposed to work.

898
00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:59.390
That's the way the scheme of shows it working.

899
01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:05.300
But now you're look at England and England and Wales

900
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:11.090
and you don't get this picture.

901
01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.700
Here is a fertility,

902
01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:18.380
the gray thing and fertility starts dropping.
As I said,
around 1870,
maybe 80.

903
01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:20.960
This shows a little bit after 1875 or so,

904
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:26.060
and then it drops rather continuously.
This is fertility.

905
01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:27.800
Infant mortality,

906
01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:31.550
which is good measure of total mortality doesn't really start dropping.

907
01:00:31.551 --> 01:00:35.240
It's pretty constant ups and downs until like 19,

908
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:39.170
1905 or something like that.
And it only starts going down.

909
01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:44.680
So here it's the reverse situation that now you have fertility falling first and

910
01:00:46.011 --> 01:00:48.380
mortality falling later.

911
01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:51.860
And you can make a causal explanation for this,
that well,

912
01:00:51.861 --> 01:00:56.150
when people are having lots and lots of kids,
they can't take care of them.

913
01:00:56.151 --> 01:00:57.800
They don't have enough food,
they don't have enough this,

914
01:00:57.801 --> 01:01:02.690
that and the other thing.
So there's very high death rate among the children,
but,

915
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:06.830
uh,
if you dropped your fertility,
you have more resources for each child.

916
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:10.970
And that's actually as compelling,
uh,
uh,

917
01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:14.150
an explanation ne without,
in the absence of data as,

918
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:16.640
as the reverse explanation.

919
01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:23.150
And,
uh,
if you look,
uh,
across many,
many countries,

920
01:01:23.151 --> 01:01:27.890
which the Princeton project did,
uh,
this is,
uh,

921
01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:33.020
the drop in the mortality rate,
this graph,

922
01:01:33.021 --> 01:01:35.870
and this is the drop in the fertility rate.

923
01:01:36.410 --> 01:01:39.470
And this is the years,

924
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:44.470
same year starts in 1825 this 1975 1975 so this is the period when the change

925
01:01:45.831 --> 01:01:49.550
was happening and for fertility here,

926
01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:53.690
this period is when birth rate has already come down by about 10% you'll see

927
01:01:53.691 --> 01:01:58.691
that some kind of a threshold and when it's down then by something like 30% I

928
01:01:58.781 --> 01:02:03.230
think it ends and mortality has also its limits.

929
01:02:03.231 --> 01:02:06.890
This is the period when mortality is falling in Norway and Denmark and Sweden

930
01:02:06.891 --> 01:02:09.770
and England and Wales and so forth and all.

931
01:02:09.771 --> 01:02:13.700
You have to look at the order of these things as if Tonia for fertility.

932
01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:17.510
France is the first one by a long shot.
It starts,

933
01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:22.350
they put it in the early 18 hundreds it's down by 10% already and it's all over

934
01:02:22.351 --> 01:02:26.550
by 1900 or so France way ahead in time of anybody else.

935
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:30.160
Now you look at the mortality and you say,
well,
where is France?
It's not no,

936
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:34.080
right?
It's not.
Their market's not Sweden.
Ooh,
where are,
where's France?
Uh,

937
01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:39.300
what do I even see?
France?
Yeah,
there it is.

938
01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:44.220
It's way in the middle of the pack.
Oh,
that doesn't fit the theory.

939
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:48.210
And he go the other way.
Norway is the first one to drop.
It's mortality rate.

940
01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:51.570
And where is Norway more or less than the middle of the pack when you look at

941
01:02:51.571 --> 01:02:56.480
fertility.
So these two things don't correlate as nicely.

942
01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:01.260
Again,
this is the Princeton project don't correlate as nicely as the theory,
uh,

943
01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:03.330
would have us do.

944
01:03:04.450 --> 01:03:08.490
And the end result of all these graduate students studying the relationship

945
01:03:08.491 --> 01:03:11.390
between mortality and fertility was the,

946
01:03:12.410 --> 01:03:15.930
that we don't know what's going on because we saw everything under the sun.

947
01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.180
There's no very strong correlation
and,

948
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:23.640
but they were very smart and they tried all kinds of things.

949
01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:28.640
And another way you can look at it is to see at what level of uh,

950
01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:34.710
mortality may be looking at.
Years is not the right thing,

951
01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:36.330
but the level of mortality.

952
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:40.770
So they looked at infant mortality levels,
uh,

953
01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:45.690
at the time when the fertility dropped.
And what you have is in France,

954
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:49.410
the infant mortality is still very high.
You know,
just infants,

955
01:03:49.411 --> 01:03:52.800
it's not total mortality in window almost 300 here.

956
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.210
When France strops starts dropping its fertility,

957
01:03:56.380 --> 01:04:01.200
sometime this,
they puts it something that somewhere in the late 17,

958
01:04:01.201 --> 01:04:03.770
hundreds of fertility started dropping and the,

959
01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:08.640
the informer tower was still very high.
And then you can go around the world,

960
01:04:08.641 --> 01:04:13.620
all different kinds of places.
Japan,
160,
Norway a hundred,

961
01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:17.670
that it doesn't seem to be any kind of commonality here in what the infant

962
01:04:17.671 --> 01:04:22.220
mortality actually was when fertility,
uh,
uh,

963
01:04:22.260 --> 01:04:26.850
drops.
And remember the 400 is sort of the,
the,

964
01:04:26.851 --> 01:04:29.310
the primitive level.
And actually when you go into Asia,

965
01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:34.200
you can see that in places like Taiwan,
uh,
and uh,

966
01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:36.750
Mexico on macro doesn't,

967
01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:40.890
they'd moved from Asia that at Mexico and Taiwan,

968
01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:45.580
the mortality was a 35,
uh,
a hundred,
uh,

969
01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:49.080
was 35 so very close to the,

970
01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:53.130
to the primitive level where you can just keep your society going and yet

971
01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:57.390
fertility starts dropping.
So basically you see the whole,
the whole range,

972
01:04:58.140 --> 01:05:00.490
the whole range is something like 35 or 40,

973
01:05:00.491 --> 01:05:03.150
and you don't keep your society live less than that.

974
01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:06.360
And Modern Japan will be at this time be about five.

975
01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.290
And you see that and the range is what you actually see is this whole range

976
01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:15.320
anywhere in that range of what a mortality levels people actually achieve can be

977
01:05:15.871 --> 01:05:19.660
the range at which,
uh,
fertility starts to fall.

978
01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:25.690
So there's no real conclusion possible.
Okay.

979
01:05:25.691 --> 01:05:28.090
What's explanation number two?
That you all have heard?

980
01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:35.200
Economic Development,
right?
How many have heard that explanation?
Oh,

981
01:05:35.210 --> 01:05:37.060
not so many.
That's very stand.

982
01:05:37.061 --> 01:05:41.230
The whole Reagan Reagan on the whole Reagan policy was,

983
01:05:41.231 --> 01:05:43.840
and for a lot of lot of the world was that,

984
01:05:43.841 --> 01:05:46.480
forget about family planning and pushing that,

985
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:50.380
that economic development is what reduces fertility.

986
01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:54.610
So that's a very good theory also.
And uh,

987
01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.280
we can look at it and wow,

988
01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:02.460
the data looks pretty good down here is per capita income in each of these is a

989
01:06:03.131 --> 01:06:07.960
separate country here.
And Wow,
for every country,

990
01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:11.770
as per capita income goes up,
fertility comes down.

991
01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:17.440
It can come down a fairly straight line or can do some wiggles and jiggles.

992
01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:22.060
But basically as per capita income goes up,
uh,

993
01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:25.660
fertility goes down.
You like that theory,

994
01:06:27.210 --> 01:06:32.090
but there's some problems with it.
So how much money does it take,
uh,

995
01:06:32.110 --> 01:06:35.530
to keep people out of bed basically?
Well,

996
01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:40.930
the French start dropping their fertility when their per capita income is

997
01:06:40.931 --> 01:06:45.120
something like 180.
Uh,
this is in a

998
01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:51.820
converted to basically dollars $180 a year,
50 cents a day.

999
01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:56.650
Back then there was more money than now.
Keeps,
keeps the Frenchmen out of bed.

1000
01:06:57.550 --> 01:07:01.690
Now anybody who of Italian extraction will be very proud to realize that it

1001
01:07:01.691 --> 01:07:06.150
takes the Italians oh,
twice as much.
360 or something to keep them.

1002
01:07:06.151 --> 01:07:10.710
But so we have now scientifically and quantitatively proven that Italians like

1003
01:07:10.711 --> 01:07:15.130
definitely sexy and French people.
Right.
And then you go along,

1004
01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:17.410
he has the Germans a little bit stolid here.

1005
01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:22.620
And of course who we had exactly the opposite of what we presume that,

1006
01:07:23.321 --> 01:07:25.420
you know,
the English is supposed to be sold straight,

1007
01:07:25.421 --> 01:07:26.770
that they don't do it at all.

1008
01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:30.880
And yet in order to keep the British out of bed,

1009
01:07:30.910 --> 01:07:32.500
you have to really pay them an awful lot.

1010
01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:37.500
They have to be somewhere between 700 and $800 in income.

1011
01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:44.400
So there doesn't seem to be any particular number of income and it has a huge

1012
01:07:45.221 --> 01:07:49.930
range,
uh,
that is required before people drop their fertility.

1013
01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:53.830
And when you think about it a little,
uh,
more,

1014
01:07:54.130 --> 01:07:56.300
this whole way of looking at it is,

1015
01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:00.250
is not a very convincing because here's per capita income,

1016
01:08:00.550 --> 01:08:05.440
but we're talking about the time of industrialization and after fertility starts

1017
01:08:05.441 --> 01:08:09.340
dropping,
so once fertility starts dropping,
per capita income does start rising.

1018
01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:12.520
That's sort of the most important take home message for day.

1019
01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:15.860
So I'll say it before,
before time runs out,

1020
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:21.250
that the industrial revolution by itself did really improve the standard of

1021
01:08:21.441 --> 01:08:24.920
living of people up until about 1870.

1022
01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.910
It was tremendous increase in productivity,
tremendous increase in population.

1023
01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:30.530
They cancel each other out.

1024
01:08:30.830 --> 01:08:35.090
And for the average working person in the standard of living does not rise.

1025
01:08:35.570 --> 01:08:40.570
Starting roughly 1870 people drop their fertility rates and the standard of

1026
01:08:41.991 --> 01:08:46.790
living starts rising.
And we see it starts rising all along here.

1027
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:52.130
So if you take any dates from 1870 till today,

1028
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:55.870
our til a few months ago anyway,
uh,

1029
01:08:57.020 --> 01:09:00.740
per capita income is rising everywhere in Europe.
At different rates,

1030
01:09:00.741 --> 01:09:02.030
but everywhere in Europe.

1031
01:09:02.690 --> 01:09:07.400
So anything is progressing in everything that you can measure about Europe,

1032
01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:12.080
changes in what we call monotonic.
And in a single drink,
education goes up,

1033
01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:17.030
urbanization goes up,
the number of the year a go goes up,

1034
01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:20.150
everything women's education goes up,
women's education goes up,

1035
01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:25.250
anything that you can think of goes up and fertility goes down.

1036
01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:26.960
So when you make graphs like that,

1037
01:09:26.961 --> 01:09:31.180
anything that you put on this axis is going up this,

1038
01:09:31.181 --> 01:09:34.490
this handy per capita income.
It could be education,
industrialization,

1039
01:09:34.491 --> 01:09:38.090
urbanization,
and fertility is falling during this period.

1040
01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:43.091
So any two variables that you put together will give you similar graph to this

1041
01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:48.620
and it tells you absolutely nothing except the only thing you can think of that,

1042
01:09:48.621 --> 01:09:53.420
well,
there is no particular level of income which causes people to drop.

1043
01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:57.830
When you get into the developing worlds,
the levels of way,
way below,
uh,
they're,

1044
01:09:57.831 --> 01:10:01.340
they're out,
they're out here and they start dropping their,

1045
01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.920
their fertility levels.

1046
01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:10.060
So they repeated this over and over again for all kinds of hypotheses.

1047
01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:12.073
Um,

1048
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:17.650
and they always got the same kind of answer that nothing really correlated very

1049
01:10:19.491 --> 01:10:20.324
well.

1050
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:25.390
Literacy is another answer that when people start getting more worldly because

1051
01:10:25.821 --> 01:10:29.470
they can read.
And fertility began to fall.

1052
01:10:29.471 --> 01:10:33.410
One literacy rates were very low in France,
in Bulgaria and Hungary,

1053
01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:38.030
but literacy was already very high in England and Wales when its fertility fell,

1054
01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:40.680
urbanization,
uh,

1055
01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:44.960
the British fertility decline when it began in Britain in 1870,

1056
01:10:44.961 --> 01:10:49.961
72% of the British were ready in what are called conurbations in urban urban

1057
01:10:51.501 --> 01:10:56.150
settings,
but in France,
and they started a hundred years earlier,
uh,
very,
very,

1058
01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:59.780
uh,
low level.
So I want to continue this,

1059
01:10:59.781 --> 01:11:01.970
but that Princeton project was a massive,

1060
01:11:01.971 --> 01:11:06.971
massive study of all the every socioeconomic variable that you can think of.

1061
01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:11.170
All the theories.
Well,
the 10 theories that you hear around and,

1062
01:11:11.171 --> 01:11:12.920
and from your friends and think yourself,

1063
01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:18.260
none of them really worked out as something you could really nail to fertility

1064
01:11:18.871 --> 01:11:23.520
drops because infant mortality drops or income goes,

1065
01:11:23.521 --> 01:11:26.100
opera education goes up or any of these sorts of things.

1066
01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:30.100
So next time we will continue and,
uh,

1067
01:11:30.390 --> 01:11:33.720
tell you at least what the Princeton people thought was the real cards.
