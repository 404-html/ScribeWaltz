WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.530
So today we have,
uh,
our first.
Okay.

2
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.600
Today we have our first guest lecturer.
Uh,
my pleasure.
Thank you.
Do,

3
00:00:09.601 --> 00:00:12.060
we'll be introducing you to a Dr. Michael title down.

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.560
And he was an undergraduate at Reed College,
uh,

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.700
where he double majored in biology and sociology.
That's,

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.750
that's an interesting combination and was five Beta Kappa and at the end of that

7
00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:26.910
became a road scholar.
So how many,

8
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.770
how many prospective Rhodes scholars do we have in the class?
Who knows?

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.780
Then he went to Oxford as a biologist to study reproductive biology.

10
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.710
And your adviser died.
Is that your adviser died?
Well,

11
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.680
first he was paralyzed.
He died a horrible,

12
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:50.940
slow death.
Yes.
Yeah.
Something bad happens,
something terrible happen.

13
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.280
You then got into the statistical and quantitative aspects of that and that

14
00:00:56.281 --> 00:01:00.610
eventually he got a phd in demography itself.
Uh,

15
00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.170
and since then he's come back to America and he's taught at Oxford,

16
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.850
then Princeton and here at Yale.

17
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.120
And unlike most academics,

18
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.510
he actually has ventured into the real world.
Uh,

19
00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.520
although I'm not sure these things are really real world,

20
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:20.430
like the u s government,
somewhat unreal.

21
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.030
And he was a staff director of the select committee on population for the US

22
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.330
House of Representatives.

23
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.230
And then he was yours commissioner for the study of international migration and

24
00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:36.120
cooperative economic development.
So that pretty important.
Uh,

25
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.850
he has been with the Ford Foundation,

26
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.490
the Carnegie Endowment for Peace International Peace.

27
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.800
And he's now with the Alfred Sloan Foundation where he's been a vice president

28
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.540
and in charge of science and technology programs for them.

29
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.650
He's been on the advisory Boards and National Academy of Sciences,

30
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:59.640
National Institutes of Health,

31
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.150
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

32
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.450
He's authored seven books that I could only find four,
one,

33
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.150
two,
three,
four.

34
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.750
So in addition to your reading packet,
which I hope you've all picked up,

35
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.340
and this is just your reading for tonight,
you can do all that.

36
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.890
Uh,
uh,
fine.
In addition to the,
to this is half his books,

37
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.490
a five major government reports,
75 articles,
et cetera.

38
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.220
So,
uh,
and one of his major contributions is what we,

39
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.460
one of the topics we've just been just finished discussing.
Uh,
he wrote,

40
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.210
I think I mentioned this to you during the lecture that the part of the

41
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:43.950
Princeton project on Britain,
the book on the British fertility decline,
there's,

42
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.230
there's the author and uh,
the,
uh,

43
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:51.900
the times higher education supplement,
which is tough,

44
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.920
wrote on that book and unsurpassed profusion of original data presented at

45
00:02:57.211 --> 00:03:01.000
analyzed with clarity all too often lacking in works of this time.

46
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.860
The book is invaluable.

47
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.300
It clarifies and orders to complex range of forces which underlie the modern

48
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:11.590
decline in rates of fertility,
et cetera.
He's also,
uh,

49
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:16.591
worked on a global environmental issues and population and resources.

50
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.480
The book,
this environmental,

51
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.440
my book is one of the best expectations.
So you have the honor,

52
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.900
not only for the lecture today,

53
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.760
but he's agreed to come to dinner and all the students were invited.

54
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.050
Uh,
we're going to be at,
at Timothy Dwight starting at five 30.

55
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.630
And I know you have other things.
If you can't,

56
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.960
we'll probably have a leasurly casual and leasurly dinner.
So,
uh,

57
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.960
if you can't get there,
five 30,
come when you can.

58
00:03:43.961 --> 00:03:47.800
If you have something else afterwards leaving me,
come,
come and go.
But TD,

59
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.730
there's some sort of a,

60
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.890
of a small dining room and TD and so you can come for that.

61
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.773
Okay.

62
00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.310
In the last lecture we discussed the fertility decline in Europe and then on

63
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:04.630
Tuesday we discussed how this fertility decline in discuss started discussing

64
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.740
has continued in Europe and spread around the world.

65
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.430
I showed you a graph of the declining fertility rate globally

66
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.640
and in the developed countries.
So in the world as a whole,

67
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.920
as you've been told,
the uh,

68
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.420
the fertility client has not been enough to keep population from still going up

69
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.320
very rapidly.
We discussed that.
But in Europe,
Japan,

70
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.140
the advanced countries,
the fertility client has,
uh,

71
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.200
caused population come down enough where these countries are now facing rather

72
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:42.010
serious problems of reduced of a,
of a decline,

73
00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.660
possibly declined in their population.
Certainly a change in the age structure.

74
00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.970
And this is what Michael is an expert on.

75
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.120
And so that is what he will discuss today as soon as I show.

76
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.850
<v 1>Well,
thank you very much.
Uh,
Doctor Wyman and his pleasure to be here.</v>

77
00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:02.910
And I just want to say you're a very lucky bunch of undergraduates to have

78
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.730
Robert Wyman as your professor.
Uh,
he's,
uh,
I,

79
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:12.400
I've heard him lecture and I know him and he's a wonderful,
uh,

80
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.090
academic and scholar.
Um,

81
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.670
going through that list of,
um,

82
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.310
going through that list of publications,
uh,

83
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.340
makes me realize why my wife has been so annoyed with me for the 40 years nearly

84
00:05:29.891 --> 00:05:34.891
that we'd been married because a lot of that work has had to be done when I

85
00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:37.390
wasn't an academic.

86
00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.930
And that means it comes out of your hide or out of your summer holidays or

87
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.610
weekends or evenings.
But it's,
uh,
interesting,

88
00:05:48.611 --> 00:05:53.490
exciting and wonderful to do and,
and I've enjoyed doing it.
Uh,

89
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.280
I know that you've been discussing,
uh,
cause I've seen your prospectus for this,

90
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.890
uh,
excellent course.
Uh,
I know you've been discussing,
um,

91
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.460
high fertility rates and the demographic transition and you know,

92
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:11.360
therefore that high fertility has attracted a great deal of attention,
um,

93
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.850
for at least two centuries.
Um,
uh,

94
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:20.540
and has always been related to poverty issues,

95
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:22.580
concerns about poverty under development,

96
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.290
developing countries and so on or poverty back in the,
uh,

97
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.650
in the 18 hundreds when,

98
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:33.710
when Malthus was writing and also related to concerns about the environment and

99
00:06:33.711 --> 00:06:34.430
so on.
What,

100
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.430
what is less known though is that for at least a hundred years of those two

101
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:42.140
centuries,
uh,

102
00:06:42.141 --> 00:06:45.920
there has been discussion about low fertility as a problem as well.

103
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.860
And this has a long,
and,
uh,
I would say tumultuous history,

104
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.780
uh,
lots of proponents,
uh,
worrying about it,

105
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.580
often very prominent people in politics or science,

106
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:07.330
I would say the debates have been plagued by misunderstanding and confusion as

107
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:11.090
have the debates about high fertility.

108
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:16.090
So there's something about population that stimulates misunderstanding and

109
00:07:16.131 --> 00:07:18.800
confusion.
Now,
in general,

110
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:23.801
low fertility has been linked to a decline in power.

111
00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.600
You have to think about this,
and in political and economic terms,

112
00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:32.900
national power empires,
the decline of empires and so on.

113
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.240
But the links have been made,

114
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:38.840
but it's often very fuzzy as to what the causal flow is.
Is,

115
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:43.520
is the low fertility a cause of the decline of empires or decline of national

116
00:07:43.521 --> 00:07:45.080
power,
or is it a symptom?

117
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.700
And often the commentators don't make it very clear what they're talking about.

118
00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.090
Those of you who know the French debates about these issues,

119
00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:58.091
we'll know that it's a very prominent feature of French intellectual discourse

120
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:01.520
going back into the 1870s,
for example.

121
00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.200
But the French are hardly alone in this.
Uh,

122
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.640
you will find many such anxieties expressed in Germany in the 30s in Great

123
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:15.920
Britain,
Sweden,
you asked Russia,
et cetera.
And,
um,

124
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.390
more recently,
let's say over the past four decades or so,
in eastern Europe,

125
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:24.350
in Japan,
in the u s certainly and,
uh,
in,

126
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:28.880
in the Asian Tigers,
uh,
most recently,
uh,
Singapore,

127
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:33.500
Taiwan,
and Korea,
because it's about power,

128
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.250
national power or sub national power,
um,

129
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:42.340
low fertility has long been closely tied to a political ideology and to cultural

130
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:45.650
values.
And in some cases,

131
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:50.651
low fertility is even been used as a tool to achieve desired social policies.

132
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:55.500
Uh,
but I want to make one point that I hope you'll take away from this,

133
00:08:55.501 --> 00:09:00.501
which is that the concern about low fertility has never ever been solely about

134
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:04.560
the number of warm bodies,

135
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.570
human being warm bodies.
That is,
but instead,

136
00:09:09.571 --> 00:09:13.110
it's been visualized through the lens of the socio cultural values.

137
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:15.403
Um,

138
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.600
the reason I say it's never been about warm bodies can be illustrated there

139
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:24.810
because if what I said is not true,

140
00:09:24.811 --> 00:09:29.070
there really could never have been any concern about fertility since at least

141
00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.520
1950.
The world's population,
as you see,

142
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:37.090
has grown dramatically over that half century.
And,
uh,

143
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.670
neither could there be any concern about future,
uh,
population?

144
00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.460
Uh,
demographic trends because the projections,

145
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:46.910
no matter which variant you take from the UN,

146
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.560
all shows substantial growth going forward.

147
00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.640
So in,
in reality,

148
00:09:53.641 --> 00:09:58.641
the fears about low fertility are always framed in terms of regional or national

149
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:05.270
or religious or ethnic or subnational populations defined culturally.

150
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.160
Um,
and I,
I would put it rather crudely if I may,
that,

151
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:16.170
um,
since the onset of mortality declined,

152
00:10:16.171 --> 00:10:19.860
which you've heard about already,
at least two centuries go,

153
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.880
there have never been any shortages of humans.

154
00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:29.250
There have only been perceived or relative shortages of particular kinds of

155
00:10:29.251 --> 00:10:30.084
humans.

156
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:35.070
And the most critical category is national groups in these discussions.

157
00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:38.520
And then you can get into language or religion or the other subgroups.

158
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.660
Uh,
to give you an example of this,
I just want to point out that,
um,

159
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:49.080
when he was mayor of Paris,
the later president of the Republic of France,

160
00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:52.440
Jacques Chirac sheer rock,
uh,

161
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:57.470
he warned about the decline in the population of France.

162
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.990
This is consistent with French,
uh,

163
00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:06.180
perspectives that right to left all French people think that there are too few

164
00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.850
French people.
Uh,
and uh,

165
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:14.990
yet at the same time he urged the repatriation of Arab immigrants and the

166
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.920
restriction of future immigration.

167
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.300
So I mean not a classically shows you that it's not about the number of warm

168
00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:28.410
bodies,
it's about the number of French or bodies in France.

169
00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:33.840
There is no ideological uniformity in these things.

170
00:11:33.841 --> 00:11:36.690
I've already said that in France,
the,

171
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.690
the range of concerns is right from the left to the right,

172
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.370
right across the political spectrum.
A democratic thinkers of um,

173
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:49.140
what you might call liberal in the US are left wing in,
in Europe say,

174
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:54.350
and of conservative orientations have all expressed about this in one form or

175
00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:58.390
another.
Those are democratic thinkers,
non democratic thinkers,

176
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:02.440
so such as the nationalist,
right.
And in Interwar,

177
00:12:02.441 --> 00:12:07.441
Germany and Italy and nationalist parties such as the Front Nazionale and uh,

178
00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:13.410
in France and other European countries have expressed such concerns as has or

179
00:12:14.321 --> 00:12:19.321
have the authoritarian lefts of Stalin and Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania.

180
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.510
There's a whole story about Romania,
which I written about.

181
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.840
If you want to see a bizarre situation read about what the Romanian government

182
00:12:27.881 --> 00:12:32.470
did in 19 in the 1960s on the political right.

183
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.790
Low fertility has generally been seen as a threat to national power,

184
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.800
imperial power or from the point of view of some with a more economics

185
00:12:41.801 --> 00:12:42.980
orientation,
uh,

186
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.930
to the capacity to restrain wages and the power of unions.

187
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.410
Many on the right have also expressed alarm about fertility differentials

188
00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:57.970
between social classes and races,
ethnic groups and so forth.
But frankly,

189
00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.360
such concerns are subliminal,

190
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:06.340
but they're in other political persuasions then than the right.

191
00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.520
And meanwhile,
as I said,

192
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:14.050
the political left has often shared these nationalistic and strategic concerns

193
00:13:14.051 --> 00:13:19.051
in the 1930s Hitler's Germany and adopted very aggressive pro natalist policies

194
00:13:20.021 --> 00:13:24.190
to raise fertility in Germany.
But so did Stalin's USSR,
same time,

195
00:13:24.191 --> 00:13:29.180
same place or different places,
same time,
same policies in many ways.
And there,

196
00:13:29.181 --> 00:13:31.090
then there were the socialist states.

197
00:13:31.091 --> 00:13:34.720
I mentioned John [inaudible] had a very strong pro natalist policy,

198
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.190
but in the meantime,

199
00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:40.570
the People's Republic of China went from prenatal isn't too strong.

200
00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:45.571
The antenatal is probably the most energetic fertility reduction policy in world

201
00:13:46.901 --> 00:13:50.410
history,
same country,
same party in control,

202
00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:55.800
very tick taking population very significantly now in the west,

203
00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.970
the Democratic Left has concentrated generally on the threat posed by low

204
00:14:00.971 --> 00:14:05.971
fertility to their desires to expand and strengthen the the welfare state.

205
00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:09.100
And in fact,
if you look in the 30s,

206
00:14:09.101 --> 00:14:12.430
you'll see a fascinating debate led by the mere dolls,

207
00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:16.870
prominent economists,
Nobel laureates later,
uh,

208
00:14:16.871 --> 00:14:21.871
of the left in Sweden who promoted what came to be called the welfare state to

209
00:14:25.241 --> 00:14:29.020
the conservative parties in Sweden on the grounds that they needed to do

210
00:14:29.021 --> 00:14:32.260
something to raise fertility.
And that was the way to do it.

211
00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:37.570
If they didn't raise fertility,
there would be no Swedes left in 50 years or so.

212
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.560
And they actually co-opted the right successfully into supporting the welfare

213
00:14:41.561 --> 00:14:44.340
state that they promoted.
What about demographers?

214
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:46.810
They've been involved in this stuff.
Yes,
they have,

215
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.150
including some very prominent ones.

216
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:54.500
One reason for this was the discovery.

217
00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:59.530
The development in the 30s by demographers have some very powerful concepts and

218
00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:02.840
techniques.
I don't know if you've actually studied yet.

219
00:15:02.841 --> 00:15:05.870
The intrinsic rate of increase net reproduction rate,

220
00:15:05.871 --> 00:15:09.290
total fertility rate and demographic projection models.

221
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:14.000
All of these being developed tech,
uh,
being technologies developed in the 30s.

222
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.820
Uh,
and these,
um,

223
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:22.330
lead to predictions from demographers that the population of the United Kingdom

224
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.673
for example,

225
00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:29.750
from the 1930s to the 1960s would declined very sharply.

226
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:34.090
And there were some very pathetic novels and,
and uh,

227
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:39.700
and academic books written with titles like twilight of parenthood,

228
00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.493
um,

229
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:46.630
race suicide and other such tomes that forecast using demographic projection

230
00:15:48.171 --> 00:15:51.860
models that there would be too few whatevers.
What's the relevant group?

231
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.820
Now in some respects,
these,
these were flawed predictions.

232
00:15:55.821 --> 00:16:00.821
Obviously it didn't happen and they arose from misunderstanding because these

233
00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:05.810
were new technologies that had only recently been understood and developed and

234
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:10.010
there was a typical excess of enthusiasm,
academic enthusiasm.

235
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.820
They really thought they had developed a window into the distant future.

236
00:16:13.821 --> 00:16:18.530
They could project the population using intrinsic rates of increase and

237
00:16:18.531 --> 00:16:23.531
projection models and they could see 50 years into the future they thought they

238
00:16:24.531 --> 00:16:28.940
were wrong.
All of those projections proved to be empirically wrong.

239
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:34.310
And we know better now because we've seen they were wrong.

240
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.000
It helps to actually see things go so badly wrong,

241
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:43.480
but the same errors of believing demographic projections to be forecasts of

242
00:16:45.731 --> 00:16:50.731
future populations are being made right now as we speak mostly by non

243
00:16:51.771 --> 00:16:53.570
demographers.
Demographers have all learned,

244
00:16:53.571 --> 00:16:58.040
they can't believe projections as predictions.
Uh,

245
00:16:58.041 --> 00:17:01.580
but non demographers haven't learned that lesson or don't want to learn that

246
00:17:01.581 --> 00:17:06.581
lesson and they use these projections to forecast decline of the West decline of

247
00:17:06.621 --> 00:17:09.680
the Soviet Union decline of Russia,
decline of Italy,

248
00:17:09.681 --> 00:17:14.060
whatever category they want to talk about.
What about,

249
00:17:14.061 --> 00:17:18.170
I said there were a few very distinguished demographers who also did this.
Yes.

250
00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:18.800
Um,

251
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:23.800
the most prominent was the great French demographer outlay Sovi a very

252
00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:28.280
distinguished man.
Indeed,
uh,
probably the dean of a French demographers,

253
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.331
uh,

254
00:17:29.331 --> 00:17:34.331
he did this kind of relationship of low fertility equals decline for most of his

255
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:39.260
professional career for 40 years.
Basically.

256
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:44.480
And let me just list for you some of the events in history that he attributed to

257
00:17:45.501 --> 00:17:47.120
fertility rates being too low.

258
00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:53.370
He said the decadence of ancient Athens and then of Rome,

259
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.340
that's item one.
The failure of France to industrialize

260
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:04.590
the decline of the French navy in the 19th century.

261
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.960
The collapse of the French army before the Germans in 1940,

262
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:16.500
he used very evocative language.
Uh,
he said,
uh,
for example,

263
00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:22.130
the terrible failure of 1940 more moral than material must be linked in part to

264
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:27.720
this dangerous sclerosis resulting from low birth rate.

265
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.560
We saw all too often during the occupation,

266
00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.510
German occupation,

267
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:39.050
old men leaning weirdly towards the survival solution at the time that the

268
00:18:41.611 --> 00:18:42.300
young,

269
00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:47.300
that's the resistance we're taking part in the national impulse towards

270
00:18:48.091 --> 00:18:50.340
independence and liberty.

271
00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:56.210
This crucial effect of our senility is it not a grave warning

272
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:03.470
d population for friends carries with it fatally a general legacy of decadence.

273
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:11.300
So you see how powerful the rhetoric can be in this area.

274
00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:17.890
I do want,
do not want you to get the impression that demographers shared.

275
00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:21.970
So these lifelong concern about fertility being too low.

276
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:26.320
To the contrary,
they were not widely shared among demographers.

277
00:19:26.321 --> 00:19:27.610
After all the PR,

278
00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.480
the gloomy forecast of the 30s proved to be wrong.

279
00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:36.940
So the past is one of confusion and anxiety.
What about the future?

280
00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:40.540
I'd say it's likely to be a future of great unpredictability.

281
00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:46.080
The truth is that currently we are in a period of low fertility rates that are

282
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:52.780
without precedent in there.
Lowness if you will,

283
00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:57.840
their smallness and without precedent in how widespread they have become around

284
00:19:58.901 --> 00:20:01.840
the world and having no precedent,

285
00:20:01.841 --> 00:20:06.790
we actually lack any way of knowing if they will continue at the east very low

286
00:20:06.791 --> 00:20:09.550
levels,
if they'll rise somewhat,

287
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:15.630
perhaps even above the magic 2.11 replacement level or could they decline

288
00:20:16.241 --> 00:20:21.241
further two levels such as the league table leaders and low fertility,

289
00:20:21.251 --> 00:20:26.140
which would be surprisingly enough,
Italy,
Spain,
Hong Kong,

290
00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:31.150
we don't know anybody who tells you they know.
Um,

291
00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:34.270
you should not believe.
They have no way of knowing.

292
00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:37.600
We do know that the law,
very low fertility,

293
00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.130
the 30s was short lived and but then it was followed by a substantial baby boom

294
00:20:42.131 --> 00:20:46.510
in some countries that had low fertility in the 30s and not in others.

295
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.850
So all I can say to you is,

296
00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:54.210
why don't you all come back for your 50th reunion at Yale in 50 years and we'll

297
00:20:55.511 --> 00:21:00.511
have a talk about weather fertility rates stayed very low,

298
00:21:00.521 --> 00:21:03.730
went lower or rows in these countries with very low.

299
00:21:03.731 --> 00:21:05.710
That's the only way we're ever going to know

300
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:13.180
this graph will surely be wrong as a prediction.
I will predict that.

301
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:19.450
Uh,
and there's a,
there's an irony here.
Uh,
we,
uh,

302
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:24.510
we had moved from a society in which 90% of women had no effective control over

303
00:21:24.581 --> 00:21:29.050
their fertility to the society in which 90% of women do have effective control

304
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.280
of their fertility,
rational control of their fertility.

305
00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:38.260
The result is that analysts,
demographers,
and you,

306
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.420
um,

307
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:45.420
are less able to rationally anticipate what they will collectively do now that

308
00:21:45.791 --> 00:21:50.170
they individually,
rationally have control over their fertility.

309
00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.790
A very wide range of population projections as plausible.

310
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:59.320
That's just a narrow range compared to some you could do if you wanted to make.

311
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.820
These are quite conservative assumptions on the high side and the low side.

312
00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.430
So under these kinds of conditions of really profound uncertainty,

313
00:22:09.431 --> 00:22:14.431
can we offer any cautious interpretations of historical experience that might

314
00:22:14.981 --> 00:22:18.070
provide us with some kind of insight into the future?
Well,

315
00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:23.110
I'll offer a few and you can shoot me down if you would like to do so.
First.

316
00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:28.170
I think it's nearly inevitable that we'll see populations with much older age

317
00:22:28.331 --> 00:22:29.110
structures,

318
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:34.110
much older age compositions than those of the past.

319
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:37.390
That's the consequence of low fertility.

320
00:22:37.391 --> 00:22:41.080
Of course if there's a nuclear catastrophe or some other catastrophe,

321
00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:42.190
all bets are off.

322
00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:47.170
None of none of these projections or future looks can assume catastrophe.

323
00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:52.480
The only way to return to the youthful age structures of the past would be to

324
00:22:52.481 --> 00:22:57.481
have very substantial fertility increases to those of the past and to sustain

325
00:22:58.361 --> 00:23:01.900
those very high fertility rates.
This intern would apply,

326
00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:07.500
would imply rapid population increase ad infinitum and I think most of you know

327
00:23:07.721 --> 00:23:11.830
that that's not likely to happen.
Now,

328
00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:18.900
my other point here is that societies that have very low fertility rates,

329
00:23:19.031 --> 00:23:24.031
like 1.1 child per woman on average that you might find in Italy or Japan,

330
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.980
Japan's a little higher but 1.3 in Japan,
I think,
um,

331
00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:33.490
it would be desirable.
This is a value judgment on my part.

332
00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:38.530
It would be desirable for fertility rates to rise somewhat to more moderate

333
00:23:38.531 --> 00:23:39.364
levels,

334
00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:44.400
but I don't think they will ever rise in those countries to the levels,
uh,

335
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.460
pre transition.

336
00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:52.180
So the challenge is going to be to find creative mechanisms to smooth the

337
00:23:52.491 --> 00:23:56.660
transition from younger to older demographic age structures and to put in place

338
00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:01.400
adaptive mechanisms that will allow such societies to prosper,
uh,

339
00:24:01.401 --> 00:24:04.640
over the longer term under these new conditions.

340
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.230
The second point I'd like to make is that we are in danger collectively of

341
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:14.240
making two errors of demographic interpretation and these are both significant

342
00:24:14.241 --> 00:24:16.070
errors.
First,

343
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:21.110
we are in danger of putting on do emphasis upon what are called period rates.

344
00:24:21.111 --> 00:24:25.190
Have you discussed period rates?
Okay.

345
00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:29.270
We are in danger of um,
focusing on period rates.

346
00:24:29.271 --> 00:24:31.610
I've just done it myself at one point,

347
00:24:31.611 --> 00:24:34.640
one child per woman for Italy,

348
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.790
even though we know they are distorted rates,

349
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:43.730
they're well below the underlying rates of how many children the average woman

350
00:24:43.731 --> 00:24:47.630
will have when she finishes their child bearing.
That's a cohort,
right?

351
00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:52.520
And second danger is,
and we're doing it every day,

352
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:57.850
miss specifying the category aged and thereby misconstruing what demographic

353
00:25:00.831 --> 00:25:04.850
aging means.
Let me say a few words about both of those.

354
00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:09.620
In Italy,
Spain,
Greece,
Portugal,
Ireland,
countries like that.
In Europe,

355
00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:13.730
there have been significant increases in the mean age of marriage and hence the

356
00:25:13.731 --> 00:25:14.930
mean age of first birth.

357
00:25:14.931 --> 00:25:19.931
Typically these are large increases by demographic standards and they are large

358
00:25:20.061 --> 00:25:25.061
enough to cause distortions in the period rates over the time period during

359
00:25:26.961 --> 00:25:29.870
which the mean age of childbearing is rising.

360
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.050
This is a well known phenomenon to demographers.

361
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.440
It's not well understood among political leaderships.
When I was,

362
00:25:39.441 --> 00:25:42.620
um,
on working on the hill running a congressional committee,

363
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:48.010
I learned not to use the term cohort because as soon as I said cohort,

364
00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:52.460
the congressman would say,
you mean your friends,
your cohort?
And I said,
no,
no,

365
00:25:52.461 --> 00:25:57.170
it's uh,
you know,
it's a generation concept.
Oh,
I don't get it.
You know,
don't,

366
00:25:57.171 --> 00:26:01.390
don't bother me with the facts,
but even the term,
uh,

367
00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:02.630
is misunderstood.

368
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:09.740
Given that it's really easy to distort,
uh,
for that kind of audience.

369
00:26:09.741 --> 00:26:11.490
If you want to make the case that,
uh,

370
00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:16.550
we're all going to hell in a handbasket to distort these period rates and say

371
00:26:17.061 --> 00:26:20.270
this is what's going to continue indefinitely into the future

372
00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:27.580
varied rate.
Okay.
Period rate is,
um,

373
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:32.810
it is expressed.
Let's say,
let's take the total fertility rate,

374
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.430
which is a period rate.

375
00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:39.670
It is synthetic in the sense that it is an attempt to summarize the fertility

376
00:26:40.911 --> 00:26:45.600
behavior.
Let's say in 2009 of women,

377
00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:50.370
demographers care only about women by the way,
of women of all ages.

378
00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:57.210
So it's the fertility rates of women 15 to 1920 and 24.

379
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.290
These are different cohorts.
As you can see in 2009.

380
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:03.240
They're born in different years.

381
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:08.250
They each have a characteristic fertility rate by age.

382
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.230
If you sum up

383
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:15.240
the rate of all of those age groups in a given year,

384
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.170
you will get a period rate,

385
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:24.200
which is an attempt to summarize the overall fertility behavior of the entire

386
00:27:25.141 --> 00:27:26.700
population of all ages.

387
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:32.390
And then we express it probably confusingly in terms such as 1.1 child per woman

388
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:37.950
or 2.1 child's children per

389
00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:43.350
per woman.
It's not actually any real woman.

390
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:45.570
It's a synthetic woman,

391
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:50.610
a the best kind of women.
Yeah.
If you,
uh,

392
00:27:50.611 --> 00:27:54.310
another way to imagine this,
imagine you had,
um,

393
00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:00.140
a thousand female demographers that's a frightening prospect when you think

394
00:28:01.591 --> 00:28:05.190
about it.
And uh,
they formed a pact,

395
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:09.340
they were all age 15.
So there are 15 year old,
uh,

396
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:14.750
demographers and they form a PAC that they will bear children collectively at

397
00:28:16.981 --> 00:28:21.981
the rate of each age group in that year that they make the pact right through

398
00:28:22.711 --> 00:28:27.540
their reproductive lifespan at the end of their reproductive life span,

399
00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:30.570
40 say or 45,

400
00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:36.890
they collectively would have an average children ever born equal to the total

401
00:28:38.701 --> 00:28:42.780
fertility rate for that year.
But of course,
that would never happen.
I mean,

402
00:28:42.781 --> 00:28:47.640
I'm just trying to give you an ask you to imagine what the rates mean.

403
00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:51.900
The problem with the rate,
well,
let me say what's good about the period rates.

404
00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:56.790
They give you a summary of what's going on in a year or in a five year period.

405
00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:01.920
That's why it's called a period,
right?
It's a current kind of summary,

406
00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:06.350
right?
The cohort rates don't do that.

407
00:29:06.351 --> 00:29:08.000
They tell you how many children,

408
00:29:08.001 --> 00:29:12.590
women age 45 today had through their entire lifespan.

409
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:18.520
The problem with the period rates is that they can be distorted if women delay

410
00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:23.300
or accelerate their child bearing each year.
If you,

411
00:29:23.301 --> 00:29:24.470
if there's a delay,

412
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:28.280
they may end up with the same number of children when they finish their

413
00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.780
childbearing,
but they're stretch it out over more years,
so the annual rates,

414
00:29:32.781 --> 00:29:34.940
the period rates are depressed.

415
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.510
Therefore we know that's happening in southern Europe.

416
00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.710
We know it's not happening in Europe,

417
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:46.090
so low rates and central Europe are not distorted in this way.

418
00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:50.380
The low rates and southern Europe are distorted in this way and that's probably

419
00:29:50.381 --> 00:29:53.650
enough about period rate.
Now.

420
00:29:53.651 --> 00:29:57.460
I said the second possible error is the miss specification by demographers and

421
00:29:57.461 --> 00:30:02.461
others of the boundaries of the age dependency category convention.

422
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:08.950
When do you get to be aged?
Dependent answer 65

423
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.140
where did that number come from?
Arbitrary.

424
00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:16.420
Who came up with it?

425
00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:22.020
The people who designed the Social Security Act of 1935 who had to decide at

426
00:30:23.081 --> 00:30:27.430
what age did a person qualify for a social security pension?

427
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:32.170
Why did they say 65 well,
actually the,

428
00:30:32.171 --> 00:30:37.171
initially they were going to say 70 because they were copying Bismark's social

429
00:30:37.301 --> 00:30:40.480
insurance scheme from the 19th century and the Bismarck system,

430
00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.820
you've got your state pension at age 70

431
00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:49.090
but it was a time of mass unemployment and so there was a desire to encourage

432
00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.030
older workers to leave the workforce,

433
00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:53.620
to make room for unemployed younger workers,

434
00:30:53.621 --> 00:30:56.170
so they moved it down by five years,

435
00:30:56.350 --> 00:31:01.350
65 it's been that way in the statistics and the data ever since.

436
00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:08.730
Demographers have not adjusted to the reality that the meaning of 65 in 1935 was

437
00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:15.310
very different from the meeting of 65 and 2005 or 2009.

438
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:20.340
And uh,
that's a problem because we,
we will,
um,

439
00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:25.300
spend a lot of time calculating to the third decimal place,

440
00:31:25.301 --> 00:31:29.770
the age of dependency ratio.
Uh,
and,

441
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:34.460
and yet we know that the meaning of the boundary between a working age and age

442
00:31:34.461 --> 00:31:35.950
and dependency,
uh,

443
00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:40.240
is increasingly out of touch with reality.

444
00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:44.680
Same is true by the way,
the young dependency ratio,

445
00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.660
youthful dependency ratio,

446
00:31:46.661 --> 00:31:51.661
which is usually set at age 15 or 19 on grounds,

447
00:31:52.301 --> 00:31:55.200
that after that people become productive,
uh,

448
00:31:55.930 --> 00:31:59.260
labor force people like you,
right?
So,

449
00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:02.260
so that's all changed to a,

450
00:32:02.261 --> 00:32:07.261
but we still stick to these boundaries and were misleading ourselves and

451
00:32:07.421 --> 00:32:09.790
everyone else.
I'm afraid by doing that.

452
00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:14.110
There are a lot of alternatives to this.
I won't go into them,

453
00:32:14.111 --> 00:32:19.111
but one obvious possibility would be to shift the age boundaries upward for both

454
00:32:19.931 --> 00:32:22.990
the youthful and the older boundaries,

455
00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:27.580
safer to 20 years and 70 years rather than 15 and 65.

456
00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.810
That would make sense.
You'd want to keep the old series as well because you'd,

457
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:37.240
uh,
you'd want to have some comparability over time,
but to have an alternative,

458
00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:38.830
a ratio would be useful.

459
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:44.470
Another possibility would be to fix the number of years,
uh,

460
00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.130
uh,
of remaining life expectancy rather than the age,

461
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:54.190
the absolute age as the boundary between age of dependency and working age.

462
00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:00.470
Now let me talk a bit about policy responses to very low fertility.

463
00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:06.680
There are basically two basic types of policy responses that have been strongly

464
00:33:06.681 --> 00:33:09.500
urged,
first measures to increase fertility.

465
00:33:09.501 --> 00:33:13.490
That's a pretty obvious and direct one and second measures to adapt to low

466
00:33:13.491 --> 00:33:16.240
fertility over the longer term.
Uh,

467
00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:20.320
I am not embracing any of these recommendations,
but I do want to,
um,

468
00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:25.040
uh,
give you the analytic possibilities that might,

469
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:30.050
that have been put forward first.
And this will offend most of you.
Uh,

470
00:33:30.051 --> 00:33:34.970
it has been urged and implemented in some countries to limit access to fertility

471
00:33:34.971 --> 00:33:39.710
control.
If you banned contraception,
abortion,
et cetera,

472
00:33:39.711 --> 00:33:42.350
sterilization fertility rates would go up.

473
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:47.150
That's basically what Cha Jessica in Romania did in 1966.

474
00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.210
Uh,
this would be,
um,
probably,
uh,

475
00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:53.750
unworkable in liberal democracy.

476
00:33:53.751 --> 00:33:58.280
Romania is not a liberal democracy to say the least and it uh,

477
00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:01.670
would be unacceptable in many other ways.

478
00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.750
It would probably result in a revolution in the United States,

479
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:09.140
but that's analytically a possibility.

480
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:14.590
Second economic incentives to encourage higher fertility and these have come in

481
00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.850
many forms in the past,

482
00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:22.630
a cop out cash bonuses for bearing a child or allowances annual payments per

483
00:34:25.251 --> 00:34:30.251
child you have in the family from the government or tax preferences to people

484
00:34:30.891 --> 00:34:33.500
with children.
Those are part of us tax law.

485
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.920
Of course these can be flat meaning each child is treated the same in terms of

486
00:34:41.091 --> 00:34:45.170
the amount of bonus or tax incentive or they can be progressive.

487
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:50.170
I guess you put that in quotes with increasing amounts per for later births.

488
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:55.610
So you might not get,
you might give no incentive for the first birth,

489
00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.400
but a big incentive for the third birth for example.

490
00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:03.020
Or you could give in kind benefits.
For example,

491
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.030
in much of eastern Europe,

492
00:35:05.031 --> 00:35:10.031
families with more than a two children had access to larger and preferential

493
00:35:10.131 --> 00:35:12.710
flats,
preferred flats,
government flats.

494
00:35:12.711 --> 00:35:17.711
They got preference in that way or subsidized housing or you could give,

495
00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.920
uh,
early retirement bonuses to people.
You could say,
well,

496
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:26.450
a woman who has three or more children can retire at age 55 instead of 65.

497
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:29.510
That would be an incentive,
uh,
in,

498
00:35:29.511 --> 00:35:33.800
in both the Soviet Union in the 30s and in Nazi Germany and Thirties,

499
00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.280
women got prizes,
gold metals,
mother heroin,

500
00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:43.560
uh,
awards,
gold medals for eight or more children for example,

501
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:45.630
in the,
in the Soviet Union.

502
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:50.910
Or You could counter weight existing disincentives to large families,

503
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:53.040
for example,
by um,

504
00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:58.460
facilitating female labor force participation for women who have children in

505
00:35:59.941 --> 00:36:02.250
various ways.
The French crest system,

506
00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:07.251
which is a government financed early childhood before the s the schools start

507
00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:11.520
system of childcare is an example of doing that.

508
00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:14.850
The Swedish government has lots of policies of this kind.

509
00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:20.340
So those are benign examples where there's some harsh examples.
Um,
you could,
uh,

510
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.840
take measures to deter female labor force participation on grounds that you

511
00:36:24.841 --> 00:36:28.950
think it conflicts with a maternal behavior.

512
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:33.750
Now among Western countries,

513
00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:38.820
they've really been only a few that have adopted explicitly pro natalist

514
00:36:39.151 --> 00:36:43.740
policies of these kinds.
Um,
France,

515
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:48.120
Luxembourg,
Greece,
Quebec come to mind.

516
00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:53.250
Although other countries have policies they do not describe as pro natalist

517
00:36:53.251 --> 00:36:55.440
policies.
They say their social policies,

518
00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:00.600
but they have the implicit effect of being pro natalist and they don't

519
00:37:00.601 --> 00:37:03.810
acknowledge that typically,
uh,

520
00:37:03.811 --> 00:37:08.520
in France there have been proposals never adopted for an official maternal wage

521
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:14.160
that's called that in which mothers who stay at home with young children would

522
00:37:14.161 --> 00:37:15.630
get monthly payments from the government.

523
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:20.630
They get paid to be mothers that would be calculated in those proposals at about

524
00:37:21.271 --> 00:37:26.271
25% of the prevailing wage for employed women in uh,

525
00:37:27.041 --> 00:37:30.240
the socialist countries,
former socialist countries of eastern Europe.

526
00:37:30.241 --> 00:37:31.830
There were lots of these policies.

527
00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:35.490
They've all disappeared or almost all of just feared since the fall of the

528
00:37:35.491 --> 00:37:39.600
communist system.
But those countries had child allowances,

529
00:37:39.601 --> 00:37:40.650
birth bonuses,

530
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:46.190
maternity leave at full pay for five months paid leave until the child is three

531
00:37:47.881 --> 00:37:52.881
years of age and substantial subsidies and grants and kind the only non western

532
00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:58.310
low fertility country that's pursued this kind of policy that I'm familiar with

533
00:37:58.311 --> 00:38:01.980
that so far at least.
But there will be others on what surely,
uh,
is Singapore.

534
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:07.790
Singapore has embraced strong pro natalist policies and there've been some

535
00:38:09.031 --> 00:38:12.390
modest ones in Korea,
Thailand and Malaysia in Singapore too.

536
00:38:12.391 --> 00:38:16.650
They have policies about encouraging highly educated young men and women to meet

537
00:38:16.651 --> 00:38:21.330
each other.
They have dating services.
They want them to meet each other and,
and,

538
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:26.220
and marry and have children,
which always causes amusement outside of Singapore.

539
00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:30.690
They don't think it's funny.
They think it's perfectly sensible,

540
00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:36.500
if it's fair to say that the impacts of these policies on are probably there,

541
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:40.750
but they're small impacts.

542
00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:45.160
And in some countries they were very expensive policies as well,

543
00:38:45.161 --> 00:38:46.420
but they didn't have much impact.

544
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:51.400
If you tried to do the kinds of things that eastern European socialist countries

545
00:38:51.401 --> 00:38:55.750
did in the 80s,
proportionately in western countries,

546
00:38:55.751 --> 00:38:59.100
the costs would be enormous.
Uh,

547
00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.190
a third to a half of average wages.
Uh,

548
00:39:03.191 --> 00:39:07.840
for a family with two or three children for example,

549
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:09.580
the cost would be very large.

550
00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:15.100
Now what about measures to adapt to low fertility over the long term?
Well,

551
00:39:15.101 --> 00:39:18.610
first it's easier to adapt if the shifts are gradual.

552
00:39:18.611 --> 00:39:22.600
So very low fertility countries having dramatic shifts in the age structure,

553
00:39:22.601 --> 00:39:24.340
it makes it much harder for them.

554
00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.870
And then I've already mentioned the question of the boundaries between

555
00:39:28.871 --> 00:39:33.420
dependency and so,
and I won't repeat that,
um,

556
00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:37.330
but it's fair to say that the elderly dependent population,

557
00:39:37.331 --> 00:39:42.331
however defined is going to cost more than the youthful a dependent population,

558
00:39:44.770 --> 00:39:49.770
mainly because of healthcare education is the main public investment in youthful

559
00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:51.760
dependent population.

560
00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.790
The rest of the costs of those children are borne by families.

561
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:58.210
But when it comes to the age of dependent population,

562
00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:03.270
the families are no longer paying the costs and the healthcare costs are very

563
00:40:03.401 --> 00:40:06.910
high and,
and rising.
And here,

564
00:40:06.911 --> 00:40:10.480
I would have to say that of the fruit of the industrialized countries of the

565
00:40:10.481 --> 00:40:13.840
West,
the u s has the largest problem in this regard,

566
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:18.550
not because it has the oldest age structure or the most rapidly growing elderly

567
00:40:18.551 --> 00:40:19.384
population,

568
00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:23.830
but because it is politically and capable of controlling its expenditure on

569
00:40:23.831 --> 00:40:27.460
health care and that's a generic problem in the society,

570
00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:32.440
but it has special importance for the elderly aid structure.

571
00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.570
What could governments do where they could modify the terms of the social

572
00:40:37.571 --> 00:40:41.200
pension provisions?
They could shift the effective age of retirement,

573
00:40:41.201 --> 00:40:45.300
they could prioritize part of the pension system.
Uh,
they could,
um,

574
00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:50.790
subject pension benefits of well off retirees to a substantial income taxation.

575
00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:57.700
Um,
but in fact the politics of pension policy and most of these countries have

576
00:40:57.701 --> 00:41:02.050
operated in the other direction in the opposite direction.
Most countries,

577
00:41:02.051 --> 00:41:02.531
if anything,

578
00:41:02.531 --> 00:41:07.531
you've taken measures to lower the pension age until recently when they started

579
00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:12.631
gradually now to reverse the lowering of pension ages that they engage in in the

580
00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:17.500
sixties and seventies as far as the youthful population is concerned,

581
00:41:17.501 --> 00:41:21.400
it's going to be smaller with these low fertility populations.

582
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:22.511
Well,

583
00:41:22.511 --> 00:41:27.250
one could certainly convert age related facilities such as schools for other

584
00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:27.881
purposes.

585
00:41:27.881 --> 00:41:32.380
And going forward it would make a lot of sense to design new schools in a

586
00:41:32.381 --> 00:41:35.960
flexible way so they're easier to convert for other purposes,

587
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:41.540
which leads me finally to immigration.
Immigration

588
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:47.270
is often put forward as a way to deal with an aging population.

589
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.970
And the truth is that the potential pool of immigrants to low fertility

590
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:53.804
countries,

591
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:59.270
the potential pool is very large and it could easily be tapped.
So,

592
00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:02.360
um,
in fact,

593
00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:06.380
many of these countries are having problems restraining the flow,

594
00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:09.020
which is exceeding what they would like it to be.

595
00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:12.470
So it would be quite simple for a low fertility country,

596
00:42:12.471 --> 00:42:16.970
any of the ones I've mentioned to simply augment their populations by allowing

597
00:42:16.971 --> 00:42:18.690
additional immigration,
that's,

598
00:42:18.691 --> 00:42:22.070
it sounds a lot easier than changing the pension system and then all the other

599
00:42:22.071 --> 00:42:22.904
systems.

600
00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:28.720
But now let me take you back to my point about concerns about low fertility not

601
00:42:29.481 --> 00:42:31.610
being about the number of warm bodies,

602
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:37.480
but about the numbers defined as part of the nation or other ethnic or cultural

603
00:42:39.321 --> 00:42:42.740
group.
So that's the paradox.

604
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.770
Under conditions of very low fertility,

605
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:51.430
substantial immigration would produce very rapid transformation of the

606
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:55.550
composition of a population socio culturally defined.

607
00:42:56.210 --> 00:43:00.380
And historically such rapid changes have led to passionate public opposition.

608
00:43:00.381 --> 00:43:05.381
So the irony here is that while you might think as an analyst sitting here and

609
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:11.000
lecture room at Yale,
that uh,
uh,

610
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:15.500
why not just have more warm bodies immigrate and that'll take care of the issue.

611
00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:20.660
It's exactly in a low fertility setting that the public opposition is strongest

612
00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.990
to increased or substantial immigration.

613
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:27.130
There are some examples in which,
um,

614
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:32.780
immigration can be of a Pete by people who are defined as part of,

615
00:43:32.781 --> 00:43:36.680
or similar to the indigenous population.
And in those cases,
there's less,

616
00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.660
typically less opposition.

617
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:43.150
And I can give you a few examples like the postwar migration of,
um,

618
00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.080
uh,
east Germans to West Germany for example,

619
00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:53.980
or the German so-called Germans from the Volga Germans from Russia to Germany,

620
00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:59.660
which turned out to be quite controversial,

621
00:43:59.661 --> 00:44:03.680
but they were defined as Germans returning home even though their ancestors had

622
00:44:03.681 --> 00:44:08.550
left 300 years earlier.
The Pew hadn't wire to France,
uh,

623
00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.420
after the collapse of the,
uh,

624
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:16.400
the French empire in Africa,
mostly the re the return.

625
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:17.271
Think about that.

626
00:44:17.271 --> 00:44:22.271
The return of Jews from North Africa to the new state of Israel,

627
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.230
of Italians,
uh,

628
00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:32.130
or Italian Argentinians rather to Arjun to Italy,

629
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:37.470
um,
of a Japanese origin,
people,

630
00:44:37.471 --> 00:44:41.700
the Nisai,
uh,
from Brazil and Peru to Japan,

631
00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:45.810
uh,
of Angolan colonial settlers to Portugal.

632
00:44:45.811 --> 00:44:49.800
So there are examples of this kind of migration being less controversial.

633
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:55.230
And I think one should also say that moderate levels of immigration do not

634
00:44:55.231 --> 00:44:56.970
appear to be all that controversial.

635
00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:01.440
This is not a question of people being passionately against immigration,

636
00:45:01.441 --> 00:45:03.930
but it's a question of quantity.

637
00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:09.030
And this will lead me if I can get this to move forward.

638
00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:16.470
Oh,
here's,
here's the Jacques rock quote,
which I'm,
I meant to show you.

639
00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:17.850
I'll let you read it.

640
00:45:30.590 --> 00:45:32.240
So you see,
she rock was saying

641
00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.050
that in 2004,

642
00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:40.190
we already know what the population was in 2004,
but that

643
00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:45.110
Europe would be empty in 2004.

644
00:45:45.770 --> 00:45:50.770
He said that in 1984 and a one thing that demographers have learned is never

645
00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:55.781
make a prediction over a time span in which you might still be alive because you

646
00:45:56.751 --> 00:46:01.280
will probably always be wrong.
A sheer rock was clearly wrong.

647
00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:10.060
What I want to talk about is a study,
and this will be my last section here.

648
00:46:10.061 --> 00:46:14.210
I study,
uh,
of,
uh,
the question of substituting,

649
00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:15.603
um,

650
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:20.890
immigration for missed fertility in low fertility societies.

651
00:46:21.850 --> 00:46:26.850
It was a study done by the United Nations population division in 2000.

652
00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:32.750
It asks the question how many immigrants would be needed to compensate for low

653
00:46:32.751 --> 00:46:36.800
fertility in Europe?
And the answer was a lot.

654
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:43.270
This was no surprise to the UN population division or two demographers.

655
00:46:44.430 --> 00:46:47.780
Uh,
but it was a surprise to the New York Times,

656
00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:51.500
which in 2001,
um,

657
00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:54.860
ran this a story or 2000,

658
00:46:54.861 --> 00:46:59.390
I guess it is second January,
2000,
uh,
ran this story,

659
00:46:59.391 --> 00:47:03.780
picked up by the Herald Tribune in Paris and so on,
um,

660
00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:06.800
about this study.
Uh,

661
00:47:06.801 --> 00:47:11.801
I know a little bit about the history of why it was published on the 2nd of

662
00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:13.460
January,
2000,

663
00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:17.150
which I can tell you because it's a story about how the press works.

664
00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:22.720
The study had been filed months before by the journalist Barbara Crossette and

665
00:47:23.301 --> 00:47:27.590
was literally filed in a file cabinet,
had not been published.

666
00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:32.230
And then on the 2nd of January day after New Year's slow news day,

667
00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:36.880
nothing was happening.
The editor on duty,
he said,
oh,
we had that story,
you know,

668
00:47:36.881 --> 00:47:41.020
from six months ago.
Let's just throw that in the paper.
They put it in.

669
00:47:41.021 --> 00:47:43.000
The paper had already been written and edited.

670
00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:49.660
And notice the headline here,
um,
the subhead,

671
00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:51.850
it's the American way.

672
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:57.600
You can imagine how this appealed to the nationalists in various European

673
00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:03.340
countries.
Europe stares at a future built by immigrants.

674
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:07.750
It's the American way.
The reaction,

675
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:10.410
uh,
was,
um,

676
00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:15.460
describe to me by the head of the UN population division.
Uh,

677
00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.700
in one word he said it was mayhem.

678
00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:25.200
They started to get calls almost immediately from almost every newspaper in

679
00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:26.283
Europe.

680
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:32.250
The secretary general of the United Nations got calls from most European

681
00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:37.600
countries,
from the governments,
and not surprisingly,
the secretary general,

682
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.020
it's office called over to the population division and said,

683
00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.750
could you please send us the study?

684
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:47.410
The truth is there was no study.

685
00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:54.120
They had done some back of the envelope calculations and had done a one page

686
00:48:55.210 --> 00:49:00.100
talking points thing for a general assembly meeting that they thought it might

687
00:49:00.101 --> 00:49:03.520
come at a up at.
Um,

688
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:06.820
so what they did was the press release,
that was I think,

689
00:49:06.821 --> 00:49:11.821
two pages summarizing the back of the envelope calculations and within a few

690
00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:18.010
days,
uh,
Lamond let's see if I have the Lamond story here.

691
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:19.600
Here's the press release.

692
00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.040
Here's the Lamond I think.

693
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:28.343
<v 4>MMM.</v>

694
00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:30.760
<v 1>And uh,</v>

695
00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:35.810
Lamanda actually dropped the question mark at the end of the title of the,

696
00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.180
of the press release.

697
00:49:39.181 --> 00:49:43.980
You see that the press release says replacement migration.

698
00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:49.010
Is it a solution to declining and aging populations and Lamond translated it as

699
00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:57.770
a solution to declining and et cetera populations.

700
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:59.743
<v 4>MMM.</v>

701
00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:06.490
<v 1>There was suddenly a big story in Europe.
Here we have Le Figaro,</v>

702
00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:10.210
the report that alarmed Europe or alarms Europe.

703
00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:15.970
It was translated,
I think there's an economist article here.

704
00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:21.430
Here's a cartoon from Figaro saying,
uh,
what's the distance to Europe,

705
00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:25.720
to the United Nations,
uh,
et Cetera,
man.

706
00:50:25.721 --> 00:50:29.390
And a woman talking over the about that.
Here's The economist.

707
00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:34.100
Fewer and wrinklier Europeans,
um,

708
00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:39.110
all the major German newspapers had articles,
uh,

709
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:44.490
Belgium,
Spanish,
Italian,
the French TV,
uh,

710
00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:49.600
main channel sent crews to the UN to interview the authors of the study.

711
00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:52.790
There was still no study.

712
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:58.460
All there was with that press release that you saw before.
Well,

713
00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:02.270
for some reason the secretary general took the view that they should now do the

714
00:51:02.271 --> 00:51:05.000
study.
And they did this study.

715
00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:10.810
And unfortunately what happened was that the press in Europe interpreted the UN

716
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:15.950
study or the press release as UN recommendation to European countries to admit

717
00:51:15.951 --> 00:51:19.010
more immigrants.
So,
um,

718
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:23.000
the United Nations is preparing a new report,

719
00:51:23.001 --> 00:51:28.001
which will argue that Europe may need to accept many more migrants over the next

720
00:51:28.161 --> 00:51:33.161
50 years to maintain population levels and the size of its workforce.

721
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:39.500
That's not,
they did do the study very quickly.
It's not what the study did.

722
00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:40.160
This is a,

723
00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:44.480
this is an inventory of all the articles that were published after the press

724
00:51:44.481 --> 00:51:49.160
release.
What are they actually find?
Well,

725
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.840
what they did were hypothetical scenarios to 2050,

726
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.240
and they asked the following questions among others,

727
00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:01.340
how many immigrants would key countries need to prevent decline in the total

728
00:52:01.341 --> 00:52:02.174
population,

729
00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:07.960
assuming that their projections on fertility were accurate to hold constant the

730
00:52:08.211 --> 00:52:11.090
population 1565 to 65.

731
00:52:11.091 --> 00:52:16.091
There we are again with those 15 and 65 age boundaries and to hold constant what

732
00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:19.970
they call the potential support ratio,

733
00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:23.930
which they defined as the ratio of people of working age,

734
00:52:23.931 --> 00:52:26.830
meaning 15 to 64,
uh,

735
00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.290
to those who are aged dependent meaning 65 and over

736
00:52:31.850 --> 00:52:34.280
and for the last,
uh,

737
00:52:34.281 --> 00:52:39.230
which was in a way the most important one here with the numbers they came up

738
00:52:39.231 --> 00:52:39.651
with,

739
00:52:39.651 --> 00:52:44.651
that Germany would need 188 million immigrants by 2050.

740
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:52.960
At which point 80% of the population within the boundaries of Germany would be

741
00:52:53.181 --> 00:52:55.550
represented by those immigrants and their offspring.

742
00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.810
Italy would need 120 million.
And you see the percentages here,

743
00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:05.720
always four fifths of the population would be accounted for by immigrants and

744
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:07.873
their offspring,

745
00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:14.680
the u s even the u s which would need 593 million immigrants who would be at 73%

746
00:53:16.851 --> 00:53:19.740
even with its higher fertility rates.
So the,

747
00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:24.850
the paradox here is that if you combine low fertility with high immigration from

748
00:53:25.801 --> 00:53:30.801
an economic view or let's say our Yale undergraduate perspective,

749
00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:36.780
uh,
immigrants or substitutes or compliments their workers there,

750
00:53:36.781 --> 00:53:40.530
they have skills,
they bring skills,
they pay taxes,

751
00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:45.090
they subsidize retirement for older residents.

752
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:50.220
Um,
but the public view is that immigrants are human beings,

753
00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:54.630
that they have cultures,
religions,
politics,
languages.

754
00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:56.610
So if fertility is low,

755
00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:00.090
immigration is less acceptable to Publix.

756
00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:02.700
Then if fertility is high or higher,

757
00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:09.410
meanwhile elite like us take that more economic perspective.

758
00:54:09.601 --> 00:54:13.200
I think probably if we did a survey of this group,

759
00:54:13.201 --> 00:54:17.280
we would be much more positive about increasing immigration.

760
00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:22.730
Then with the public at large and the outcomes of this are really unknowable.

761
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:27.480
There's been a lot of heat.

762
00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:31.920
There hasn't been a lot of light about international migration.

763
00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:35.050
Um,
the data are week.

764
00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:39.690
Is it a fertility data are a much better mortality data or the best demographic

765
00:54:39.691 --> 00:54:44.691
data for utility Beta with data are the second best migration data are by far

766
00:54:44.851 --> 00:54:47.520
the worst.
They are very weak,

767
00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:53.360
but we think they were about 200 million international migrants around now and

768
00:54:54.601 --> 00:54:56.540
then it's gone up about two thirds,
uh,

769
00:54:56.680 --> 00:55:01.680
in 15 years increasing at about 2.3 million per year.

770
00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.370
If you put them all together,
where does the,
where do they fit?

771
00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:10.710
200 million would be the fifth largest population in the world.

772
00:55:10.711 --> 00:55:12.390
So it's a nontrivial number,

773
00:55:12.391 --> 00:55:15.990
but it's a very small fraction of the world's population.

774
00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:17.760
Like 3% or less.

775
00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:23.380
We have tens of millions of people migrating,

776
00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:27.790
but overwhelmingly the majority of people do not migrate.

777
00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:32.440
So just keep all of those paradoxes in your head about international migration

778
00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.350
in absolute terms.

779
00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:39.360
The U s has the largest number of foreign born people at 35 million in 2000 and

780
00:55:39.971 --> 00:55:44.710
the Russian Federation is next.
And here if you can read that.

781
00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:50.470
Yeah,
I guess you can,
you see the u s at the top there,
the Russian Federation,

782
00:55:50.471 --> 00:55:54.460
and then the other countries are a lot smaller in terms of foreign born

783
00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:55.683
residents.

784
00:55:57.450 --> 00:56:01.710
If you look though at the percent of the population,

785
00:56:01.711 --> 00:56:05.610
you got a different list than the one I just showed you of the different league

786
00:56:05.611 --> 00:56:06.444
table.

787
00:56:06.810 --> 00:56:10.500
The Persian Gulf states have the highest percentage of their population who are

788
00:56:10.501 --> 00:56:12.260
immigrants or,
or um,

789
00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:17.540
international migrants largely because they have substantial numbers,

790
00:56:17.670 --> 00:56:21.870
small compared to the u s but substantial numbers of international migrants on

791
00:56:21.871 --> 00:56:24.940
the base of a very small indigenous population.

792
00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.850
Most of their migrants are temporary workers.

793
00:56:27.851 --> 00:56:31.630
They're not immigrants in the sense that they're allowed to stay permanently.

794
00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:35.850
So you have three quarters of the populations of the United Arab Emirates and

795
00:56:35.851 --> 00:56:39.260
the Kattar who are foreign born.
Um,

796
00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:42.680
and more than half in Kuwait.
Um,

797
00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:45.670
I say here that Israel and Jordan are about 40%.

798
00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:50.080
It depends on how you define the Palestinians and Jordan.
Uh,

799
00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:52.660
but that if you call them international migrants,

800
00:56:52.690 --> 00:56:57.690
then it's 40% or so in Jordan and then you can find a few European countries.

801
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.890
But they're tiny like Lichtenstein that have high percentages of foreign born

802
00:57:02.891 --> 00:57:07.120
people,
but generally speaking,
the highest percentages are in small countries.

803
00:57:07.121 --> 00:57:09.790
And here's the league table there.
I don't know if you can read it.

804
00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:15.820
United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait,
Jordan,
Israel,
Singapore,
Oman,
Estonia,

805
00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:19.960
Saudi Arabia,
Latvia,
Switzerland,
Australia,

806
00:57:19.990 --> 00:57:22.600
New Zealand got ball Canada.

807
00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:27.190
You see the big countries don't by and large peer in that league table.

808
00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:32.880
Uh,
if you look at countries that have 50 million or more,
sorry,

809
00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:33.640
we're starting about,

810
00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:37.600
or we're starting to talk about significant population countries.
Um,

811
00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:43.650
the percent of foreign born exceeds 10% in only three such countries in the

812
00:57:44.111 --> 00:57:48.010
Ukraine,
in the u s and in France.

813
00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.910
The Russian Federation and Germany are getting pretty close,

814
00:57:51.911 --> 00:57:53.470
so we should include them probably,

815
00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:56.620
but there aren't many others that are above 5%.

816
00:57:58.390 --> 00:58:03.390
So I've already said that low fertility might imply increasing immigration and

817
00:58:03.551 --> 00:58:05.980
there are plausible arguments about,
uh,

818
00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:10.570
in favor of that to meet the labor force needs that employers say they have.

819
00:58:11.310 --> 00:58:14.680
Um,
as there's more economic integration,

820
00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:18.700
a more international migration is inevitable.
Uh,

821
00:58:18.701 --> 00:58:23.701
and immigrants can arguably finance unsustainable pension systems pay as you are

822
00:58:24.071 --> 00:58:27.880
in the pension systems,
but they're equally plausible counter arguments.

823
00:58:29.080 --> 00:58:31.600
Uh,
and you're just going to have to decide for yourself.

824
00:58:31.601 --> 00:58:35.020
I don't think anyone can convince you one way or another,
um,

825
00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:38.260
of what's right here,
what's the proper mindset.

826
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:42.610
But one argument here would be that low fertility rates are likely going to be

827
00:58:42.611 --> 00:58:43.444
temporary,

828
00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:48.920
that that public opposition will prevent an increase of international migration

829
00:58:49.361 --> 00:58:50.410
to very high levels.

830
00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:55.030
And that these pay as you are in pension systems are going to be restructured.

831
00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:57.850
And I am firmly on the fence on this.

832
00:58:57.851 --> 00:59:02.380
I will sit uncomfortably on the fence as long as I can stand it.

833
00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:05.980
It's painful to sit on the fence.
But,
uh,
in this case,

834
00:59:05.981 --> 00:59:10.600
I don't think there's a clear,
uh,
correct position on these things.
So here,

835
00:59:10.630 --> 00:59:11.800
summary and conclusions,

836
00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:17.500
very low fertility now is widespread and it's continuing to spread.

837
00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:21.560
I think the last I looked,
and don't quote me on this,

838
00:59:21.561 --> 00:59:24.950
but last I looked,
um,

839
00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:29.270
if you don't include China,
because China tilts everything,

840
00:59:29.271 --> 00:59:31.310
it's 20% of the world's population.

841
00:59:31.311 --> 00:59:33.410
So let's be conservative and not include China,

842
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:37.280
which does have below replacement fertility.
Without China,

843
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:42.110
40% of the world's population now lives in countries with below replacement

844
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:46.400
fertility and rising
with China.

845
00:59:46.401 --> 00:59:50.060
60% of the world's population lives in such countries.

846
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.030
Uh,
in the past.
We know that these low fertility rates,
in fact,

847
00:59:56.031 --> 01:00:01.031
not as low as some of the rates we see today have led to exaggerated a alarm and

848
01:00:01.521 --> 01:00:03.050
to nationalist responses.

849
01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:08.090
Fertility rates could rise in the future.
There's nothing to stop them.

850
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:11.630
Most sociologists,
anthropologists,

851
01:00:11.631 --> 01:00:16.130
and demographies don't think they will,
but they have no way of knowing.

852
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.220
I don't think they will,
but I could easily be wrong.

853
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:23.450
But it's hard to increase fertility rates.

854
01:00:23.451 --> 01:00:26.240
The policy in liberal democracies,

855
01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:33.820
increased immigration is often invoked as a solution to the problems resulting

856
01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:35.060
from very low fertility,

857
01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:40.340
but it's not very effective and it's likely to stimulate its own passionate

858
01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:44.270
opposition.
So my bottom line is,
and I'll stop with this,

859
01:00:45.110 --> 01:00:48.170
that adaptive societies,
societies that are capable,

860
01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:53.200
flexible enough to adapt to changing aid structures up and down and sideways are

861
01:00:53.481 --> 01:00:57.340
likely to fare the best in the future.
Thank you.

862
01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:03.190
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

863
01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:16.870
<v 1>they've got to be some questions because I didn't explain some things that I</v>

864
01:01:16.871 --> 01:01:17.710
just asserted.

865
01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:24.850
<v 4>Okay.
So</v>

866
01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.520
when you think is causing this,

867
01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:40.760
<v 1>uh,
how long?
Yeah.
How long do we have?</v>

868
01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:44.600
Uh,
there,
uh,
there are a whole range of theories about this.
Uh,

869
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:49.710
there's a whole theoretical structure called the second demographic transition

870
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:51.343
theory,

871
01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:56.590
which explains low fertility on grounds of secularization of societies,

872
01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:58.760
the,

873
01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:03.760
the collapse of a religious social control over behavior,

874
01:02:04.191 --> 01:02:08.930
which relates heavily to marriage and child bearing of the,

875
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:09.350
uh,

876
01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:14.350
rising labor force participation of women and women's labor force participation

877
01:02:16.371 --> 01:02:19.300
being in conflict with um,
um,

878
01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:24.720
fertility and child bearing and child rearing and a whole range of other things

879
01:02:24.721 --> 01:02:27.660
that you might just characterize it.
Modernization.

880
01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:29.940
And from this point of view,

881
01:02:29.941 --> 01:02:34.941
theoretically low fertility is permanent and inevitable in,

882
01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:38.820
um,

883
01:02:39.330 --> 01:02:44.330
advanced societies that no society of that kind is going to ever again approach.

884
01:02:47.310 --> 01:02:50.380
While they would,
I don't know if they would say this,
but they might,
wouldn't,

885
01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:52.800
would not ever exceed replacement level.

886
01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:58.220
And you'll have high percentages of women who will be a childless throughout

887
01:02:59.761 --> 01:03:03.330
their lives.
Uh,
low marriage rates.

888
01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:08.360
Why should anybody bother getting married when there's no problem and cohabiting

889
01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:14.010
without being married socially,
culturally and legally?

890
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:19.670
If all the benefits of marriage can be accrued without needing to get married,

891
01:03:19.891 --> 01:03:22.470
why bother?
And you actually see that,

892
01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:27.360
especially in the Nordic countries where,
um,

893
01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:33.270
very high percentages of the population,
again,
of women,

894
01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.070
we can look at men too,
but women are the important fertility,
uh,

895
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.570
carriers if you will,
uh,

896
01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:44.600
very high percentages of women age 30 are never married and don't look like they

897
01:03:44.851 --> 01:03:49.710
ever will get married.
Very high rates of cohabitation.
And in the case of Sweden,

898
01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:54.900
fertility has been rising from low levels under those circumstances,

899
01:03:54.901 --> 01:03:59.430
which is posing some theoretical problems for the proponents of the second

900
01:03:59.431 --> 01:04:03.540
demographic transition.
But we can't explain things like this.

901
01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:08.320
Uh,
life is too complicated and,

902
01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:12.990
and collective fertility behavior is too complicated to explain things like
this.

903
01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.920
If you look at Japan,
for example,
in Japan,

904
01:04:17.610 --> 01:04:19.020
you have very low

905
01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:23.670
rates of marriage among women in their twenties.

906
01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.220
It looks like Sweden,
uh,

907
01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.170
in terms of marriage behavior,

908
01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:36.320
but there's a huge difference in the percentage of births in Japan versus Sweden

909
01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:41.160
that are outside of marriage.
If I remember correctly,

910
01:04:41.161 --> 01:04:45.540
it's like 2% of births in Japan or outside of marriage.

911
01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:50.700
And in Sweden it's almost 50% of births are outside marriage.

912
01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.490
So you have the same marriage behavior roughly,

913
01:04:53.491 --> 01:04:57.600
but higher fertility collectively in Sweden than you do in Japan.

914
01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:58.973
Italy,

915
01:05:00.090 --> 01:05:05.090
European country looks more like Japan in this respect that it looks like Sweden

916
01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:06.533
or Germany.

917
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:09.743
<v 3>I see.</v>

918
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.823
Okay.

919
01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:22.390
<v 1>Or at least in America,
terrorism or war</v>

920
01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:28.600
<v 4>within the government.
How much of a big issue with this and like at what time?</v>

921
01:05:30.830 --> 01:05:35.450
<v 1>Well,
the US has high fertility by the standards of its peer countries.</v>

922
01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:38.420
It's very close to replacement level two.

923
01:05:38.421 --> 01:05:41.780
Last time I looked at this 2.0 versus 2.1,

924
01:05:41.781 --> 01:05:45.020
it was 1.1 or so in,
in uh,
Italy,

925
01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:49.560
1.3 in Japan.
So there's less concern here.
Um,

926
01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:54.110
then there is in among political elites in other countries,

927
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:57.800
what the US does have that most of them don't have,
however,

928
01:05:58.670 --> 01:06:01.820
is a very large baby boom generation.

929
01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:04.730
US had a big baby boom.

930
01:06:04.731 --> 01:06:09.500
You've probably discussed this in previous lectures or you will be the u s

931
01:06:09.501 --> 01:06:11.040
Canada,
uh,

932
01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:16.120
Australia and New Zealand really where the four baby boom countries post World

933
01:06:16.490 --> 01:06:21.170
War II and in the case of the u s fertility went from below replacement level

934
01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:25.940
two,
3.7,
uh,
doubled.

935
01:06:26.030 --> 01:06:31.030
Essentially it peaked in 1957 and started declining sharply in 1965 but there

936
01:06:34.341 --> 01:06:36.860
was a period,
um,
uh,

937
01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:42.130
the bit so called baby boom generation if you will in 1947 birth to 19,

938
01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:44.030
uh,

939
01:06:44.030 --> 01:06:49.030
65 who are now reaching the statutory retirement age and that bulge is going to

940
01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:57.820
rapidly increase the proportion of the population in that post 65 age group for

941
01:07:01.041 --> 01:07:04.820
about 20 years.
Because it's just,
you know,
it's just aging.

942
01:07:04.821 --> 01:07:09.821
It's way through the age structure given that the u s government has proven

943
01:07:10.221 --> 01:07:15.050
itself incapable of getting control over healthcare expenditures.

944
01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:19.400
That will be a major crisis for the Medicare system.

945
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:23.450
I can predict that without any doubt,
whatever.

946
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:26.660
I don't know what's going to happen,
how it will be handled.

947
01:07:26.661 --> 01:07:30.500
I just know it's going to be a major crisis.
Yes ma'am.
Yup.

948
01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:33.890
<v 4>Yup.
Yup.
Could you speak briefly,</v>

949
01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:40.080
my response to theorists are why it's moderate,

950
01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:49.420
moderate to severe decline in populations is actually addressing social and

951
01:07:51.771 --> 01:07:53.840
environmental concerns and that,
yes,

952
01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:59.340
<v 1>yes.
Uh,
I,
um,
I have a,
um,</v>

953
01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:03.130
a firmly on the fence moderate position on these things.

954
01:08:03.131 --> 01:08:08.131
I think both rapid population growth and rapid population decline are

955
01:08:08.981 --> 01:08:11.290
problematic for societies.

956
01:08:11.291 --> 01:08:15.280
There are too many things tied to age in the societies,

957
01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:20.290
like public provision of schools versus healthcare and other things that rapid

958
01:08:20.631 --> 01:08:24.830
shifts will cause problems.
So I think I alluded to this,

959
01:08:24.831 --> 01:08:29.831
it's easier for societies to adjust to change if it's slower in general,

960
01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:33.740
whether it would be desirable as some environmentalist.

961
01:08:33.741 --> 01:08:38.741
Think for the population of the world to decline sharply from where it is,

962
01:08:40.521 --> 01:08:45.410
six point some billion to whatever they think the carrying capacity of the earth

963
01:08:45.411 --> 01:08:45.681
is.

964
01:08:45.681 --> 01:08:50.681
And that's a highly speculative calculation of course is another matter.

965
01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.930
And I don't think anybody can really resolve those debates.

966
01:08:53.931 --> 01:08:58.931
People feel very strongly in both directions about those sorts of arguments.

967
01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:04.600
But I would say myself that the optimal trajectory would be fertility rates plus

968
01:09:06.561 --> 01:09:11.000
or minus 10 15% of replacement level,

969
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:13.880
not 50% above,

970
01:09:13.881 --> 01:09:18.881
not 50% below not fluctuating a lot because if they fluctuate a lot,

971
01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:25.360
it causes all kinds of oscillations in the age structure over 75 or 100 years.

972
01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:29.460
And those are problematic for societies.
But uh,
you know,

973
01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:34.520
moderation in all things is probably a good maxim for these kinds of long lived

974
01:09:36.230 --> 01:09:40.790
slow changing but powerful there.
Their demography is like,

975
01:09:40.820 --> 01:09:45.050
I think of demography as being like the tectonic plates of the earth.
You know,

976
01:09:45.051 --> 01:09:50.051
it's moving very slowly by the standards of elections or economic collapses or

977
01:09:51.651 --> 01:09:56.651
economic booms very slowly but huge force behind it and huge momentum behind it

978
01:09:59.661 --> 01:10:02.630
too.
So you don't want to get in the way of tectonic plates if you can,

979
01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:06.650
if you can avoid it.
I saw another hand.
Yes sir.

980
01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:08.860
<v 4>Hold on.
Policy perspective,</v>

981
01:10:08.861 --> 01:10:13.480
I guess specifically us are all warm American politics.

982
01:10:13.481 --> 01:10:18.481
People who take taking consideration economic circumstances

983
01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:22.430
<v 1>from whose perspective</v>

984
01:10:23.570 --> 01:10:25.480
<v 4>it governments or world?</v>

985
01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:31.280
<v 1>Well,
the government doesn't have a brain.
I mean in the government is,</v>

986
01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:38.680
I would say it depends on the economy.
Um,

987
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:44.080
so if you had to choose,
this is a personal interpretation.
Uh,

988
01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:47.090
it's not a fact.
If you had to choose,

989
01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:52.180
let's say between a group of very highly skilled immigrants or a group of very

990
01:10:52.521 --> 01:10:53.354
low skilled,

991
01:10:54.230 --> 01:10:59.230
let's say illiterate immigrants and they were moving into society where the

992
01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:03.810
mode,
most of the population was illiterate,
then it,

993
01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:05.660
it wouldn't,
the,

994
01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:10.661
the illiterate immigrant population would not be a serious issue really.

995
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:16.350
But if they're moving a society in which you have to be literate in order to

996
01:11:16.351 --> 01:11:20.310
have any chance of economic sustainability and,

997
01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:22.650
and advancement,

998
01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:26.920
it would not be a good idea to import large numbers of people who are not going

999
01:11:26.921 --> 01:11:29.590
to make it in that society.
So it's it,

1000
01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:33.720
it's a question of both the nature and characteristics of the immigrants and the

1001
01:11:33.721 --> 01:11:36.830
nature and characteristics of the economy and society,

1002
01:11:36.831 --> 01:11:41.220
and to which they're moving.
But governments,
you know,

1003
01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:44.550
if you're asking me what is the position of the U S or British government on

1004
01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:46.940
this,
they don't really have one.
You know,
they,

1005
01:11:46.941 --> 01:11:51.941
it's just the pushing and shoving of different interest groups and wherever the

1006
01:11:52.861 --> 01:11:56.700
vectors of pushing and shoving and up is what the government policy is,

1007
01:11:56.701 --> 01:12:00.660
but it's not necessarily thought through in a kind of logical way.

1008
01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:04.140
I think I saw one other hand,
we were running out of time.

1009
01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:11.130
<v 3>Good.
[inaudible].</v>
