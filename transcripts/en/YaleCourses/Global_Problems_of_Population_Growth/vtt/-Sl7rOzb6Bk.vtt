WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:05.340
So,
uh,
we're discussing,
uh,

2
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.410
in this MDL was every,
sorry,

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we're discussing the fertility transition and we've talked that prior to the

4
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:19.560
fertility transition,
there was a control on fertility,

5
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.200
but it was at a very high level and

6
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.700
you add in different parts of the world.

7
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.410
We talked in very general terms about it.

8
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.760
I want to just describe a little bit about what the story was in Europe,

9
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:36.300
exactly how,
uh,
fertility was controlled.

10
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.560
And one of the main reasons that I've mentioned this before but not really

11
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.710
described it,
is control of marriage.

12
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:49.490
That the number of people that were allowed to in some sense get married,

13
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.330
changed with economic conditions and agricultural conditions.

14
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.800
And you can see that very clearly where we get statistics from the period.

15
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.480
So as you know,
uh,
the first year of the black death was this 13,
47,

16
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.740
1348 and huge numbers of people died and good.

17
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.030
Their land was immediately taken over by someone else.

18
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.350
Immediately these new landowners got married,
got married.

19
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.870
There was an enormous burst of marriage.

20
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.050
So like in one small French village,

21
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.920
there had been 10 to 12 marriages a year in the preceding decade.

22
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.050
In 1349,
the first year after that phase of the plague past,

23
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.130
he'd win,
uh,

24
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:36.570
from 10 to 12 to 86 marriages and an enormous thing.

25
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.560
And so what was going on is there was a,

26
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.880
before the black death when Europe was crowded for,
for its system,
uh,

27
00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.210
there was a huge pool of unmarried,
uh,

28
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.630
individuals who really wanted to get married but did not have any land on which

29
00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:56.730
to support themselves or a family.

30
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.840
And the opening of the land allows marriage to take place.

31
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.010
And then not only did they get married right away,

32
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:10.260
but the women got pregnant immediately.

33
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.120
And one contemporary observer wrote,
there are pregnant women wherever you look,

34
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.790
and this is 1349.

35
00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.720
So up and this fertility rate,

36
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:26.721
it was a flexible system that moved up and down according to Emma economic and

37
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:32.310
demographic conditions in England,
there's data from the 1550s,
and,

38
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.160
and,
and later the grocery production rate.

39
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.420
That's the number of women from w are certain number of women in one generation.

40
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.010
How many female children do they produce in the 1550s,

41
00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:48.330
it was 2.8.
So one will reproduce a woman.

42
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:51.840
The grocery we've got for it should be one,
but they were producing 2.8.

43
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.230
A century later it drops down to 1.8,

44
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.710
and by that 1650s and by eighties,

45
00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.690
it rises again to over three.
So there's enormous range between,

46
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.490
uh,
one,
uh,
uh,
close to one less than two,

47
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.740
just reproducing themselves,

48
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.580
getting into this dangerous thing where very high death rates,

49
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:18.640
where the whole society at that rate won't continue.

50
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.430
And a factor of three women,

51
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.040
which will do just fine.

52
00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.570
So you can see the same thing at the age of marriage.
Uh,

53
00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:35.390
know the numbers of marriage of course,
but the age of marriage,
uh,

54
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:39.730
during the early 18 hundreds,
remember that was a time when the,
you're the,

55
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:40.391
you're American foods.

56
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:44.110
They're European population was rising strong as a high birth rate.

57
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.000
So land hunger became the land.
There was no extra land available.

58
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.830
So marriage became later and later and eventually reached 23 to 28,
uh,

59
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:57.370
for females and even older than that,
uh,
for males.

60
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.290
So by that time,

61
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:04.291
probably the average lifespan with like 35 that had improved some.

62
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.090
But if,
if you're fertile at say 15 and you don't marry till 28,

63
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.560
that's a huge chunk of your reproductive life where you're not reproducing.

64
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.480
That reduces the birth rate and keeps the population in check

65
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.050
whoever.
Once in marriage,

66
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.540
the children just just flowed that there was no apparently no control or within

67
00:04:28.541 --> 00:04:33.480
marriage whatsoever.
So in 300 year,

68
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.390
all the data that we have says that in 300 years in Europe,

69
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.820
there was no control of fertility within marriage.
All the control,

70
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:47.290
all the social control of population was in how many people got married,

71
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.000
what they called the nuptial reality,

72
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.380
that the fraction of people that got night was the total mechanism of social

73
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:58.990
control.
There's of course a external control by,
by disease,

74
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:02.350
by famines because some plague of the plants.

75
00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.440
And then there were individual controls,

76
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:08.740
which we've talked about infanticide and and so forth.

77
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.150
But in terms of social controls,
the north through Northwestern,

78
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.200
the northern Europeans,

79
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.230
especially in Northwestern European model was control marriage and it was quite

80
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:22.660
effective.
But these,
uh,

81
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:28.090
these marriage controls didn't just happen automatically.

82
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.670
People just didn't sort of have a rational sense of this at all.

83
00:05:30.671 --> 00:05:33.030
I can't get married there.
There was really the,

84
00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:36.520
the controls were forced upon them.
So,
uh,

85
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.690
most land was owned by some land owner and the man was given a plot of land,

86
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:45.680
which he could work.
It was a size,

87
00:05:45.681 --> 00:05:50.560
so that one individual could work this plot of land.
He starts having children.

88
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.160
Well,
Lou,
the landlord knows that only one,

89
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:59.480
one son is needed to farm that land.
So,

90
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.793
uh,

91
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.900
and the father knows he can only give that land to one son.

92
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.820
So there's tremendous pressure.
If you have extra children,

93
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.790
they can't stay at home.
You'll see when we talked about China,

94
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:15.980
very different model.
If he can't stay home,

95
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.910
those people are forced off to the cities and in the cities,

96
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.450
the cities are very dangerous and disease ridden places.

97
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:28.280
So they just die in the cities and the cities are growing.
During this time,

98
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:32.330
but very high death rates still on the cities,
about one third.

99
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.650
Each generation has to be replenished as I've mentioned to by about one third in

100
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:38.990
the cities.
Um,

101
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:45.310
so in the landlord of course didn't want these extra children around cause he

102
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:48.710
would have more and more people to feed with the same amount of land,

103
00:06:48.711 --> 00:06:51.200
therefore the same amount of product production.

104
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.060
So you had to get the landlord's permission in order to get married.

105
00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:00.110
And if you didn't,
if he didn't have extra land for you,

106
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.010
you couldn't get married.
And of course,
officially it wasn't the landlord,

107
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:07.310
but it was the local parish church that you had to get married in.

108
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:12.020
But guess who hired the parish?
A minister or a priest,
the local landlord.

109
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.470
And the whole structure of churches almost everywhere is that they are very much

110
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.740
either controlled by or mutual support of the,

111
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:26.990
the Gentry,
the rich people and the religious authorities intermix.

112
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.870
So,
uh,

113
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.950
they weren't allowed to get married either by the landlord or by,
by the church.

114
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.280
And it was very,
you had to post what they called bands.

115
00:07:37.281 --> 00:07:40.280
So everybody knew there was a marriage and of course the landlord would notice.

116
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:45.470
And so it was,
it was impossible to do anything about that.

117
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.270
Another mechanism was going off becoming a servant.

118
00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:54.500
That was one of the very standard kinds of things.
Um,

119
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:59.270
they would,
uh,
leave home,
very young,

120
00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.460
become servant and serve males and females,
both servants in the houses.

121
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.740
You've all seen all these Victorian movies and earlier movies.

122
00:08:06.741 --> 00:08:09.020
You know how many servants they have.
Of course,

123
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:13.490
they were never allowed to get married.
Uh,
no allowed to have sex.
No,

124
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.950
no boyfriend,
no girlfriend,
none of that was a lot.
Very,

125
00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:20.420
very strict rules on how servants and how students were very large fraction

126
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.870
of the young people of,
of everybody in say England.

127
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.013
Um,

128
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:34.070
then those that didn't become servants would go off somewhere to become an

129
00:08:34.071 --> 00:08:38.990
apprentice.
You know,
one son stays at home.
It does go off and become apprentices.

130
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.940
And apprenticeship was a very long period of time in which they had to learn the

131
00:08:43.941 --> 00:08:46.540
skills and get,
um,

132
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:51.260
get some sort of resources so that they could buy the equipment and rent a shop

133
00:08:51.261 --> 00:08:54.920
and set up eventually on their own or wait until the master died and then

134
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.020
inherit the masters,
uh,
place.

135
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.960
So the,
the end result of all this is that it took many,

136
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:08.961
many years to establish a sufficient economic base so that the society would

137
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:15.051
allow you to get married and many people never gotten out of it.

138
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.110
I'll show you a little bit later what the marriage rates,

139
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:24.111
actually we're in Europe or during this period and it's surprisingly low in the

140
00:09:25.261 --> 00:09:29.730
culture adapts to this.
What do all these unmarried men and women do?

141
00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:33.210
But you have the spinster,
the spinster a woman,

142
00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:36.090
you have the confirmed bachelor.
Again,

143
00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:38.700
using men in much British comedy in British movies is about,

144
00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:41.970
always has characters in it where,
you know,
some confirmed bachelor,

145
00:09:41.971 --> 00:09:44.010
he's just not getting married.
Uh,

146
00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.480
presumably a fair amount of the homosexuality that was president,

147
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:49.870
especially in the British upper classes,

148
00:09:49.871 --> 00:09:54.871
is due to this whole tradition that a lot of nails are not going to get married.

149
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.250
And then they do something else with their sexual impulse.
Of course,

150
00:09:59.251 --> 00:10:03.270
that's not proven.
We don't really understand the basis of homosexuality.

151
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.970
Uh,
females.
Uh,

152
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:11.460
we're also do like the males a forced off the land because they were not the

153
00:10:11.461 --> 00:10:15.510
wife of the,
the one son that inherited the land.

154
00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:16.960
They had to go somewhere else.

155
00:10:16.961 --> 00:10:19.320
So they went to the cities where there were not jobs,

156
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:24.180
especially not jobs for women.
Um,
so,
uh,

157
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.660
they become,
uh,
sort of a floating population,

158
00:10:28.050 --> 00:10:30.180
a very largely prostitutes,

159
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.600
huge explosion of prostitution at this time,

160
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.320
both because of the excess women that are trying to,
to stay alive,

161
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:41.100
that have migrated into the cities and there's all these bachelors,

162
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.630
they're having some sort of job that could pay for their services.

163
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.110
So,
and of course,
you know,

164
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.550
that babies that resulted from any of these situations were very often just

165
00:10:53.551 --> 00:10:56.730
abandoned and left to die.

166
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.630
So this control of marriage,

167
00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.180
that that marriage was the control on pop,

168
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:12.220
the social control on population lasted well into the 18 hundreds well into and

169
00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:17.961
possibly even through the Victorian era and these mechanisms together reduced,

170
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:19.800
uh,

171
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:24.480
the north European birth rate and especially in England to about 50% of what

172
00:11:24.481 --> 00:11:29.481
otherwise could have been that remember we did calculations of someone goes out,

173
00:11:29.741 --> 00:11:34.620
how many children one can have and then there's always examples much to the high

174
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:38.250
end of that.
But in England,
taking a reasonable number,

175
00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:42.450
these controls of marriage cut the birth rate in half.

176
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.530
Okay.
So what did it feel like to the people involved in this?

177
00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.870
And I suspect a fair number of you have,
uh,

178
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.450
heard this quote,
it's a letter from a woman to her uncle.

179
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.780
Don't,
don't shout out the,
raise your hand if you know,

180
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.480
I think dearest uncle that you cannot really wish me to be the mother of a

181
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:09.550
numerous family for,

182
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:14.551
I think you will see the great inconvenience in a large family would be the

183
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:17.200
hardship to myself.

184
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:22.600
Men never think what a hard task it is for us women to go through this pregnancy

185
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:27.640
very often.
Have you heard this?
No.
No one's heard this letter.
It's very famous.

186
00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:31.290
So this is a woman in this system,
the way she,

187
00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:34.330
and she's married and therefore she's having cha children one after the other

188
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:38.410
with no kind of control.
And she's coming.
This is hard on me,
you know?

189
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:43.210
And why don't you man ever think how hard this is on me.
You know?
So,
uh,

190
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:45.160
what social class,
this poor woman,

191
00:12:45.161 --> 00:12:48.610
middle class and upper class woman having all this way,

192
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.540
no ideas.
It's Queen Victoria.

193
00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.810
So here's by far the richest woman in the world has all the help,
all the money,

194
00:12:58.811 --> 00:13:01.720
all the food.
And even for her it's a burden.

195
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.610
And she probably doesn't have to do much of the burden except just straight up

196
00:13:04.611 --> 00:13:06.430
of the pregnancy and childbearing.

197
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.910
And if she perceives it as a burden,

198
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.010
then can you imagine what the common woman thinks of it?
Oh,
and by the way,

199
00:13:15.011 --> 00:13:19.510
so it's,
it's Queen Victoria to her uncle who is king Leopold of Belgium.

200
00:13:20.350 --> 00:13:23.470
You've heard this before.

201
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.240
And so

202
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.490
when,
well,
let's see,

203
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.130
this is one of the things that,
ah,

204
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:44.640
so sexuality itself,
uh,

205
00:13:44.641 --> 00:13:48.700
since I made it a lot of problems with sexuality at that time,

206
00:13:48.701 --> 00:13:51.160
you'd reading some stuff about it.

207
00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:56.850
And one of the things is that men inside from the childbirth aspect of it,

208
00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:01.090
that women were of course always worried that if they had sex,

209
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:02.290
they would get pregnant.

210
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:05.740
And often they did usually even they probably did not want to get pregnant,

211
00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.450
but also the men were not,
uh,
uh,

212
00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.820
very skilled.
They either did not know how to pleasure a woman,
uh,

213
00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.600
they didn't want to or they thought it was very improper to,
uh,

214
00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:24.510
even tried us to pleasure a woman.
So here's another quote,
uh,

215
00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.120
from Lady Alice Huntington.
Hilling,
sorry.

216
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:33.040
Hillingdon 1857,
uh,
and she died only in 1940.

217
00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:36.310
So we're really coming up to a fairly recent kinds of times.

218
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.670
And presumably this was written in your journal in 1912.

219
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:41.260
No one can find that journal.

220
00:14:41.261 --> 00:14:45.100
So they don't know the state of pro how apocryphal this is.

221
00:14:45.101 --> 00:14:49.240
But this is a quote that again,
you've probably heard at least part of it.

222
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:51.980
I'm happy now.
The George,

223
00:14:51.981 --> 00:14:56.981
her husband calls in my bed chamber less frequently than then of old as it is I

224
00:14:58.821 --> 00:15:01.610
now endure,
but two calls a week.

225
00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.410
And when I hear his steps outside my door,
I lied down upon my bed,

226
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:09.620
close my eyes,
open my legs.
And think of England.

227
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.770
Sometimes the code is,

228
00:15:12.771 --> 00:15:16.280
think of Victoria and budget apparently think of England is the proper.

229
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:18.831
And again,

230
00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:22.250
we're not talking about some poor woman with a brutal husband is in some Oliver

231
00:15:22.251 --> 00:15:26.000
twist or one of these movies.
This is a,
a very high uh,

232
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:29.930
stage lady.
Um,

233
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:35.840
so how did this change and who,
who was arrayed against this?
So,

234
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.670
uh,
people,
women especially,
we're not happy with the situation.

235
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:45.170
A young man of course wanted to get married,
couldn't chill.
They were old.

236
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:50.350
We've talked about that situation in Africa where the bride price is very high.

237
00:15:51.021 --> 00:15:53.240
The old men control the bride price.

238
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:56.960
They don't allow the young men to get married until it was almost a revolution.

239
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:02.330
And this is an aside,
but with respect to the bride price,
you know,

240
00:16:02.331 --> 00:16:05.960
we hear a lot about older men,
uh,

241
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:08.630
marrying or having sex with younger women in the West.

242
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.780
It's one of the things we sort of complain about,
about other,

243
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.830
other cultures at this great disparity in age and older man with a younger
woman.

244
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.160
And we tend to blame the man who's getting married.

245
00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.830
But if you think of it from the point of view,
their society,

246
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.970
that man has been under the control of even older guys,
the really powerful guys.

247
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.040
And so he's been abused and not allowed to get married til he sold the women of

248
00:16:31.041 --> 00:16:35.390
his age already married to the much older guys.
So this is his only option.

249
00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.270
So again,
within a society,
uh,

250
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:43.250
these things all intermingle and,
and,
and form a pattern,

251
00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:47.300
not necessarily a good pattern,
not necessarily a pattern that the people,
uh,

252
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:52.340
uh,
like.
Uh,
but it is a,
it is a tight web.

253
00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:56.510
Uh,
coming back to Europe,

254
00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:02.420
this was this unfortunate situation where young men weren't allowed to get

255
00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:05.330
married.
Young women weren't allowed to get married.
Once you're in marriage,

256
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:10.570
the sexual mores were so straight jacketed that it was not certainly not

257
00:17:10.731 --> 00:17:12.470
pleasurable for most of the women apparently.

258
00:17:12.471 --> 00:17:15.470
And who knows what the men were using it.

259
00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:19.850
But the Victorian pornography during this period is lots of Mres,

260
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.700
lots of prostitution and lots of of being whipped.
They,

261
00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:25.190
they love to get punished,
uh,
themselves.

262
00:17:25.191 --> 00:17:30.191
A surprising perponderance of a masochistic sexuality in the Victorian

263
00:17:31.671 --> 00:17:35.100
literature of that time.
So at least from our point of view,
uh,

264
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.470
sexuality was a mess.
Okay.
So some people tried to change this.

265
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.550
Of course there's always pioneers.
And in England,
uh,

266
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:48.050
one of the pioneers was a,
uh,
uh,
a man and a woman.
Uh,
Charles,

267
00:17:48.051 --> 00:17:52.470
Brad Law and Annie an 1877,
uh,

268
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.480
family planning was,

269
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.910
contraception was coming into a possibility in England.

270
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.650
And so they distributed,

271
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:04.740
printed and distributed what we would now consider a very mild,

272
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:09.850
a pamphlet about birth control called the fruits of philosophy because very

273
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.970
abstract falls,
you know,
philosophical.
So,
of course what happened to them,

274
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.780
arrested and died and the official an indictment accused them of inciting and

275
00:18:21.331 --> 00:18:25.740
encouraging the subjects of the queen to indecent,
obscene,

276
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:30.750
unnatural and immoral practices.
And to bring them,
the citizens,

277
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.470
the citizens of the Queen,
the subjects of the queen to a state of wickedness.

278
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.940
Lewdness and a Boucherie.
This is because they were saying that,
well,

279
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:41.730
there's these things called condoms around and you know,
why don't you use them?

280
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.983
<v 1>MMM.</v>

281
00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:52.560
<v 0>And this trial was very interesting that in a culture you,</v>

282
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.880
there are certain things you can't talk about.

283
00:18:53.881 --> 00:18:55.530
If something is culturally forbidden,

284
00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.130
like almost anything to do with sex in marriage,

285
00:18:59.131 --> 00:19:03.000
you're just couldn't talk about it.
Now here's this big trial in London,

286
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.180
very famous.
All the newspapers are carrying it.
And guess what?

287
00:19:06.181 --> 00:19:11.181
Everybody learns about birth control and a very big thing.

288
00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:15.880
And some scholar,
some historians attribute,
uh,

289
00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.540
that there's just the period when,

290
00:19:17.541 --> 00:19:20.610
when the use of birth control is increasing tremendously in England.

291
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.950
And that this trial popularized it.

292
00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.860
What do we have something similar a few years ago in America

293
00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:31.120
with our president,
Bill Clinton and oral sex?

294
00:19:31.121 --> 00:19:35.750
Or you all too young to remember that was a taboo,
taboo topic.

295
00:19:35.751 --> 00:19:39.020
You could not discuss it.
And then the right,
the right wing,

296
00:19:39.021 --> 00:19:43.430
the conservatives who are opposed to this kind of free sexual activity

297
00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:47.780
publicized it and publicize and publicize until every teenager in America knew

298
00:19:47.781 --> 00:19:48.650
about oral sex.

299
00:19:48.651 --> 00:19:53.651
And now the data is that oral sex is just gone exponentially down into the high

300
00:19:53.991 --> 00:19:57.320
schools and even junior high schools.
And I can tell you stories about that,

301
00:19:57.321 --> 00:20:01.880
but I won't.
Um,
so with all this,
uh,

302
00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.800
moralizing about it,
that,
uh,

303
00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.710
the religious leaders,
the political leaders,
uh,

304
00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.850
the medical doctors said it was,
it was bad for you.

305
00:20:13.851 --> 00:20:18.830
You've read some of that in your reading.
Uh,
everybody is,
uh,

306
00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.060
they were terrorized in,
in a sense that it was an intellectual terrorism.

307
00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.310
One of the people that they feared legal process,

308
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.700
prosecution and most of these things were illegal to buy things,

309
00:20:28.701 --> 00:20:32.530
to use thing to write about them and publish them.
Uh,

310
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.490
they were told that they would get physical injury.
You may have heard that,

311
00:20:37.491 --> 00:20:41.610
you know,
masturbation will make you blind.
And that,

312
00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:46.400
I don't know if any of your parents said that,
but I heard it in my time.
Uh,

313
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.970
mental injury,
if it doesn't make you blind,

314
00:20:48.971 --> 00:20:53.971
it'll make you go crazy and deep moral reservations and just straight aesthetic

315
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:59.920
d this taste,
um,
that,
you know,
when the society frowns on something,

316
00:20:59.921 --> 00:21:04.450
we sort of have incorporated a kind of revulsion to anything which society

317
00:21:04.451 --> 00:21:07.540
considers a disgusting.

318
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.200
And contraceptives themselves were considered repulsive,

319
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.580
unnatural only for prostitutes,
that kind of thing.

320
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.380
And of course at that time,
almost a lot of people were starting to do it,

321
00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.210
but since you couldn't talk about it publicly,

322
00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.460
no one knew what everyone else is doing.

323
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:29.550
So they make what they had to take this great leap themselves in defiance of

324
00:21:30.251 --> 00:21:33.970
everything that their culture,
uh,
is,
is telling them.

325
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:36.993
So how did it,
how,

326
00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:40.750
what happened in individual is starting to think about these things.

327
00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:45.550
So we have,
uh,
some interesting and what a lot of,

328
00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.780
a lot of letters,
a lot of interesting stuff and uh,
referred to in the reading.

329
00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:54.460
Some of this is in your reading letters to various pioneers,
Margaret Sanger or,

330
00:21:54.461 --> 00:21:56.640
um,
who has it in England,
the,
uh,

331
00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.470
and for blocking on the name of the clinic in England,

332
00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.580
we have letters from women sort of begging information on how to,

333
00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.050
how to keep from getting pregnant again,
but a lot of it is,

334
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.590
is not with any official organizations,
women talking to women.

335
00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:16.410
And some of it can be relaxed it a little bit later stage.
So there's a,

336
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:21.750
a series of Nice interviews from the 1920s and thirties,

337
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.120
um,
with elderly,

338
00:22:25.121 --> 00:22:29.950
Italian and Jewish women in the United States.
And,
uh,

339
00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:33.580
they talk to each other about technique because techniques is one of the thing.

340
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.250
And this interview is from an Italian American woman

341
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:41.460
born in the night,
uh,
born in the u s in 1920.

342
00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:46.810
A recent immigrant parents.
And the conversation took place in the late 1930s.

343
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:52.300
She works in a hairdressing salon and shortly she gets engaged and of course,

344
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:56.590
all her coworkers know about it.
And so an interviewer,

345
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.830
anthropologists or sociologists goes in and starts asking her about it.

346
00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:04.450
And apparently prior to this little quote they had brought up the topic of birth

347
00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:06.430
control.
So the interviewer says,

348
00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:09.580
how did you learn about condoms to Nina?

349
00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.140
One of my customers said,
I really hope you don't get pregnant,

350
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:18.610
let him wear a rain coat.
So I started wondering,

351
00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:22.750
I'm thinking I'm working and my mind just can't work out on a raincoat is,

352
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:28.210
and then Mary White who worked for me,
he said,
baby,
what's on your mind?

353
00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:32.680
And I said,
Mrs. Jacobs said a funny thing to me.
She said,

354
00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:36.760
my ring was lovely or marriage ring.
Uh,
uh,

355
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:37.993
was lovely,

356
00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:42.460
but she hoped I didn't start a family and he should wear a raincoat,

357
00:23:43.150 --> 00:23:46.100
but I can't ask Johnny to wear rain to bed.

358
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:51.910
And so this Mary White laughed and laughed and says she means he used to wear a

359
00:23:52.731 --> 00:23:55.550
condom.
What is it Nina said?

360
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:59.310
And then she got told and got enlightened in this way.

361
00:23:59.311 --> 00:24:03.280
And it's that kind of conversation where individual people have,
you know,

362
00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:08.040
not very high class are learning that it's okay to buck the trend.
And,

363
00:24:08.041 --> 00:24:11.240
and even the basic information they previously don't,
don't have.

364
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:15.860
It doesn't always work out that when these discussions take place,
that the,

365
00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.410
that the participants do take on the new behavior,

366
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.140
sometimes they don't want to want to do that.

367
00:24:21.650 --> 00:24:25.760
And gossip,
most conversation by humans is gossip.

368
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.490
And there's,
there's very good studies showing this.

369
00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:32.870
And we know that from our chimp days were very social species.

370
00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:36.860
That status is so terribly important and status translates to social

371
00:24:36.861 --> 00:24:37.850
acceptability.

372
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:42.950
So the purpose of gossip is to find out what the limits of social acceptability

373
00:24:42.951 --> 00:24:47.570
are.
Gossip is almost exclusively about someone who has stepped over what was

374
00:24:47.571 --> 00:24:51.590
perceived to be the limit and either gotten away with it or not gotten away with

375
00:24:51.591 --> 00:24:54.230
it or something that's down just inside the limit.

376
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.680
So large fraction of gossip is to see what is socially acceptable in my circle.

377
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.330
And sometimes like we've seen here,

378
00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:07.520
the use of condoms become socially acceptable as a result of discussions like

379
00:25:07.521 --> 00:25:12.220
this.
Sometimes it,
it,
at least this individual at this time,
uh,

380
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:17.510
it doesn't become
acceptable.

381
00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:23.000
Now where's this other quote that I'm just looking for?
Ah,

382
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:27.650
so this is,
uh,
another two women,
uh,
and the interview asks,

383
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:29.390
how did your friends have abortions?

384
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.870
The issue of abortions came up and as you probably have read or will read

385
00:25:32.871 --> 00:25:37.520
abortions at this time,
a very,
very common all illegal.
Uh,
but very common.

386
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:39.440
Uh,
Peggy,

387
00:25:39.441 --> 00:25:44.180
I'm trying to think what they would take because they tell me a lot of them

388
00:25:44.181 --> 00:25:48.380
would have a friend who had put something up there that would bring on their

389
00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:52.430
period,
the interviewer,
a knitting needle.
Peggy,
no,

390
00:25:52.431 --> 00:25:53.450
not a knitting needle.

391
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:58.040
Some kind of fluid like hot boiling water or salt water.

392
00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.300
They would ruin their insides.
They would say,
oh,
Peggy,

393
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:07.280
don't you,
don't you do that?
Oh No,
I would never do that.

394
00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:11.930
That's my husband.
It's the man who takes care.
And,

395
00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:15.620
uh,
and it's interesting that in this particular case,
you know,

396
00:26:15.621 --> 00:26:18.830
it's usually a woman's responsibility,
most good.
But in this case,

397
00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:20.420
whenever it was going on in the marriage,

398
00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:25.250
she perceived it as the husband's case and in further discussion that it was his

399
00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:29.900
responsibility to use a condom all the time.
So,

400
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.713
uh,

401
00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:36.440
and the reason given by the woman is not any moral consideration,

402
00:26:36.441 --> 00:26:39.860
no life.
You know,
I'm saying get away that,
that's not the consideration,

403
00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.890
but it's straight a medical thing.
It's just at that time,
the math,
the,

404
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.720
since it was illegal and if you didn't,

405
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:49.050
even if you went to a practitioner was very,
very dangerous,

406
00:26:49.051 --> 00:26:51.980
but the kinds of things that women actually used on themselves rather than it

407
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:53.070
was so incredibly dangerous.

408
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:56.580
So the reason she's not having an abortion is that she didn't want to ruin

409
00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:59.850
herself in,
in a medical,
uh,
sort of way.

410
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:03.870
You take this same woman transposer 50 years later,

411
00:27:03.871 --> 00:27:08.280
we're now abortion is safe and possibly illegal.
Uh,
she,

412
00:27:08.281 --> 00:27:10.770
the same woman may have a very different attitude toward it,

413
00:27:10.771 --> 00:27:15.690
but of course we don't know anything about that.
So the,

414
00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:17.600
the point of this,
uh,

415
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:22.380
these series of stories is a big change in,
in,

416
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.300
in culture that prior the,
you know,

417
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.770
every society has to control population in some way.

418
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.220
And we've talked about,
you know,
the physical constraints,

419
00:27:32.221 --> 00:27:35.970
the disease and famines.
We've talked about the social controls,

420
00:27:35.971 --> 00:27:40.430
like not being able to get married,
but up until in,
in,

421
00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.460
in Europe,
up until very recently,
there was no individual control.

422
00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:49.500
Individuals themselves did not have the cultural freedom to make these kinds of

423
00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:52.710
decisions.
Once married,
procreation just keep,

424
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:57.830
keeps going one after the other until either someone dies or the woman becomes

425
00:27:58.650 --> 00:27:59.483
infertile.

426
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:06.020
And so now we're seeing a transition where individuals can start deciding for

427
00:28:06.061 --> 00:28:08.840
themselves very big change,
uh,

428
00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:13.020
in the extension of agency that what a person thinks they can control about

429
00:28:13.021 --> 00:28:16.620
their lives.
So here is a,
uh,

430
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.030
an elderly Jewish woman,
uh,
was,
uh,

431
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:27.180
uh,
report talking about her mother and said that the,
uh,

432
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.820
the way the neighbors now start controlling this,
uh,
she,
the,

433
00:28:32.821 --> 00:28:36.480
so the mother who did not use any kind of of fertility control,

434
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.780
her friends and relatives who sort of get on her case,

435
00:28:39.781 --> 00:28:44.670
but mile trainers who are mildly,
when she would get pregnant,
they would say,
oh,

436
00:28:44.671 --> 00:28:49.150
Esther,
not another belly.
And so at this time,
uh,

437
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:50.640
friends,
relatives,

438
00:28:50.641 --> 00:28:55.560
neighbors start imposing a new culture on you that there's,

439
00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:56.500
you know,
you can be,

440
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:59.670
there's some aspects of freedom that the individual now gets to choose.

441
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
But the culture comes on and now at least starts to import a new cultural norm

442
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:12.030
on you.
So,
uh,
in Sicily,
uh,
you know,

443
00:29:12.031 --> 00:29:15.630
reputed to have very high ha actually having high fertility rates,

444
00:29:15.631 --> 00:29:20.630
but some point they go through their transition.
And this is,
uh,

445
00:29:21.090 --> 00:29:23.520
in 1980 and the 1980s,

446
00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:28.550
very late and [inaudible] is a report of a woman who's one of the few remaining

447
00:29:29.221 --> 00:29:31.080
peasants in this village.
You know,

448
00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:34.110
Sisley like all the rest of the world is changing and growing up.

449
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:38.050
And she reported that of,
of the,

450
00:29:38.051 --> 00:29:41.100
these family that's still had child after child after child,

451
00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:45.330
their neighbors called them animals.
And this is,
you know,
Sicilian two,

452
00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.380
two Sicilian,
uh,

453
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.450
is another example of this,

454
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:58.810
a Jewish immigrant in the u s writing to her mother back in,
in Poland.

455
00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.680
So this is a lovely letter here in America.

456
00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.590
It is the customer that if a woman wants to,

457
00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:09.640
she has a baby and if she does not want to have any,
she doesn't.

458
00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:14.070
David's wife,
I don't know that that's a brother or something.

459
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:18.160
David's wife says that she will have a baby every four years.

460
00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:22.810
I think it is good to have one every three years.
And so after three years,

461
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:26.410
I shall have another,
it is terrible cut at home.

462
00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:31.110
Women suffer only hardships and childbearing whom being Poland,
uh,
in,

463
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.170
in this case.
And it's,

464
00:30:34.171 --> 00:30:36.940
it's really interesting that the technology is not of interest to her.

465
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.260
She doesn't,
in this case,

466
00:30:38.261 --> 00:30:41.860
talking about the wonderful new contraceptives that they have in America,

467
00:30:41.861 --> 00:30:46.640
which of course they would not have had,
uh,
in,
in Poland.
Uh,

468
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.570
nor about the availability of the knowledge about it,

469
00:30:49.571 --> 00:30:53.560
the availability of the technology of it.
She doesn't talk about economics.
Uh,

470
00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:54.491
she doesn't say,
Oh,

471
00:30:54.491 --> 00:30:57.550
we can't afford it or we can't afford her and any of that sort of stuff.

472
00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:02.440
She's talks about what to hers is startling new idea that's under her control,

473
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:07.480
that she can choose herself,
what to do and someone else can make a different,
uh,

474
00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:10.510
kind of a choice.
And what she's,

475
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:15.190
what she's a exuberant about is the lack of cultural constraints.

476
00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:20.220
She's now a free individual to navigate the world as she sees it in herself.

477
00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:23.773
Um,

478
00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.440
okay.
There's one that I,

479
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.823
<v 1>okay.</v>

480
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:41.310
<v 0>And also when these,
in all these discussions,
men are rarely mentioned.</v>

481
00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.850
It really is sort of a women's,
a decision here and the,

482
00:31:44.851 --> 00:31:49.170
and the women are working it out.
And again,
in most of these things,

483
00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:53.160
well and a lot of these things,
uh,
sometimes it is the man and you know,

484
00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:54.870
no matter what I say,
he won't stay away from me.

485
00:31:54.871 --> 00:31:59.400
But once the contraception comes in that men want to sex and you get a lot of

486
00:31:59.401 --> 00:32:02.730
conflict,
if they're not using contraception,
contraception comes in.

487
00:32:03.180 --> 00:32:08.010
It seems to be much easier to manage,
uh,
the females.

488
00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:12.030
And so you have

489
00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.990
read some of this in,
in,
in your readings.

490
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:24.540
So
until the demographic.
Uh,

491
00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:30.150
so now I'm going to go back to talking about marriage until the demographic

492
00:32:30.151 --> 00:32:34.200
revolution.
As I said,
the marriage rates were controlled by the community,

493
00:32:34.201 --> 00:32:35.160
not the individual.

494
00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:39.290
And let's look at the marriage rates here.

495
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.920
I can find them without,

496
00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.910
so,
uh,
whoops.
That's not what,
what I might want it.

497
00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.193
Yeah.

498
00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:06.500
So this is Belgium in various provinces in Belgium and Belgium.

499
00:33:08.371 --> 00:33:10.440
As you know,
it's a totally Catholic country.

500
00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.590
And we will talk a little bit more about Belgium in a minute.

501
00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:18.570
And here the dates from,
from before the,
uh,

502
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:22.380
the transition to 1970,
very recent.

503
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.670
This is the end of the marital index.
What fraction got married?

504
00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.280
And look at that 40%,

505
00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:34.650
only 40% of people got married in that year,
that ever,

506
00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.790
ever married.
So that more than half of people are not getting,

507
00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.410
getting married.
And we think of the old days is,
as you know,

508
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:46.350
everybody had to get married.
No.
And then as time goes on,

509
00:33:46.351 --> 00:33:49.080
as the fertility transition takes places,

510
00:33:49.081 --> 00:33:53.010
people are interested or having fewer and fewer children within marriage,

511
00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:58.260
the marriage rate goes up drastically until it's like 70,
75%,

512
00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:01.650
which is kind of a modern rate.
And the same thing,

513
00:34:01.651 --> 00:34:04.740
this is another set of provinces and other set of provinces.

514
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:09.390
There's an tour plays the big cities and Luxembourg,

515
00:34:09.391 --> 00:34:14.000
which I'd not have provinces in Belgium.
So,
uh,

516
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:18.690
a very interesting thing is that again,

517
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:22.140
keeping in mind that societies have to control their fertility.

518
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:28.140
If you're controlling marriage,
if you don't have any mechanism contraception,

519
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.780
then when people get married,
they're going to have babies.
Boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.

520
00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:33.480
So you have to control one Mac,
one method,

521
00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.970
you have to control the number of marriages.

522
00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.270
So you control it extremely 40%.

523
00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:42.990
Now just in China,
we're going to talk about China later.

524
00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:46.530
Do you know what the rate of,
uh,
so there,

525
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:51.360
there the American's complain and Chinese too to some degree about the one child

526
00:34:51.361 --> 00:34:56.361
policy and the excess of female of males that there aren't enough girls to get

527
00:34:56.431 --> 00:35:00.040
married.
And this is going to cause incredible social disruption.
You know what,

528
00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:01.030
you know what the rate,
how,

529
00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:06.110
what the absence of females is there at maximum like 15 or 18%.

530
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:10.500
And so nothing like,
and here 60% of people aren't getting,

531
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.590
getting married and the Chinese situation is still above.
They,
if,

532
00:35:14.591 --> 00:35:16.770
if all the males,
if all the females get married,

533
00:35:16.771 --> 00:35:20.520
something like 85% of men can get married.

534
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:25.590
So if you compare China and Europe,
you see it's,
it's again,

535
00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:30.280
it's not necessarily reality based thing.
This,
this worry about,
uh,

536
00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:35.100
the male female ratio come back here.

537
00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:44.230
This is,
uh,
no,
I ain't gonna have to get my glasses.

538
00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:50.080
This is a map of Europe and the whole of Europe,
including Russia.

539
00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.500
And this is 1870 and 1870.

540
00:35:55.871 --> 00:35:56.080
[inaudible].

541
00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.500
This is from the Princeton project and every one of these little things as a

542
00:35:59.501 --> 00:36:02.650
province of Europe and every one of these provinces,

543
00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:05.710
they've collected data on everything under the sun for,

544
00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:09.400
and this is the marriage rate.
So look here,

545
00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:14.700
the red is less than 30% when you have an occasion place in northern Scotland.

546
00:36:15.521 --> 00:36:17.200
I think this is bold.

547
00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.883
<v 1>Uh</v>

548
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:22.660
<v 0>Oh,
just this.
Let's see.
North Italy,</v>

549
00:36:22.661 --> 00:36:25.750
there's not Bulgaria Bulgaria's or more over here.
I can't tell from the map,

550
00:36:25.751 --> 00:36:29.260
but it's a province in southeast,
but look at the red here.

551
00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:34.410
That's under 40% of people are getting married and then some of the lighter

552
00:36:34.661 --> 00:36:39.400
stuff you get into the 40 to 50% and the same truth.
We're middle of Europe,

553
00:36:39.401 --> 00:36:44.320
Germany,
Austria,
Switzerland,
Scandinavia,
Finland,

554
00:36:44.321 --> 00:36:47.680
all through here.
You're all in the 50 and less.

555
00:36:47.681 --> 00:36:52.390
Less than 50% of people are getting married.
1870 little bit.

556
00:36:52.391 --> 00:36:52.931
In Spain,

557
00:36:52.931 --> 00:36:57.931
you get up into a more reasonable range and you have to go all the way out to

558
00:36:58.211 --> 00:37:02.530
the Caspian Sea.
The board of the cans,
Mitzi defined people getting married,

559
00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:06.820
80% of people getting married and a number that we consider something sort of

560
00:37:06.821 --> 00:37:10.660
reasonable for are not,
not now because marriage was rate is falling,

561
00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:15.960
but that was the general preconception of Westerners going up in our society is

562
00:37:16.301 --> 00:37:19.120
that for time and memorial,
almost everybody got married,

563
00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:22.240
but it's not not the case.
The Eastern Europe,

564
00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.910
which was in a rather different mold,

565
00:37:25.090 --> 00:37:29.920
had a higher marriage rate.
Now you look at this,

566
00:37:29.921 --> 00:37:31.450
this is 1870.

567
00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:36.340
When you come up to after the fertility of transition and look,

568
00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:40.450
looks at what happened.
Everybody's going bluish,
right?

569
00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:44.770
Marriage has just shot up all over Europe.
Hooding out here.
It actually went,

570
00:37:44.771 --> 00:37:48.700
got less.
These,
these are sort of doing reverse,
but western Europe where we have,

571
00:37:48.701 --> 00:37:50.680
you know,
lots and lots of good data and understanding,

572
00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.110
there's almost nothing pink left.

573
00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:58.120
And guests now who has the lowest,
uh,

574
00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:01.210
uh,
marriage rate,
Ireland,

575
00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.700
what's special about Ireland at this time?

576
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:08.380
Catholic and no,
no contraception.

577
00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:12.430
So they're not allowed to get married there back in the 30,
40%.

578
00:38:12.431 --> 00:38:15.100
And that's sort of,
uh,
you know,
very characteristic of,

579
00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:19.870
of the sociology of Ireland that the men are very close to their mother and get

580
00:38:19.871 --> 00:38:24.520
married at a very later,
don't get,
get married at all.
Whereas England,

581
00:38:24.521 --> 00:38:29.380
they're Protestant neighbor with sharing all kinds of other cultural aspects is

582
00:38:29.381 --> 00:38:33.160
up there in the 70,
75% of marriage.

583
00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:38.580
So that's one of the really kinds of things that that happened that basically

584
00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:44.770
the spread of marriage that in,
in Europe,
different story,

585
00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:47.620
other parts of the world that Matt,

586
00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:51.940
because of the need to control total population.
In the old days,

587
00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:55.840
people just weren't allowed to get married because once they were in marriage,

588
00:38:55.841 --> 00:38:58.330
they weren't allowed to use contraception.
Once you,

589
00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:02.230
once you flip that equation and open up to individual decision,

590
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:03.940
there's no requirement in all of this.

591
00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:07.430
There's no requirement that people use contraception,
but fam,

592
00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:10.990
families naturally want to have fewer children than they would have naturally.

593
00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:15.190
And so fertility in a family,
uh,
declines.

594
00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.850
The social control of marriage is not needed anymore.
And marriage rate,
uh,

595
00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:25.330
goes,
goes up very high.
And of course,
along with marriage,

596
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:30.190
uh,
that I call this democratizes that marriage gets democratized.

597
00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:35.140
And of course,
sex gets democratized prior to this,
all these,
you know,

598
00:39:35.141 --> 00:39:38.800
all these people that aren't married either have no sex and they have homosexual

599
00:39:38.801 --> 00:39:41.860
sex.
They go to prostitutes.
I mean they,
they,

600
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:44.290
we don't know much about how much sex they had,

601
00:39:44.291 --> 00:39:48.490
but they had one sort of sex and that was what society demanded of them.

602
00:39:48.820 --> 00:39:53.170
Normal marital sex was not allowed in a very small fraction,

603
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:57.040
were able to get married in sex.
So along with the democratization of marriage,

604
00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:01.480
you'll also get the democratization of sex.

605
00:40:03.460 --> 00:40:08.440
So,
um,
good.
Let's,

606
00:40:08.441 --> 00:40:10.330
let's look at some of the details.

607
00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:14.870
<v 1>All of this happening.
Oh,</v>

608
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:17.750
well I've got these pictures.

609
00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:22.640
These big maps are hard for the computer to calculate apparently.
Come on.

610
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:26.180
What is going on here?

611
00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:45.900
<v 0>So this is some of the,
uh,
the contraceptives that were coming in at this time.</v>

612
00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:46.800
Some of the,
there's,

613
00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.670
there's museum does several museums in the world that get all the countries.

614
00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:53.080
One is just stones putting stones in the universe.

615
00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:56.950
These others sort of various forms of,

616
00:40:56.951 --> 00:41:00.390
of blocking of the canal to absorb this and the semen.

617
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:03.390
And you put cotton or something in a little bag like this,

618
00:41:03.391 --> 00:41:06.890
put it in the vagina and then present that,
have these all help.
This,

619
00:41:06.891 --> 00:41:10.470
I don't know exactly what that is,
but again,
some blocking substance.

620
00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.460
Then they can be made not only a vegetable matter,
but metal.

621
00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:19.590
There's a whole bunch of things called pessaries where the,
uh,
cat,
which is some,

622
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:23.430
a cap made out of porcelain or something put over the cervix.

623
00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:26.810
<v 1>Um,
there are,</v>

624
00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:31.270
<v 0>this is,
uh,
a variety of condoms,
including some fairly modern ones.</v>

625
00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:36.560
The older ones.
This is an old way.
They're made older ones look like this.

626
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:40.760
And what do you think was the,
how they originally made condoms?

627
00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:45.440
What the technology was borrowed from something else?

628
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:51.910
What else comes very commonly purchased item come sausages,

629
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:56.900
exactly that.
The,
and what and what,
what was before there's plastics,

630
00:41:56.901 --> 00:42:01.220
what was sausage casings made out of intestines,
animal intestines.

631
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:03.020
They can be made very thin because they're,

632
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:06.620
they're supposed to be as just a small barrier for absorption and they're very

633
00:42:06.621 --> 00:42:07.130
thin.

634
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:12.130
And so they were called skins and I don't know which of these things are which,

635
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:16.010
but,
um,
uh,

636
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:20.330
that was not a very difficult technology to make them out of skins.

637
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:24.530
And here are some more modern things,
various kinds of IUD.

638
00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:29.960
You know,
everything under the sun,
uh,
was tried including the more modern,

639
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:32.630
uh,
oops,
that's the wrong one.

640
00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:38.240
<v 1>Come back
when this is being so slow.</v>

641
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:43.790
<v 0>And this is very ancient technique.
You know,</v>

642
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:47.040
people at different times of believe that almost anything works as it comes to

643
00:42:47.041 --> 00:42:49.670
this is a bone on a string.
Again,

644
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:52.910
placed inside and heavens know what the theory was,

645
00:42:52.911 --> 00:42:56.540
white and that would work in it might've just prevented the man from entering

646
00:42:56.720 --> 00:43:01.610
foreign off or something.
Who Knew?
Who knows?
Uh,
but these,
the,
the,
the string,

647
00:43:01.611 --> 00:43:06.180
it likes like a modern Iud,
whereas in the string hangs out and you can go down.

648
00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:09.860
And what are one of the problems with modern ids until recently?

649
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:12.320
And the same problem here,
you have a string.
What does the string do?

650
00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:19.590
Route for bacteria to,
to,
to swim up.
So the strings are,
are,
are,

651
00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:24.190
are dangerous things.
Okay,
let me get back to the beginning

652
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:30.120
<v 1>this a little bit and no,</v>

653
00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:32.870
this is good.
Come on.

654
00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:48.030
<v 0>So,
so now we've talked about individuals sort of in a variety of ways.
How,</v>

655
00:43:48.031 --> 00:43:51.840
how this happened,
individuals and cultural thing here has this,
you didn't,

656
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:53.730
this wasn't in your reading,
this particular graph.

657
00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:56.970
So here is a graph of the date again,
Europe,

658
00:43:56.971 --> 00:43:59.970
the different countries of Europe and when,

659
00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:03.780
what they're of within marriage,

660
00:44:03.781 --> 00:44:08.070
what their rate of fertility was within marriage with actually 1.0 being the

661
00:44:08.071 --> 00:44:12.120
Hutter right level,
which is the maximum level people haven't achieved.

662
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:17.460
And what do you make out of that?
It's kind of a mess,

663
00:44:18.310 --> 00:44:20.040
right?
You can see something,

664
00:44:20.041 --> 00:44:25.041
you can see France being lower already by 1860 we know it had its transition and

665
00:44:26.101 --> 00:44:27.450
you can't really see much else.

666
00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:33.080
But one of the data that that you read about,

667
00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:38.720
if you take those same graphs and now change their time thing and they ask,

668
00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:45.240
well let's gather each graph at the point visit true traditional level of

669
00:44:45.241 --> 00:44:50.010
fertility,
age or so children and in each country may be a little different,

670
00:44:50.011 --> 00:44:53.700
somewhere between six and eight and then at some point it starts to drop.

671
00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:58.290
And when it's dropped by 10% is a critical stage.

672
00:44:58.291 --> 00:45:03.080
So the Princeton people argued,
and so they've gathered,
this is the years,
uh,

673
00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.870
after reaching the 90% patrols.
So at this point in time,

674
00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:10.710
all of these countries have dropped these,

675
00:45:10.770 --> 00:45:15.770
these curves are gathered to put together the point where they reach 10% drop

676
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:21.330
from there pre transition level,

677
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:23.460
and then it makes more sense.

678
00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:28.610
Look at the way that falls down like crazy until it hits some sort of roughly a

679
00:45:28.741 --> 00:45:33.690
new plateau at about half or so of the earlier plateau,

680
00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:37.740
a little bit less than half.
And the amount of time here,

681
00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:41.820
this is zero years and it's all over maybe in 50 years.

682
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:47.550
And if you look at any one place,
it's much shorter period than that.

683
00:45:47.880 --> 00:45:51.660
So within a very,
what Princeton decided a couple of things,

684
00:45:51.661 --> 00:45:55.320
one that hard to figure out,
but there was,

685
00:45:55.321 --> 00:46:00.150
for some reason various groups started their fertility decline and we'll talk

686
00:46:00.151 --> 00:46:03.330
about various theories of that.
But once it became,

687
00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.830
where's everyone else was horrified about whatever these,

688
00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:10.320
they say it was rich people,
it was outcast people.
Uh,
how did,

689
00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:11.160
how did it in a mirror?

690
00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:15.460
So it was upperclass the fertility clinic happened first of all,
upper class men,

691
00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:20.010
city class among Jews.
And so it's always some sort of a,

692
00:46:20.011 --> 00:46:21.150
of a mark of a,

693
00:46:21.151 --> 00:46:26.040
of a non majority social group that starts social change.

694
00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:31.860
What made the discussion of condoms,
uh,
legitimate in America?
You know,

695
00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:34.770
when I was in you could not mention condom,
no,
no television discussion of it.

696
00:46:34.771 --> 00:46:36.090
News reports never mentioned it.

697
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.750
And what is it that allowed condoms to be discussed in America?

698
00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:45.820
<v 1>You know,
wow.
Alone</v>

699
00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:52.660
<v 0>AIDS epidemic.
And where did the AIDS epidemic started?
Homosexuals.</v>

700
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:55.630
So a marginalized group start something.

701
00:46:55.660 --> 00:46:58.300
It spreads into the culture where to wear clothing.

702
00:46:58.301 --> 00:47:02.860
Fashions often come from the poorest kids.
Often I can see,

703
00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.460
uh,
you know,
uh,
go into the ghetto and see what the kids are wearing.

704
00:47:06.461 --> 00:47:09.530
And six years later you guys are going to be wearing exactly what,

705
00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.960
what they are wearing,
long baggy pants and so forth and showing various parts.

706
00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:17.260
Okay.
So the idea is one,

707
00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:21.010
that's something happens up here and there's a lot of discussion about that.

708
00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:25.870
But once it becomes socially ideas,
once it reaches that 10% level,

709
00:47:26.110 --> 00:47:30.520
Ooh,
it just falls down.
Fertility just falls down like a stone.

710
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:35.980
And,
uh,
in this period,
uh,

711
00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.950
up here,
you can get all kinds of,
you know,

712
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:43.610
economic levels that different economic groups or having different fertility,
uh,

713
00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.010
different educational groups.

714
00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:48.800
So different difference between urban and rural in a different city,

715
00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:51.280
whether their agricultural or in an industry.

716
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:53.140
And you can find all of these differences.

717
00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.630
But once this fertility thing starts like this,
uh,

718
00:47:57.850 --> 00:48:00.670
everybody does it.
These,
what they called,
these differentials,

719
00:48:00.671 --> 00:48:03.430
the socioeconomic differentials just disappear.

720
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:08.670
And a farmer is just as likely to be limiting his fertility as a bourgeois,

721
00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:12.070
uh,
person,
uh,
in,
in the cities.

722
00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:17.540
<v 1>And
so,
um,</v>

723
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:24.750
<v 0>if you try to think of how rapidly the economic situation change or how rapidly</v>

724
00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:30.460
does education increase,
and you look at all the various variables,
uh,

725
00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:33.730
none of them increased with this kind of repeated,
none of them change.

726
00:48:33.731 --> 00:48:37.150
Would that kind of a pillar,
infant mortality,
almost anything you can make it,

727
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:41.410
nothing goes with that kind of a rate.
So

728
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:46.820
<v 1>what,
um,
what goes with that kind of a rate,</v>

729
00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:55.040
a fad or fashion that,
um,

730
00:48:56.690 --> 00:49:01.160
let me try to find
this is this is the problem with my printer.

731
00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:08.750
Well,
I'm not going to be able to find it.
I know the data.

732
00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.860
<v 0>So if you look all around Europe and this was in,
in,
in your region,</v>

733
00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:17.730
what you see is the date of the beginning of the decade.

734
00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:22.760
This is the decade where that 10% level was reached and what,

735
00:49:23.820 --> 00:49:27.510
what provinces are this perfect.
This is all France.

736
00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:31.350
Then there's a long delay and surprisingly long delay and boom,

737
00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:35.930
all the rest of Europe then does it [inaudible] basically,
uh,

738
00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:41.420
most of it's done between 1870 and in 1930 it's almost all done.

739
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:44.910
So let's just sweep through Europe.
And again,
as I've showed you in the maps,

740
00:49:44.911 --> 00:49:48.600
that includes Russia,
eastern Europe,
economically and educationally,

741
00:49:48.601 --> 00:49:51.540
very underdeveloped,
uh,
kinds of places.

742
00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:56.010
And yet the fertility drops.
This is all of Europe.
Nobody,

743
00:49:56.220 --> 00:49:58.350
nobody is left out.
So again,

744
00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:03.440
it makes it difficult to put an economic or an educational,

745
00:50:03.781 --> 00:50:07.590
any of these other variables are on it.

746
00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:12.690
And
what you have instead is,

747
00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:16.680
and one,
one of these stories you read about in your reading,

748
00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:21.600
remember that each of these graduate students and postdocs was put on a

749
00:50:21.601 --> 00:50:26.040
different country of Europe and the Princeton project.
So one how to do England,

750
00:50:26.041 --> 00:50:27.560
one ha and we'll have the one who did,

751
00:50:27.561 --> 00:50:31.820
England is going to be guest lecture here next week,
next Thursday.
Um,

752
00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.700
he's not going to talk about that because you'll have had enough in that by
then.

753
00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.353
Um,

754
00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:41.550
and there's a guy who's assigned Spain is guys William leasure and uh,

755
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:45.200
this I think you read a little bit about and he,
uh,

756
00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.320
he gathered all this data,
huge amount of work,
you know,

757
00:50:48.321 --> 00:50:52.730
in all the Spanish archives of every province from going way back to 1830 or

758
00:50:52.731 --> 00:50:53.540
something and whatever,

759
00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:58.310
whatever it was there he looked at and he put it all together and he could not

760
00:50:58.311 --> 00:51:00.200
make any sense out of it whatsoever.

761
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:06.130
So this guy was going out of his mind and he took to drawing a map of fertility

762
00:51:06.261 --> 00:51:08.330
rates,
sort of like these,
those kinds of maps.

763
00:51:08.331 --> 00:51:13.200
I just showed you fertility rates at different points in time at the,

764
00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:15.450
in the different provinces of Spain.
And,

765
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:18.980
and he showed it to everybody and you apparently was walking around campus one

766
00:51:18.981 --> 00:51:23.910
day and he saw a professor of Spanish literature and who had met somewhere in

767
00:51:23.911 --> 00:51:26.990
here button hold the guy and showed him the track and said,

768
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:31.540
I can't make any sense out of this.
Told,
told the professor what it was for.

769
00:51:31.541 --> 00:51:36.200
As I said,
that's the linguistic regions of Spain.
And as you know,

770
00:51:36.201 --> 00:51:39.350
Spain has a,
had a variety of kingdoms.

771
00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:44.590
They were controlled by the Muslims and then the northern Christians kicked them

772
00:51:46.491 --> 00:51:47.324
out and,

773
00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:52.830
but there's Castiel and Navarro and Aragon and all of these cultural things and

774
00:51:53.271 --> 00:51:55.970
still the Basques consider them still quite separate.

775
00:51:55.971 --> 00:51:58.040
The Cadillac is consider themselves separate.

776
00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:02.690
So Spain to this day has a serious regional diversity's.

777
00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:08.140
And what apparently lecture had come up with unknowingly was a map of the

778
00:52:08.361 --> 00:52:12.410
linguistic boundaries of ancient Spain,
ancient medieval Spain.

779
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:15.590
And they still remained in.

780
00:52:15.591 --> 00:52:18.440
The idea that he came up with as well as it's fairly obvious,

781
00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:21.950
is that people that could speak the same language,
the same dialect,
river,

782
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:26.270
a common culture,
would talk to each other and that it was social spread.

783
00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:30.800
What kept the province a linguistic region,
uh,

784
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:34.970
uniform and it's fertility practices was the cultural spread that that was a

785
00:52:34.971 --> 00:52:37.520
cultural unit as well as the linguistic in it.

786
00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:40.070
And it didn't cross boundaries.

787
00:52:41.090 --> 00:52:44.720
Another more quantified example of that is Belgium.

788
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:48.500
And here is Belgium.
And you know,
Belgium,
they speak two languages,

789
00:52:48.501 --> 00:52:52.190
which are French and Flemish.

790
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:54.890
And Flemish is almost the same as Dutch,

791
00:52:54.891 --> 00:52:59.050
which is almost the same as German there.
So it's a big divide,
the dramatic,

792
00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:03.500
it's a dramatic romance language divide.
This is,
this is a big language divide.

793
00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:08.840
And in Belgium here,
the various provinces of Belgium,
and uh,

794
00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:12.200
these are the southern ones near Francis over here.

795
00:53:12.201 --> 00:53:16.490
So these are all French speaking and Holland is up there in Germany is over
here.

796
00:53:16.491 --> 00:53:20.210
These are the Flemish speaking of provinces.

797
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:25.880
And when you look at their fertility,
oops,

798
00:53:26.780 --> 00:53:29.070
<v 1>what is that?
Uh,</v>

799
00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:34.700
<v 0>what happens is that there's another slide I don't want to find,</v>

800
00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.553
which,

801
00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:38.593
<v 1>oh,
no,</v>

802
00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:40.790
<v 0>sorry.
This is messed up.</v>

803
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:45.250
<v 1>All right.
So,</v>

804
00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:50.540
<v 0>uh,
when you look at their fertility,
France as you've heard a hundred times,
uh,</v>

805
00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:54.840
starts to fertility transition,
fertility drops.
There it goes,

806
00:53:54.841 --> 00:53:57.810
it takes a fair amount of time,
but it goes first into French speaking,

807
00:53:57.811 --> 00:54:02.490
Belgium and France speaking Belgium then conforms to,
to the,
uh,

808
00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:04.410
to the French norm.

809
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:10.590
But then this is language line and you compare across that line and nothing,

810
00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:12.240
nothing north of the line changes.

811
00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:15.690
And it takes 60 years to cross that Lang,

812
00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:20.820
that language line that I showed you.
I don't know what's going on here.

813
00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:27.750
Stop this and getting to where I want to be.

814
00:54:32.170 --> 00:54:33.003
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

815
00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:36.290
<v 0>yeah.
No,
that isn't what I want.
Um,</v>

816
00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.880
so it takes 60 years to cross the,
the language barrier.

817
00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:43.930
So this guy less tig,
uh,
the guy who studied,

818
00:54:43.931 --> 00:54:48.340
who was assigned to do Belgium and he is Belgian has himself,
he said,
well,

819
00:54:48.341 --> 00:54:52.900
what could be causing it?
What are the
differences between North,
south on,

820
00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:54.730
aside from language?
When he was doing it,

821
00:54:54.731 --> 00:54:58.240
they didn't really come up with this when he was originally,
when he started,

822
00:54:58.270 --> 00:55:01.720
they didn't have understood this cultural difference and she was looking at

823
00:55:01.721 --> 00:55:06.160
socioeconomic variables.
And so he took villages across that,

824
00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:10.750
that boundary line there in who take no more than five kilometers difference and

825
00:55:10.751 --> 00:55:13.810
he would take villages that were matched.
The soil was kind of the same.

826
00:55:13.811 --> 00:55:15.910
The agricultural productivity was the same.

827
00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:20.290
And every kind of socioeconomic variable that he could find was not different

828
00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:22.820
across that line.
Uh,

829
00:55:23.050 --> 00:55:27.130
except fertility that the northern line,
uh,

830
00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:31.480
just had an awful lot more children than south of the line.
French speaking,

831
00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:34.300
Flemish speaking,
and presuming the,

832
00:55:34.301 --> 00:55:37.960
eliminating all of these socioeconomic variables by comparing these neighboring

833
00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:41.560
towns all across from Belgium,
from east to west,

834
00:55:41.561 --> 00:55:45.790
all across this line he looked at,
at,
at these kind of paired villages.

835
00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:51.670
Well,
they said what,
what was doing it?
Well,
there's,

836
00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:57.120
so they started thinking about cultural reasons and at that time in Europe there

837
00:55:57.581 --> 00:56:01.870
were two through,
uh,
democracy was still fairly real.

838
00:56:01.871 --> 00:56:05.410
Democracy was still fairly young,
but most everybody had the vote.

839
00:56:05.890 --> 00:56:09.910
And there was a lot of discussion about who would control democracy,

840
00:56:09.911 --> 00:56:12.460
whether democracy is good or bad thing.
So the suffrage,

841
00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:16.720
the expanded kind of suffrage,
they still had kings and all that,

842
00:56:16.721 --> 00:56:19.330
but the power was being eroded by parliaments.

843
00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:24.430
And there were two sets of parties as really still are in Europe.

844
00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:29.560
One was the Catholic party,
the Conservative Party called,
uh,

845
00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:33.080
and the other was the Socialist Party.

846
00:56:33.081 --> 00:56:35.980
So the Communist parties and anybody know,

847
00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:38.180
so like Europe Union,

848
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:44.080
what they called the Social Democrats and in a variety of names,
other parties,

849
00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:44.771
the Christian Demo,

850
00:56:44.771 --> 00:56:48.370
there's really the parties that are still named Christian Democrats and Social

851
00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:52.580
Democrats.
Like in Germany,
they pass their tests,
the,
the,
the,
the,
um,

852
00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:57.250
the premiere ship back and forth between them that was established at this time

853
00:56:57.670 --> 00:57:01.870
and it was considered a fairly good marker for what we call secularization,

854
00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:07.590
that how much a person was still believing in the old morality of the old style

855
00:57:08.381 --> 00:57:13.330
things was,
was religious.
They would usually vote for the Christian Democrats,

856
00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:16.210
people that had undergone some sort of a transition.

857
00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:20.950
And now we're buying socialists theory or worker solidarity theory or believed

858
00:57:20.951 --> 00:57:23.950
in unions would vote,
uh,
the,
the,

859
00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:29.020
the Democratic Socialist Party.
And what he did,
he said,

860
00:57:29.021 --> 00:57:33.770
okay,
let's look at each of the provinces again.
And then this,

861
00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:35.140
this is our own,
these mall,

862
00:57:35.141 --> 00:57:39.280
which was smaller grouping then province and see what their vote is.

863
00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:44.520
So here's the Catholic part and this is the percentage of non Catholic party.

864
00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:49.930
And then he just compared this with how much their fertility had declined again,

865
00:57:49.931 --> 00:57:51.700
always within,
within marriage.

866
00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:56.230
And it turns out the more non-catholic cause they are,

867
00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:01.510
the greater the decline in fertility.
It's kind of a,
uh,
a backwards thing.

868
00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:05.350
So,
and very nice line of proportionality.

869
00:58:05.351 --> 00:58:08.470
This is an exact proportionality in the points stick,

870
00:58:08.471 --> 00:58:12.670
really very close to that line.
It's not hard to see what that line is.

871
00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:14.140
And so people,

872
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:19.060
what became clear is that culturally people that were voting for the Catholic

873
00:58:19.060 --> 00:58:22.810
party,
and therefore we're in the older mode of culture,
uh,

874
00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:28.030
did not drop their fertility very much.
People who were voting,

875
00:58:28.060 --> 00:58:31.390
the socialists of the left wing liberal,
whatever you want to call it,

876
00:58:31.391 --> 00:58:35.350
way had dropped their fertility by 60 to 80%.

877
00:58:35.351 --> 00:58:38.530
Huge drought in fertility.
So,

878
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:40.583
<v 1>oh,</v>

879
00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:48.500
<v 0>all right.
Um,
and these kinds of data kept coming.</v>

880
00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:52.060
<v 1>Oh,
the</v>

881
00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.490
to conclude the,
um,

882
00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:02.960
<v 0>the bottom line is that in this Princeton project,</v>

883
00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:08.420
they just could not tie fertility,

884
00:59:08.421 --> 00:59:13.100
changed any of the standard socioeconomic variables.
Now the word socioeconomic,

885
00:59:13.101 --> 00:59:17.900
I think it's a terrible word.
I mean,
what does not either socio or economic?
So,

886
00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:18.201
you know,

887
00:59:18.201 --> 00:59:22.040
I always go around and ask people descriptions of it and I think it basically,

888
00:59:22.041 --> 00:59:27.041
anything you can quantify and you get interesting variables like education,

889
00:59:27.441 --> 00:59:30.380
and we'll see this sort of disastrously for understand the situation.

890
00:59:30.381 --> 00:59:31.640
When you come into the third world,

891
00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:36.770
education suits you for a better job,
especially women.

892
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:38.210
So when people get educated,

893
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:40.880
it's an economic variable because suits you for better job,

894
00:59:40.881 --> 00:59:41.601
you can get higher pay.

895
00:59:41.601 --> 00:59:45.470
It makes it more worth your while to go out and work other than stay home and

896
00:59:45.471 --> 00:59:46.304
have children.

897
00:59:46.670 --> 00:59:50.750
But Education also gives you a window on the world and makes a worldly person

898
00:59:50.751 --> 00:59:51.950
open to new ideas,

899
00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:55.960
a greater sense of agency that you can talk back to your husband or your mother

900
00:59:55.961 --> 00:59:59.480
in law or Sofa.
So a lot of the variables,
you can't decide,

901
00:59:59.481 --> 01:00:01.760
is this an economic variable or a social variable?

902
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:07.210
So it's kind of very unfortunate that they use this term socioeconomic variable,

903
01:00:07.581 --> 01:00:10.880
but I think it was an early stage and understanding the problem and they,

904
01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:15.520
they didn't know what to do about it.
Also,
uh,

905
01:00:15.521 --> 01:00:16.161
another problem,

906
01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:19.040
it's always in the social sciences when you're trying to do these studies,

907
01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:22.760
getting the data itself is really very difficult.

908
01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:27.260
And so since Europe has organized politically into provinces,

909
01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:31.580
that's where the data was gathered.
And they had province level things.

910
01:00:31.581 --> 01:00:34.820
They didn't have individual village,
uh,
level information.

911
01:00:34.821 --> 01:00:37.850
They didn't have individual family kind of information.

912
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:42.800
When you do an aggregation,
even as finally as they could do,
I mean,

913
01:00:42.801 --> 01:00:47.710
it's amazing to do every province in Europe.
So that was for the,
that period of,

914
01:00:47.711 --> 01:00:50.750
of social science.
That was the low level of aggregation,

915
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:54.110
but still within each province.
Uh,

916
01:00:54.770 --> 01:00:59.060
you have a huge range of people in very different circumstances and maybe you're

917
01:00:59.061 --> 01:01:03.410
missing a lot by this aggregation.
So aggregation is a problem.

918
01:01:04.550 --> 01:01:06.500
And since this period,
uh,

919
01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:11.420
a lot of social science scholars have come back and argued tremendously over

920
01:01:11.421 --> 01:01:16.370
this and say,
no,
they really are economic reasons for the fertility decline.

921
01:01:16.371 --> 01:01:19.370
And we'll talk about those in a later lecture.

922
01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.330
I just want to summarize what we've,

923
01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.770
we spent a lot of time on this demographic transition and it's theory and a lot

924
01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:31.580
of reading and every year the students say,
Oh,
I hated that part of the course.

925
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:35.330
But it is in a sense for the modern times,

926
01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:37.940
it's the most important part of the course because everything else that you in

927
01:01:37.941 --> 01:01:40.230
every understanding of the,

928
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:44.080
of what's happening now in developing countries is based on this stuff and

929
01:01:44.081 --> 01:01:47.450
either agrees with it or disagrees with it or uses the same methodology,

930
01:01:47.451 --> 01:01:49.970
are very self consciously tries to use a different methodology.

931
01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:52.100
This is the foundation of the field.

932
01:01:52.101 --> 01:01:56.270
So that's one reason you should know about it.
The other is,

933
01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:00.410
it's such a tremendous,
uh,
change.
It may be.
To my mind,

934
01:02:00.411 --> 01:02:03.770
it's the most important revolution ever in human history.
Look,

935
01:02:03.771 --> 01:02:05.390
look what happens throughout this period.

936
01:02:06.050 --> 01:02:09.640
Life people get to live three times as long,
right?

937
01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:14.580
Imagine if you're at 20.
How many of you are under 20?
Okay.
Half of you,

938
01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:18.980
you'd be dead,
right?
Half of this class would be dead if we weren't,

939
01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:23.120
if we hadn't gone through,
uh,
this,
this transition of modernization,

940
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:26.640
he's happy about that.
The numbers of human beings,

941
01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:30.300
the number of people that we now are able to keep alive as a fee is 10 times

942
01:02:30.301 --> 01:02:32.040
larger.
Everyday it gets bigger.

943
01:02:32.041 --> 01:02:35.850
But the last time I can't get 10 times larger than what we think the population

944
01:02:35.851 --> 01:02:38.610
was back then.
So an enormous,

945
01:02:39.090 --> 01:02:41.310
even though it's the introduction of contraception,

946
01:02:41.311 --> 01:02:45.870
which limits the amount of people or tries to limit the amount of people,

947
01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:49.860
in fact,
the number of people on earth has just expanded enormously,

948
01:02:49.861 --> 01:02:54.861
both in numbers and in how long each one lives wealth individual per capita

949
01:02:55.861 --> 01:02:56.190
wealth.

950
01:02:56.190 --> 01:03:01.190
We saw that the industrial revolution by itself got into Malthusian problems and

951
01:03:01.561 --> 01:03:04.000
didn't,
at least up until the,
the,

952
01:03:04.001 --> 01:03:08.920
the fertility transition did not improve people's individual wealth.
Uh,

953
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.180
that required the combination of industrial revolution,

954
01:03:12.181 --> 01:03:15.510
which increased production and fertility control,

955
01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:19.680
which put a limit on the number of people trying to get advantage from that

956
01:03:19.681 --> 01:03:20.970
increased production.

957
01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:24.900
We've seen a tremendous democratization of marriage.

958
01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:29.670
Imagine a society where 30% of only 70% of the people who are unmarried,

959
01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:30.301
you know,

960
01:03:30.301 --> 01:03:33.720
we sort of talk a lot about marriage and how marriage is going way as an

961
01:03:33.721 --> 01:03:38.040
institution.
We are way,
way ahead of that.
China is way,
way ahead of that.

962
01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:41.010
And so imagine I was that,
you know,

963
01:03:41.011 --> 01:03:45.750
very few of you would have prospects of ever getting married because society

964
01:03:45.751 --> 01:03:48.750
just didn't allow it.
And the same for sex as a,
as I've mentioned,

965
01:03:48.751 --> 01:03:51.060
that democratization of sex,

966
01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:55.830
your fertility coming under your individual control.
What a big change,
you know,

967
01:03:56.050 --> 01:03:59.790
uh,
in life that you announced one of the big decisions you can make,
you know,

968
01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:03.450
do I want some children,
many children,
fewer children,
whatever.

969
01:04:03.451 --> 01:04:04.350
When do I want them?

970
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:08.760
All this comes under control within marriage.

971
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:13.290
Previously couples who are constantly under the pressure of constant

972
01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:17.370
childbearing that the wife was always either pregnant or lactating.
Later,

973
01:04:17.371 --> 01:04:21.090
I'll show you some statistics from the third world that women are almost never

974
01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:21.810
free.

975
01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:26.810
They're always either pregnant or lactating until they die and men had to go

976
01:04:28.201 --> 01:04:31.800
out.
And this is a period when men was,
men were basically the breadwinners.

977
01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:32.620
They had a support,

978
01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:37.350
an ever increasing number of children under difficult economic circumstances.

979
01:04:37.650 --> 01:04:41.910
So men and women were freed from,
from the requirement.
They had no choice.

980
01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:45.180
The requirement of supporting,
taken care of and supporting these,

981
01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.640
these large families.
There's,

982
01:04:48.641 --> 01:04:51.990
there's so many issues that change during this time.
If you,

983
01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:55.420
if any of you are thinking of doing term papers,
uh,

984
01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:59.460
you just infinite number of things that have not even been looked at.

985
01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:04.290
So for instance,
we talked a lot about an abandonment of children,
infanticide.

986
01:05:05.130 --> 01:05:09.810
When do you think that disappeared?
Something in about this time,

987
01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:10.681
you know,

988
01:05:10.681 --> 01:05:14.130
you read about it into the 18 hundreds it was a lot of it and then it goes away.

989
01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:18.400
There's a lot written about the period when it was heavy and much understanding

990
01:05:18.401 --> 01:05:22.060
of why did infanticide disappear?
What does it do to this?

991
01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:25.900
I don't know the answer.
I don't think it has been discovered.
Uh,
does,
uh,

992
01:05:26.330 --> 01:05:28.210
investigate great term paper.

993
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:33.190
What about the romantic conception of marriage?
Marriage changes like this,

994
01:05:33.191 --> 01:05:36.760
it becomes less of an economic thing,
less of a child bearing thing.

995
01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:40.440
You don't need your wife to work,
especially on the farm.
Uh,

996
01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.610
what is the tie in between romantic conceptions that we all now have about

997
01:05:45.611 --> 01:05:49.930
marriage and love and all that and this whole demographic transition.

998
01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:53.800
So in,
in almost every way you can think of modern culture,

999
01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.350
this is that at the root of it,

1000
01:05:56.440 --> 01:06:01.440
that this is a thing that you always have to consider as whatever you believe.

1001
01:06:01.961 --> 01:06:03.310
However you're leading your life.

1002
01:06:03.311 --> 01:06:07.060
How much of it is due to these pioneers that we've talked about that started

1003
01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:10.720
controlling their fertility as an individual decision rather than as a,

1004
01:06:10.721 --> 01:06:14.290
as a community decision?
Okay.
So there's no,

1005
01:06:14.350 --> 01:06:16.590
no reading for today and,
uh,

1006
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:18.550
because the lectures are now caught up with the reading.

1007
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:21.520
So next week we'll talk on Tuesday,

1008
01:06:21.521 --> 01:06:23.350
and then on Thursday we have a guest lecturer.

1009
01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.600
The schedule changed from what you have.
