1
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.180
Oh,
how many of you saw the New York Times yesterday morning?

2
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:06.643
<v 1>What'd you say?</v>

3
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.800
<v 0>Yes.
So the front and center,
uh,
a story</v>

4
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.820
<v 1>and the times is good.</v>

5
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.860
Get My,
uh,
my pointer.

6
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.560
<v 0>So,
uh,
this is a girl.
So in Afghanistan,</v>

7
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.840
one of the ways of suppressing women is to keep them from getting any education.

8
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.300
And so with these girls go to school because you'll learn a lot about that in

9
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:04.880
the course of why they want to go to school wide.

10
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:06.480
Their parents want them to go to school.

11
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.180
So they go to school and three guys came up on a motorcycle.
Um,

12
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.290
they don't have a motorcycle motor scooter and they just asked the girls how

13
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:18.660
you're going to school.
They're walking to school in the morning.

14
00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.800
And the girl said,
yes,
threw acid in their faces.

15
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.280
And this story is about that kind of thing happening right now in Afghanistan.

16
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.360
Uh,
when this happened,
the girl,

17
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:36.390
everybody was of course very scared,
but the parents,

18
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:40.800
one set of parents that were quoted here said,
you must go to school.

19
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.090
Even if you're killed,

20
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.070
they're going to school is more important than their lives in these communities.

21
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:50.620
And you'll understand a lot later why.

22
00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.130
Okay.
Now one other notable thing happened,
so that's quite amazing.

23
00:01:56.131 --> 00:02:00.120
I talk about it on Tuesday and Wednesday morning up comes a the New York Times

24
00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:03.780
story.
This happens every year.
I think there's a spy in the class.

25
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.180
So,
uh,
the next thing is a student said,
oh,
she loved the lecture,

26
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.180
but what did she love about it?
She loved the Dung Beetles.

27
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.050
And so she sent me her own personal picture of Dung Beetles

28
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.830
and uh,
she lacks a little bit poetic about them.
Um,

29
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.360
I have to let you know that Dung beetles are among my favorite animals.

30
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.520
The best part is watching the males agonize over rolling the ball over to the

31
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:35.790
whole while the female rides relaxed,

32
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.780
just planting her eggs inside it.
The ultimate feminism,

33
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:41.940
if you ask me now,

34
00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:45.060
the student wants to remain anonymous so that you all don't think that she's a

35
00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:45.960
little kinky.
Maybe

36
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.170
that's nothing wrong with that.
This is,

37
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.080
this is where very liberal minded here in this class.
Now,

38
00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.990
how many of you were not here last time?
Oh,
a few of you.

39
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:06.070
So I should give a very short summary of what went on last time.

40
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.480
Uh,

41
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.480
I was describing the basic biology of how the social organization of the species

42
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.320
is organized around their sex and reproductive function.

43
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.750
And for virtually all species of higher than,

44
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:27.130
than single cell organisms,
the female puts a lot of,
uh,

45
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.120
makes big eggs,
a lot of investment.
She doesn't make that many eggs.

46
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:34.960
They're rare and expensive.
The male sperm is very tiny.

47
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.880
He can make a huge amount of them.

48
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.920
And so they are plentiful and very cheap.
Um,

49
00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.830
males then given the excess of sperm that males can inseminate many females,

50
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.870
the males then must compete for the females.
And they have two mechanisms,

51
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.760
either sperm competition where there's the sexual system is polygamous,

52
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.850
uh,
promiscuous.
And many males will mate with the same female,

53
00:04:04.851 --> 00:04:06.880
the same female will mate with many males,

54
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.480
and then the sperms themselves will compete by a whole variety of mechanisms to

55
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:17.050
see which sperm will fertilize the egg.

56
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.460
Uh,

57
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:23.460
the other US mail strategy is to physically fight with other males to gain

58
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.910
control of the female or to compete in some other way,

59
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.600
like displaying your,
the peacock with this enormous tail displaying.

60
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:35.570
I've got a more beautiful tail than you do.
Or we talked about,
uh,

61
00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.700
birds dancing.
The males dance for a long time and display their,

62
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.300
their mental ability to dance coordinated Lee and their beauty and stamina to

63
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:47.770
the females.
Then the females choose.

64
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.490
The females also have two strategies.
I mean,

65
00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.170
obviously this is a great simplification.
The females also have two strategies.

66
00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.830
One is to get resources from the mail as in the Dung Beetle.
There's the,

67
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.840
the,
the Dung balls are full of nitrogen,

68
00:05:04.841 --> 00:05:09.580
which is a very rare,
uh,
and uh,

69
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.120
so they,

70
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.050
they feed this to the female and female then can produce more eggs in it,

71
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.350
which is evolutionary leap.

72
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.350
Very good for both the male and the female or the female wants,

73
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.590
uh,
to choose the male with the best genes.

74
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.270
And so in some way the males have to display what are the best jeans in best

75
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:32.260
just means those that are successful reproductively sometimes bigger is better,

76
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:35.950
sometimes smaller is better.
Sometimes fast it's better.
Sometimes slow is better.

77
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.030
Better does not mean anything.
And fitness,
the word fitness,

78
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:43.540
which you've heard does not mean anything other than leads,
more offspring.

79
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:45.730
It can be any kind of phenotype.

80
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:50.290
You can imagine any kind of body type and he kind of ability or the opposite in

81
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:54.580
some ecological situations being fat as good.

82
00:05:54.581 --> 00:05:59.540
And other times being skinny,
uh,
it's good.
So,
uh,

83
00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.870
the females either watch the males display,

84
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.080
watch the peacock's tail or observe the end of fighting between the males.

85
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:09.560
That one male becomes dominant,

86
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.610
then the female is happy to copulate with that male.

87
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.830
When males fight,
no,

88
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.760
the males tend to get large cause that helps them in the fight.

89
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.480
Evolution makes them larger and they'd get larger than the females.

90
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.950
And once they're larger than the females,
they can start coercing the females.

91
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.370
And that's really the origin of the biological origin of a lot of male female

92
00:06:33.531 --> 00:06:37.490
violence that males can either to gain access to female,

93
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:39.290
they can either fight with other males,

94
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.520
which can be very difficult and you're liable to get damaged or killed or just

95
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:46.460
coerce a female who's smaller and less strong.

96
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.850
And so you get mail coercion of females

97
00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.200
and in primates,

98
00:06:54.201 --> 00:06:57.650
the last sort of in primates and the great apes,

99
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.590
we are all great apes in particular.

100
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:06.070
This tendency toward male violence onto females is carried to,

101
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.020
uh,
is his most prominent.

102
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:13.490
And the reason is we invest enormously in our young,

103
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.660
we spend very long time with the young taking care of them.

104
00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.010
And therefore the females who do most of the investment can't have very many

105
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:26.960
young,
they can't have them very rapidly.
And in the great apes,
aside from humans,

106
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:31.610
which we'll talk about next time,
as an exception,
it takes five to 10 years.

107
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:34.730
The females don't have a second.
They have a,
a child,
a baby,

108
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.740
then they wait five to 10 years before having a baby again.

109
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:44.390
So eggs are very difficult to come by.
In a,
in a group of chimps,

110
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:49.310
maybe one egg a year is available for fertilization and the males compete like

111
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:51.140
crazy by every possible mechanism,

112
00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:55.640
including a lot of violence to get access to that single,
uh,
egg.

113
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.030
Uh,
okay.

114
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:04.390
So one anecdote about the relationship of sociality in sexuality has to do with,

115
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:07.730
uh,

116
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:12.730
orangutans who are the most distantly related of the great apes from us.

117
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.740
They are just,
they're very clever,

118
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:20.460
like all the great apes and they use all kinds of ways of being,
uh,

119
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.330
attractive to a male and vice versa.

120
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.990
And one of the ways they use like reduce intellectual brilliance.

121
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.520
I think Yale students are involved,
especially to use intellectual brilliance to

122
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.640
be attracted.
My college girlfriend,

123
00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.020
I feel guessing love with her because she could do the Latin and I couldn't,

124
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:43.130
I was hopeless.
She was just stunned at how well,
how good,
how well she could,

125
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.740
she did it.
Anyway.
Um,
in,
uh,
1978,

126
00:08:47.741 --> 00:08:52.490
a graduate student from Stanford,
uh,
went to the orangutan research station,

127
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:55.710
Borneo and his job was language.
They are,
you know,

128
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.850
lots of people want to show how close or how different great apes are from

129
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:02.790
humans.
So language is a special human ability,

130
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.210
but the great apes have a certain degree of it.

131
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:07.860
And he wanted to find out how much.

132
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:11.670
So he taught an adult female named Rennie sign language.

133
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.300
And uh,
the guy's name was Gary Shapiro.

134
00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:18.600
Renny was his mate in turns out she was a brilliant student.

135
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.800
She really should have been at Yale,

136
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.200
but she was stuck in Borneo and didn't have the money to come here.
Um,
and she,

137
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:29.700
Gary just could not believe how fast Reney learned the language.

138
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.410
And so he was just glowing and he loved Rennie and his research project,

139
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:36.010
he was going to get famous.
You know,

140
00:09:36.011 --> 00:09:39.330
he's probably being able to teach more language than anyone else has ever taught

141
00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:41.070
to,
to,
to an ape.

142
00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:45.270
But Rennie took all this attention quite personally.

143
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.150
She thought there was something going on,
but between the two of them,

144
00:09:48.151 --> 00:09:52.260
it wasn't all intellectual,
but she waited for Gary and nothing happened.

145
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.020
So one day she took the,
uh,
the,

146
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:58.900
the dominant role as I've heard Yale girls sometimes do,

147
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.360
and she took Gary by the hand and did the obvious things,
uh,

148
00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:08.730
to try to seduce him.
And so there's Gary,
what is he going to do?
Well,

149
00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:13.430
he wasn't very up for this,
uh,
like many Yale guys that I've heard of.

150
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:21.390
And so Gary just pushed her away,
not thinking an awful lot about it,

151
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.010
but being a scientist,

152
00:10:23.011 --> 00:10:26.880
he hadn't read his literature and he does not know that there is no law,

153
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:29.580
no wrath,
like the wrath of a woman scorned.

154
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.260
So thereafter,
she lost all interest in signing,

155
00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:38.880
would not cooperate in the lessons,
ruined his phd thesis project.

156
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:45.030
So let that be a warning guy.
Okay.

157
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:48.310
So we've,
we talked,
uh,
about,
um,

158
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.780
uh,
we talked last time about Aurangzeb of the great apes,

159
00:10:54.781 --> 00:10:58.290
those five species,
including us.
We talked about the,
uh,
the,

160
00:10:58.291 --> 00:11:00.290
the rape that orangs do.
Uh,

161
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:05.300
we talked about the infanticide that gorillas do and now we come to chimpanzees

162
00:11:05.641 --> 00:11:09.330
who have yet another system.
Uh,
again,

163
00:11:09.331 --> 00:11:12.750
always coping with this idea of the rarity of female eggs.

164
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:18.270
Unlike the orangutan in the gorilla at the males are not solitary.
The standard,

165
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:23.100
the most common.
There is no standard now millions of species.

166
00:11:23.101 --> 00:11:24.210
And they do millions of different things.

167
00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.050
Most Standard Mammal thing is for the males in some way to fight with each other

168
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.780
and they push other males away.
And uh,

169
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.090
one male gets one or several females.
There are,
there are exceptions to this,

170
00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:40.610
but that's the most common sort of way chimp and,
uh,

171
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:43.400
chimpanzees don't do this.
Uh,

172
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:48.680
they live in a group of males and in fact the males that are born into a,

173
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.940
into a group stay with the group.

174
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:56.150
So this is a male group that has been staying together for as far back as,

175
00:11:56.181 --> 00:12:00.550
as one can tell.
Male Spacely never transfer groups.
They never leave a group.

176
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.980
Uh,
so these are basically a,
a long line one,

177
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:10.190
one family set of males,
uh,

178
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.470
within that community.
Uh,
let's see,

179
00:12:14.471 --> 00:12:18.100
I think I have some slides.
Ah,
that's,

180
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:22.300
that's a picture of the Orang that fell in love with the Grad student.

181
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:27.190
Now we'll come to Jane Goodall in a,
in a minute.

182
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:31.390
Um,
given that there are males together,

183
00:12:31.391 --> 00:12:33.850
what they do then is compete for dominance.

184
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:38.880
And a lot of that is physical fighting and their dominance position gives them

185
00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:41.050
access to food and to females.

186
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.700
So when a chimp wants to move up in the dominance hierarchy,
uh,

187
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.600
may go through a long period where they're sort of jockeying and various ways,

188
00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:54.400
and I'll describe some of the jockeying going on.
Uh,
largely big displays,

189
00:12:54.401 --> 00:12:58.300
beating the chest,
uh,
if there's anything around shaking branches,

190
00:12:58.301 --> 00:13:02.060
stomping on the ground,
uh,
hollering,
uh,

191
00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.870
but they don't fight.
But eventually,

192
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.890
if in fact a reversal of dominance position is going to take place,

193
00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.960
a real fight almost always does occur.
Not always successfully.

194
00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:18.310
Jane Goodall describes one of these Sherry and they give names to each of the

195
00:13:18.311 --> 00:13:20.590
chimps.
Sherry,
a younger male,

196
00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:24.580
was moving up in the hierarchy and aggressive young male,
you know,
some of those,

197
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.600
he had beat out some of the lower ranking young males,

198
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.200
but the next one on his list was named Satan.
You can tell from the name,

199
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:35.860
this was not a wise move.
Satan was not the Alpha male,

200
00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:40.390
but was higher than Sherry.
They had a huge fight when it was over.

201
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:45.280
Sherry was bleeding from bad wounds on his shoulder,
both hands his back,

202
00:13:45.281 --> 00:13:49.690
his head,
and one leg.
Sherri escaped and ran away screaming loudly.

203
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.340
This was apparently such a bad,
uh,

204
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:58.300
experience that Sherry never again attempted to dominate any other male.

205
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:02.170
He had been whipped and he learned whatever his instincts may or may not have

206
00:14:02.171 --> 00:14:07.060
been about aggression.
He learned that's not his game.
He never tried this again.

207
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:13.110
So they do a lot of threats and displays as a prior to these fights.

208
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.620
But if there's going to be a real reversal,
uh,

209
00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.910
there's usually a fight and the fights can get very severe in the wild.

210
00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:25.810
The loser just runs away and they don't carry the fight to the death.

211
00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.340
And by the end of the lecture,

212
00:14:27.341 --> 00:14:31.210
you should understand why they don't want to kill each other.
But in a zoo,

213
00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:36.340
when the,
when the chimps are in captivity,
uh,
the males can escape.

214
00:14:36.341 --> 00:14:41.341
And then that proximity leads to a prolongation of the violence and sometimes,

215
00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.470
uh,
to death.
Um,

216
00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.170
France Deval who you'll do some reading from him.

217
00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:51.890
He describes one fight where the loser had an ear gone,
uh,

218
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:56.300
uh,
the other ear torn his hands and feet badly,

219
00:14:56.301 --> 00:15:01.301
mauled with several bones exposed and some fingers and toes missing a Gash,

220
00:15:01.521 --> 00:15:04.430
stretched one shoulder to the opposite hip.

221
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.480
And a two toes were missing.
And this guy was really beat up.

222
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:13.730
And so they took him to a human type hospital and try to fix them up.

223
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.900
Didn't work.
He died.
So in,
within a group,
uh,

224
00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:21.620
the fights basically never end in death.
In captivity,

225
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.160
they do end to end in death.
That's within group fighting.

226
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.720
So this finding your place in the dominance hierarchy is a very serious

227
00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:32.960
business.
Uh,

228
00:15:32.961 --> 00:15:37.820
you can either win and go up or you can lose and stay either.
Dot,
you know,

229
00:15:37.821 --> 00:15:42.650
and get very badly physically damaged or Steve or be relegated to a low place.

230
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:46.790
Humans called dominance,
hierarchy status.
And when you,
when I,

231
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.540
when I used dominance,
think status,
we don't always use the word here,

232
00:15:50.541 --> 00:15:54.530
but I think one of the things if you want to compare chimps and humans,

233
00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.400
think of the various things that humans do,
uh,
for status.

234
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:05.410
So chimps live in groups of about 40 individuals with a dozen or so adult males,

235
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:08.060
approximately the same number of females.

236
00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.850
And as with orangutans that I described to you,
the female,
they have a big range,

237
00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:17.420
15 square kilometers,
40 square kilometers,
something like that.

238
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.430
And they wonder about this.

239
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.930
The females when they have a young are usually fairly isolated.
Not,

240
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.640
not necessarily,
not all the time,

241
00:16:25.641 --> 00:16:28.280
but mostly they're by themselves with their young,

242
00:16:28.281 --> 00:16:32.240
it's a very stable group that always stays together.
Uh,
as,

243
00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:36.610
as I told you last time,
the mother is never out of either touch or,
or,

244
00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.630
or sight or hearing of their young for five or more,
five to 10 years.

245
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:47.210
Uh,
the males on the other hand wander round also,
but they bond together.

246
00:16:47.211 --> 00:16:52.211
They traveled together and they are very often in parties and they go around

247
00:16:52.551 --> 00:16:56.360
certain searching for food and patrolling the borders of the territory.

248
00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:00.640
They also of course visit the females,
go around see which females,

249
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:02.570
what the sexual status of females is.

250
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.830
And I showed you a slide last time of a male smelling of female sexual

251
00:17:06.831 --> 00:17:10.100
secretions to figure out what status she's in.

252
00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:12.683
<v 1>Ah,</v>

253
00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:16.390
<v 0>this looks like something that I have already talked about here tonight.</v>

254
00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.260
There's this repeating.

255
00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.390
<v 1>Uh,
all right,</v>

256
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.553
let's see.

257
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:34.790
<v 0>So,
um,
yeah,
I don't remember what I,</v>

258
00:17:34.940 --> 00:17:36.860
whether I did this.
Um,

259
00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:42.230
the females are usually quite promiscuous with their sex partners in the

260
00:17:42.231 --> 00:17:46.430
community fall followed by Jane Goodall in each estrous cycle.

261
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:51.730
Each female had at least set at least one bout of intercourse with every male in

262
00:17:51.841 --> 00:17:56.730
the group.
And I did.
Then I,
I did do this yesterday.
I forgot this,

263
00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.930
I dunno how this happens.
Um,

264
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.390
the mail,
how do the males,
uh,
do their,

265
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.320
operate in their dominance hierarchy?
Um,

266
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:15.450
it's not all violence.
Uh,
one aspect is violence,

267
00:18:15.451 --> 00:18:17.430
but they also make friends with other males.

268
00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:22.980
Single males cannot be successful.
It's a very,
very social situation.

269
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.700
These animals are very clever.
They know each other individually.

270
00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.390
They know each other,
propensities,
which ones are dominant,
which ones are not,

271
00:18:30.391 --> 00:18:33.420
which ones are smart,
which ones are not,
which ones they can fool,

272
00:18:33.421 --> 00:18:38.280
which ones they can't fool and so on.
So they do a lot of social manipulation,

273
00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:42.750
uh,
to try to get allies in their dominance fights.

274
00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:46.410
Um,
these friendly relations,

275
00:18:46.411 --> 00:18:49.230
you mostly see it as a grooming thing.

276
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.650
Males and females spent a lot of time with each other.

277
00:18:52.651 --> 00:18:57.450
Grooming and what is grooming?
Uh,
uh,
uh,

278
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.440
chimps like all kinds of other animals that are infested with parasites,

279
00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:04.260
which can carry diseases and be very dangerous so they have to get rid of them.

280
00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:09.360
So one chimp will sit there and the other chimp will combine and spread the for

281
00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.730
very carefully.
And then if there's an insect,

282
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.780
it's good for the person from whom they take the insect.

283
00:19:15.781 --> 00:19:20.100
Cause that insect is no longer can parasitize them and it's good for them.

284
00:19:20.101 --> 00:19:23.340
They get a little bit of protein.
They spent hours and hours doing this,

285
00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.700
males to males,
males and females with each other.
And females to females.

286
00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:28.230
Everybody does it with everyone else.

287
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.400
And one of the things that the observers do is count how much time each

288
00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:34.680
individual spends grooming the other.
The,

289
00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:38.700
the person who's the person in the chimp who's being groomed has this wonderful

290
00:19:38.701 --> 00:19:42.720
expression on their face.
They're clearly enjoying this.
It's like a nice massage.

291
00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:45.053
Um,

292
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.620
so,
um,

293
00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:56.620
the purpose of this friendliness or one of the purposes is to help the males

294
00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.290
when they engage in dominance fights.

295
00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.680
So Jane Goodall describes one of these Goliath,
one of the,

296
00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:08.780
one of the males that we'll talk about later.
So he,
late one evening,

297
00:20:08.781 --> 00:20:13.781
he arrives in camp all by himself and he seems a little on edge every so often

298
00:20:14.571 --> 00:20:17.990
he stands upright and stares back at the direction and from which he had come,

299
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.980
he seems nervous and startles that ev every sound,

300
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:27.350
six minutes later,
three adult males appear on one of the trails.

301
00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:32.510
And one is the high ranking.
Whew.
They pause,
they see him,

302
00:20:32.511 --> 00:20:35.030
they,
they pause the hair on end.

303
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.970
Then abruptly they charged down toward Goliath.

304
00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:42.050
But he in the time that they were sort of waiting,

305
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.980
he then has disappeared quietly into the forest.

306
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:50.900
And the next five minutes,
these three big guys thrash around the anniversary,

307
00:20:50.901 --> 00:20:54.430
they're looking for him,
but he has successfully escaped.
He's afraid,

308
00:20:54.431 --> 00:20:58.870
obviously one guy,
one against three,
he's afraid.
The next morning,

309
00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.460
Hugh,
uh,
returns to camp with,
with two companions.

310
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:08.770
Uh,
a few minutes later,
Goliath charge Goliath,
the one that had run away before,

311
00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:13.930
uh,
charges down dragging a huge branch.
That's one of their display,

312
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:15.040
the kinds of things.

313
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:20.460
And then he runs straight as he would attack some guy that ran away last time,

314
00:21:20.771 --> 00:21:24.340
one against three is still one against three,
but now he's,
he's the attacker.

315
00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:29.680
A very strange and it's not until the battle is already in progress where,

316
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.633
uh,

317
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:35.830
where they're grappling and hitting each other that it become obvious why he has

318
00:21:35.831 --> 00:21:39.510
done that.
Because suddenly,
uh,

319
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:45.880
there's,
there's uh,
the dominant male,
one of the very,
not the Alpha,

320
00:21:45.881 --> 00:21:49.930
one of the strong dominoes is a very big one called David Gray beard.

321
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.750
And while this fight has just begun,

322
00:21:52.751 --> 00:21:56.800
David Greybeard appears me undergrowth and he gives a beat display and Ooh,

323
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.330
it gives a cup some pantsuits and uh,

324
00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:05.680
he's clearly on a gala,
a huge side.

325
00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:10.060
So you and had been obviously been with you just before you came in.

326
00:22:10.061 --> 00:22:14.420
So now he had an ally and then the outcome of the fight,
uh,

327
00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:19.510
was,
was very different.
Suddenly,
Goliath leaps right onto whew.

328
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:20.440
Uh,

329
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.700
grabbing his hair and shoulder pounding on his back with both feet and he gives

330
00:22:24.701 --> 00:22:29.170
up and he managed to pull away and runs off screaming and defeated.

331
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.810
So the guy that was,
I think I got the names right,

332
00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:36.870
the guy who was scared last night when he has an ally is now the winner.

333
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:44.580
And the females are almost as good as males in these dominance coalitions

334
00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:47.590
against each other.
So their,

335
00:22:47.591 --> 00:22:52.591
their behavior to arrange these coalitions is extremely complex and manipulative

336
00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:54.190
as,
as I've said,

337
00:22:55.450 --> 00:23:00.450
and they spend huge amounts of their time trying to organize these coalitions.

338
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:05.810
And then as soon as there's,
so several males will,
will be the,

339
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:10.060
in a coalition,
one of them will get to be alpha almost immediately.

340
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.320
They become alpha,

341
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.170
the other to go out and form other coalitions to try to displace him.

342
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.750
And we have some of our faculty members like that.

343
00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:22.310
And last night I was reading a book about a renaissance,
uh,

344
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:27.770
intrigue.
And it was amazing to have,
uh,
some of the big Duke's,
uh,

345
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.930
like the meadow cheese and the [inaudible].

346
00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:34.780
And then you have some of these smaller guys and then you have the pope who's

347
00:23:34.781 --> 00:23:39.781
got his own army and there's this constantly floating crap game of who's going

348
00:23:40.331 --> 00:23:44.130
to be allies with who.
And as soon as someone gets some one of these pencils,

349
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.170
principalities gets to be dominant,
the coalition rearranges and everyone else,

350
00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:49.700
it goes against him.
So,

351
00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:54.020
and you can read the history of Europe in the 19th century where there's all

352
00:23:54.021 --> 00:23:58.310
these balance of power stuff where you can read the newspaper today and it's all

353
00:23:58.311 --> 00:24:02.390
balanced with power,
with the shifting alliances.
I mean,
we,
you know,

354
00:24:02.391 --> 00:24:06.440
Japan and Germany where our great enemies and now there are great allies and et

355
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:11.060
Cetera,
et cetera.
Russia and was an,
then it was an ally in world war one and two,

356
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:14.210
and then it looked like then they were an enemy and then they're in ally again.

357
00:24:14.211 --> 00:24:16.910
Now maybe it'd be an enemy again.
It's,
it's,

358
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.840
it really doesn't read a terribly different,
differently.

359
00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.300
So,
um,

360
00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:31.160
so the purpose of all this kind of fighting for status is,

361
00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.550
uh,
of course to gain access to females.

362
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.460
There's some degree of food and we'll talk about where their food is a real

363
00:24:37.461 --> 00:24:40.310
scarce item for them or not.
It's usually not a scarce item,

364
00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.850
but access to females,
I think I mentioned this last time,

365
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:47.750
is dependent on the status of males.
And so,

366
00:24:47.751 --> 00:24:52.751
and it's not simply a size and aggressiveness at all that determines dominance.

367
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.900
But how good is social manipulator?
The individuals are,
uh,

368
00:24:58.230 --> 00:25:00.170
and especially the females.

369
00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.010
And if a male has not been nice to the female,

370
00:25:04.011 --> 00:25:08.690
which means off sharing food with them,
uh,
they go and hunt colobus monkeys.

371
00:25:08.691 --> 00:25:12.800
And if they catch a monkey,
uh,
how much of the meat it gets shared,

372
00:25:12.801 --> 00:25:14.780
how much grooming they do,

373
00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:19.640
and if the male is a use boorish,
uh,

374
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.910
the,
the other chimps who simply I shun him.
They just,

375
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.960
when he comes up and tries to start some kind of friendly and try and they just

376
00:25:26.961 --> 00:25:30.470
turned their back on him and walk away,
he's shunned and isolated.

377
00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:33.740
So the point is,
no matter how strong,

378
00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:36.680
physically strong and violent as single male is,

379
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.040
he can never be Alpha without the support of the community.

380
00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:44.270
It really is an not quite democratic,
but it has aspects of,

381
00:25:44.271 --> 00:25:48.440
of a democratic choice that the male must have the consent of the community

382
00:25:48.441 --> 00:25:53.060
before he can become dominant.
So this social acceptance,

383
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:56.620
the,
the,
the,
the value of your peers,
uh,

384
00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:02.080
and your social status is really the deciding factor in who will be dominant and

385
00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:07.550
therefore who will pass on his genes into the next,
uh,
generation.

386
00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:12.730
Now going back to the females,
uh,

387
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.360
when the sex behavior of chimpanzees was first being observed,

388
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.130
uh,
the,

389
00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:23.150
the observers were quite struck with the obvious promo promiscuity of the

390
00:26:23.151 --> 00:26:26.420
females.
The females just didn't seem to care who made it them.

391
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:31.130
And we discussed that last time,
you know,
and in each mating cycle,

392
00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:32.600
uh,
a female,

393
00:26:32.601 --> 00:26:35.940
we made it by every single male in the troop and Jane Goodall's troop,

394
00:26:35.941 --> 00:26:39.020
sometimes not quite so extremely.

395
00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:44.400
And that was kind of a surprising,
given the theory that I've described to you,

396
00:26:44.401 --> 00:26:46.890
that females should want something from the males.

397
00:26:46.891 --> 00:26:51.350
They should want to choose either the male with the best genes or the male,
uh,

398
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:54.420
who's giving them the biggest gift or something.

399
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:57.690
And this just sort of compliance under any segment.

400
00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.170
It was obvious that that's what they were observing,

401
00:27:01.171 --> 00:27:05.760
but it didn't make any sense.
But finally,
uh,

402
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.470
they observe more of the chimps are obviously not terribly easy to observe and

403
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.170
over a lifetime.
So you know what's going on.
And the story is this,

404
00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:18.420
that
when chimps are young,
either males or female,

405
00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:23.250
the juveniles are under the domination of their mothers.
And the females,

406
00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:24.790
the females meet with each other every so often.

407
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.280
So any female can dominate any young independent of sex.

408
00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:32.580
And so you really,
if you just looked at the social behavior,

409
00:27:32.581 --> 00:27:36.450
you wouldn't be able to distinguish a boy,
a boy,
infant girl,
infant.

410
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.270
And I'll give you some reading that human societies,

411
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:43.830
many what we call primitive human societies have the same thing that even the

412
00:27:43.831 --> 00:27:46.420
words for a young boy at the same as for a girl,
that they're,

413
00:27:46.421 --> 00:27:50.220
they're not distinguished only at some sort of puberty,
right to the boy.

414
00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:55.250
Do the biological boys become socially constructed boys and in a sense,

415
00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.390
but in chimpanzees.
So when,
when they're little,
um,

416
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.340
the females dominate them.

417
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.600
But of course the males start growing big and in adolescence they start to get

418
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.700
up to the same size of the female.

419
00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:13.440
And then what happens is that these young males come and start attacking the

420
00:28:13.441 --> 00:28:16.860
females for no obvious external reason.

421
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:19.200
And when this first happens,

422
00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:22.380
the female is still bigger and she's swatting them away,
you know,
and,

423
00:28:22.381 --> 00:28:26.130
and he runs off screaming.
Uh,
but as he gets bigger,

424
00:28:26.131 --> 00:28:29.040
he comes back and seems to sort of choose one female at a time,

425
00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:33.870
starting up on some mild dominance hierarchy among females.
Not very strong,

426
00:28:33.871 --> 00:28:34.770
but a little bit there.

427
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:40.470
He goes to just gratuitously attacks one female after another and keeps doing

428
00:28:40.471 --> 00:28:44.790
it,
pushes her punches,
her,
bites her,
pose the hair,

429
00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.800
you know,
and she fights back.

430
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.390
But eventually he's big enough to cow her and he becomes dominant to that

431
00:28:51.391 --> 00:28:54.390
female.
Then he goes to the next and the next and the next.

432
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:57.810
And eventually as they go through adolescence,

433
00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:01.260
the young males become dominant to each female.

434
00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:05.340
And then,
uh,
that's not the end of it.

435
00:29:05.341 --> 00:29:09.990
That every so often thereafter they again,
gratuitously attack,

436
00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:14.210
uh,
the females for no a particularly obvious reason.

437
00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:21.150
Let me describe you one read to you one of the exam descriptions of these kind

438
00:29:21.151 --> 00:29:25.140
of dominance attacks.
This is one of the people in,
uh,

439
00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:30.030
studying in Jane Goodall's group and Gone Bay in Tanzania.
And this is,
uh,

440
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:32.940
she's recollecting.
Nearly 20 years ago,

441
00:29:32.941 --> 00:29:36.930
I spent a morning dashing up and down the hills of Gone Bay trying to keep up

442
00:29:36.931 --> 00:29:41.500
with an energetic,
a young female on her rear end.

443
00:29:41.501 --> 00:29:45.940
She sported the small bright pink swelling characteristic of the early stages of

444
00:29:45.941 --> 00:29:46.331
estrus.

445
00:29:46.331 --> 00:29:49.210
She was just coming into her fertile period and really wasn't particularly

446
00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.330
fertile at that time.
Um,

447
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:56.740
for some hours are run through the park was conducted in quiet quietly,

448
00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:01.270
but then suddenly a chorus of male chimpanzee pantsuits shattered the

449
00:30:01.271 --> 00:30:02.800
tranquility of the forest.

450
00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.310
My female rushed forward to join the males.

451
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:11.170
She greeted each of them bowing and then turning to present her swelling,

452
00:30:11.171 --> 00:30:14.290
a rear end for inspection.
You know,
hey guys,
get interested in me.

453
00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.210
She's young and a little inexperienced.

454
00:30:16.211 --> 00:30:20.500
She thought they would be real hot to trot,
but it didn't turn out.

455
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:25.330
And the male is examined her kind of perfunctorily and they saw she wasn't

456
00:30:25.331 --> 00:30:29.590
really ready yet.
Uh,
and so they resumed grooming one another and showing no,

457
00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.750
didn't,
no interest in this young female.
And they,

458
00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.080
the scientists here,

459
00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:40.090
the anthropologist was a rather surprised by listen difference to a potential

460
00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.200
mate.
And then she understood,

461
00:30:43.210 --> 00:30:46.150
she sorta recalled and there's that and well her swelling is really pretty small

462
00:30:46.151 --> 00:30:50.080
so far,
so she's not ready.
So she realized it and we,

463
00:30:50.081 --> 00:30:55.081
it would be a week or two before she was really going to be a fertile and uh,

464
00:30:56.410 --> 00:31:00.580
then then there'll be really interested.
And so she was sort of watching this,

465
00:31:00.581 --> 00:31:04.060
the,
the males basically grooming each other,
ignoring this,
this female,

466
00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:08.350
and then boom,
all of a sudden they attacked,
the tech came without warning.

467
00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:13.410
One of the males charge toward us.
The anthropologist was with the,
uh,

468
00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:14.883
with the female,

469
00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:19.210
one of the males charged Cortez Heron and looking twice as large as my small

470
00:31:19.211 --> 00:31:23.080
female and enraged as he rushed by,
he picked her up,

471
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:27.640
her older to the ground and pummeled her.
She cringed and screamed.

472
00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:32.110
He ran off,
rejoining the other males seconds later as if nothing had happened,

473
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.710
he taxed this one and then nothing happened.

474
00:31:36.130 --> 00:31:38.560
And it was not so easy for the female to return to normal.

475
00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:42.670
She whimpered and darted about Darden.
Nervous glances,
had her attacker,

476
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:46.450
and he was worried he was going to just charge it at her again.

477
00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:50.950
And the,
the primatologists continues that in the years that follow cheese.

478
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:54.820
So many,
uh,
such assaults by this.

479
00:31:55.330 --> 00:32:00.160
So what's the purpose of this?
Uh,
these,
these attacks do not end in sex,

480
00:32:00.161 --> 00:32:01.960
so they're not rape.
Uh,

481
00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:06.070
what happens is the male establishes the dominance over the female.

482
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.530
She's afraid of him,
as I told you.

483
00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:11.560
They of course know each other individually and remember over many,
many years.

484
00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:12.610
And so these,

485
00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:16.660
these attacks during adolescence when they establish their dominance and then

486
00:32:16.661 --> 00:32:20.650
the continual reminders that their garments and they can coerce them at any

487
00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:24.460
minute,
uh,
is what the purpose of this is.

488
00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:28.780
So when she does come into estrus and all the males are,
are around,

489
00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.200
and there's only a very short window of opportunity when he may,

490
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:33.640
she may be alone,

491
00:32:33.641 --> 00:32:37.600
the other males or fighting or not paying attention for a moment.
Remember,

492
00:32:37.601 --> 00:32:41.360
he only needs 15 seconds.
When I described that last time for about,

493
00:32:41.361 --> 00:32:42.140
of intercourse,

494
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:46.650
he has 15 seconds before the other males are going to come and interrupt him.
Uh,

495
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.910
so the last thing he wants is for her to resist.

496
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.360
She has to be compliant in that very short time.

497
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:56.120
Sort of like a private and an army.
Don't ask questions,

498
00:32:56.121 --> 00:32:59.570
do whatever you're told immediately.
And this prior violence,

499
00:32:59.571 --> 00:33:04.571
the purpose of this prior violence is to cow the females into submission at that

500
00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:08.630
moment when they need this submission.

501
00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.360
Um,
so,
uh,

502
00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:20.060
so that,
that is,
uh,
the,

503
00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:24.560
the chimp system.
It's to our eyes.
It's not a very pretty kind of system.

504
00:33:24.561 --> 00:33:29.090
And you can think how much of that we still do something similar.

505
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:34.370
And that's up to you to decide.
So we've described now,

506
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:38.060
uh,
three other great apes aside from us.

507
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:42.800
And there's the fourth grade ape species,
which you probably have heard of,
uh,

508
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.450
or cold bonobos.
And for a long time they're very similar.

509
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:49.310
The chimps I showed you last time,
the evolutionary tree,

510
00:33:49.311 --> 00:33:51.200
they've split off from chimpanzees.

511
00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.780
Chimps and Bonobos have split off very recently.

512
00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:58.100
So there's still very much the same.
The bonobos are a little bit smaller.

513
00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:01.640
The difference in size between males and females is not so great,

514
00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.080
but their behavior is enormously different.
Uh,

515
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:09.820
there's almost no violence,
uh,
in,
uh,
uh,

516
00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.830
Nobo troop.
They,
the various Banabos troops,
uh,

517
00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:18.500
don't get into a violent attacks with each other.

518
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.120
What they do is have sex a lot that anything that come,

519
00:34:23.121 --> 00:34:27.740
anything that an a chimpanzee would probably illicit violent competition for

520
00:34:27.741 --> 00:34:31.940
food come dish for females,
whatever they have sex.

521
00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.960
And somehow that that diffuses it.
And um,

522
00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.330
they do everything you can dream of.

523
00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.320
<v 1>Uh,
oh,</v>

524
00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:50.610
I didn't order or
what was going on here.

525
00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:03.360
<v 0>Somehow there's something wrong anyway.
Um,
what happens is,</v>

526
00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:08.340
uh,
males and males or females may initiate the sex about,

527
00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:12.120
they often do it face to face,
which is not a usual animal sort of thing.

528
00:35:12.121 --> 00:35:15.070
And the pictures that I had and I'd want to wear their why,

529
00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:16.620
why they're not being pulled up.

530
00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:21.830
His first a male and a female copulating sort of face to face and what you,

531
00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:27.240
you'd recognize immediately what was going on.
And they seem happy about that.

532
00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.660
And then I have no slide of two females going at it.

533
00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:34.680
And what they do is they stand face to face and rub their genital regions

534
00:35:34.681 --> 00:35:36.060
together.
And of course,

535
00:35:36.061 --> 00:35:39.420
what are the primatologists that Jen and Phil Gentle rubbing,

536
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:43.920
perfectly neutral right now,
the locals where these,
these,
uh,

537
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:46.710
Benobos lived there much.
They understand better.

538
00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:51.570
And so are the locals called Hoka.
Hoka.
So the long picture of hookah,

539
00:35:51.571 --> 00:35:56.130
hookah and in the previous year,
I,
I hadn't,
I won't tell you the story.

540
00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:01.590
Very interesting story,
uh,
afterwards.
Um,

541
00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:04.920
so the question is,
uh,
and there's,

542
00:36:04.921 --> 00:36:08.520
there's essentially no dominance of the males over the females are very little

543
00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:12.990
dominance of the males over females.
You don't see this violent thing happening.

544
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:15.060
So you read about this demonic,

545
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:19.110
there's a several readings on Benobos cause I don't time in the lecture to talk

546
00:36:19.111 --> 00:36:21.720
so much about them,
but,
uh,

547
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:27.110
it seems that what's going on is a Banabos live one side of the Congo River and

548
00:36:27.901 --> 00:36:32.610
chimpanzees the other side and on the side where Bonobos are there also
gorillas.

549
00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.780
And so they compete for the same food source.
Uh,
I'm sorry,

550
00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:41.160
the chart side with the chimps are,
uh,
they're also,
I got this right.

551
00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:46.340
Uh,
gorillas and so they compete,
uh,
for the food source.

552
00:36:46.341 --> 00:36:49.500
There's not that much
food.

553
00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.830
So the chimps have to forge pretty much alone.

554
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.660
The females get isolated and therefore they're subject to male dominance.

555
00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.030
In the Bonobo territory,

556
00:37:00.031 --> 00:37:03.880
there's more a greater food density so the females can stay together and forage

557
00:37:03.881 --> 00:37:08.610
as a party.
And as you read it,
this female power,
the females stay together.

558
00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.340
And if a male comes and tries to dominate one of the females,

559
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:15.350
her sister's support her and beat the mail off.
So in evolution,

560
00:37:15.351 --> 00:37:17.100
and they've sort of given up trying that trick,

561
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.070
and now everybody copulates with everybody else.

562
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.370
And what do we call that when there's this great promiscuity?

563
00:37:23.371 --> 00:37:27.420
What's the form of competition going on?
Sperm competition.

564
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:33.120
And so one of the ways that the Banabos evolve is that they're in evolution,

565
00:37:33.121 --> 00:37:34.470
the testes get bigger and bigger.

566
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:39.330
And so you measure the ratio of tests to size in a Bonobo,

567
00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.980
which has a lot of sperm competition to chimpanzees,
which have a lot,
a lot less,

568
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:46.140
very little because they fight,
the males fight each other.

569
00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.550
And what you find is that as a fraction of total body size,

570
00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:55.960
the dinobo testes are much larger than the chimpanzee testes.

571
00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:01.340
Okay.
So,
uh,

572
00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:06.590
we've seen four different models of male female relationships that rape and

573
00:38:08.701 --> 00:38:12.300
orangutans,
infanticide in gorillas,
battering in chimps,

574
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.170
and total promiscuity in Bonobos.
Uh,

575
00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:20.310
so one of the questions that you can ask is which one most resembles the human

576
00:38:20.311 --> 00:38:22.140
condition?
Well,

577
00:38:22.141 --> 00:38:26.490
it turns out that if you do the statistics in humans,

578
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:29.730
rape is relatively rare.
Of course,
we all know what happens,

579
00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:34.230
but it's not a major event in fantasize,

580
00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:39.010
which you'll see happens very frequently,
but not against the will of the mother.

581
00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:42.550
The males,
uh,
not unrelated males.

582
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:46.810
Killing the infants of other females is a very,

583
00:38:46.811 --> 00:38:50.860
very rare event in humans.
Again,
it happens,
but it's,
it's quite rare.

584
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:55.480
The common form of,
of Male,
female human violence,
what do we call it?

585
00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:01.240
Battering,
right?
Battering is extremely common,
uh,

586
00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:06.820
almost all over the earth and for as far back in history as we know.

587
00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:11.350
So various studies have been done in different places in Punjab,

588
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.390
in north India,
uh,

589
00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:16.930
75% of scheduled caste women that's lower,

590
00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.960
lower caste women reported being beaten frequently by their husband's 75.

591
00:39:23.231 --> 00:39:24.050
There's an agreement there.

592
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:28.060
75% of the men report beating their wives in Bangladesh.

593
00:39:28.061 --> 00:39:31.240
47% of the women report having been beaten.

594
00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:37.170
A study of 10 countries ranging from Japan to Ethiopia showed that in most sites

595
00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:42.211
between 30 and 56% of the ever partner and this partner violence,

596
00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:46.990
uh,
women had experienced both physical and sexual violence.

597
00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:50.560
And of course these are almost certainly whenever you collect statistics on

598
00:39:50.561 --> 00:39:54.840
something that is not exactly a appreciate it.
And this is hard a year,

599
00:39:54.841 --> 00:39:56.500
you're getting a very low report.

600
00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:59.740
These are certainly under reports cause people don't want to report it.

601
00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:03.430
But also when you ask about,
you know,
not just casual,
a little bit of violence,

602
00:40:03.431 --> 00:40:04.840
but you know,
is this severe,

603
00:40:04.841 --> 00:40:09.841
have you been severely beating in a society where 75% of the women are beaten

604
00:40:10.121 --> 00:40:10.954
frequently?

605
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:14.440
The standard for what they're going to call severe is going to be very high.

606
00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:19.030
So if you've used our understanding of,
of male,
female battering,

607
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:22.870
the numbers would clearly be much,
much higher.

608
00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:25.593
Uh,

609
00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:30.430
and what's interesting is there's a fair amount of collusion between the males

610
00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:35.170
and the females in,
in this,
uh,
beating this,
this battering,

611
00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.660
uh,
both in the culture,

612
00:40:37.661 --> 00:40:42.661
both the men and the women that feel that it is the husband's right to beat the

613
00:40:42.911 --> 00:40:46.780
woman.
And it's,
and it's just right.
It's the woman's do.
She should be beaten.

614
00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:52.450
And they talk about this quite openly,
uh,
40 to 80%.

615
00:40:52.451 --> 00:40:54.430
And again,
in different surveys,
40,
80,

616
00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:59.260
40 to 80% of wives agreed that a beating is justified if it will.

617
00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:04.030
If a wife neglects household chores or is disobedient.
And again,

618
00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:08.540
this will be,
it probably has a much more minor meaning.
Uh,
but this,

619
00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:13.320
this be worth of beating would not be even considered disobedience by us.

620
00:41:13.321 --> 00:41:16.030
Maybe probably very minor.

621
00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:22.390
Severe beating is almost uniformly justified and can condone for many reasons,

622
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:25.660
including,
for example,
a husband,

623
00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:29.380
a woman disobeying her husband's orders if it was been gives a woman a direct

624
00:41:29.381 --> 00:41:33.680
order and she does not follow it.
She gets beaten.
Uh,

625
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:42.500
uh,
it's,
it's her duty to obey or husband and they describe it.

626
00:41:42.501 --> 00:41:44.750
The women talking to each other and talking to investigate it,

627
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.450
describe it as selfish,
that when she follows what she wants to do and,

628
00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.980
which of course there is always conflict between one person who wants to do and

629
00:41:51.981 --> 00:41:55.850
person B,
then they said,
I was selfish,
I deserved a beating.

630
00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.050
Or they say that if another woman,

631
00:41:57.051 --> 00:42:02.051
she was selfish and she deserves a beating in the u s of course we have an

632
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:07.400
escape.
This,
this has now become,
uh,
it was hush hush for a very long time.

633
00:42:07.401 --> 00:42:10.100
But now it's,
it's fairly open because of the feminist movement.

634
00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:15.460
And the numbers are something like 50% of us women will be physically abused by

635
00:42:15.891 --> 00:42:20.300
the men with whom they live.
So they're getting this as partner,
uh,
violence.

636
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.600
6 million will be really battered and that's way more,

637
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:29.750
you look at the say way more than rape and auto accidents and muggings and every

638
00:42:29.751 --> 00:42:32.360
other kind of mishap put together.

639
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:37.250
So a battering seems to be,
uh,

640
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.550
both the chimpanzee mode of violence.
And it's not the Orangutang,

641
00:42:40.551 --> 00:42:43.640
it's not the apron.
And certainly not,
uh,
not they rang,
not the grill.

642
00:42:43.641 --> 00:42:46.180
And certainly not the Bonobo,
uh,

643
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:51.650
but humans seem to engage in the same kind of violence as,
as chimpanzees.

644
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:56.900
And the most wonderful quote that I have a describing,
uh,

645
00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:00.920
this is from a Palestinian woman and she says,

646
00:43:01.280 --> 00:43:04.880
men have small brains.
If you feed them,

647
00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:08.930
cook for them and cleaned for them,
maybe then they will not beat.
You.

648
00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:13.670
Think that's a great tag.

649
00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.280
Okay.
Um,

650
00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:26.080
so now I've spun a nice story for you,
right?
The way chimpanzees,

651
00:43:26.081 --> 00:43:29.000
social organization around sex and reproduction.

652
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:32.990
And I don't know if any of you have noticed there's something really wrong with

653
00:43:32.991 --> 00:43:36.800
the story.
Wrong,
incomplete,
incorrect.

654
00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:40.460
Anybody think anything?
So what have I described to you?

655
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:43.070
I've scratched you in the first hand,
uh,

656
00:43:43.071 --> 00:43:46.310
that these males fight with each other their whole lives.
So male,

657
00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:50.930
he is not much else to do.
Feed and think about his,
his part in the dominance.

658
00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.660
So in the whole year there's going to be one or two females ready to be

659
00:43:53.661 --> 00:43:56.750
inseminated.
And what do they do the whole rest of the year?

660
00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:00.950
They're fighting for dominance,
right?
And finally you get to have an Alpha male.

661
00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:05.450
And most of the time he's in strong control and really can control,

662
00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:10.340
uh,
all the other males.
Okay.
That's,
you know,

663
00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:15.260
the naked ape kind of story,
which you've heard,
but whoa,
wait a minute.

664
00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.310
What else have I also told you?
Every time the FEMA comes into estrus,

665
00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:24.050
she does it with everybody,
right?
Those two stories don't jive with each other.

666
00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:29.360
There's a,
there's some,
some contradictory thing going on there.

667
00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:35.020
And that's the next part of the whole story that we have to figure out why since

668
00:44:35.731 --> 00:44:38.820
the Alpha male could easily win,
when there's a really strong alpha male,

669
00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:43.260
could easily keep all the other males away from the fear means only a couple of

670
00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:47.910
weeks that she's at all fertile and he spent the whole year being boss.

671
00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:48.541
You know,

672
00:44:48.541 --> 00:44:53.541
why does he keep the other males away and get all the sexual activity for

673
00:44:54.391 --> 00:44:56.910
himself?
It's an interesting,
it's,

674
00:44:56.930 --> 00:45:00.990
it's a surprising thing and it tells you that something is missing from the

675
00:45:00.991 --> 00:45:03.900
story.
Uh,

676
00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:10.230
okay.
So this is where Jane Goodall comes in and she's responsible for almost

677
00:45:10.231 --> 00:45:12.690
everything about chimpanzees and the whole field of primatology.

678
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.990
He's a real hero of mine,
uh,

679
00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:17.970
angry that Yale has never given her an honorary degree,

680
00:45:17.971 --> 00:45:20.460
even though she lives right here in Wilton in Connecticut.

681
00:45:20.461 --> 00:45:25.080
It's really bad or shameful.
Okay.
So what's her story?

682
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.660
Just a little bit of personal interests.
Uh,

683
00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:32.330
she was 23 years old in 1960 and he,
she,

684
00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:36.020
she and her biography,
she always loved watching animals.
I mean,

685
00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.570
she would go into the hen house and just sit there and her mother couldn't find

686
00:45:39.571 --> 00:45:43.020
her and they,
you know,
look where the hands are.
Well,
that's where Jane Jane is.

687
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:48.060
She not,
not from a family that was sort of education bound.

688
00:45:48.061 --> 00:45:51.210
She had not been to a university.
She had no particular career,

689
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:56.040
but she was invited to visit a friend in Africa and in,
and a lot of England,

690
00:45:56.041 --> 00:45:57.080
a lot of time,
Africa,

691
00:45:57.081 --> 00:46:00.940
sort of very romantic kind of place with every young person wants to go in and

692
00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:01.853
see Africa.

693
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:06.690
So she took a job as a waitress because it wasn't trained to do anything else

694
00:46:06.691 --> 00:46:11.130
and saved up enough money so she could get the steamboat passage,
uh,
to Kenya.

695
00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:13.680
So she took a boat to Kenya in 1960

696
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:18.840
she bet up fairly soon with Louis Leakey and the,

697
00:46:18.841 --> 00:46:22.650
and the expatriate community,
the English community there,
Louis Leakey,

698
00:46:22.651 --> 00:46:26.680
you may have heard of his family,
has done all the paleontological,

699
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:29.160
the digging up of Lucy.
I think Lucy is one of theirs.

700
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:33.030
And all the other scouts I'm sort of rewritten,
uh,
the history of,

701
00:46:33.031 --> 00:46:35.670
of human evolution.
And that the idea of basically being,

702
00:46:35.671 --> 00:46:39.300
there were lots of branches that are species just didn't grow out of
chimpanzees,

703
00:46:39.301 --> 00:46:42.900
but there were lots and lots of species floating around and most they,

704
00:46:42.901 --> 00:46:46.620
all the others went extinct in what,
what survived as us.

705
00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:50.640
And so here comes this young woman and she doesn't really have a job and she

706
00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:53.490
needs some support and she loves African.
She loves animals.

707
00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.680
And leaky gets an idea that,
well,

708
00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:58.650
no one has been able to go out and see what chimpanzees do.

709
00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:02.400
We know what they knew by that time,
they were our closest relative.

710
00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:05.370
They didn't really understand about Benobos at that time.

711
00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:10.500
And Banabos didn't live where he was anyway.
Uh,
and so he says to her,

712
00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:13.880
you know,
how are you interested at all in,

713
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:17.340
in going out and trying to observe chimpanzees?

714
00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:22.920
And uh,
she says,
yes,
yes,
yes.
And he says,

715
00:47:22.921 --> 00:47:26.130
you know,
they,
they,
they don't like human.
They run away,
you know,

716
00:47:26.131 --> 00:47:28.410
and if they don't run away,
they'll probably try to attack you.

717
00:47:28.411 --> 00:47:31.390
These are big violent beasties and uh,
you know,

718
00:47:31.391 --> 00:47:34.780
you may be in physical danger and she says,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
I went to,

719
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:38.320
and then it says,
well,
you know,
you're an attractive young woman and you were,

720
00:47:38.321 --> 00:47:40.660
what did I say,
23 or something?
And you know,

721
00:47:40.661 --> 00:47:41.890
there aren't going to be any men around.

722
00:47:41.891 --> 00:47:44.650
You're going to be living in the jungle basically by yourself.

723
00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:48.910
I'm sure you want to do it.
Hi.
Hi.
Yeah,
yeah,
I want to do it.
He says,
you know,

724
00:47:48.911 --> 00:47:51.880
it's going to take you 10 years before you're going to be the same thing.

725
00:47:51.881 --> 00:47:55.450
You have to get it,
get them accustomed to use that you can even observe them.

726
00:47:55.451 --> 00:47:58.120
Then you have to be able to watch them over long periods of times to understand

727
00:47:58.121 --> 00:48:02.830
their social behavior.
You really want to do it.
Yes,
she decides to do it.

728
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:07.720
And she later on recounts this discussion where he said it would take her 10

729
00:48:07.721 --> 00:48:11.500
years and she said if I had done it for only 10 years,

730
00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:13.730
I would not have seen,
uh,

731
00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:17.030
the violence that I did eventually see.

732
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:19.091
In fact,

733
00:48:19.091 --> 00:48:24.091
it took 25 years before she saw the events that I'm going to describe to you.

734
00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:26.500
And so the,

735
00:48:26.501 --> 00:48:30.490
the violent events that I'm going to describe orange chimpanzee communities

736
00:48:31.390 --> 00:48:34.810
about once a generation,
more or less like humans,
if you take the time,

737
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:40.090
say in the West,
between the,
the Napoleonic wars and the 1870 war,

738
00:48:40.091 --> 00:48:43.390
a little bit long from,
from the French Franco Prussian war,

739
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:45.080
the world war wound toward war two,

740
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:49.780
we seem to do it more or less every generation or so ballpark,

741
00:48:49.781 --> 00:48:53.080
25 years.
And that's very variable.

742
00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:57.910
And chimpanzee violence has that same sort of a,
of a character to it.

743
00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:00.370
So in 62,

744
00:49:00.371 --> 00:49:04.630
she started observing a group of night that it was a large group,

745
00:49:04.631 --> 00:49:09.130
much larger than as usual.
There are 19 adult and adolescent males.

746
00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:14.340
And then the long with females and the young and the main thing that they were

747
00:49:15.491 --> 00:49:17.140
watching was the social behavior.

748
00:49:17.141 --> 00:49:19.930
They weren't really interested in the physiology or that kind of stuff at the

749
00:49:19.931 --> 00:49:21.340
time was really the social behavior.

750
00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:24.310
So they watched who was doing what with whom.

751
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:28.970
And one of the one things they know who were two individuals that they consider

752
00:49:28.971 --> 00:49:29.531
best friends,

753
00:49:29.531 --> 00:49:34.531
Goliath and Joe Romeo and they spend very long time grooming each other and all

754
00:49:34.541 --> 00:49:35.710
friendly interactions.

755
00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:40.030
And they saw these two individuals interacting over six years and there's

756
00:49:40.031 --> 00:49:44.840
nothing,
nothing but friendly.
So gradually this large group,
she,
uh,

757
00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.430
had started banana feeding the group in order to be able to see them.

758
00:49:48.431 --> 00:49:51.130
She would put out bananas and they would come in and get it and they would get

759
00:49:51.131 --> 00:49:54.370
used to her that way.
And for a long time,

760
00:49:54.371 --> 00:49:57.330
other scientists thought she may have distorted the behavior,
but it's,

761
00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:02.590
it turns out everything she saw it has been a scene again when there was no,

762
00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:05.320
no banana feeding.
So that that was not a real issue.

763
00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.570
So she watched this group for for many years,
six years or so.

764
00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:13.450
And then things started to change.
Gradually.

765
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:17.360
The true groups started separating those sort of a northern,
uh,

766
00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:22.060
mountain hill with a ravine than a southern mountain and hill.
And,

767
00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:26.230
uh,
one group started spending clung subset of this one big group.

768
00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:31.040
So I was spending time on the Northern Hill and another group on the Southern

769
00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.220
Hill.
And the northern group was somewhat larger but not a huge difference.

770
00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:38.930
There are eight fully mature males in the northern group and only six in the

771
00:50:38.931 --> 00:50:42.860
southern group along with three females,
for instance,
with the southern group.

772
00:50:43.850 --> 00:50:46.910
And first he just,
they just watch how much time they spent.

773
00:50:46.911 --> 00:50:51.890
They recorded everything and they started seeing the group split a little bit.

774
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:55.520
And then when,
but it wasn't absolute,

775
00:50:55.521 --> 00:50:57.170
they were still seeing it in each other's territory.

776
00:50:57.171 --> 00:51:01.310
But after awhile they never saw males alone in the wrong territory.

777
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:06.570
They started traveling only in groups when they were in,
uh,
the other,
uh,

778
00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:09.680
territory.
And it was clear that they were beginning.

779
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:14.390
This one group was beating deficient into two rather separate groups.

780
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:19.490
One day,
uh,
six northern males,

781
00:51:19.491 --> 00:51:23.960
most of the males were observed traveling together in their own northern

782
00:51:23.961 --> 00:51:25.670
territory,
but they were near the border.

783
00:51:25.671 --> 00:51:29.690
There was kind of patrolling what was becoming the border and they heard
calling,

784
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:31.100
uh,
from the south.

785
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:36.400
And so they became silent and then move very quickly,
uh,

786
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.620
directly to where they had heard the calling.

787
00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:43.360
What they saw was goatee,
a southern male.
Uh,

788
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:46.370
he was feeding up in a tree and not doing anything particular.

789
00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:51.740
He noticed them coming and he jumped down and ran away.
But Humphrey,

790
00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:55.850
one of the,
the northern guys chased after him and tackled him.

791
00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.480
And then Humphrey was big.
He,
once he had tackled him,

792
00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:04.190
he got on top of them and held down his sat on his face actually,

793
00:52:04.191 --> 00:52:08.870
and held his hands.
Another one came in,
held down the feet.
So they basically,

794
00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:09.733
uh,

795
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:14.870
immobilized a goatee and then they started attacking him.
The other,
there's,

796
00:52:14.871 --> 00:52:19.730
remember the six males to,
to hold them down.
Um,
they tacked,

797
00:52:19.731 --> 00:52:24.620
he ripped off his skin gat and gashes on the face and the nose on the mound

798
00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:27.570
puncture in the leg puncture wounds.
Uh,

799
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:32.180
in the ribs and eventually he was beaten so badly that he was just motionless

800
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:35.570
plot plopped out there in the attackers just left.

801
00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:38.630
Then they didn't kill them or anything.
They just left,

802
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:43.520
but he was so badly wounded that he died shortly thereafter.
Anyway,

803
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:45.500
seven weeks later,

804
00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:51.040
three northern males attack d and other southern male d runs up a tree and

805
00:52:51.651 --> 00:52:56.060
starts trying to escape by jumping from,
from branch,
from,
from tree to tree.

806
00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:59.390
But these are big animals and sometimes they grab it,
not strong enough.

807
00:52:59.391 --> 00:53:03.920
Branch grabs a branch,
it cracks and he's left dangling.

808
00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:06.680
So they pulled him down and the three man,

809
00:53:06.681 --> 00:53:11.150
three males that had during the tech kept beating him and he first huddled up

810
00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:15.140
and then he lay flat on the ground and no longer even trying to escape.

811
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:19.640
They were females in this party at this point when he was not so much a danger

812
00:53:19.641 --> 00:53:20.780
anymore.
He was pretty emotional.

813
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:24.230
They joined in and the females then started dragging him.

814
00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:28.620
He was faintly squeaking as they dragged them along the ground and in the

815
00:53:28.621 --> 00:53:31.240
dragging the skin was torn from him.
And then they,

816
00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:35.280
they start biting him and flying off his skin with,
with their teeth.

817
00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:39.630
And then after he was sufficiently down,
they just left.

818
00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.210
And he actually lived for,
for a few months.

819
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:46.710
His spine in his pelvis were protruding from outside the skin.

820
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:50.580
His scrotum has shrunk to one fifth of its normal size.

821
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.670
He died whole year,

822
00:53:53.671 --> 00:53:56.610
passes five males attack Goliath.

823
00:53:56.670 --> 00:54:00.360
Goliath is the one we talked about already,
who by this time,

824
00:54:00.361 --> 00:54:04.210
it's an extremely old male with teeth worn down to the gum.

825
00:54:04.211 --> 00:54:08.730
So clearly not a threat to anybody.
He was too old to,
to be a threat.

826
00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:12.330
And Joe Romeo,
who had been his previous grooming partner,
you know what,

827
00:54:12.331 --> 00:54:13.450
for six years they were,

828
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:18.500
they were buddies and he's part of the attacking party and he attacks,

829
00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:22.350
uh,
Goliath,
just like any of the others.

830
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:27.800
Goliath was beaten for 20 minutes and he tries to protect his head,

831
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:31.530
but eventually he's too beaten and just gives up and lay still.

832
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:33.900
And in this particular case,

833
00:54:33.901 --> 00:54:37.170
the adolescent males were along and they watch this,

834
00:54:37.171 --> 00:54:40.370
they stay a safe distance away,
but they're watching this and they get,
you know,

835
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.200
very excited.
They,
they hoot and Holler and jumping all around.

836
00:54:43.201 --> 00:54:47.580
You've probably seen kids,
human kids behave that way.
And then again,

837
00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:50.520
once Goliath was pretty much immobilized,

838
00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.760
they ran in and contributed their,
uh,

839
00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:58.470
their degree of violence to this.
And again,
same story.

840
00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:01.410
And they didn't bother to kill them.
They just went away.
But he died.

841
00:55:02.940 --> 00:55:07.260
This continues,
uh,
and one after the other.

842
00:55:07.530 --> 00:55:10.610
And three years after the first kill,
uh,

843
00:55:11.070 --> 00:55:15.780
the northern males caught sniff who is the last remaining,
uh,

844
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:20.430
southern male.
And Satan was one of the attackers.
You've heard Satan before.

845
00:55:20.431 --> 00:55:23.430
And he grabbed her by the neck and suck the blood from his nose.
He had,

846
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.110
and cutting the nosy suck the blood.

847
00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:29.880
Two males grabbed one leg each and dragged him down into a ravine.
And again,

848
00:55:29.881 --> 00:55:34.110
the same thing.
They beat him up.
They left him to die and he did indeed die.

849
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:37.140
So sniff was the last nail in the southern group.

850
00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:41.850
The females were also not spared.
Madam B,

851
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:46.660
who's a crippled female and her daughter,
little B,
uh,
uh,

852
00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:51.420
both were an estrous,
so both were sexually,
uh,
ready,
sexually available,

853
00:55:51.930 --> 00:55:53.010
uh,
but didn't matter.

854
00:55:53.011 --> 00:55:57.470
They were attacked and they had a series of attacks on,

855
00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.520
on the females over the course of a year.

856
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:04.360
And in the last attack after she had stopped moving completely,
Jeremy,
me,

857
00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:08.100
you know,
it was observed only the mail we've seen picked her up,

858
00:56:08.101 --> 00:56:12.450
slams or are down stomps,
honor,
rolls are over and over along the slope.

859
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:15.810
And then he let her go.
But when she tried to get up,

860
00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:20.960
another male comes in and slams into the ground again and beat her again till

861
00:56:21.121 --> 00:56:24.580
she senseless.
And she dies five days after this attack.

862
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:29.450
So eventually the southern group was totally wiped out.
Uh,

863
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:33.800
they saw some killing of the juveniles of the infants,
uh,

864
00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.590
but they couldn't observe that all.

865
00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:38.860
And the presumption is that the infants that they didn't see actually being

866
00:56:38.861 --> 00:56:41.780
killed,
they lost their mothers.
They consult,

867
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.400
they just died in the jungle somewhere.
But they never,
no,

868
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:48.790
no individual from the southern group was never seen again.

869
00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:55.860
So what happens then?
So now,
uh,
this northern group,
uh,

870
00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:59.560
the called the Casa Keela group,
uh,
is dominant.

871
00:56:59.561 --> 00:57:02.170
They expand into the southern territory.

872
00:57:02.171 --> 00:57:06.970
Now they have sort of basically twice the size territory and there's sort of

873
00:57:06.971 --> 00:57:09.880
luxuriate in that in some sense.
And it lasts all of a year.

874
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:13.210
But then they come in contact with the next group to the south,

875
00:57:13.211 --> 00:57:16.990
which is even stronger than they are.
And they had nine that,

876
00:57:16.991 --> 00:57:21.220
that community had nine fully adult,
a fully mature males.

877
00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.050
And so in the next year that's that next southern group starts attacking what

878
00:57:26.051 --> 00:57:30.010
was the northern group and almost destroys them,

879
00:57:30.011 --> 00:57:31.470
almost an NII lates.

880
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:36.190
Then they're pushed out of their newly one territory and even north of there

881
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.840
called prewar boundaries.

882
00:57:37.841 --> 00:57:40.750
So there were soft and they want to be where before two wars.

883
00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:43.720
And in the meantime they are being pushed north.

884
00:57:43.721 --> 00:57:48.040
But there was another strong community in the north pushing south and it looked

885
00:57:48.041 --> 00:57:52.330
very bad for this group and Jane Goodall and her and her staff by then and which

886
00:57:52.331 --> 00:57:55.030
had grown fairly large,
was wearing,
you know,
they'd spend 20 years,

887
00:57:55.300 --> 00:57:59.250
so 25 years studying these individuals had all their history known him.

888
00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:02.500
It was the only group that they could really understand individuals or,

889
00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:06.190
and it literally looked like they were just going to be wiped out.

890
00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:07.990
As it turned out,

891
00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:13.000
they got lucky that just at the time when it looked like her group was going to

892
00:58:13.001 --> 00:58:13.834
be wiped out,

893
00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:18.990
some of the adolescent males turn fully mature and the balance of power was

894
00:58:19.421 --> 00:58:23.110
reestablished.
And when two groups or more or less equally strong,

895
00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:25.120
they don't engage in fights.

896
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:30.390
These fights only happen when a group from one community goes and finds a single

897
00:58:30.941 --> 00:58:35.110
individual from the other community and then they go and kill him or beat him up

898
00:58:35.590 --> 00:58:39.520
very badly.
So the group that's attacking basically does not take any risks.

899
00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:42.250
And in the course of these three years,
the northern group loss,

900
00:58:42.251 --> 00:58:46.490
nobody and the southern group was totally wiped out.
They,

901
00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:51.000
they only engage in this violence when they're sure to win.
And you,

902
00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:55.930
you can read about human primitive warfare as it has very much the similar,
uh,

903
00:58:56.350 --> 00:59:00.310
character.
So as soon as this group got,
got strong enough,

904
00:59:00.311 --> 00:59:04.960
by the luck of adolescent males,
uh,
becoming a fully adult,

905
00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:08.800
uh,
what they then the two groups would meet at a,
at the boundary,

906
00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:11.710
and they'd scream and yell at each other and bang their chests and all this kind

907
00:59:11.711 --> 00:59:16.690
of stuff.
And,
uh,
but then they back off and retreat into their,

908
00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:21.010
their territory.
So,
uh,
good all's group was,
was saved.

909
00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:26.060
Now the question comes up as I mentioned,
uh,

910
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:28.370
does this have anything to do with the banana feeding?

911
00:59:28.371 --> 00:59:31.910
Did Somehow Jane Goodall's treatment of these,
uh,

912
00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:36.290
these animal groups,
they saw a big group in the beginning.

913
00:59:36.291 --> 00:59:37.610
Maybe that wasn't a natural group.

914
00:59:37.611 --> 00:59:42.470
Maybe it was two different groups that came into that sort of joined for the

915
00:59:42.471 --> 00:59:44.480
purpose of getting bananas.
Uh,

916
00:59:44.481 --> 00:59:48.770
and then they reverted to their prior hostility,
separateness and hostility.

917
00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:52.000
Uh,
there was no way to really know that a new,

918
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:55.190
a whole lot of other hypotheses why this couldn't be the case that everybody

919
00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:56.180
knew.
Jen Good.

920
00:59:56.181 --> 00:59:59.600
I had herself before she sold this word published of lovely book saying how

921
00:59:59.601 --> 01:00:04.250
peaceful chimps were.
And there was all this popular literature about how,

922
01:00:04.251 --> 01:00:07.730
you know,
humans were rogue species.
We're the only ones that kill each other.

923
01:00:07.731 --> 01:00:10.160
We're the only ones that go to war.
You were really bad.

924
01:00:10.161 --> 01:00:15.020
And it's modern civilization or capitalism or imperialism or you know,

925
01:00:15.021 --> 01:00:17.330
all of these cultural things that,
why,

926
01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:20.390
what has made humans such as such a bad species,

927
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:24.730
cause chimps are nearest relatives were just so wonderful.
Uh,

928
01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.120
and so there are,

929
01:00:26.121 --> 01:00:30.360
people are thinking of all kinds of reasons why what they saw was not true.
Uh,

930
01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:33.740
but meanwhile,
the Japanese who were very,
very strong in this field,
and again,

931
01:00:33.741 --> 01:00:36.890
females are really almost dominant in this field.

932
01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:40.250
I know that they have the patients to go there and watch for such a long time.

933
01:00:40.251 --> 01:00:42.710
But,
uh,
this,
the,

934
01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:46.650
even in both in America and Japan and England,
uh,

935
01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:51.240
the female researchers are some of the very best.
So,
uh,

936
01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:56.240
they again,
they observed a group of Japanese were in a different part of Africa,

937
01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:01.250
uh,
for 10 years.
Nothing but peace.
Then during the second decade,

938
01:01:01.251 --> 01:01:03.680
so years 10 to 20,
uh,

939
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:06.320
all six adult males of the smaller community,

940
01:01:06.321 --> 01:01:10.220
they also had several minutes containing 22 members managed one by one,

941
01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:14.360
apparently due to the aggression by males of the other too much larger

942
01:01:14.361 --> 01:01:17.240
neighboring communities who are dominant because of their size,

943
01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:21.860
size in this case,
meaning number of adult
males.

944
01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:26.480
Now in this case,
they didn't kill the females,
but one after another,

945
01:01:26.481 --> 01:01:30.440
the females of the annihilated community transferred with they're surprising

946
01:01:30.441 --> 01:01:32.180
offspring,
uh,

947
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:35.690
to the victorious m group.

948
01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:40.610
And the m group also got control of the k group's territory.

949
01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:45.770
Now the exception to this transfer of the females who were the young is that the

950
01:01:45.771 --> 01:01:48.620
adolescent males were not allowed to,
did not transfer,

951
01:01:48.621 --> 01:01:50.270
and probably we're not allowed to transfer.

952
01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:54.440
And they just basically stayed in the old territory and wasted away and died

953
01:01:54.441 --> 01:01:57.680
without their social community.
All the males were dead in,

954
01:01:57.681 --> 01:02:01.460
the females had transferred.
So the troop,
and they apparently weren't allowed in.

955
01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:07.700
So now is this just sort of random violence,
man,

956
01:02:07.701 --> 01:02:10.340
it takes three years and they're,
you know,
a fair number of attacks.

957
01:02:10.341 --> 01:02:13.370
But it wasn't like every week they had another,
another battle.

958
01:02:13.371 --> 01:02:17.900
So it was sporadic.
Is this just sort of casual violence or,
or,

959
01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:21.240
or was there some kind of uh,
in this,

960
01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:26.730
and uh,
let me cut to the chase here.

961
01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:27.653
So

962
01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.970
usually a chimpanzee is,
there are many examples of this,

963
01:02:33.971 --> 01:02:38.170
but we only have time for like one.
Um,
usually the chimpanzees,

964
01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:39.130
when they sleep at night,

965
01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.160
the males will get together and not write one tree in the next,

966
01:02:42.161 --> 01:02:45.850
they make nests up in the trees,
but within a reasonable,
it doesn't,

967
01:02:45.851 --> 01:02:49.900
so they can call to each and they call to each other before they go to sleep to

968
01:02:49.901 --> 01:02:52.420
know where of,
where have you built a nest,
where are,
where are we all?

969
01:02:53.050 --> 01:02:55.420
And the usually fairly noisy about that.

970
01:02:56.260 --> 01:03:00.240
But one night I'm Marico Hasegawa,
a Japanese woman scientist,
uh,

971
01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:04.790
was observing them and she noticed and quite startling me.
There was no,
no,

972
01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:09.070
no pan Tootie.
They weren't telling me they weren't making any,
any noise.

973
01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:13.750
And she had never experienced that before.
And she was,
she was surprised.

974
01:03:13.751 --> 01:03:18.460
The next morning the troop got up and started attacking a neighboring troop.

975
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.780
They singled out a mother and her infant and attacked and killed them.

976
01:03:23.790 --> 01:03:26.620
And so why would they sign up the previous night,
which he had never seen before?

977
01:03:26.621 --> 01:03:30.910
It looks like not only each individual was planning,
but it was a group thing.

978
01:03:30.911 --> 01:03:34.180
No one in the group,
uh,
w was making any noise.

979
01:03:34.181 --> 01:03:39.010
So this had somehow been decided as a group effort,
uh,
the night before,

980
01:03:40.030 --> 01:03:43.750
uh,
when they're going to attack several males together,

981
01:03:43.751 --> 01:03:47.470
we'll leave the core of their range and travel [inaudible] purposely towards the

982
01:03:47.471 --> 01:03:49.180
periphery rather than just wandering around.

983
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:53.100
And I'll tell you a little bit about the wandering.
Um,
and there,

984
01:03:53.110 --> 01:03:57.040
it's really has all the aspects of planned ahead and purpose of,

985
01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:00.340
and this is really something that they plan to do.

986
01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:06.350
The purpose of this violence has not at all clear.
There's contending schools,
uh,

987
01:04:06.351 --> 01:04:07.270
about this.

988
01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:11.830
The most obvious one is they get more territory and there they therefore they

989
01:04:11.831 --> 01:04:14.640
get more trees,
more food.
Uh,

990
01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:17.660
they live largely on fruit and largely on figs.

991
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:21.940
There's a lot of fig trees and all jungles and uh,

992
01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:24.790
and so they just wander around and find a fruit tree.

993
01:04:24.791 --> 01:04:26.620
And then depending on how much truth there is,

994
01:04:26.621 --> 01:04:30.310
they either go up and eat themselves or they can call over someone else and say,

995
01:04:30.311 --> 01:04:31.960
Hey,
I found a good fruit tree.

996
01:04:32.710 --> 01:04:37.330
Most of the time the chimps have no problem finding food.
Uh,
Jane Goodall,

997
01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:42.520
uh,
had one of her workers follow an adult male for 50 days.

998
01:04:42.521 --> 01:04:45.130
Never.
I out of sight.
And one of the things they notice,

999
01:04:45.131 --> 01:04:49.780
did he ever go looking for food in this 50 days?
Never did he try to hunt food?

1000
01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:53.410
We just hold,
wander through through the jungle and every solvent,

1001
01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:57.910
his foot would step on a rotting fruit and squish and he would notice how he'd

1002
01:04:57.911 --> 01:05:01.570
look up and there's,
there's a tree full of fruit and climb up and eat.

1003
01:05:01.571 --> 01:05:03.880
And maybe call over,
uh,
some others.

1004
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:07.690
So she was definitely of have the impression that,
uh,

1005
01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:12.480
that food is not a limiting factor for them.
Uh,

1006
01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:16.540
later and Pusey and another scientist,
uh,

1007
01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:20.110
came the opposite conclusion that there she noticed there's some sort of

1008
01:05:20.111 --> 01:05:21.670
dominance Harvard among females.

1009
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:26.050
Those females would have more fruity trees and where they range do better.

1010
01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:29.800
Reproductively and Richard Wrangham who you'll read some of his stuff,

1011
01:05:30.310 --> 01:05:31.150
he's a food man.

1012
01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:35.650
So there's a whole group and not wildly convinced by the evidence,

1013
01:05:35.651 --> 01:05:37.720
but you know,
I'm not in the field.

1014
01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:42.550
There's a big thought that food limitation is,
is important.

1015
01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:43.211
So for instance,

1016
01:05:43.211 --> 01:05:47.020
the different stream bonobos and chimps has been ascribed to food density and

1017
01:05:47.021 --> 01:05:50.320
the size of the parties and,
and,
and so forth.

1018
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:55.370
One of the problems with the food idea is that,
uh,

1019
01:05:55.510 --> 01:06:00.100
they have fairly large chair Tories and the young healthy adults can basically

1020
01:06:00.101 --> 01:06:02.530
always find food.
They'd never seem to starve to death.

1021
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:07.780
It's the older individuals who are quite sick and not so mo tile,
uh,

1022
01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:10.590
that seemed to have trouble finding food and they can get trouble in,

1023
01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:11.650
in the dry season.

1024
01:06:11.651 --> 01:06:15.250
When there's a lot less fruit but they're probably too weak to,

1025
01:06:15.251 --> 01:06:19.360
even when they have territory a,
they're too weak to even,
you know,

1026
01:06:19.361 --> 01:06:22.780
they just can barely searched territory a and if you give them twice as big a

1027
01:06:22.781 --> 01:06:23.614
territory,

1028
01:06:23.860 --> 01:06:27.370
may not do them any good because they just don't have the energy to go search
it.

1029
01:06:27.790 --> 01:06:31.000
So,
uh,
I think the,
the,

1030
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:36.630
the field is moving toward the idea that that food is the important thing.

1031
01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:41.680
The evidence that I've seen doesn't convince me yet,
but again,

1032
01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:46.210
I'm not an expert in this whatsoever.
So the other,
of course,

1033
01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:48.010
the other purpose of course to acquire females.

1034
01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:51.520
I've been going on and on about how rare an egg is.
And so you think,

1035
01:06:51.521 --> 01:06:53.260
well that's the obvious reason,

1036
01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:55.960
but then you watch them go and they kill the females,

1037
01:06:56.260 --> 01:06:59.410
even the female's in estrus.
So that doesn't make a lot of sense.

1038
01:06:59.590 --> 01:07:02.560
Although the Japanese group,
sometimes the females do transfer.

1039
01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:07.000
And the story there is,
is quite interesting because as you know,

1040
01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:10.840
a small groups of individuals,
if they interbreed,

1041
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.660
if the group was sealed,
if you know the males are sealed,

1042
01:07:13.661 --> 01:07:15.310
they stay together in this one community,

1043
01:07:15.311 --> 01:07:19.600
like forever for generation of generation.
But if the females also stayed there,

1044
01:07:19.601 --> 01:07:24.040
it would be an in inbreeding group and inbreeding gives big genetic problems.

1045
01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:28.930
So all species have to have some mechanism of gene flow and have to get jeans in

1046
01:07:28.931 --> 01:07:31.570
from the outside or sent and or send their jeans out.

1047
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:33.730
So it turns out that in chimpanzees,

1048
01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:38.970
the females have access to other troops and they go out and have intercourse

1049
01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:44.170
when they're away and exactly how this is done because the males watched them.

1050
01:07:44.171 --> 01:07:45.310
When they come into estrus,

1051
01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:50.320
they must disappear before coming into estrus and have it out there.

1052
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:55.330
It's not really known but,
but now they can do the genetics.
And again,

1053
01:07:55.331 --> 01:07:59.470
something like half of the babies are born with fathers that are not from the

1054
01:07:59.471 --> 01:08:01.660
troupe where they're resident in.

1055
01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:06.040
Very often the adolescent females who just transferred troops altogether.

1056
01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:10.660
And it's very interesting when a female tries to transfer,
go into another group,

1057
01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:14.860
if she's never had a young,
she's almost always accepted if she's had a,

1058
01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:16.130
if she's not,

1059
01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:20.420
if she's already really in this group because she's had a young,

1060
01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:24.920
very often attacked or even killed or,
or,
or kicked out,
kicked out.

1061
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:29.060
So there's something,
for some reason that's not understood at all,

1062
01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:34.340
a virgin female basically is much more acceptable for transfer then,
uh,

1063
01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:39.260
an older female and that's not really understood.

1064
01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:41.683
Um,

1065
01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:47.020
so that means since the females are going to move around anyway and biologically

1066
01:08:47.021 --> 01:08:49.100
the,
the social things,
it has to be that way.

1067
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:53.330
It doesn't make a lot of sense that they're,
that they're doing this for fee for,

1068
01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.920
to get extra females.
So,
uh,

1069
01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:02.300
there's a lot of,
a lot of unknowns here.
All right,

1070
01:09:02.301 --> 01:09:06.980
let me summarize this by the,
the summary of the,
of the chimpanzee social system.

1071
01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:10.250
So the PRI could come back to the question,
why do the males,

1072
01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.960
why is the Alpha male not dominate a totally the sexuality?
So,

1073
01:09:14.961 --> 01:09:17.710
and the reason is that these groups fighting each other a lot of,

1074
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:20.390
we don't really know the reason why they finished,
but they fight each other.

1075
01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:23.060
And the winner is always the group.
So far,

1076
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:28.090
always the group that has the most adult males and the group that is the

1077
01:09:28.941 --> 01:09:31.880
attacking group basically takes no casualties whatsoever.

1078
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:34.850
So having a lot of adult males is very important.

1079
01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:40.220
If an Alpha male got so aggressive that he kicked out all the other males,

1080
01:09:40.850 --> 01:09:44.360
he wouldn't last long.
The other communities would come in and annihilate him.

1081
01:09:44.690 --> 01:09:47.660
So because of this fighting between the communities,

1082
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:50.960
the males have to stay together in,

1083
01:09:50.961 --> 01:09:54.050
once the males have to stay together,
uh,

1084
01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:56.390
that means they're going to compete for females.

1085
01:09:57.260 --> 01:10:02.260
If the competition was such that only the alpha reproduced than evolution would

1086
01:10:03.621 --> 01:10:06.260
push all the other males into some other strategy.

1087
01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:10.520
As we've seen the big and the small,
uh,
um,
orangutans.

1088
01:10:10.521 --> 01:10:13.490
And you're going to read about our whole variety of sexual strategies.

1089
01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:16.430
You think that is heterosexual,
homosexual?
No.
There's lots of different,

1090
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.740
lots of different versions,
which you will read about.

1091
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:23.000
So evolution would push the other males to fight all the time to get to them.
If,

1092
01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:24.470
if they were not reproducing,

1093
01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.710
they would then be pushed by evolution to either fight all the time with the

1094
01:10:27.711 --> 01:10:32.711
Alpha male or go away and try to start their own troop or do something that it's

1095
01:10:32.841 --> 01:10:34.070
not a stable situation.

1096
01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.130
Only one individual can reproduce and everyone else can't.

1097
01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.770
So the males have to compete with each other.

1098
01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:43.370
All the males have to have some chance of being of fathering children.

1099
01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.640
This also has many subsidiary advantages.

1100
01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:51.200
So every male thinks he could be the father of any of the young and the troops

1101
01:10:51.201 --> 01:10:56.060
and they're all very protective.
Once it was seen that,
uh,
uh,
uh,

1102
01:10:56.061 --> 01:10:59.540
mother was coming back into estrus and becoming sexually interested,

1103
01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:03.590
the Alpha male was whether it was about to start copulating with her,

1104
01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.070
her young who did not want to be evolution.
No,

1105
01:11:07.090 --> 01:11:10.790
it doesn't want a brother because she wants all the resources and attention of

1106
01:11:10.791 --> 01:11:14.220
the mother.
He gets in between them.
And so it's finding,
and in fact,

1107
01:11:14.221 --> 01:11:18.220
he bites the scrotum of the Alpha male.
There's little,
little Tyke,
you know,

1108
01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:21.300
really clearly a sub,
even not even adolescent yet.

1109
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:26.970
And so what is the Alpha male do?
He stops what's bends down,

1110
01:11:26.971 --> 01:11:30.690
very gently,
picks him up,
takes him over here,
plop some down,

1111
01:11:30.691 --> 01:11:32.340
and goes back to the mother.

1112
01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:37.500
Because even though when that infant was born,
that Alpha male was not the alpha.

1113
01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:39.990
So it's probably someone else might've,
might've been his.

1114
01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:45.230
So this uncertainty of paternity is what the May all the males protect all of

1115
01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:51.330
the young.
So because there's males,

1116
01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:55.170
the males fight for this dominance.
The males get bigger,
uh,

1117
01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.610
than the females,
and then they can coerce the females.

1118
01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:01.920
And so I think,

1119
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:05.550
and that's why you see all this mail on not only male on male violence,

1120
01:12:05.551 --> 01:12:06.990
but male and female violence.

1121
01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:10.410
So I think the story does in the end fit back together.

1122
01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:15.680
But the driving force seems to be the fight between the different groups of

1123
01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:18.810
males,
which require males.
They've got evolve,

1124
01:12:18.811 --> 01:12:22.620
a social situation in which a lot of males competing with each other can hang

1125
01:12:22.621 --> 01:12:27.490
together.
Okay.
Um,
so it's,
it's an,

1126
01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.690
it's an interesting thing that it's because the battles between the males are

1127
01:12:30.691 --> 01:12:34.200
not decisive.
The Alpha doesn't kill the other because it's balancing.

1128
01:12:34.201 --> 01:12:37.920
The males are not decisive that the males then turn on the females to do

1129
01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:40.380
violence with them.
Okay.

1130
01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:45.530
Next time we will start on humans and we will describe humans and you will make

1131
01:12:45.781 --> 01:12:46.411
up your minds.

1132
01:12:46.411 --> 01:12:51.411
And how much of this is relevant to humans are not so see you on Tuesday.
