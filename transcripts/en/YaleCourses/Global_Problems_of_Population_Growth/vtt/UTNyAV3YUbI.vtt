1
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.320
Anybody here happened to be from Korea?
Hey,
born there.

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.790
Even from soul.
Yeah.
Ah,
you may know about this.
Okay.

3
00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.780
So there's a,
there's a,

4
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.390
do you know about the oldest tree in soul?
Hello?

5
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.220
So this is the oldest tree in soul.
It's a Ginkgo tree,

6
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.170
uh,
and it's supposed to be 840 years old.
That's a really old tree.

7
00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.640
And it's venerated by the residents.
It's kind of a,
uh,

8
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.370
a holy sacred tree.
And they bring fruit.

9
00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:42.270
They bring other offerings once a year and pray among other things for their

10
00:00:42.271 --> 00:00:43.104
safety.

11
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.380
But it's real advantage is that it helps pregnant women to have a boy child.

12
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.330
And so this is a very important transit we'll do.
Do you know about this tree?

13
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.970
Yes.
Okay.
Gingko is one of the few kinds of trees that has male and female sex.

14
00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.800
Most trees are hermaphrodite have both male and female sex.
Anyway,

15
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.400
it turns out they ran into a problem with this tree because two apartment

16
00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:17.940
buildings were interfering with the tree's roots as,

17
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:19.480
as the cheese spread its roots.

18
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.550
So what happens to the district government spend four point $3 million to take

19
00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:25.990
down the apartment buildings.

20
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.640
So it just shows to show you the importance and the,
uh,

21
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.320
political acceptability,
the cultural acceptability of son preference.

22
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.830
It's a very,
very big factor in the world.

23
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.820
The sex ratio is a very important biological factor.
If we have time at the end,

24
00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:47.710
I'll,
I'll tell you a good bit about it,

25
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.790
but just to show you that it's very well controlled.

26
00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.500
A biologically,

27
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.830
this is one of several theories about how the sex ratio in humans gets to be

28
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.580
what it is that sperms are 50,
50,

29
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.200
because there's a hundred male sperms to a hundred,
a female sperms.

30
00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:10.340
And that's because,
uh,

31
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.250
the sex is determined by the father and the father has one x and one y.

32
00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.710
And when they split to go into separate sperms,

33
00:02:17.711 --> 00:02:19.720
one gets an x one gets why that's even,

34
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.820
but by the second month of gestation,
so this is still in the mother's room,

35
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.240
apparently a huge fraction of about one third of the male fetuses are have died

36
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.730
leaving

37
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.570
<v 1>uh,
um,</v>

38
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.990
<v 0>I'm sorry,
of the female fetuses have died cause now it's,</v>

39
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.350
it's a high male ratio.
Then as time goes on,

40
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.610
the female fetuses start to die.
And when you end up,

41
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.940
you get 106 at birth all over the world unless people are messing with it.

42
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.400
There's about 106 male burst.

43
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.390
Every hundred female births.
This is a very,

44
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.080
a very fixed number.
So for instance,

45
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.100
the United States in 1969 there were 105.3 males born per hundred females.

46
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.070
Uh,
1995,
30 something years later,

47
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.640
104.9.
So difference of 0.4,

48
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.040
that number really does not very,

49
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:25.960
except basically between 105 and 106.
It's a very,

50
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.160
very stable number.

51
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.690
Okay.
So,

52
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:36.691
given that you can look at some parts of the world and see something like this,

53
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.730
this is again,

54
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.110
the sex ratio and you can look over time,

55
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:48.340
1972 to 1992 a 20 years span.

56
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.470
And here's Japan where they started a little bit of x.

57
00:03:53.471 --> 00:03:55.360
Here's,
here's the numbers you should expect.

58
00:03:55.361 --> 00:04:00.280
Somewhere in this range they have somewhat of an excess of boy,
but very minor.

59
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.440
And then during this period of time,

60
00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.800
Japan came down to almost exactly that one or six number would look at what's

61
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:09.550
going on in China

62
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.370
up to 113 or so,

63
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:19.240
which means basically seven out of every hundred girls who are being done away

64
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:22.720
with 7%,
no sure.
That's not anywhere near the,

65
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.550
the worst case.
So what do you think is,
is,
uh,

66
00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.630
the cause of this

67
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.963
<v 2>unreal</v>

68
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.380
<v 0>mitochondrial DNA?</v>

69
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.653
<v 2>Yup.</v>

70
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.610
<v 0>So you think it's a very longterm evolutionary,</v>

71
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.870
what she's saying is she thinks there's,
there's stuff that,
uh,

72
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.250
uh,
the,
the,
the,
the why the sperm,
the y,

73
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.140
the y chromosome has very few genes.
The x chromosome has many genes there.

74
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.020
Looks like there's a long evolutionary process,
uh,

75
00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.780
by which genes are getting eliminated on the why and the venture,

76
00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.550
the y we'll then have nothing on it and disappear.

77
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.490
But this is much too short a time.
We're talking 10 years.

78
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.420
Evolution just doesn't happen in 10 years,
but it's a good,
good thought.

79
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.573
Okay,
sure.

80
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.963
<v 2>Whining,</v>

81
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:25.970
<v 0>very good.
This is this,</v>

82
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.470
this is the most usual answer is the one child policy in China.

83
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.040
This is China,
remember?
And the one child policy.

84
00:05:34.041 --> 00:05:37.640
So people have heard of the one child policy and we're going to give lectures
on,

85
00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.630
does that sound like a good hypothesis for you?
Yeah,

86
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.070
but just saying it doesn't make it true.
So what else is that?

87
00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.210
This is at birth.

88
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.400
<v 2>You image you wanted son.</v>

89
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.380
I presume that the greatest way to manage that would be through fantasize.

90
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.000
<v 0>Very good.
Uh,
idea.</v>

91
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.530
<v 2>What she says is,
look,
this is at birth and then,</v>

92
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.550
okay,
you're getting ahead.
We'll,
we'll good.
I'm glad all this,
this discussion.

93
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.660
Let's notice one other thing.
One child policy.

94
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:15.350
When does the one child policy start?
We'll come back to these.

95
00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.830
These explanations.
They're all good.
Anybody know?
Okay.

96
00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.670
Guess right about 1979,
1980,
when does this take off?

97
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.143
Right?

98
00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.060
So that looks like now we've got at least a second piece of evidence that it's,

99
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.820
the time sequence fits very nicely with,
uh,

100
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.250
the one child policy.

101
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:44.210
So how can we check that we're still,
you know,

102
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:47.380
we have to be very skeptic about everything that anyone tells you that that's

103
00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.220
the scientific attitude.
Anything anybody tells you.
Politics,
science,
religion,

104
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:56.660
economics.
Try to say something.
Immediate gut responses.
That's nonsense.

105
00:06:56.661 --> 00:07:00.410
Prove it to me.
So I'm not convinced yet.
So what else might you do?

106
00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:01.973
You did fine.

107
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.250
<v 0>You could find data on abortions.
Good.
We'll,
we'll look at that room.</v>

108
00:07:08.251 --> 00:07:09.840
We talk about China,

109
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.920
but we might look at other countries that don't have the one child policy,
right?

110
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.700
So here's another country.
This is India.

111
00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.290
And you have,
remember the,
the Chinese,
uh,
and,

112
00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.640
and this is a somewhat different,
it's a dead,
is that this is not,

113
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.570
not at birth,
but the total population,
which is less extreme,

114
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.030
but a comparable number for China would be here.

115
00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:35.040
So India is more extreme than China.

116
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.710
<v 2>It is a bad example because before I prices are so high.</v>

117
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.180
<v 0>There are reasons.</v>

118
00:07:42.181 --> 00:07:45.660
Other reasons in India there's clearly reasons all around and there may be

119
00:07:45.661 --> 00:07:47.820
different in different places,
but the,

120
00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.000
but the main hypothesis that we are working on it and come back to that,

121
00:07:51.001 --> 00:07:51.930
it's very important.

122
00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.490
The main I positive that we're working on is that it's one child policy in
China,

123
00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:02.270
but now we see that China is not particularly extreme take compared to India.

124
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.580
It depends on what year you look and exactly what statistic you look.

125
00:08:05.581 --> 00:08:09.150
It's really in the same ballpark with India.
So now we have to say that,

126
00:08:09.151 --> 00:08:13.440
well it's probably not one child policy.
So what's our next hypothesis?

127
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.410
We've heard,
we've heard a different one for China.
India has bride price,

128
00:08:19.411 --> 00:08:22.830
but then if you start with Indian,
say that China doesn't have bride price,

129
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.060
they have dowery may have in fact the opposite.

130
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.770
So what about

131
00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:32.993
<v 2>excellent.</v>

132
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.850
<v 0>That's something but,
but why are the one doing poverty?
That's the usual thing.</v>

133
00:08:37.851 --> 00:08:42.620
When you speak of India and China in these years,
they were still very,

134
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:46.400
I mean they're,
they're still quite poor,
but it was poverty.

135
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.820
So how does that strike you as a,
as a hypothesis for this?

136
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:56.820
We're part of it.
I mean there's,
these things are multi causal.

137
00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.570
<v 2>China's economy has been taking off,
but it's,
the ratios are still going up.</v>

138
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.500
<v 0>Well he only shot,
I'm going to show you that data,</v>

139
00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:07.550
but I only showed you the data up to 1990 a 92.

140
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:12.730
Uh,
so I haven't,
I'm going to show you that.
Uh,

141
00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.510
okay.
So again,

142
00:09:14.511 --> 00:09:19.310
we can go to an international comparison if we want to see if poverty is at the

143
00:09:19.311 --> 00:09:23.420
root of this and what are we looking at here?
Korea,
South Korea.

144
00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.480
Korea is not a poor country,
right?

145
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.810
And yet they are just as bad,
in fact,

146
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.770
a little bit more extreme than China at this time.

147
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:38.780
So,
uh,
we really have,
uh,
uh,
uh,

148
00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.640
quite a conundrum that we can give particular exercises for each place,

149
00:09:43.641 --> 00:09:45.020
but they're going to maybe going to be different

150
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:47.740
<v 2>population growth.</v>

151
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.990
<v 0>It could be population growth in general.</v>

152
00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:55.220
That's certainly true of all of the three countries,

153
00:09:55.221 --> 00:09:57.740
that there's something about the density of population,

154
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:01.970
hard to prove since India and China is very crowded for a very long time.

155
00:10:01.971 --> 00:10:05.930
And Korea is also crowded but not as extremely as,
as,

156
00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.480
as China and India.

157
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.281
Okay.

158
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:19.281
So not the greatest sex ratio is in South Korea,

159
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.860
which is you heard is not poor.
And by 2010,

160
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.100
there will be a 20% deficit in the marriage age.

161
00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:34.080
There'll be a 20% deficit of,
of females in Korea,
which is quite a,

162
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:39.580
quite high.
And that's a way with,
so the,

163
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.920
the,
uh,
the poverty thing,
the economic thing does not work between countries.

164
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:44.940
And even if you look,

165
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:49.110
I'll show you a little bit later this big regional variations within each,

166
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.670
each country.
Uh,
but it doesn't go with economics at all.

167
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:57.570
So in China,
uh,
in Guangdong,
Guangdong,

168
00:10:57.571 --> 00:10:58.890
which can't on which everything,

169
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:00.750
everything you're wearing and everything he played with,

170
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:05.340
including probably this is maiden,
somewhere in Guangdong province,
uh,
probably.

171
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:09.570
And so it's one of the richer places in China.
And the sex ratio,

172
00:11:09.571 --> 00:11:14.460
there is 130 to 100 something.
I showed you 12 to 14.

173
00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:19.230
In that province,
it goes up to 130 and parts of that province.
So of course,

174
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.300
even within a province,
there's,

175
00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:25.770
there's different places they can go up to 144 to 100.

176
00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.170
So something like a third of the girls are done away with.

177
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.293
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

178
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.190
<v 0>No,
Brian Bride price doesn't happen in either China or India.
Bride price,</v>

179
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:47.220
you remember is when the man's family gives something to the girl or the girl's

180
00:11:47.221 --> 00:11:50.710
family.
Dowery is the opposite.
And dowery is,

181
00:11:50.711 --> 00:11:52.470
is common in India.

182
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:57.040
And really it was really communist got rid of it.
Any,

183
00:11:57.041 --> 00:12:00.670
any vestige of that in,
in China.
So that,
that's not the case.

184
00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:06.400
So in India,
the same thing,
uh,
the states,
uh,
in New Delhi and Hariana,

185
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.060
which are the richer places there,
uh,

186
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.660
have more extreme sex ratios than poor places.

187
00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.830
And,
uh,
is in,
uh,
in Delhi,

188
00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:22.580
that's 861 females per thousand,
uh,
males,
uh,

189
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:25.120
at birth.
And

190
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.520
so as time goes on,
as you see,

191
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.760
the sex ratios are getting worse and the,

192
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.520
the answer to our problem of what his car is causing,

193
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:45.960
what caused things to change at this point in time is what someone here said.

194
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.580
What,
what did someone say?
Something that would,

195
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:52.380
it wasn't the one she is the one child policy happened at this time,

196
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.800
but something else happened in both India and China and Korea.

197
00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.583
<v 2>Okay.</v>

198
00:13:01.290 --> 00:13:02.820
<v 0>It has to do with technology.</v>

199
00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:04.293
<v 2>Perfect</v>

200
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.950
<v 0>for knowing the sex,
uh,
before birth and what,</v>

201
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:16.190
what is the technology that's commonly used ultrasound that at that time

202
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:21.700
ultrasound came in and became a rather inexpensive and available.

203
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:24.420
The two ways of doing it or amniocentesis,

204
00:13:24.421 --> 00:13:27.960
which is somewhat difficult medically and quite expensive,
but ultrasound,

205
00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:32.670
you don't need an awful lot of training.
The equipment is not terribly expensive.

206
00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.670
It costs I think about $14 in,

207
00:13:35.671 --> 00:13:40.440
in India in this period of time to get an ultrasound test of what your,

208
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:44.700
uh,
your,
your fetus was.
So,

209
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.620
uh,
in one of the counties in,
in China for instance,

210
00:13:50.010 --> 00:13:54.200
that they started doing ultrasound.
And what happened was the first child,

211
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:58.470
and I'll show you some data that was okay if it was a girl,
but if the second,

212
00:13:58.471 --> 00:14:01.530
if they had a first girl and the second child was also a girl,

213
00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:06.810
then 92% of the time,
uh,
the girls would be boarded.

214
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:12.530
And I think in your reading it talks about an India in 8,000.

215
00:14:12.541 --> 00:14:13.200
They,

216
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:18.200
they looked at 8,000 serial abortions in a particular hospital and 7,999 were

217
00:14:19.741 --> 00:14:24.530
females,
one was a male and that that was probably a mistake.
They just read.

218
00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.710
I didn't read the ultrasound.
Right.
And it's not always easy to do it.

219
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:33.690
So what's happening is that in India and in China,

220
00:14:33.691 --> 00:14:35.520
it's illegal in both places,

221
00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.690
but the have even sidewalk clinics that you can just go and,
and,

222
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.610
and get a little ultrasound.
Does.

223
00:14:41.611 --> 00:14:43.260
How many of you have had some sort of ultrasound?

224
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:44.840
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

225
00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.673
<v 0>Yeah,
it's very,</v>

226
00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:50.270
they take a little probe about that long and this and just run her over you.

227
00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:54.080
And a picture on a TV screen and,
and,
and you know,

228
00:14:54.081 --> 00:14:58.490
whatever your heart or your lungs or your baby,
whatever's going on.

229
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:04.570
So,
uh,
that's,
that's,

230
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.170
that's what's going on.
It's the cheap,

231
00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:10.700
I'll ultrasound a doctors in a lot of places,
doctors,

232
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:13.370
it's so fast to do this.
It's so cheap,

233
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:17.090
doesn't take much skill that in a lot of plays doctors that he's giving up all

234
00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:20.270
the rest of their practice and just doing ultrasound.
It's,
it's,

235
00:15:20.271 --> 00:15:24.800
it's sort of like liposuction here or something.
It's,
it's uh,
easy and,

236
00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:25.634
uh,

237
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:30.710
easy and cheap and they make a lot of women a lot of money with this.

238
00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.850
So the head of the Women's Association in India says,

239
00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.650
no one wants girls.

240
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.490
If the test says a girl than the pregnant woman will have an abortion.

241
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.350
Uh,
and so someone else also mentioned this,

242
00:15:45.351 --> 00:15:49.760
I think that the final sex ratio,

243
00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.690
uh,
not at birth as,
as we said,
what their hand is.

244
00:15:53.691 --> 00:15:57.980
One of you picked out the fact that this is at birth means it's not an

245
00:15:57.981 --> 00:16:01.580
infanticide issue.
This is something doing before birth.

246
00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:05.060
The only thing you can do before birth is sex selective abortion.

247
00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:09.410
So it's clearly the mechanism of this and the timing is clearly the introduction

248
00:16:09.411 --> 00:16:14.411
of ultrasound put the total sex ratio of the country hasn't changed all that

249
00:16:15.141 --> 00:16:15.890
much.

250
00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:20.890
Then in China we have pretty good data and traditionally wherever one has data,

251
00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.030
there has been a,
uh,

252
00:16:23.031 --> 00:16:28.031
a dearth of about 10 to 25% of girls from,

253
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:32.420
they have data back to the 17 hundreds.
That's,
that's pretty decent.

254
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:34.880
But back then it was infanticide.

255
00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:40.300
So what you're really seeing is a change of method that the society is going

256
00:16:41.541 --> 00:16:46.541
from an infanticide control of the sex ratio to an ultrasound and,

257
00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.580
uh,
and sex selective abortion,
control of the sex ratio.

258
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:56.810
So the,
apparently the desire and the,
and the cultural desire for,

259
00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:01.220
for males hasn't changed all that much,
but technology has,

260
00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:06.230
has changed what they do.
And to most people's mind,
uh,
it's,
uh,

261
00:17:06.330 --> 00:17:10.920
an abortion is,
is a,
is a better thing than that,
an infanticide.
But,
uh,

262
00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:14.600
you can make up your own mind about that.

263
00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:20.290
So let me give you some more data that of the various questions that you've all

264
00:17:20.331 --> 00:17:25.040
asked.
Um,
one is an update in time.

265
00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:28.240
So that particular slide,
uh,
stopped in,
in that figure.

266
00:17:28.241 --> 00:17:31.700
The dataset stopped in 1992 in this picks up a little bit later.

267
00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.240
And here is again,
India,

268
00:17:35.241 --> 00:17:39.440
five states there and in the most extreme states,

269
00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:44.210
which again are the richest,
not the poorest of poor.
Uh,
this is a poor state.

270
00:17:44.211 --> 00:17:46.890
These are rich states.
This is southern states there.
Oh,

271
00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.980
there's different reasons.
We'll come to that in a moment.

272
00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.200
But here we saw ratios of,
of one,
uh,

273
00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:54.990
one 14 or so,

274
00:17:55.350 --> 00:18:00.350
and now they've gone up to one 29 and slowly getting better,

275
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:04.910
a little bit better with time out to the last census in 2000,
uh,

276
00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:10.110
six,
uh,
data.
And these are two,
uh,
well off,

277
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:14.160
uh,
provinces and they're extreme.

278
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:19.140
Southern India is,
uh,
the,
the in the north India,

279
00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:19.890
they speak Hindi,

280
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:24.720
mostly Hindi related languages in the South Dravidian lady related languages.

281
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.410
Uh,
the Muslim invasions didn't quite reach the south of India.

282
00:18:28.411 --> 00:18:30.540
A lot of differences between north and south India.

283
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:34.210
In terms of demography or culture,
almost anything.
It's,

284
00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:38.190
it's crazy to talk about India.
You cannot talk about India.
It's so diverse.

285
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.550
China,
they've convinced the people that their one culture.

286
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.130
But in India that's not the case.

287
00:18:44.131 --> 00:18:49.131
So you really have to compare this as one kind of these two states as one kind

288
00:18:49.381 --> 00:18:54.270
of country.
And this is very close to the,
to the one o six level.

289
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.030
So this is,
and also just weirdly in,
in uh,

290
00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:01.740
in most places it's the number of boys to girls.
But in India,

291
00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:05.720
the way they define sex ratios,
the opposite.
So I've translated into these,
these,

292
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:10.320
the numbers that are comparable to what,
what you've been been hearing.

293
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:16.320
Okay.
That's India.
Here is China.
Again,

294
00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:17.940
it has gone more extreme.

295
00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:22.470
So we stopped here about 1992 and the one 12 range.

296
00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.570
And uh,
this is at birth age zero.

297
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.720
So we're looking at this line that start that's here and that has now gone up to

298
00:19:33.241 --> 00:19:36.630
one 18,
one 19.
The sex ratio at birth.

299
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:38.860
And then as the child grows older,
as,

300
00:19:38.861 --> 00:19:42.180
as the set of children that you're counting grows older,

301
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:47.010
the sex ratio gets more and more skewed as time goes on.

302
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:51.240
And we look at that in a little bit.
Uh,

303
00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:58.650
it is,
uh,
very diverse.
I mentioned this very,
very diverse by province.

304
00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:03.680
Here again is India.
So Carola,
uh,
as I mentioned to it,

305
00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.500
they're very poor.
Carol is a very poor state in India,
one of the poorest,

306
00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:12.570
but they had a communist government for long time and very that a,
a matriarchal,

307
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:17.550
their traditional system was matrix,
not matriarchal,
matrilineal.

308
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:20.840
So women have more power for a lot of reasons.
Uh,

309
00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:25.850
Carola has been doing very good on social indicators of social progress and look

310
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:26.670
at it.

311
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:31.670
This is child mortality from zero to five through the first five years here and

312
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:39.810
males six,
uh,
six per thousand,

313
00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.920
uh,
Maldef,
4.5 females,

314
00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:47.010
very low desk.
Compare that to Bihar.

315
00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:52.410
A very poor state where 50 or 60 up to 70,

316
00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:56.010
almost deaths.
It's a factor of,

317
00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:58.690
of of 10 or 15 for females.

318
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:04.020
The difference between our different states in India and the same thing,

319
00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.990
uh,
in China.
Here is,
uh,

320
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:12.970
sorry,
why did I ah,
what I want,

321
00:21:12.971 --> 00:21:17.971
what I wanted to show you about that slide was,

322
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.230
well forget it for a moment.

323
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:27.250
This is China and you have again,
very different.
This is sex ratio at birth,

324
00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.390
SRB,
sex ratio at birth and over different periods of time,

325
00:21:31.391 --> 00:21:33.670
1980 to 90 and so forth.

326
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:38.860
Those are between the green,
which is a normal ratio,

327
00:21:38.861 --> 00:21:42.490
even bias toward females.
This is almost within the normal range.

328
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:46.780
This would be biased toward females and uh,
Tibet,

329
00:21:46.781 --> 00:21:50.920
the far western provinces,
uh,
are,
are,

330
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:53.500
are either normal or even bias toward females.

331
00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.370
And that is a cultural difference because you have,

332
00:21:57.371 --> 00:22:01.750
these are Muslim provinces in the Qur'an forbids the killing of daughters.

333
00:22:01.751 --> 00:22:05.770
So Muslim countries in general do not have this,

334
00:22:05.771 --> 00:22:09.670
these very skewed sex ratios to bed of course is Buddhist.

335
00:22:09.671 --> 00:22:14.560
And they also don't do this.
But in the hon regions,
the heartland of China,

336
00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:19.370
especially around 2000 2005,
you know,
very high ratio,

337
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:23.290
120 to 138 and change,

338
00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.260
it's changing a little bit slowly.
So as time goes on,

339
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:30.520
we see they go from uh,
the 112 that we talked about,

340
00:22:30.521 --> 00:22:31.720
the blue regions,

341
00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:37.020
they are being disappearing and you're getting more extreme situation here in

342
00:22:37.061 --> 00:22:40.780
China.
So again,
you can pick out,

343
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.140
depending on if,
if,

344
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:46.540
if you look at [inaudible] more culturally homogeneous regions,

345
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.920
you get either very low numbers,
are very high numbers.

346
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:52.923
Uh,

347
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:57.850
now here's another thing which I mentioned.

348
00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:02.260
It depends terribly much on parody how many children they already have.

349
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.050
So for a first birth,
uh,

350
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:09.910
this is as China and the going out to the year 2000.
And this is the deal.

351
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.460
This is a parody here.
And this is,
uh,

352
00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:17.650
the different censuses.
So the latest census,

353
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.900
2005,

354
00:23:19.901 --> 00:23:23.470
I think is this census here.

355
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:27.910
And for first birth it's,
it's one oh seven.

356
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.580
It's pretty normal,
little bit elevated,

357
00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:34.870
but by second birth it goes in enormously up.

358
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:39.460
And you're into like one 40 or a prior census,
one 50.

359
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.140
So a 50% difference in boys and girls.
And that it's extreme.

360
00:23:44.141 --> 00:23:48.050
There is the one child policy is,
is pushing that because they're only allowed,

361
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.950
we'll talk a lot about that.
And this is not really true anymore,

362
00:23:51.951 --> 00:23:56.120
but in principle they are allowed only one child to get these various high

363
00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.560
ratios here.
And then by three children,
four or five children,

364
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:05.060
uh,
the,
the sex ratio is,
is,
is enormous.

365
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:09.680
And you may sort of have a little thing in your mind,
wait a minute,

366
00:24:09.681 --> 00:24:13.910
one child policy and here they have one child and having to child and having

367
00:24:13.911 --> 00:24:16.400
three children,
having four children,
there were five children.

368
00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:20.540
You know what's going on.
And we're going to talk about that.

369
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:24.140
So here is,
and again,
you don't want to,

370
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.670
you don't want to nail this too hard to the one child policy,
uh,

371
00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:32.540
because here is South Korea.
And uh,
again,

372
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:36.950
this is an old time,
but look what it goes up to.
The same thing.

373
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:41.210
So you look at the most recent numbers on this graph and for first birth,

374
00:24:41.211 --> 00:24:45.470
it's a quite a normal ratio.
Second birth that gets bigger by third birth,

375
00:24:45.471 --> 00:24:49.550
it's bigger than anything we see in China and by fourth birth it's way,

376
00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:54.551
way over 237 and we saw what about one 60 or something in China would have on

377
00:24:55.011 --> 00:24:58.550
the previous slide.
So again,
Korea,
no one child policy,

378
00:24:58.551 --> 00:25:01.040
no government control of fertility at all.

379
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:05.240
And yet they are more extreme than China.

380
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:07.603
<v 1>MMM.</v>

381
00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:16.260
<v 0>At birth.
Um,
at birth,</v>

382
00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.050
the,
the genetic factors.
So,

383
00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:20.483
<v 1>uh,</v>

384
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:27.500
<v 0>boys have an x and a y chromosome and girls have two x's humans as well as every</v>

385
00:25:27.691 --> 00:25:31.500
other animal carry a lot of deleterious or even lethal mutations.

386
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.540
But you have them on only one chromosome.

387
00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:38.010
The other chromosome will have a note in general will have a normal copy of the

388
00:25:38.011 --> 00:25:38.844
gene.

389
00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:44.060
And for almost every gene one normal chromosome makes enough of the proper

390
00:25:44.101 --> 00:25:45.960
protein and you're live,
you're fine.

391
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:49.320
You don't even notice that you've got this deleterious mutations.

392
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:53.490
So it's only when you get a mutation from both parents that it becomes a week.

393
00:25:53.491 --> 00:25:56.490
Cause the homozygous,
you're getting the Delta a bat,

394
00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.200
a deleterious mutation of both parents,

395
00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:03.440
then the person is sick that works for all the chromosomes except for the sex

396
00:26:03.511 --> 00:26:07.710
chromosome.
So a female has two xs,
so this still holds for her.

397
00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:12.600
She's got to be really unlucky and get bad copies from both mother and father.

398
00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.620
But a male has one acts in the why with almost nothing on it.

399
00:26:16.890 --> 00:26:21.090
So if he gets a bad ex,
he's sick.
So males are weaker.

400
00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:22.950
And one of the,

401
00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:28.640
the thoughts about why 106 males are born for every hundred females is that as

402
00:26:29.161 --> 00:26:30.240
time goes on,

403
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.310
those males die during childhood because they are genetically weaker and

404
00:26:35.311 --> 00:26:37.590
eventually it evens out to a hundred a hundred.

405
00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:42.210
And there's good evolutionary reasons why evolution pushes a sexually

406
00:26:42.211 --> 00:26:45.570
reproducing species,
a hundred males and a hundred females.

407
00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:50.220
We can go into that later perhaps.
So you're seeing that this is at at birth,

408
00:26:50.221 --> 00:26:55.020
right around birth,
which is still a genetic reasons and this is all of India.

409
00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.400
You see that now the male deaths are higher than the females.

410
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.380
This is a sign of the genetic weakness of males,
uh,
at birth.

411
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:08.460
And when you break that down by state,
every single state,
uh,

412
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:12.450
54 to 40,
there's more male death,
71 to 68.

413
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.610
So what do we have?
Uh,

414
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:20.510
one of the Punjab which had high pro male ratio,

415
00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.970
but at birth there is more male death than female.
That,
so that's,

416
00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.380
that's a biological phenomenon that continues.

417
00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:42.680
But if you look,
uh,

418
00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:48.100
later to child mortality,
now we're,
we're,
we're done with the birth mortality,

419
00:27:48.101 --> 00:27:49.840
we're done with sex,
selective abortion,

420
00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.360
the sex selective abortion itself changes the sex ratio.

421
00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:58.960
But then even after that,
the sex ratio keeps changing.

422
00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.960
So here again is in the first five years after birth.

423
00:28:02.410 --> 00:28:07.240
And notice again in Kerala where they don't have this sex selective,

424
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:12.190
this sex choice.
And I've showed you this,
uh,
more males than females.

425
00:28:12.191 --> 00:28:16.660
That's again the normal biological issue.
But in every other state,

426
00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:21.320
females are,
this is two and a half times as much.
This is four,

427
00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:24.430
four times as much female mortality.

428
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:27.940
A one and a half times as much,
more than twice as much,

429
00:28:27.941 --> 00:28:31.300
twice as much a half again as much.

430
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:35.440
Then in all the states of India,
with the exception of Carola,

431
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:39.280
there's an excess female mortality after birth.

432
00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:41.590
That's counter biological.

433
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:45.220
And what that is is basically some infanticide,

434
00:28:45.221 --> 00:28:49.690
but largely female neglect.
They get less food,
they get less good food,

435
00:28:49.691 --> 00:28:54.190
they get sick,
they get taken to the doctor less often if medicines are required,

436
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.720
they don't get it very well.

437
00:28:55.900 --> 00:29:00.670
So you see this after birth reduction in females,

438
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.040
uh,
also the problem just keeps,
keeps happening.

439
00:29:06.740 --> 00:29:07.573
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

440
00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:16.930
<v 0>So this issue of the loss of females in the population is a very large</v>

441
00:29:19.221 --> 00:29:22.250
phenomenon.
Statistics.
Well,

442
00:29:22.251 --> 00:29:26.480
from this data you can make fairly decent statistics for places where this is

443
00:29:26.481 --> 00:29:27.950
collected.
So in India alone,

444
00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:31.580
there's supposed to be something like 23 million women missing.

445
00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:36.670
So add all this up new and you're 22 men in the world.
They're the,

446
00:29:36.671 --> 00:29:40.880
the somewhere between an estimate and the guest mint is 100 million missing

447
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:46.330
women.
And you could say,

448
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.240
you know,
when you look deeper and more deeply for the rain,
we've had,

449
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:53.920
we have the sort of the proximate cause people are using,
uh,
sex,

450
00:29:53.921 --> 00:29:54.790
selective abortion.

451
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.920
But we haven't touched much on the question of why do they want to want to do

452
00:29:59.921 --> 00:30:03.010
that.
And you can just say it's traditional.
And,

453
00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.890
and I hear a lot of discussions that say that,
and this is true.

454
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:10.360
In India's first national census,
which is 1871,

455
00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.520
there were 98 million males,

456
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:17.521
but only 91 and a half million females already 6% of the females were missing.

457
00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:22.270
Whereas in an a population which doesn't discriminate against females,

458
00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:26.410
males being weaker all during the ages there get to be more and more females.

459
00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:31.060
And with the older agents,
extreme excess of females.
But in India,

460
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.560
really in 1871,

461
00:30:32.561 --> 00:30:36.460
that was quite a difference in China.

462
00:30:36.461 --> 00:30:40.480
This is a Chinese book of travels from the 19th century.

463
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:43.990
And someone,
a Chinese person went to India,

464
00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:48.380
went to England and observe things and came back and wrote a travel book,
uh,

465
00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.360
for the Chinese.

466
00:30:49.361 --> 00:30:54.100
And this is a quote from that England is so short if inhabitants that the

467
00:30:54.101 --> 00:30:56.890
English rare rear every child that is born,

468
00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:01.210
even prostitutes who bear children do not destroy them.

469
00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:05.980
So that England was the dominant power of the world.
And uh,
they were,

470
00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:08.420
they were invading China with the opium wars.

471
00:31:08.421 --> 00:31:12.070
So of course everybody including the emperor was interested in what is England

472
00:31:12.071 --> 00:31:16.030
like,
how come they're so powerful?
What's different there?
And the,

473
00:31:16.031 --> 00:31:18.410
so the emperor read this and the emperor,

474
00:31:18.411 --> 00:31:21.820
his response was he didn't believe that the English were so stupid.

475
00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.770
So again,
the cultural thing that,
that,
you know,

476
00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:29.620
to raise up all the children and especially the raise up all the girls is just,

477
00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.900
uh,
not going,
uh,

478
00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.080
in your reading packet.

479
00:31:35.081 --> 00:31:40.081
It discusses a villages in India dating back to 1830 that have no girls at all.

480
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.230
They just do way with all the girls.
All of them are,
aren't killed.

481
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:50.080
1921,
a Somerset mom,
does that ring name and name,

482
00:31:50.081 --> 00:31:53.680
ring any bells?
Uh,
uh,
he was a famous author,
wrote a lot of novels,

483
00:31:53.681 --> 00:31:57.940
a lot of movies with very famous movie starts,
very popular author.

484
00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.020
1921,

485
00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:04.200
he was touring China and he came upon a little tower on a Chinese hillside with

486
00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.940
a single small hole in the wall.

487
00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.770
So they're walking along and there's those small tower,

488
00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:13.750
a little hole in the wall and out of that whole camera,
nausea and odor.

489
00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:18.610
And uh,
he asked,
he was with the Chinese guy and he asked him,

490
00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:23.650
what is that?
And you know,
he thought maybe vcs dumped there something.
No,

491
00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:28.651
it turns out it was a baby tower and it was just a pit dug into the ground and

492
00:32:29.171 --> 00:32:33.670
surrounded with this tower and people brought excess of girls especially,

493
00:32:33.671 --> 00:32:38.671
but some occasionally board and just dump them into this little boy came and

494
00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:43.610
explained this to him and said that the blue boy said the four babies were

495
00:32:43.611 --> 00:32:46.310
thrown in at that that morning.
This doesn't,

496
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:49.640
this particular passage and discuss the sex of the babies cause he didn't know

497
00:32:49.641 --> 00:32:53.570
that there to re in there.
Uh,

498
00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:58.630
and one of the quotes is the female child is regarded as a liability here in

499
00:32:59.031 --> 00:33:01.700
rural areas.
Women are not even considered people.

500
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:06.620
And you'll do some reading where,
uh,
rather bias reading,

501
00:33:06.621 --> 00:33:10.060
but accurate on this that,
uh,
you know,

502
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:13.790
girls often don't get names and traditionally their name,
daughter number one,

503
00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:17.870
door number two,
door number three,
and all kinds of things.

504
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:20.720
So as I've mentioned,

505
00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:25.780
the elimination of females is not limited to the young and a in one of your

506
00:33:27.021 --> 00:33:28.890
readings or,
right.

507
00:33:29.050 --> 00:33:34.050
And I guess I described it to the tribe in New Guinea where if a male died,

508
00:33:34.281 --> 00:33:36.680
his widow was immediately strangled.
Do you remember that?

509
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:40.000
That changes the sex ratio?
Uh,

510
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.960
in India he heard about this there,

511
00:33:42.961 --> 00:33:46.310
there used to be a very into this practice called Sati.

512
00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:51.380
You heard a saute or sateen sometimes where the wife throws herself on the

513
00:33:51.381 --> 00:33:55.640
funeral pyre of the man or in some other way does away with herself.

514
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:59.120
So this is from 1813 quite some time back.

515
00:33:59.121 --> 00:34:03.080
And as a British captain named camp who's eyewitness to one of these things and

516
00:34:03.081 --> 00:34:07.220
he wrote,
uh,
a description of it,
these phenomena,

517
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:12.080
a male had been sick a short time and the astrologer said that he was on the

518
00:34:12.081 --> 00:34:16.730
point of death and so he was taken down to the side of the holy Ganges River to

519
00:34:16.731 --> 00:34:17.564
expire.

520
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:22.820
He was immersed to his waste in the river for some time,
but he didn't die.

521
00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:27.110
They brought him back to the bay,
to the Bank of the river and let him broil in.

522
00:34:27.111 --> 00:34:31.250
The son didn't die.
Then they put it back in the river again.

523
00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:36.140
He didn't die.
He's returned to the bank.
This kept going for 36 hours,

524
00:34:36.141 --> 00:34:40.880
alternate sort of freezing and baking and finally this sick guy died.

525
00:34:40.881 --> 00:34:44.740
Whether he would or would not have died anyway,
who knows the newest,

526
00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:49.640
the astrologers word that he was going to die.
His wife,
he was married,

527
00:34:49.641 --> 00:34:53.510
was a healthy young girl of about 16 learning.

528
00:34:53.511 --> 00:34:54.710
If her husband's death,

529
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:59.770
she decided to be buried alive with his corpse to British officer.

530
00:34:59.871 --> 00:35:03.350
This camp tried in vain to persuade the girl not to do it.

531
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.120
Then tried to persuade the mother.
Uh,

532
00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.700
and he said that that a resolution of this type to just kill yourself was a kind

533
00:35:10.701 --> 00:35:11.600
of madness.

534
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:16.100
But he had no success and he encountered not the slightest sign of either

535
00:35:16.101 --> 00:35:20.450
hesitation or a great regret on either the girls part or the mother's part.

536
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:24.710
So the actual scene takes place.

537
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:29.840
The young widow accompanied by her friends proceeded to the beach where his body

538
00:35:29.841 --> 00:35:33.650
lay.
He was placed in a grave about six feet deep.

539
00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:38.700
The wife circled the grave seven times calling out hail God.

540
00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:43.770
Hell God.
The surrounding crowd echoed her chant.
Hell God,
Heal God.

541
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:47.190
She climbed into the grave,
the captain,

542
00:35:47.191 --> 00:35:51.780
this British guy moved up to within a foot of the grave to see if at the last

543
00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.730
minute she showed any signs of reluctance,

544
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:56.970
whether her relative showed any sign of of horror.

545
00:35:57.270 --> 00:36:00.030
And if you sold reluctancy might've jumped in and pulled her out.

546
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:04.980
She placed yourself in the sitting posture as her husband had been placed in

547
00:36:04.981 --> 00:36:08.190
laying flat,
but a sitting posture both faced north.

548
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:13.080
So she was sitting behind his back.
She embraced the corpse with her left hand.

549
00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:15.420
And reclined her head on his shoulder.

550
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:19.380
The British officers still saw no sign of regret on her part.

551
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:22.140
The other plan other hand,

552
00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.410
she placed over her head with her four finger re erect,

553
00:36:25.411 --> 00:36:27.540
which she moved in a circular direction.

554
00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:34.070
The watchers then started throwing earth on them and to start burying them.

555
00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:38.910
And,
and then other men as,
as the earth was put in,

556
00:36:38.911 --> 00:36:41.580
they stamped on the earth to pack it down.

557
00:36:41.790 --> 00:36:46.470
But she continued circling her hand until her head was completely buried.

558
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:50.910
And then she kept going for some time after that and finally stopped.

559
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.620
The earth was piled on and stamped down and it was two or three feet above the

560
00:36:55.621 --> 00:36:58.060
heads of the in tuned.

561
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.050
No tear was shed by any of the relations.

562
00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:05.700
Eventually the crowd dispersed and the ritual imitations and howling commenced,

563
00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:06.960
but without sorrow.

564
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:11.570
So this is a long time ago and it's,
uh,

565
00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:16.650
it's,
it's certainly extremely rare now if it happens at all.

566
00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:21.930
There was one report of one woman in a village about 10 years ago who did it.

567
00:37:21.931 --> 00:37:24.060
And you know,
this is illegal in India.

568
00:37:24.061 --> 00:37:28.530
So very hard to get any decent statistics on it.
But very rarely it happens.

569
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:34.110
And this woman who killed herself on her husband Pyre was considered a paragon

570
00:37:34.111 --> 00:37:38.240
of virtue and sort of like a saint because she was following the old,
uh,

571
00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:42.120
religious customs and the village was very happy about it cause they got a lot

572
00:37:42.121 --> 00:37:46.770
of tourists to come and revere this saint like a lady and made a lot of money

573
00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:51.690
off the tourists.
But it's very rare.

574
00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:58.130
Uh,
uh,
and of course this whole sex preference businesses,

575
00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:00.120
not in any sense,
limited to Asia.

576
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.450
Hispanic women in Los Angeles were surveyed.

577
00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:08.690
They want 2.8 sons on average in 0.1 gorders a factor of 28 difference that's

578
00:38:11.210 --> 00:38:13.860
uh,
in Kuwait before the Gulf War.

579
00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:18.900
This is the 1991 more I think.
Uh,
Barbara Walters,

580
00:38:18.901 --> 00:38:22.950
who you all know did a story on,
on,
uh,
gender roles in Kuwait.
Yes.

581
00:38:22.951 --> 00:38:23.641
During the Gulf War.

582
00:38:23.641 --> 00:38:28.641
She was there and she noted that women customarily walk about 10 feet behind

583
00:38:28.741 --> 00:38:31.920
their husbands.
And this is,
it happens in a lot of places,

584
00:38:31.921 --> 00:38:35.070
in a strong sign of female deference and dependence.

585
00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:39.370
The husband walks without the wife and the wife follows 10 feet behind.
You've,

586
00:38:39.371 --> 00:38:43.960
you've heard of that customer.
So the war takes place.
Uh,

587
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:49.180
uh,
the,
the co the Iraqis get beat and she comes back to Kuwait,
uh,

588
00:38:49.181 --> 00:38:51.250
to do another story after the war.

589
00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:55.010
And she was so pleased because now the,
the,

590
00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:59.110
the men walked behind the wives that the women were walking in front.

591
00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:02.650
And so Barb Walthill all this is wonderful progress.
This is the American,

592
00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.650
you know,
they're,
they're catching on over there.

593
00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:08.590
And so she approached one of the woman and said,

594
00:39:08.591 --> 00:39:12.100
and then the camera was rolling to catch this,
you know,
she's a TV personality.

595
00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:14.320
This is marvelous.
As Barbara Walters.

596
00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:19.590
Can you tell the free world just what enabled women to achieve this reversal of

597
00:39:19.601 --> 00:39:24.490
roles?
And the Kuwaiti woman said land mines.

598
00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:31.580
And so it wasn't a reversal at all.
Uh,

599
00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:33.723
all right.

600
00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.140
I think you'll get the idea of all of this.

601
00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:43.270
Um,
we,

602
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:45.640
the,
there's deeper reasons.
I mean,
again,

603
00:39:45.670 --> 00:39:48.280
one way is to put it down to Asian tradition.

604
00:39:48.281 --> 00:39:52.170
And that's not really any kind of an explanation.
Uh,

605
00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:55.840
we like to think that people are rational around the world and that there's some

606
00:39:55.841 --> 00:39:57.940
more,
more fundamental reason for it.

607
00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.970
And a lot of the reasons that you all said,

608
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:04.210
what are some of the extra reasons that I sort of pushed aside for the moment.

609
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:09.460
One was dowery issues and some of you said some other things,

610
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:14.270
but there's a whole lot of things.
And the basic story is that,
uh,

611
00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:17.650
in certainly in India and also in traditional China,

612
00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:20.800
the girl is brought up by the parents.

613
00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:24.760
It gets married at quite a young age and by young teenage,
uh,

614
00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:28.630
they get married and get shipped off to the sun.

615
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:33.690
The husband's family where she works is then counted in that family and has

616
00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:37.120
worked,
usually worked very hard and a servant,

617
00:40:37.121 --> 00:40:38.950
basically a servant in that family.

618
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:43.620
So the family that raises her has the problem of,
of,
uh,

619
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:48.890
investing in that girl putting a lot of money to raise that girl.
Then justice,

620
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:52.500
she's able to start working seriously and maybe return some labor,

621
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:56.200
some serious labor or some money to the parents.

622
00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.040
She's gone and she works for some other family.

623
00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:03.760
And so this is economically a very bad thing.
And the,

624
00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.820
the people called raising girls like watering someone else's garden.

625
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:12.160
And then on top of that,
when the dowery system is as strong,

626
00:41:12.161 --> 00:41:16.510
which it is an Indian going crazy a minute marriage,

627
00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.900
they have to provide a lot of money and this can go up and to be like a year's

628
00:41:19.901 --> 00:41:24.640
income,
uh,
easily to,
to,
to,
to,
to get the girl married.

629
00:41:24.640 --> 00:41:26.410
And it's great honor thing.
If you have a daughter,

630
00:41:26.411 --> 00:41:29.950
you have to get her marriage so you have to pay dowry or your family's honor.

631
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:33.020
It goes away.
So,
uh,

632
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:38.290
this idea that the girl was his is just passed away at the adjusted the time she

633
00:41:39.561 --> 00:41:40.394
can be a value to.

634
00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:44.450
It's kind of the rational actor theory of why this all this female

635
00:41:44.451 --> 00:41:49.130
discrimination,
anything strike you unexplained about that.

636
00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:55.780
Why is it that it's the girl that that goes away all the time?

637
00:41:56.511 --> 00:42:00.590
Why can't the man go away?
This is by the way,
characteristic of human societies.

638
00:42:00.591 --> 00:42:05.591
I may have mentioned this to a timeline to genetics shows when that males in a

639
00:42:06.441 --> 00:42:07.400
village or related,

640
00:42:07.401 --> 00:42:12.350
they've stayed there for hundreds of thousands of years and females move,

641
00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:15.020
move out.
So x Aga,
me,

642
00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:20.060
and where have you seen Exxon gummy before among the chimpanzees where the

643
00:42:20.061 --> 00:42:22.910
females go out.
And so as far as we can tell,

644
00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:28.240
this is a vestige from our very original biological roots where our reproductive

645
00:42:28.551 --> 00:42:29.750
system requires,

646
00:42:29.751 --> 00:42:33.560
not that the males fight each other and the males disperse,

647
00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:38.860
but that the males stay together in a military situation and the females,

648
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:40.790
uh,
go out.

649
00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:44.750
And so it's this very basic form of a,

650
00:42:44.751 --> 00:42:48.740
you can call a chimpanzee social organization that leads to that the females go

651
00:42:48.741 --> 00:42:51.980
out and therefore the females are of no value to the family that brings them up

652
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.860
and therefore they're discriminated against.

653
00:42:55.280 --> 00:43:00.280
The men stay together and they have to have a protective protect the village

654
00:43:01.251 --> 00:43:04.310
against violence.
In some places there's a,
there's a,
a,

655
00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.910
either a tribe or a cast as you'd call it in India than I,
ours,

656
00:43:07.911 --> 00:43:11.960
which are very military kind of cast.
What haven't they get married very young.

657
00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:16.580
But then the man may or may not like spend one night with the wife and then he

658
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:21.560
goes off to the military and meanwhile the wife has all kinds of sexual

659
00:43:21.561 --> 00:43:23.810
relationships and it's quite formalized,
quite legal day.

660
00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.810
The women live in one big house.
They don't really recognize it's a,

661
00:43:26.811 --> 00:43:31.520
it's like the nod that you read about it.
It's a female lineage society.

662
00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:36.260
And then upperclassmen are invited in to sleep with these women and produce

663
00:43:36.261 --> 00:43:40.430
babies for them.
And then the men have 15 or 20 years of military service.

664
00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:44.410
Then they come home.
And only really at that time do they pick up,
uh,

665
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:47.270
the marriage.
And so again,

666
00:43:47.271 --> 00:43:51.920
it's very clear in this particular cultural manifestation,

667
00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:56.450
it's very clear thing that women are,
the reproducers men are the military ones.

668
00:43:56.690 --> 00:44:01.370
And as in chimpanzees sort of a communal sexuality that WHO's the biological

669
00:44:01.371 --> 00:44:05.210
father is not a particularly important.

670
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.963
Okay.

671
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:17.330
Now I want to switch gears here.
And in the time we have left,

672
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:21.700
and we were telling this whole lecture was about South Asia and South Asia and

673
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.100
East Asia are the centers of female disadvantage,

674
00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:29.300
but that doesn't go on in all of South Asia as I've mentioned in Muslim

675
00:44:29.301 --> 00:44:33.690
countries,
that basically does not happen.
So we're going to talk next about,
uh,

676
00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:38.280
uh,
two places.
One is Iowa and the other,

677
00:44:38.281 --> 00:44:42.360
I'll tell you in a,
in a moment.
And uh,

678
00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.950
so I was a rich place,
right?
What does Iowa rich from

679
00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:53.930
agriculture.
Corn,
so very,
very fertile place.
Well,

680
00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:59.370
let me go,
go back a little bit.
So I will tell you the country don't,

681
00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:00.500
I'm going to talk about

682
00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.880
<v 1>if I can find it.
Oh,
okay.</v>

683
00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:05.650
<v 0>Again,</v>

684
00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:10.650
we worry a lot and have induced some of the Asians to worry about the sex ratio

685
00:45:10.841 --> 00:45:13.630
that all these men won't get married.
But remember,

686
00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:18.370
we're seeing sex ratio disturbances of of 12 to 20%.

687
00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:22.000
And Remember in Europe I showed you this slide that a lot of places,

688
00:45:22.001 --> 00:45:25.750
only 30% or 40 or 50% of people got married.

689
00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:29.200
So the marriage imbalance,
uh,
is much,

690
00:45:29.201 --> 00:45:33.430
was much more severe in Europe for hundreds of years than it is now in Asia.

691
00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:38.230
So the marriage pattern and the social system in,
in Europe,
uh,

692
00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:43.330
made for more extreme situation.
Then,
uh,
the female disadvantage in Asia.

693
00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:45.070
Okay.
There's not a great slide,

694
00:45:45.071 --> 00:45:48.980
but this is Bangladesh and what's in here in Bangladesh?

695
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:53.530
Is it since this is the Himalaya Mountains and here is China,
Nepal,

696
00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.390
Bangladesh over here,
India over here.

697
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:59.450
And this is blown up a little bit and what you see is,
this is the,

698
00:45:59.451 --> 00:46:04.451
the Bay of Bengal here is that the Ganges river comes out of the Himalayas.

699
00:46:04.540 --> 00:46:09.220
The MLA has stretch all across here.
The Ganges comes out of the,
the,

700
00:46:09.221 --> 00:46:10.540
the western Himalayas.

701
00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:14.230
The Brahmaputra comes out of the eastern Himalayas.

702
00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:19.390
Bangladesh has lots of water and this is all delta.
You see this stuff,

703
00:46:19.391 --> 00:46:24.280
this is all delta from has through geological time.
As the river wanders around,

704
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:29.670
it puts down a delta out here and this is what the Delta actually looks like.

705
00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:33.700
There's a reading that you have,

706
00:46:33.701 --> 00:46:37.150
which says that the place is so good that people are trying to move out and move

707
00:46:37.151 --> 00:46:40.990
out onto this land and try to farm on it.

708
00:46:40.991 --> 00:46:42.790
And then of course a monsoon comes to the river,

709
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:47.020
the water rises and they're wiped out.
You'll have a reading about that.

710
00:46:47.021 --> 00:46:51.130
But keep this picture in mind when you do that reading.

711
00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:56.140
So now let's,
let's do the,
this story on,
on,
on the agriculture.

712
00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:01.420
So,
uh,
the people in Bangladesh are Bengalis,
uh,
of course.

713
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:06.510
And the Bengalis are a large group that are split actually between Bangladesh

714
00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:12.370
and,
uh,
eastern or northeastern,
part of part of India.

715
00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:16.680
Oh,
Yo.
Rich Calcutta is the capital.
Dhaka is the capital in,

716
00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:21.690
in Bangladesh and Calcutta is a capital Westbank on which is part of India.

717
00:47:21.731 --> 00:47:25.540
So partition,
split Bengalis into two groups.
Uh,

718
00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:30.550
Bangladesh is a very homogeneous country between Pakistan,
India,

719
00:47:30.551 --> 00:47:33.550
and Bangladesh.
The three ones,
or the old British Raj,

720
00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:38.170
98% of them are Bengalis.
So they speak the same language,

721
00:47:38.171 --> 00:47:41.980
have the same cultural tradition.
In 88% are Muslim.

722
00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.070
So unlike India,
which you cannot talk about as a whole,

723
00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:48.490
you can really talk about Bangladesh as,
as a whole.

724
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:52.660
Bengal is a very rich part of the world.
Uh,

725
00:47:53.140 --> 00:47:55.120
the moguls who ruled from the 13.

726
00:47:55.121 --> 00:47:59.350
So the mobiles were Muslim invaders from apparently I think from Afghanistan.

727
00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:04.870
Uh,
Concord,
north,
north India,
north of that part.

728
00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.780
And they ruled it from the 13th century onward.

729
00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:13.530
They called Bangov the paradise of nations in the 16th century when European

730
00:48:14.621 --> 00:48:15.610
traders came,

731
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:20.130
they were ecstatic over bangles abundance and enriches.

732
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:24.850
Uh,
so why was it so rich?

733
00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:29.990
And you have to,
for that,
I want to compare it to Iowa.
The uh,

734
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:33.730
size of Bangladesh.
It's fifth 56,000 square miles.

735
00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:38.830
It guess what the size of Iowa is?
56,000 square miles.

736
00:48:38.831 --> 00:48:41.110
So they're,
they're very close to the same size.

737
00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.840
Both are very basically agricultural.

738
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:47.830
Maytag makes washing machines are used to in Iowa,

739
00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.290
but they're very heavily agricultural.

740
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:54.640
But Bangladesh has a much better climate than Iowa.

741
00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:57.130
They grow three crops a year in Bangladesh.

742
00:48:57.131 --> 00:49:01.030
It's nice and warm there all the time.
But Poor Iowa,

743
00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:05.350
anybody from Iowa here,
they can only grow one crop a year.

744
00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:09.770
They grow winter wheat some,
but basically it's one crop a year.
Ben Gall,

745
00:49:09.771 --> 00:49:13.270
they can grow three crops a year.
Uh,

746
00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:18.020
Bangladesh has plenty of water.
I showed you.
They have nothing but water there.

747
00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:22.250
So they're,
they,
they never,
they never have droughts.
And,
uh,

748
00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:24.860
I was not bad for that.

749
00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:28.540
And it has Mississippi River on one side than Nebraska River on the other side.

750
00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:32.560
Uh,
but inside I where the rivers are all very small.

751
00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.320
So we go to the edges.
There's rivers has been inside,

752
00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:40.650
not a huge amount of rivers and they sometimes have droughts there.

753
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:45.300
Uh,
both are fertile.
Bangladesh,

754
00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:47.140
which shows a low Illumio plane.

755
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:50.660
So the way land gets naturally fertilizes water,
rush,

756
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:52.600
glaciers in the mountaintop grind,

757
00:49:52.601 --> 00:49:57.370
the rock and that glacier flowers,
it's called,
gets into the river,

758
00:49:57.371 --> 00:49:58.480
dissolve somewhat in river.

759
00:49:58.630 --> 00:50:02.650
And during flood season it spreads all this silt over the farm land.

760
00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:06.400
And that's silt.
The minerals in the rock are the fertilizer.

761
00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:09.010
So Bangladesh has this,
this,
uh,

762
00:50:09.070 --> 00:50:12.700
floods from the Himalayas that covered basically the whole country.

763
00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:14.890
And it gets it's fertilizer for free,

764
00:50:14.891 --> 00:50:19.310
gets lot of fertilizer and it gets it all for free.
So again,
the agriculture is,

765
00:50:19.350 --> 00:50:21.870
is looking real good.
Uh,

766
00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:26.300
but Iowa does not get this except at the margins when the Mississippi,
uh,

767
00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:29.660
floods and sometimes the Nebraska floods,
so the interior of the country,

768
00:50:29.661 --> 00:50:32.750
they have to go and buy fertilizer there.

769
00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:37.730
So by all these geographical kind of considerations and climatic kind of

770
00:50:37.731 --> 00:50:39.120
considerations,
uh,

771
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:43.340
Bangladesh should be much richer than Iowa and you compare to three crops a year

772
00:50:43.341 --> 00:50:47.540
to one crop and you know,
something like three times as rich.

773
00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:53.180
But Bangladesh is per capita income.

774
00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:59.030
I was incoming 17 times larger than,
than Bangladesh's.

775
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:04.990
And the difference is basically all population I was population is 2.9 million.

776
00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:11.750
Bangladesh is now about 140 million,

777
00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:14.500
so it's like 40 times a difference.

778
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:18.130
Bangladesh is 40 times as much population as,

779
00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:22.550
as Iowa and compared to every other place in the world.

780
00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:26.580
Here are a variety of places.
Uh,

781
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:30.710
here's Bangladesh way,
way out in front of everybody else.

782
00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:34.730
Netherlands is considered,
you know,
of,
of,
of other places.

783
00:51:34.731 --> 00:51:38.990
The next most common placement is also an agricultural place,

784
00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:42.650
but per both these have,

785
00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:44.510
they don't have big mountains for deserts or anything.

786
00:51:44.511 --> 00:51:48.530
So all the Netherlands is basically fertile and all of Bangladesh has basically

787
00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:49.150
fertile.

788
00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:54.150
But look at the difference in population and density and everybody else is less

789
00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:59.330
than either of those two places.
So,

790
00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:03.530
and as you know,
uh,
as I've just mentioned,
the,

791
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:06.650
the income in Bangladesh is distressingly poor.

792
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:09.950
It's one of the poorest countries in the world.

793
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:14.990
And the estimates are that it's population may double before if and when

794
00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:17.030
stabilizing.
So things are,

795
00:52:17.031 --> 00:52:21.380
it's going to be very hard to make things better in Bangladesh.

796
00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:25.300
Well,
going back,
uh,

797
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:30.330
Bangladesh had a stable population.
They had a kind of traditional Burkhart,

798
00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:34.040
very high birth,
very high death rates of the population,
grew very slowly,

799
00:52:34.041 --> 00:52:38.580
if at all.
But about 1880,
uh,
population started to take off.
That's when the,

800
00:52:38.581 --> 00:52:40.940
the again,
colonialism and whatnot,

801
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:45.560
the death rates started to climb and they started adding about 3 million people

802
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:48.860
every decade and sort of 3 million extra people do.

803
00:52:48.861 --> 00:52:52.880
And in a country the size of Iowa,
not,
not tiny,
but not especially big either.

804
00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:56.210
Well,
there's some jungle,
there was some jungle in Bangladesh.

805
00:52:56.211 --> 00:52:59.870
They cleared that and they started farming.
But by the late 1930s,

806
00:52:59.871 --> 00:53:02.870
the jungle was just totally gone.
No more jungle land.

807
00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:08.480
In 1938 beer and Ganguli Bengali himself wrote,
quote,

808
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:12.350
every inch of land that is fit for cultivation is already used.

809
00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:17.740
Every pathway or cattle track is pared down by farmers on either side until it

810
00:53:18.561 --> 00:53:21.970
barely leaves room for two people to pass each other on,

811
00:53:22.070 --> 00:53:25.880
on this narrow track.
Uh,

812
00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.650
so what did people do as the population kept increasing,

813
00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:33.250
they started moving out onto these mud flats that I've shown you,

814
00:53:33.251 --> 00:53:37.020
which are very temporary.
And the cyclones come in,

815
00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.060
not only is their sort of normal flooding from,
from the rivers,

816
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:45.130
the cyclones come in and you start getting these enormous death tolls in a

817
00:53:45.761 --> 00:53:50.761
period of time in Bangladesh from climatic problems.

818
00:53:51.191 --> 00:53:52.930
But it was really,
again,
a population problem,

819
00:53:52.931 --> 00:53:54.490
just like the deserts that I told you about.

820
00:53:54.670 --> 00:53:58.120
People shouldn't be living on these slats where they're going to be wiped out.

821
00:53:58.380 --> 00:53:59.680
Uh,
periodically,

822
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:02.023
<v 1>uh,</v>

823
00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:07.270
<v 0>there was a for a while,
almost a hundred thousand deaths a year from storms,</v>

824
00:54:07.271 --> 00:54:09.610
erosion and flooding from these kind of just,

825
00:54:09.850 --> 00:54:12.940
just considered deaths from climatic water stuff.

826
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:19.470
And so it took about 60 years of the population increase from Bangor becoming

827
00:54:21.431 --> 00:54:26.230
on,
uh,
going from one of the rich places of,
of the world,
not industrialized,

828
00:54:26.231 --> 00:54:31.060
but rich on their agricultural produce to what we standardly described as a

829
00:54:31.061 --> 00:54:34.810
basket case.
And now all the focuses on Africa,

830
00:54:34.811 --> 00:54:36.730
but not so much longer ago.

831
00:54:36.731 --> 00:54:41.560
Bangladesh was considered justice as in bad shape,
uh,

832
00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:46.360
as Africa is now that we constantly on the news stories of disaster in

833
00:54:46.361 --> 00:54:49.630
Bangladesh and uh,

834
00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:54.670
you supposed to cry at that and,
and give money.
Um,

835
00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:58.320
so Bangladesh was clearly one of those places that was caught in the one

836
00:54:58.330 --> 00:55:00.760
[inaudible] traps,

837
00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:05.290
the arable land.

838
00:55:05.291 --> 00:55:09.130
And this is a somewhat old figuring the population of the grease delight is 0.1

839
00:55:09.131 --> 00:55:10.450
heck tear per person.

840
00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:15.180
That's a quarter of an acre of person.
Just to compare that,

841
00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:19.180
any of you from foreign places,
how many of you from foreign places every year?

842
00:55:19.181 --> 00:55:21.730
I always get it.
Get some,
do you know what,
what's the size of the,

843
00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:23.770
of the farms where you live?
Where do you live?

844
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:29.410
Outside of Cleveland.
Okay.
That's not one of the big phone,

845
00:55:29.411 --> 00:55:33.850
but do you know roughly the size of the farm?
No.
No.

846
00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:39.130
30 acres.
Okay.
So that small,
that small farms out west,

847
00:55:39.131 --> 00:55:42.910
it can be thousands of like the real commercial farms,
thousands of acres.

848
00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:47.500
And here's 0.1 hectare for president here in,
I used to live in Bethany,

849
00:55:47.501 --> 00:55:51.860
which is sort of a north west suburb of new haven.
And our house was,

850
00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:55.770
our part of Bethany was zoned for three acres and I didn't have to live off it.

851
00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:58.180
I just thought it was just a house on that.
If you had a house,

852
00:55:58.181 --> 00:55:59.440
you had to have three acres.

853
00:55:59.710 --> 00:56:04.180
So that was enough to that in Bengal and Bangol,
Bangladesh,

854
00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:09.040
30 families would live on this three acres at,
at,

855
00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:11.170
at 0.1 hectare per person.

856
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:17.230
So all of the indicators in the,
in this time starting,

857
00:56:17.231 --> 00:56:22.210
say in the 1950s or sixties,
uh,
was that,

858
00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:22.780
uh,

859
00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:27.250
Bangladesh would not be a country in which you,

860
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:32.260
where you'd find a desire to limit fertility or the practice of Dolby
limitation.

861
00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.480
It's,
it's,
it's,
as I've said,

862
00:56:34.481 --> 00:56:38.740
almost all Muslim and it's a conservative version of Islam.

863
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:41.920
Their infant and child mortality was high.

864
00:56:41.921 --> 00:56:45.250
25% of the children died before the age of five,

865
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:50.200
but that had been coming down slowly as I showed you for roughly 20 years.

866
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:54.600
Women have very low social status there.
Most of them in,
uh,

867
00:56:54.850 --> 00:56:59.390
we're subject to Purdah,
uh,
which they not only have to,
to dress,

868
00:56:59.391 --> 00:57:01.330
so they can't be seen when they're outside of the house,

869
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:06.130
but they generally couldn't go outside of the house role unless accompanied by a

870
00:57:06.131 --> 00:57:09.530
male member of the family.
And,
uh,

871
00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:14.410
men were fairly free to,
to abuse women.
And I read you the first lecture.

872
00:57:14.411 --> 00:57:18.430
I think some cases the battery acid being thrown at women in more recent times

873
00:57:18.431 --> 00:57:21.220
so that,
that still continues.

874
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:25.600
Last time you mentioned that one of the reasons that people want children is for

875
00:57:25.601 --> 00:57:28.480
old age security.
Who's going to take care of me in my old age,

876
00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:31.930
and of course Bangladesh was very poor,
had no social security system.

877
00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:36.220
So the families were across dependent on uh,
children for the old age.

878
00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:38.770
They were dependent on sons for their old age.

879
00:57:38.771 --> 00:57:40.210
So that meant you had and have a lot of children,

880
00:57:40.211 --> 00:57:41.530
make sure that it can't have a daughter.

881
00:57:41.531 --> 00:57:46.090
You've got to have sons to make sure that you have somebody to take care of you

882
00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:52.690
during the period of time.
I'm going to talk about,
uh,
Oh,

883
00:57:52.691 --> 00:57:57.670
here are some of the major disasters,
uh,
in,
in Bangladesh over time.

884
00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:00.190
So this is one really very famous one.

885
00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:04.510
The Bengal famine of 1943,
world war,
they were red.

886
00:58:04.511 --> 00:58:06.820
They were ready on the edge.

887
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:11.950
And then World War Two hits and the variety of things happen.
And uh,

888
00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:15.960
two,
uh,
two and a half million people,
this is in filed,

889
00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:19.670
two and a half million people die in the famine.
Uh,

890
00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:21.490
here's some of the cyclones,

891
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:26.050
various psych clones that a war when they were trying to get independent of west

892
00:58:26.051 --> 00:58:28.800
Pakistan,
they had a war and these things happened,

893
00:58:28.810 --> 00:58:33.430
another site clone floods or,
and so all kinds of,
uh,

894
00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:38.410
problems be set.
The country now here during this period,

895
00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:39.580
uh,
that,

896
00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:44.580
that is the critical period for population issues of the per capita GNP.

897
00:58:44.861 --> 00:58:48.970
The gross domestic product basically didn't change little bit up,

898
00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.450
but not,
not enormously.

899
00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:56.260
It's basically had a flat per capita economy per capita GDP.

900
00:58:56.261 --> 00:58:59.380
So again,
the,
the total economy was growing,

901
00:58:59.381 --> 00:59:01.330
but more and more people ate it all up.

902
00:59:01.331 --> 00:59:06.280
So basically the per capita GDP doesn't change in this period.

903
00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:09.523
<v 1>Uh,</v>

904
00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:15.340
<v 0>what,
uh,
what happened was that</v>

905
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:19.690
Malthus had been in India and the India,

906
00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:22.610
the whole Indian subcontinent paid a lot of attention.
Multiple.

907
00:59:22.611 --> 00:59:24.920
So they have been aware.
India,
Pakistan,

908
00:59:24.921 --> 00:59:29.250
Bangladesh had been aware of population issues and aware of the mouth ASEAN and

909
00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:31.310
ideas about it for a long time.

910
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:34.640
And the British of course trained they're civil servants of the countries when

911
00:59:34.641 --> 00:59:38.000
they got an independence it with the same people.
So this was in their mind.

912
00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:39.920
So in fact the South Asia,

913
00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:44.030
originally Indian Pakistan where some of the very first countries to institute

914
00:59:44.031 --> 00:59:49.031
family planning programs and then after the one in Pakistan was not particularly

915
00:59:50.811 --> 00:59:51.680
successful.

916
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:56.180
The one in India is now much better but did not start out successfully.

917
00:59:56.630 --> 01:00:01.160
But after the war of independence,
when Bangladesh split from west Pakistan,

918
01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:05.060
the government really was aware of these problems,

919
01:00:05.061 --> 01:00:10.040
how to Malthusian attitude and they really decided that they must start to get

920
01:00:10.041 --> 01:00:14.540
some control of their,
of their population.
So they,

921
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:18.710
the government supported and instituted family planning program for the whole

922
01:00:18.711 --> 01:00:22.700
country and international organization said,
okay,
you want to do this,

923
01:00:22.701 --> 01:00:23.690
we will help you.

924
01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:28.310
And especially there's a group called the international diarrheal research

925
01:00:28.311 --> 01:00:30.590
organization,
which was one of the ones that had

926
01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:36.950
discovered and pushed the oral rehydration packets.
You know,
many,

927
01:00:36.951 --> 01:00:40.940
many huge numbers of infant deaths in poor countries.

928
01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.910
Do they get diarrhea and diarrhea?
The bug doesn't kill you,

929
01:00:43.911 --> 01:00:47.240
but you lose enough water through the diarrhea that you die basically of

930
01:00:47.241 --> 01:00:50.960
dehydration.
And all you need to do is to have a little packet,

931
01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:56.120
a water salt.
And sugar.
And as long as the water is not terribly polluted,

932
01:00:56.370 --> 01:00:56.690
uh,
the,

933
01:00:56.690 --> 01:01:00.470
the child will say live and eventually kick out the virus or the bacteria.

934
01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:06.080
So it's international dire real research group,
very well respected.

935
01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.280
And they said,
okay,
we will also,
we will also help you,
uh,

936
01:01:09.281 --> 01:01:13.770
with family planning programs.
And uh,

937
01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:18.680
what resulted was a countrywide of program.

938
01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.810
Now at this same time,
we're talking the early 1970s,
most of the developed world,

939
01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:27.260
uh,
had the idea that they,

940
01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:30.620
what they say they so rich countries,
I have few children,

941
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.500
poor countries have a lot of children.
What's the cause?
Well,

942
01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:36.830
money is because when you get rich,
you want to have fewer children.

943
01:01:36.831 --> 01:01:40.070
We're going to have a lecture on that very interesting phenomenon.

944
01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:41.540
So the developing country,

945
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:45.380
a lot of developing countries and east European countries rejected the whole

946
01:01:45.381 --> 01:01:49.340
idea of family planning as a way of improving the economy and said,
no,

947
01:01:49.341 --> 01:01:52.250
development is the best contraceptive.
That was,
that was the rule.

948
01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.840
Development is the best contraceptive.

949
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:57.230
That there's no way in a poor place like Bangladesh that you're going to get

950
01:01:57.231 --> 01:02:00.740
fertility down because of all these reasons that we've mentioned.

951
01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:02.870
But if you develop the country economically,

952
01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.810
then it will naturally come down and the government doesn't have to mess with.

953
01:02:05.811 --> 01:02:08.210
It,
doesn't have to set up family planning programs.

954
01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:13.660
So everybody predicted strenuously that Bangladesh could do what it wanted with

955
01:02:13.761 --> 01:02:18.110
family planning programs until,
and unless they develop economically,

956
01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:23.350
they would be,
uh,
no,
no progress.
Um,

957
01:02:24.270 --> 01:02:27.480
so
what they did

958
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:33.540
was lay,
they,
prior to this program,

959
01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:38.100
they had tried a variety of things in Pakistan,
one of the Times as well,

960
01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:41.550
people are culturally into having a lot of children.

961
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:45.690
And so he must work with their culture and must work with the traditional birth

962
01:02:45.691 --> 01:02:49.970
attendants.
So in Pakistan,
including Bangladesh,
it at the time,
uh,

963
01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:53.840
they had a women called [inaudible] who are basically,
um,

964
01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.770
local health providers,
herbal women,
uh,

965
01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:03.900
mid midwives for births and,
and stuff like that.
But they had basically no,

966
01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:06.660
no modern training,
uh,
whatsoever.

967
01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:11.970
So in the first implementation of Pakistan's program,
uh,
they,

968
01:03:12.030 --> 01:03:12.863
uh,

969
01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:17.640
they gave these diaries various forms of birth control and they were supposed to

970
01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:21.630
give them out.
It didn't work.
Why didn't work?

971
01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:25.200
The days themselves were older women in general who did not use contraception

972
01:03:25.201 --> 01:03:29.050
themselves,
did not think it was moral,
did not think it worked,
uh,

973
01:03:29.210 --> 01:03:31.260
and had all kinds of bad attitudes toward it.

974
01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:35.580
So someone tries to sell you something and they don't themselves believe in it

975
01:03:35.581 --> 01:03:38.490
and you generally don't,
don't accept it.
Uh,

976
01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:43.730
plus economically they made very little by distributing these kinds of

977
01:03:44.131 --> 01:03:48.030
contraceptive from the government,
but they can make quite a bit more,
uh,

978
01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.010
by,
um,

979
01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.390
by attending the births that they charge a good bit for breasts.

980
01:03:54.391 --> 01:03:55.980
Would the government sent the little bit?

981
01:03:55.981 --> 01:03:59.220
They wanted to have the contraceptives very fairly free to the people.

982
01:03:59.221 --> 01:04:00.054
So they didn't pay the,

983
01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:04.350
he's very much so the dyes would get all the condoms especially and sort of

984
01:04:04.351 --> 01:04:07.710
buried them somewhere and claim to the government that they had distributed them

985
01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:09.180
and then made a lot of,

986
01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:14.070
not a lot of money but their money from attending the bursts that that hadn't

987
01:04:14.071 --> 01:04:18.450
been averted by the so so it didn't work.
But they you learn,

988
01:04:18.451 --> 01:04:19.201
I mean these are the,
again,

989
01:04:19.201 --> 01:04:21.440
the first countries in the world to have family planning program.

990
01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:22.530
They didn't know how to do it.

991
01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:27.240
You have to not given that this is the way you do it.
So eventually they,

992
01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:31.590
they started the program that I described to a somewhat last time,

993
01:04:32.100 --> 01:04:36.360
um,
where the women can come out of the house.

994
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:41.480
So you hire a high status woman from that village known to the women has high

995
01:04:42.571 --> 01:04:47.430
status,
is herself using contraception,
thinks it's a wonderful thing.

996
01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:52.140
You train her how to deal not only with the woman but the woman has very little

997
01:04:52.141 --> 01:04:55.950
power there to deal with the husband to deal,
especially with the mother in law.

998
01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:59.460
And for that you need a high status woman that can go into a house and start

999
01:04:59.461 --> 01:05:00.450
discussing these things.

1000
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:05.280
Cause even talking about anything to do with sex for reproduction is not,
uh,

1001
01:05:05.730 --> 01:05:10.590
is not a socially acceptable
thing.

1002
01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:16.860
So they started this program and uh,
initially

1003
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:20.920
you got this kind of a of thing and uh,

1004
01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:25.930
Vena Siddharth talked about this,
that when you start a family planning program,

1005
01:05:25.931 --> 01:05:29.560
this is an old older version of the family planning program.
Not,

1006
01:05:29.561 --> 01:05:33.640
not the one I've just described.
What you see is they took,
uh,

1007
01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:37.750
there was a place called [inaudible],
one of the districts in uh,

1008
01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:40.780
in Bangladesh and they chose some villages.

1009
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:42.970
They want to know whether what they were doing was successful.

1010
01:05:42.971 --> 01:05:46.270
Some villages they gave this family planning program too and other villages they

1011
01:05:46.271 --> 01:05:48.070
didn't as a,
as a control region.

1012
01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:51.460
And here is during this period up to 1977,

1013
01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.160
the comparison area where they didn't do anything special,

1014
01:05:54.161 --> 01:05:58.240
the government had a small program but nothing much was happening.

1015
01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:03.420
Now the international diarrheal research group comes in with this somewhat

1016
01:06:03.461 --> 01:06:08.170
updated program,
not,
not the the one I showed you.
And what happens immediately.

1017
01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:12.640
There's great success and they're jumping up and down.
Okay,
it's true,

1018
01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:17.770
but then it peaks and then over time you'd falls down.

1019
01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:22.190
So what's happening here is a small fraction woman,

1020
01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:24.070
well 20% is not terrible,

1021
01:06:24.250 --> 01:06:28.060
but a small fraction of the women before the program comes in or want to limit

1022
01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:32.020
their births and you'll give them anything they accepted immediately.

1023
01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.550
That's this initial rise.

1024
01:06:33.551 --> 01:06:37.120
And that's very standard for family planning programs that you get an initial

1025
01:06:37.121 --> 01:06:42.121
rise and then it falls off and over the longterm,

1026
01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:44.770
if you're evaluating the program here,
you think it's wonderful,

1027
01:06:44.771 --> 01:06:47.890
but if you're evaluating the program here,
it's kind of worthless.

1028
01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:50.800
And Vina was talking about that,

1029
01:06:50.801 --> 01:06:55.780
that she comes out of this Economic World Bank perspective and they're very

1030
01:06:55.781 --> 01:06:58.270
impressed with with these periods of time.

1031
01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:02.950
This is a program that in retrospect we would say really didn't work well though

1032
01:07:02.951 --> 01:07:06.490
it helps a fair fraction of the women.

1033
01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:11.940
But then you put in a good program that I described to you and now what happens

1034
01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:14.230
a later time.
So we stopped the previous graph,

1035
01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:19.231
stopped in 77 at this level of contraceptive,

1036
01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:23.050
uh,
ex acceptance is that a program that didn't work,

1037
01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:27.400
then they start sending these village working women into the homes of the other

1038
01:07:27.401 --> 01:07:32.401
woman and now you get another big rise that this is now successful immediately.

1039
01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:36.790
But now the,
the success continues.

1040
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:37.901
Meanwhile,

1041
01:07:37.901 --> 01:07:42.880
there's modernization in this social diffusion that these areas,

1042
01:07:42.881 --> 01:07:46.870
the comparison areas are actually intermixed,
uh,
with the treatment areas.

1043
01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:51.550
And they hear a lot about what's going on in there.
And so for that reason,

1044
01:07:51.551 --> 01:07:54.280
and others are not,
we don't really have data to say why it rise.

1045
01:07:54.281 --> 01:07:57.520
But even in the comparison area,
it starts to rise.

1046
01:07:57.910 --> 01:08:01.440
And in one of your readings about Taiwan where you'll have a family peg,

1047
01:08:01.930 --> 01:08:03.130
very similar kind of thing,

1048
01:08:03.131 --> 01:08:07.030
it makes big point that there they did have some data that they had villages

1049
01:08:07.031 --> 01:08:10.150
where they had a family planning program and then as soon as this was heard

1050
01:08:10.151 --> 01:08:11.290
about in the surrounding regions,

1051
01:08:11.291 --> 01:08:14.230
people would come into the treatment region to get treatment.

1052
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:15.860
So the fertility goes down.

1053
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:21.130
This one of the factors behind this is certainly a diffusion of,

1054
01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:25.700
of,
of the ideas of family planning.

1055
01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.850
Uh,
so this,

1056
01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.810
this thing in,
in,
in Bangladesh has,

1057
01:08:35.850 --> 01:08:40.490
has had terrible significance for what we believe about,

1058
01:08:40.710 --> 01:08:44.810
uh,
family planning and programs and people's acceptance of it.

1059
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:46.220
Because up until this time,

1060
01:08:46.221 --> 01:08:51.110
it was really dogma that you have to have economic development and you have to

1061
01:08:51.111 --> 01:08:53.960
have some degree of literacy and you have to have some degree of,

1062
01:08:53.961 --> 01:08:56.350
of women's status,
uh,

1063
01:08:56.720 --> 01:08:59.300
before people would want to limit their fertility.

1064
01:08:59.810 --> 01:09:03.380
Then you go into Bangladesh with a,
with a well funded,
well thought out,

1065
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:09.070
well run program and it starts working and now Bangladesh is,

1066
01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:12.110
uh,

1067
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:16.370
it's fertility has kept falling and it's in there with a lot of countries that

1068
01:09:16.371 --> 01:09:20.030
are a lot richer than it.
India is a lot richer.

1069
01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:24.380
Egypt is a lot richer than Bangladesh and they all now have come to more or less

1070
01:09:24.381 --> 01:09:28.640
the same kind of fertility level.
So it,

1071
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.940
it,

1072
01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:34.940
it now is no longer really believe it's believed that women almost everywhere in

1073
01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:36.021
this case,

1074
01:09:36.021 --> 01:09:39.830
it must be the men because the men and the mother-in-law's control the issue

1075
01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:43.400
really do want to reduce fertility.
And if you give them the option,

1076
01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:45.530
they will accept it

1077
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:50.240
along the way.
Um,

1078
01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:56.180
other places have learned other lessons.
So India next door,

1079
01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:57.403
uh,

1080
01:09:57.470 --> 01:10:02.060
had a much stronger central government because of the Gandhi effect.

1081
01:10:02.061 --> 01:10:05.540
Andy was such a national hero to all the ethnic groups in India.

1082
01:10:05.541 --> 01:10:08.950
So the government was strong and Nehru was very strong and,

1083
01:10:08.951 --> 01:10:09.800
and neighbor's daughter,

1084
01:10:09.801 --> 01:10:14.801
Mrs Gandy was very strong and they were westernized and under the Malthusian

1085
01:10:14.931 --> 01:10:19.250
influence and they decided that they need a family planning program also.

1086
01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:22.760
Actually India was even before this.
Uh,
but again,

1087
01:10:22.761 --> 01:10:27.761
they didn't know how to do it and they decided to use incentives.

1088
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:29.181
That's what,
you know,

1089
01:10:29.181 --> 01:10:31.480
economists keep telling you that every time you're taking an economics for

1090
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.140
people respond to incentives.

1091
01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:38.740
And so they decide to use incentives to get people to take on a family planning.

1092
01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:44.150
And there's a lot of debate about this issue of incentives.
And one part of it,

1093
01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:49.360
one article I read about people in villages in Nepal,
like the one that,
that,

1094
01:10:49.770 --> 01:10:52.250
uh,
being it was in pretty far,

1095
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:57.080
they have to take a whole day off from work to go down to get a contraceptive

1096
01:10:57.081 --> 01:11:00.950
and they have to go back and what kind can they get because they can't go this

1097
01:11:00.951 --> 01:11:04.100
every,
every month to get something new and they,

1098
01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:06.920
they can't take time off from their work or their chores.

1099
01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:11.150
So it's a real major economic expense,
not the contraceptive itself,

1100
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:15.270
but the time and effort needed if they have to take a bus and maybe very

1101
01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:20.220
expensive in their economy,
uh,
to that.
So part of the idea of,

1102
01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:26.100
of,
uh,
giving incentives is to just repay,
uh,

1103
01:11:26.130 --> 01:11:30.300
the woman for her time and effort and India,

1104
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:34.290
it started out that way,
but the program was not very well run.
It wasn't,

1105
01:11:34.510 --> 01:11:38.760
they didn't have the big international help to Bangladesh had and program wasn't

1106
01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:42.110
terribly well run.
And so they sort of got frustrated at,

1107
01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:44.430
at the results and their population kept going.

1108
01:11:44.431 --> 01:11:49.431
And it was a time in India way before this current boom that India has been

1109
01:11:50.131 --> 01:11:53.170
going through.
It may or may not still be going through.
Uh,

1110
01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:57.150
and so the government got frustrated and the population grew and there they saw

1111
01:11:57.151 --> 01:11:57.871
their hopes.

1112
01:11:57.871 --> 01:12:01.350
This was window of opportunity that I was talking about for modernization,

1113
01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:06.200
for populating.
It gets too dense.
That window may close.
So the government got,
uh,

1114
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:11.460
got desperate and started
introducing some coercion.

1115
01:12:11.461 --> 01:12:13.740
They were,
uh,
some of it is,
is incentive,

1116
01:12:13.741 --> 01:12:18.741
like a transistor radios to the man to get the men to get sterilized.

1117
01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:20.790
And,
and that was wonderful,

1118
01:12:20.791 --> 01:12:24.030
but who got sterilized with the old men that weren't going to have children

1119
01:12:24.031 --> 01:12:28.350
anyway,
but they get a transistor radio or,
or some money out of this.

1120
01:12:28.530 --> 01:12:29.790
And the whole thing crashed.

1121
01:12:29.791 --> 01:12:33.750
And it came entangled as an America reproduction and politics.

1122
01:12:33.930 --> 01:12:35.580
So the opposition,
uh,

1123
01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:39.720
to the people didn't especially like it cause it's changing their culture.

1124
01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.220
And uh,

1125
01:12:41.370 --> 01:12:45.750
but the opposition took hold of it and blew up all the abuses that were no

1126
01:12:45.751 --> 01:12:49.620
question.
There were abuses blew up,
the abuses,
the newspapers bled the abuses.

1127
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:52.740
And it became a very big political thing.
And,
uh,

1128
01:12:52.830 --> 01:12:56.100
the Congress party government fell,
uh,
because of that.

1129
01:12:57.090 --> 01:12:58.230
India has since sort of,

1130
01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:01.260
they then they went to a period where they sort of did nothing in family

1131
01:13:01.261 --> 01:13:05.310
planning because it was in such bad favor and now they've started up again and

1132
01:13:05.311 --> 01:13:08.310
think things are going a lot better.

1133
01:13:08.970 --> 01:13:13.830
So I think the,
the,
the story of this is that

1134
01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:20.420
the idea which was prevalent up till the Bangladesh experiment that only rich

1135
01:13:22.141 --> 01:13:25.350
countries,
they're going to reduce their fertility is just plain wrong.

1136
01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:28.480
And now as the,
as the fertility,
uh,

1137
01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:33.420
transition goes through Asia,
it's now amazing places,
uh,

1138
01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:35.480
very poor places.
What,
what's happening?

1139
01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:39.630
So sealon was one of the first countries in Asia to get down to replacement

1140
01:13:39.631 --> 01:13:43.890
level.
Kara,
very poor in salon is not a rich place.
Carola,

1141
01:13:43.891 --> 01:13:47.930
one of the poorest province of India is down at replacement level.
Uh,

1142
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:51.060
all kinds of countries,
Thailand,
Indonesia,

1143
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:55.890
all have really reduced their fertility at amazingly low levels of per capita

1144
01:13:55.891 --> 01:14:00.680
income.
So income is clearly important.
When it doesn't want to throw it out,
it's,

1145
01:14:00.681 --> 01:14:04.290
it's perfectly clear that things are easier if you have more money and there's

1146
01:14:04.291 --> 01:14:07.680
reasons why Richard people have fewer children,
which we'll go into,

1147
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:12.600
but it does not a necessary prerequisite.
Okay.

1148
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:16.680
We will see,
oh,
have a good vacation,
enjoy,

1149
01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.790
come back refreshed
and I will see you then.
