1
00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:02.743
Now,

2
00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.750
in the last lecture we talked about how China,

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.890
uh,

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.510
has had this very dense population of very poor peasants for a very long time.

5
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.890
And,
uh,

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.000
we started discussing some of the possibilities for why that would be.

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.770
So we talked about the possibility that China just had a higher fertility rate

8
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.240
and roughly that was not true.

9
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.993
Um,

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.220
we found that the Europeans and the Chinese both had methods of controlling

11
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:41.700
their population.
It doesn't mean the methods were exactly equal,

12
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.620
but they were rather opposite.
The European method,
as you know,
was late marriage,

13
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.430
uh,
incomplete marriage that half or so,
40%,

14
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:54.750
50% of people never got married or run married at any given time.

15
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.860
A great deal of lack of marriage and late marriage meaning,

16
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.690
but once they got married,

17
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:04.800
they did not seem to have any limitation on their fertility.

18
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.290
And so half the people,
uh,
uh,

19
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.610
going at full tilt is sort of one hour clock and the Chinese situation tend to

20
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:18.030
25% of the girls who had done away with basically at birth,

21
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.570
the rest all got married.
But,
uh,

22
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.800
within a marriage they had a very low rate of reproduction,

23
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.710
uh,
uh,
show.
Uh,
at the end.
I don't think we'll have time,
but if we do,

24
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:36.210
I'll show you some of the evidence that this low rate of reproduction was not a

25
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:41.110
conscious effort to control fertility,
but was the result of the culture.
I,
I,

26
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.440
I,
I discussed,

27
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.020
I gave you that conclusion last number and give you any data there.

28
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.010
There's plenty of data for that.
So we're,

29
00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:55.530
we're back to what the difference is between China and Europe.
You know,
why,

30
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.380
why are they so different when,
yeah.

31
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.110
When you say design,
do you mean design consciously?
No,
it's done.

32
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:14.460
I think the people had no idea.
People obey various cultural rules.

33
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.170
Cultural rules happen randomly.

34
00:02:16.171 --> 00:02:19.890
You Can Watch anthropologists watch cultures and culture is a very flexible

35
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:24.510
thing and it changes fairly frequently.
If that change works,

36
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.830
people retain it in the whole culture works.
If that doesn't work,

37
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.710
either people change it again or the culture disappears.

38
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.170
Most cultures over time have disappeared.

39
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.700
Cultural Evolution seems to fall pretty much the same rules as biological

40
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.090
evolution.
Almost random change in biology.

41
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:44.160
You have random changes in the genome,

42
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.230
the cosmic ray hits you or you smoke a cigarette or or something like that,
uh,

43
00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:54.231
and a base pair changes or you're a piece of chromosome jumps out and goes back

44
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:59.320
in,
inserted a lot of different things.
These are mostly bad changes,
but very,

45
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.960
very rarely.
There's a good change if it's a good change,

46
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.520
presumably that individual will have more children and so there's more copies of

47
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:08.860
that gene,
the next generation and so on.
You,
you know,

48
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:12.220
the basic story of evolution,
cultural evolution can be the same.

49
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.910
People change culture on the basis of fads and who knows what.

50
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.710
We've had a lot of evidence that even the great reduction in fertility that

51
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:25.330
we've seen all over the world has a lot of aspects of a fan that once a small

52
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:26.200
group adopts it,

53
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.970
everybody looks around and likes the idea of group fertility drops like a stone

54
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.540
way before and,
and,

55
00:03:32.541 --> 00:03:35.890
and rather independently of economic changes in educational changes and

56
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:37.000
urbanization changes.

57
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.600
And a lot of the lectures have shown that that something is adopted for maybe

58
00:03:42.941 --> 00:03:45.580
unclear reasons by a small group.
People like it.

59
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:48.970
It's like the kind of clothes that you wear or something and there's no

60
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:53.500
rationality to it.
But if it works,
it gets embedded in the culture.
So the uh,

61
00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.640
so no,

62
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:59.110
I don't think there's any evidence that any of these practices were put into

63
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:01.840
place for the purpose that we now impute to them.

64
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.800
But there are practices that worked for that culture within the rest of their

65
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:10.060
ecological and cultural context.
And so it persistent.

66
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.930
That's a very important,
uh,
it's a good question,

67
00:04:12.931 --> 00:04:17.560
is a very important way of thinking about culture that it evolves very much in

68
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:21.500
the same way that biology,
biological things evolve.

69
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.350
And it's a decent introduction to what I want to say today because one of the

70
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:28.210
strong aspects of culture is family

71
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.520
and of course in Chinese culture as,
as in many others,

72
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.030
it's really the very center of Chinese culture,

73
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.540
the family and other responsibilities to each other.

74
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.430
We talked and I'll go back over it a little bit about how loosely bound the

75
00:04:45.431 --> 00:04:49.060
families in in Europe were all refer to this later,
but in China,

76
00:04:49.061 --> 00:04:51.630
families are much more tightly bounded.
It's,

77
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.070
it's a much more functional unit.

78
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.410
And this binding a is ordered by Confucian doctrine,
uh,

79
00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.990
for,
for a long time in China and this is women,
uh,

80
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.950
had to give absolute deference to men.

81
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.360
Children had to give absolute deference to parents and elders for instance.

82
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.610
The relationship between parents and children are extremely important.

83
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.740
And in China,
children did not leave the home in Europe.

84
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.920
Remmeber I described to you that age seven,
Charles Dickens is,

85
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.770
goes out and works and,
and,

86
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.350
and people are sent out to do service in different places or be apprentices.

87
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.230
That happened,
of course,
any,
everything happened in China.

88
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.580
But the most usual thing was that the children were kept at home and worked on

89
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:41.500
the family land.
The parents chose a spouse for the child.
Again,
in Europe,

90
00:05:41.501 --> 00:05:43.900
people went out and had what they called Morgan Adic,
marriages,

91
00:05:43.901 --> 00:05:45.580
marriages presumably for love.

92
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.260
But the parents were not involved in the marriage.

93
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.390
In China after marriage,

94
00:05:52.391 --> 00:05:56.890
the sun remained living in his parents' compound and the daughter in law moved

95
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.350
in with them.
Very,
very standard kind of situation.

96
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.570
There was no separate economic unit for the marriage children as long as the

97
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:08.480
father lived,
he controlled the assets of all the family.

98
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.160
The children did not have independent stuff and money that they owned.

99
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.160
It was all under the control of the father and in old age it was the children

100
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.610
and not the community.
Uh,
who responsible for support of the parents.

101
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.070
That was part of the tit for tat.
Again,
in the culture,

102
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:26.450
this is very closely range.

103
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.880
The parents have responsibilities toward the children.

104
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.670
The children have responsibilities towards the parents.

105
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.160
The parents support the children when they're young,
provide land for them,
uh,

106
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.300
when they inherit the land.

107
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.590
But in return the children must support the parents in old age.

108
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.410
Living in the family of your,
your,
your parents,
uh,

109
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.530
is a very conservative,
uh,
uh,

110
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.790
effect because the older generation gets to dictate the customs and morays and

111
00:06:58.071 --> 00:07:02.510
the behavior of the younger generation and older generations are by definition

112
00:07:02.511 --> 00:07:06.040
conservative cause they were brought up in an older version of things and there

113
00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:10.520
may be modern things going on but they don't generally accept them.

114
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.770
And so the respect to fertility,

115
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.920
the SPEC to son preference of a boy who may be 17 marries a girl who may be 13,

116
00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:19.970
14,
15,

117
00:07:19.971 --> 00:07:23.840
the girl and the boy is under the thumb of his mother and the girl moves into

118
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:27.800
the enter the house and she's only 13 and she's under the thumb of everybody.

119
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.730
And the mother insists that she get pregnant right away and have a boy.

120
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.780
And she describes it as for my son's benefit,
that,

121
00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:39.350
that the cultural thing is she's doing it so that my son will pass on the family

122
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:42.110
name.
It's good for my son,
but the son probably doesn't want it.

123
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.060
And when as times modernize,
he wants to enjoy his life and enjoy his,

124
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.650
his wife and so forth.

125
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.950
But they have little power of the son and the daughter in law had little power.

126
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.900
It's the grandparents that have the cultural power in the family.

127
00:07:56.901 --> 00:08:01.400
So it's very,
uh,
conservative,
uh,
factor in,

128
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.570
in cultures and uh,
especially in matters of reproduction.

129
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:09.200
So,
uh,

130
00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:14.120
in the return as I mentioned for children giving up autonomy,
which,

131
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.880
which they give up their children very much under the control of the parents and

132
00:08:16.881 --> 00:08:19.340
for living in this absolute deference,
uh,

133
00:08:19.341 --> 00:08:22.970
fathers in a lot of China at different times in their history had the right to

134
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:25.920
kill a child if the child would was disobedient and that was not,

135
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.900
not against the law.
Um,
uh,

136
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.510
in return for this,

137
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:37.160
they had a support that children of all ages find spouses and assure resources

138
00:08:37.161 --> 00:08:41.030
for the next generation.
And the essence is since they really,

139
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:42.010
the only resource that,

140
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:47.060
that peasants generally have is some land that meant giving the children land

141
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.570
for the next generation.
In England,

142
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:52.370
especially in a lot of the rest of your day,

143
00:08:52.371 --> 00:08:56.250
practice primogenitor that only the oldest son got the land.

144
00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:58.500
And so the holdings,

145
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.650
whatever amount of land and the parents had was kept together,

146
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:06.450
the Chinese did not practice primogeniture and you're talking about a lot of

147
00:09:06.451 --> 00:09:09.210
place over a long time.
So I'm sure there were some places where it happened.

148
00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:12.690
But in general,
uh,
they did not practice primogenitor.

149
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.530
So on the death of the father of the family land would be divided up among

150
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:18.600
however many sons that there were.

151
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.640
They said the good benefit that no one was forced.

152
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:28.290
And one of the cultural reasons for it that we'd land.
You could start a family,

153
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.260
you could have children,
you can have sons.

154
00:09:30.261 --> 00:09:32.640
So no one would be forced into the situation,

155
00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:36.630
which was unbearable in traditional Chinese culture of not having a son.

156
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.390
You had to have a son.
We're going to have a son,
you how to have a wife,

157
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:42.150
not have wife you have means and supporting her a little bit.

158
00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.150
So the family had to give you land.

159
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.250
So this factor,
the lack of,
uh,

160
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.020
the division of family land in China had a tremendous impact on the whole

161
00:09:55.021 --> 00:09:58.320
economic situation of China.
Of course,

162
00:09:58.321 --> 00:10:02.400
as population grew that guaranteed that the plots of land would get smaller and

163
00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:07.401
smaller and smaller and right down to the subsistence level

164
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.140
a common Chinese and the Chinese were very well aware of this.
Uh,
uh,

165
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:19.180
a common Chinese saying which summarize this phenomenon says fortunes seldom

166
00:10:19.801 --> 00:10:24.060
continue considerable in the same family beyond the third generation.

167
00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.670
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

168
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:30.110
<v 0>If you're Chinese and say that we have similar sayings in the Western world,</v>

169
00:10:30.111 --> 00:10:33.810
but they're very different meanings in China,
what it means if you are,
uh,

170
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.480
have a fortune.
If you're rich,

171
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.020
you'll be able to keep more of your children alive,
including the sons.

172
00:10:39.021 --> 00:10:39.860
If you have more sons,

173
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:44.870
you have to divide your land into more small pieces and you go right back to the

174
00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:48.560
poverty level.
When we say things like that,
and the west,

175
00:10:48.561 --> 00:10:53.150
it means the first generation works very hard,
is honorable in a sense,

176
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.260
makes money.
The second generation seen their parents work,

177
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:02.330
retain some of that work were worth that good work ethic.
But the children,

178
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:05.870
the grandchildren grow up rich and they're there,
they're rotters.

179
00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.580
They don't work very hard.

180
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.270
So the same cultural impression of,
of uh,

181
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.440
works in both cultures that rich has don't last very long and generations,

182
00:11:17.451 --> 00:11:22.280
but one is due to the scarcity,
the division of land and one is due to the,

183
00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:25.190
the,
the personality of the individual.

184
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.280
And uh,
Maltis knew about this saying the saying is so popular.

185
00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:36.290
Trend Maltis knew about this saying and wrote about it 200 years ago and it's

186
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.900
uh,
still still common.

187
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.550
I read it a Chinese saying may the New York Times a few years ago.

188
00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.010
Okay.
And again,

189
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.280
this is in contrast to the European situation where children left home early to

190
00:11:54.191 --> 00:11:56.680
work in a succession of other chap households.

191
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:00.750
They chose their own spouses very interestingly as evidence of,

192
00:12:00.751 --> 00:12:04.480
of this kind of disillusion that in most of the world we have these tight

193
00:12:04.481 --> 00:12:07.570
families.
When someone get married,
there's some record of it.

194
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.770
There's some registry through a personal family rec record kept as a family

195
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:16.280
treasure or some governmental or village or religious record.
And in all,

196
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.070
in all these countries with tight marriages,

197
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:22.420
there's a long list of relatives that have witnessed the wedding and say,
yes,

198
00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:26.770
this,
this is true.
Not In England.
There's the,
the,
the list.

199
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.550
It's the two people go to church or a priest or a minister marries them and

200
00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:35.050
that's it.
The family can be involved but need to have nothing to do with it.

201
00:12:35.051 --> 00:12:38.640
And legally it doesn't have anything to do with it,
uh,

202
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.240
after marriage,

203
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:44.680
unless they are the primogenitor son that is inheriting the father's household,

204
00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:50.010
they go and set up their own household somewhere else and live separately there.

205
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.940
Economic,
as soon as they get married,

206
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:55.240
they're economically independent of their parents.

207
00:12:56.140 --> 00:13:00.450
And one Dataset in 75% of cases in,

208
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.600
in northwest Europe,

209
00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:05.200
children didn't even live in the same village where their parents lived.

210
00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.220
So it wasn't like they were really close,
but they moved away.

211
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.800
Now again,
in cultures,
all these,
a lot of things have to fit together.

212
00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.600
So the system of independence,

213
00:13:16.601 --> 00:13:20.120
the European system can only occur if some provisions made for supportive the

214
00:13:20.121 --> 00:13:23.110
elderly.
Because in China,
the,
the young,

215
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:28.600
the children have the responsibility to take care of the overlay and this has to

216
00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:31.630
happen.
All elderly need to be taken care of.

217
00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.890
And the culture would never evolve successfully if,

218
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.660
if there wasn't some way of European,
uh,

219
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.040
oldsters getting some sort of support.

220
00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.780
But interesting in Europe it was not the children who are responsible for

221
00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:48.700
support of the elderly.
Uh,
but the community had that responsibility.

222
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:53.980
Uh,
in from 1598 parliament as a long time ago,

223
00:13:53.981 --> 00:13:58.981
1598 parliament are required overseers of the poor to be appointed every year in

224
00:13:59.921 --> 00:14:02.800
every parish in the country.
Absolutely system.

225
00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.160
Every parish was responsible for its own,
uh,
poor.

226
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.450
And which was mostly elderly.
And they not only had the duty to

227
00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:15.340
support anybody that came and asked for it,
who was indeed poor,

228
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.400
they had to go out and identifying the poor.

229
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:23.230
They had to the poor there that were too helpless or too ignorant or didn't
know.

230
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.230
They had the responsible to go out and identify the poor.

231
00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:29.650
And we have a lot of argumentation about are the America,

232
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:31.450
especially about our current welfare state.

233
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:36.750
How much effort should the welfare agencies do to pull in clients for their

234
00:14:37.721 --> 00:14:40.390
services to advertise their services?
Well,

235
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:43.480
1598 England have faced of course the same issue.

236
00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.970
And the parliament then decided that no,

237
00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:50.980
the responsibility of the community was to go out and identify fine people who

238
00:14:52.191 --> 00:14:56.270
needed help.
And these,
uh,

239
00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:01.070
these overseers were empowered to levy taxes sufficient to pay for this.

240
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.150
So the law was very clear that the primary responsibility for providing relief

241
00:15:05.151 --> 00:15:08.510
lay with the parish,
that that was where it happened.

242
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.280
And there was no direct obligation recognize between the child and the parent.

243
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:17.870
A parent could not go and sue his children,
uh,
for support.

244
00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.630
But there was a back door,

245
00:15:20.631 --> 00:15:24.890
a little loophole that once the parish discharge his responsibility and

246
00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:25.790
supporting the poor,

247
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:31.420
then the parish could go and sue the child to re Rican reimburse the parish for

248
00:15:32.541 --> 00:15:35.480
it's,
it's expensive.
So it wasn't totally that,
that,

249
00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:36.770
that the children get off the hook.

250
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.170
But that was when her children lived in a different village.

251
00:15:39.171 --> 00:15:43.010
And this was all very localized.
It was a very hard thing to enforce.

252
00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:45.770
And basically it was the community that had this responsibility.

253
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.640
Colonial America picked up that same pattern and there are really quite horrible

254
00:15:52.131 --> 00:15:55.670
stories of pregnant women who either got pregnant out of wedlock or whose

255
00:15:55.671 --> 00:16:00.050
husband had died or had gone off to a war or something sort of being chased from

256
00:16:00.051 --> 00:16:05.051
village to village while they were pregnant and ready to give birth because of

257
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.060
the village knew that if that child was born in that village,

258
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:12.410
they would ever have to have to do poor relief for the mother and the child.

259
00:16:12.411 --> 00:16:16.520
And there's some really unpleasant stories from,
from colonial America.

260
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:22.590
Well,
so you have two different patterns.
Uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,

261
00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.720
Chinese and of course not limited to China where the children are under the

262
00:16:26.721 --> 00:16:30.290
thumb of the grandparents,
especially the grandmother and reproductive matters.

263
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.470
And so behavior is not terribly flexible.

264
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:37.310
It's whatever the older generation believe.
Whereas in Europe,

265
00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.760
children go out and form their own households and they can respond more easily

266
00:16:43.701 --> 00:16:46.820
to changes in,
in cultural Milan's

267
00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.640
the younger boys,
it's quite interesting,

268
00:16:52.641 --> 00:16:57.641
the while one of the results of the primogenitor is one,

269
00:16:57.951 --> 00:16:59.870
you keep the plots together so that in the,

270
00:16:59.871 --> 00:17:04.460
in the peasantry you don't have this enormous class of terribly poor peasants.

271
00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.870
Peasants retain a reasonable amount of land,

272
00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:14.060
but all the rest of the sons go off to the cities and uh,

273
00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.980
they get,
they get forced off the land.

274
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.150
And demographically they usually don't,

275
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:23.810
don't require the resources to get married because in the cities it's very hard

276
00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:28.070
to,
to accumulate the resources.
Uh,
so they never get married.

277
00:17:28.071 --> 00:17:30.500
They never have children.
As I mentioned before,

278
00:17:30.501 --> 00:17:35.030
the death rates in the cities who are so incredibly high that,
uh,
about,
uh,

279
00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.700
every generation,
about a third of the,
of the,

280
00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:42.480
of the city people die and had to be replaced by new immigrants from the country

281
00:17:42.481 --> 00:17:43.314
side.

282
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.520
But still there was quite a large population of unemployed or barely employed

283
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:52.150
people in the cities.
And what did they do?
They joined armies.

284
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:56.850
That's one of the big specialty of,
of men big require manpowers.

285
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.590
And some historians believe that the,
the aggressiveness of Europe,

286
00:18:01.591 --> 00:18:04.920
all the constant wars that Europe or in during this period in the colonial

287
00:18:04.921 --> 00:18:05.754
expansion,

288
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:09.360
we do it all these young men in the army and they had to do something with them

289
00:18:09.361 --> 00:18:11.760
that,
that or reverse,
they were available.

290
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.770
All these young men were available for the army.

291
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:18.750
And so they were employed to do whatever the rulers believe that they should do.

292
00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.680
Uh,
they also,
uh,

293
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.470
try to make a living in the city and did a lot of apprentice ship and they would

294
00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:32.700
start a small trade or some hand manufacturing operation.
And again,

295
00:18:32.701 --> 00:18:35.390
some historians believe that this excess of,
of,

296
00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.370
of males in the city trying to cope on their own,

297
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:42.300
were formed one of the bases for the industrial revolution.

298
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:48.150
So the two systems,
uh,
were really dying.
The European Shiny,

299
00:18:48.151 --> 00:18:51.720
we're sort of diametrically opposite.
And the Chinese system was in a sense,

300
00:18:51.721 --> 00:18:54.300
much kinder because no one would,
in Europe,

301
00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.990
children was sort of basically sacrificed goodbye,
have a good time in life,

302
00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:00.280
we'll see ya.
I,
whereas in China they were,

303
00:19:00.281 --> 00:19:03.780
they were kept at home in the security of the family and its land,

304
00:19:03.781 --> 00:19:07.440
which is both emotionally more secure and economically more secure,

305
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:08.970
but very poor.

306
00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.400
<v 2>Um,
so,</v>

307
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.470
<v 0>so it looks like that this very practice,
which is,</v>

308
00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:22.490
is the center of Chinese culture,
the tightness of the family,

309
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.180
respect too for elders,

310
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:28.020
lack of adolescent rebellion and et Cetera,
older,

311
00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:32.100
the characteristic of things that go along with that may also be one of the

312
00:19:32.101 --> 00:19:36.990
reasons why China suffered now through z and in the Malthusian misery situation

313
00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:38.960
for so long that the,

314
00:19:38.961 --> 00:19:43.800
the land parcels in which people try to survive with just so tiny that they were

315
00:19:43.801 --> 00:19:46.320
up against the,
uh,
an absolute limit.

316
00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.053
<v 2>Okay.</v>

317
00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.221
<v 0>All right.</v>

318
00:19:51.221 --> 00:19:56.221
We can see in the statistics the result of this keeping people on the land.

319
00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.400
Um,
China basically as,

320
00:20:01.401 --> 00:20:04.500
as observed by Chinese and by everyone else.
Uh,

321
00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:09.430
it became what was called a vast sea of impoverished rural peasants.

322
00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:14.710
As late as 1994% of Chinese lived in villages,

323
00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:19.630
meaning they were agricultural there online countries in England a hundred years

324
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.470
earlier in 1800.
The agricultural population was down to 37,

325
00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:24.940
37%.

326
00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.310
So China was way more than a hundred years behind England,
at least in,

327
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.390
in urbanizing and industrializing and so forth

328
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.640
without enough land.
Nonetheless,
uh,

329
00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.020
when plots got so small that people really could not survive on them.
Of course,

330
00:20:44.021 --> 00:20:44.540
even in China,

331
00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:49.540
they had to leave the land and you've a class of landless laborers as there

332
00:20:49.601 --> 00:20:52.310
really was everywhere.
But the,

333
00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:55.180
the conditions which they left in Europe,

334
00:20:55.181 --> 00:21:00.181
the poverty in on the farms was so much worse than say an in Europe that when

335
00:21:01.061 --> 00:21:05.470
they moved to the cities,
it was even a step,
a step further down.

336
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:11.260
And this is really a disastrous,
in 1930s,

337
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.530
they,
both Americans and and Chairman Mao,

338
00:21:14.531 --> 00:21:18.850
Mao did some of his earliest scholarly work investigating conditions of the

339
00:21:18.851 --> 00:21:20.500
rural poor in China.

340
00:21:20.830 --> 00:21:25.810
And so there's a fair amount of data that in the 1930s wages,

341
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:30.730
uh,
that we paid for,
uh,
uh,
labor.

342
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.320
What you paid a man to work for a day was the same as it cost you to,

343
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:39.940
to provide fodder for a donkey.
So the cost per day of a donkey.

344
00:21:39.941 --> 00:21:44.470
And a human where the same,
it was such absolute misery,
but which,

345
00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:48.460
which do people prefer to hire by a donkey or hire a human?

346
00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:50.990
Same cost per day.

347
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:53.523
<v 2>What?</v>

348
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.030
<v 0>Okay.
All the things that donkeys are humans can do,</v>

349
00:21:57.390 --> 00:22:00.180
but donkeys especially what kind of donkey do carries things?

350
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.020
It turns out that they prefer to hire the human.
Why?

351
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:07.500
Because if you have a donkey,
you have to pay them every day.

352
00:22:07.501 --> 00:22:10.200
Even when the donkey is not working.
If you have a human,

353
00:22:10.201 --> 00:22:13.860
you pay him for that day.
Essentially a subsistence wages,

354
00:22:13.861 --> 00:22:15.240
just enough food to keep going,

355
00:22:15.241 --> 00:22:18.210
which is more or less the same as the donkey and when you don't need them,

356
00:22:18.211 --> 00:22:21.720
when the,
when the harvest is gone or you don't have anything to carry by,

357
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:25.590
you know.
So,
uh,
that's,

358
00:22:25.591 --> 00:22:28.950
that's what you see in the Chinese cities of all this time that there was very

359
00:22:28.951 --> 00:22:32.240
little mechanized transport.
Not Everything was carried by road,

360
00:22:32.250 --> 00:22:34.520
by rickshaw carry.
Ritual is a seat.
But you know,

361
00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:39.240
human laborers were carrying all the goods around the cities and between cities

362
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.830
and in the forums.

363
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:45.120
Also a labor was so cheap and human.

364
00:22:45.121 --> 00:22:49.800
There was so many humans per land that,
uh,
there was no,

365
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:55.770
uh,
there was no economic incentive to get animals to do your heavy labor.

366
00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.330
So there's an absence of draft animals in China and amazing difference between

367
00:23:00.331 --> 00:23:04.970
Europe and trying as the absence of,
of draft animals.
And it's very instinct.

368
00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:07.830
Draft animals not only provide you pulling labor,

369
00:23:07.831 --> 00:23:12.660
but they provide manure and Europe had plenty of manure from all the liquor that

370
00:23:12.661 --> 00:23:16.170
a lot of animals and Chinese then had to go to human manure.

371
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:21.590
And that the whole industry of,
of,
of spreading the human manure nights,

372
00:23:21.591 --> 00:23:26.580
soil,
as they call it on the fields,
is due to a lack of,

373
00:23:26.581 --> 00:23:30.180
of draft animals.
So in this,
uh,

374
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:36.630
this,
this continued,
uh,
as late as the 1970s,

375
00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:40.230
some parts of China was still too poor to have farm animals.

376
00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.620
And so you didn't get mechanized farming,

377
00:23:43.621 --> 00:23:46.850
you didn't get any of the Labor was so cheap that didn't get any of the

378
00:23:46.851 --> 00:23:51.650
mechanization of either motorized transport in cities or,

379
00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:56.360
uh,
agricultural machinery and in the countryside.

380
00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:00.860
Okay.
So

381
00:24:02.660 --> 00:24:06.830
this kind of people coming down to a very,
very,

382
00:24:06.831 --> 00:24:10.580
because the land got so crowded,
people coming down to a very,

383
00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.480
very poor state of existence.
Uh,

384
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:15.920
it was really a great weakness of China.

385
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.380
And while at the top of the emperor and the court,
uh,
were,

386
00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.960
were fabulously wealthy,
there was based on the backs of a mass of really,

387
00:24:23.961 --> 00:24:28.610
really poor peasants.
And so when Europe,
uh,

388
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:34.150
develop good shipping and modern arms starting to develop modern armaments,

389
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.940
they were able to,
uh,

390
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:40.850
thrust their power all the way from Europe around most of the world.

391
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:44.360
It's not very easy to get by by sailing ship from Europe to China.

392
00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.330
But by the early 18 hundreds,

393
00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:53.020
Europe could project enough military power into China to defeat the Chinese

394
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:58.280
armies.
And as I mentioned last time,
uh,
the British were,

395
00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.920
by that time having a terrible trade deficit with China.

396
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.480
The British were addicted to tea and they were losing all their money and the t

397
00:25:05.481 --> 00:25:07.050
addiction would have choked the,
their,

398
00:25:07.051 --> 00:25:10.460
their ledgers are very clear how that England was just losing all its money.

399
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:15.560
And if,
uh,
if they didn't restore the balance of trade,

400
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:20.000
uh,
Europe would be bankrupt and would have cut off the industrial revolution,

401
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:23.270
the money that could have fueled the industrial solutions.
In fact,

402
00:25:23.271 --> 00:25:27.740
going to China to feed a caffeine addiction,
it was really a massive,

403
00:25:27.741 --> 00:25:28.790
massive effect.

404
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.680
And so the British started importing opium into China from India as an attempt

405
00:25:33.681 --> 00:25:37.370
to reverse the balance of trade,
which you did.
I mentioned this,

406
00:25:37.371 --> 00:25:40.460
the Chinese put down their foot and said,
no,
you can't addict my people.

407
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:41.370
The British tried,

408
00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:46.130
cried free trade invaded China in the first and the second opium war.

409
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:51.480
So by about 1840,
it was clear that China was a paper tiger.
No,

410
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:55.640
apparently that there's only had a vast number of people in a very strong

411
00:25:55.641 --> 00:26:00.560
autocratic state.
They could not respond to western military power.

412
00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:05.450
And,
uh,
once kicked out of the,
uh,
so for short interim there,

413
00:26:05.451 --> 00:26:08.600
before the opium war,
the Chinese were able to kick the opium smugglers out.

414
00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:12.800
Where'd they go to a little rocky island off the coast of south China.

415
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.660
And that's now called Hong Kong.
It started a smuggler's den.
And all the,

416
00:26:17.661 --> 00:26:20.500
basically the big,
uh,
Jardine,
Matheson,

417
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:25.040
all the big British fortunes that stemmed from the China trade.

418
00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:29.360
We're,
we're there,
we're really opium trade,
drug trade,
the things.

419
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:34.510
So the British started a controlling parts of China.
Then the Germans moved in,

420
00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:37.160
the French moved in,
and the Americans,

421
00:26:37.161 --> 00:26:39.590
when in the periods when Chinese government had some power,

422
00:26:39.591 --> 00:26:43.740
we're very happy to intermediate and the drug trade and,
and help,

423
00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:48.420
help avoid certain restrictions on the,
on the Brits and so forth.

424
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:53.190
And then the Japanese got modernized in the early 19 hundreds and they invaded

425
00:26:53.191 --> 00:26:54.024
China.

426
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:59.270
And the end result of this is that from the first opium war for 115 years,

427
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:06.830
China was basically at the mercy of the European and imperial powers and the

428
00:27:06.991 --> 00:27:10.830
Japanese,
uh,
newly imperial state.

429
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:15.840
And the,
the,
the final chapter on that,
of course is world war two,

430
00:27:15.841 --> 00:27:19.290
when the Japanese invaded.
And we're incredibly brutal to the Chinese.

431
00:27:19.291 --> 00:27:23.560
And I read you,
uh,
sometime back,
a story about the rape of Nanking.

432
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.230
And then after that,

433
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:29.100
there was a battle between the communists and the nationalists.

434
00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:33.060
One by the comes a very,
very vicious civil war.
Uh,

435
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:38.410
basically China was devastated by this hundred,

436
00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:42.960
hundred,
15 or years of dissolution of the government and,

437
00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:46.170
and being taken advantage of by foreign powers.

438
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:51.660
The scarcity of land.
Just as a sort of a footnote to that history,

439
00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:56.160
the scarcity of land,
uh,
remains a major problem for China,

440
00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:57.990
especially the dry in hilly land.

441
00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:02.220
You may remember last time I told her that as American foods came in and farming

442
00:28:02.221 --> 00:28:03.054
increased,

443
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:08.100
that people learned that they could grow food on hilly land and dry and dry
land.

444
00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.210
And so the population expanded into this,
uh,
marginal land

445
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.390
February and the end of February,
this year,
just a month ago.
Uh,

446
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:22.460
there was a story in the times and China's now going through the worst drought

447
00:28:23.791 --> 00:28:27.690
in half a century,
which also means that they go through this every half century.

448
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:32.700
So it's not really an incredibly unusual thing.
And in the week band,

449
00:28:32.701 --> 00:28:35.070
farmer's land is one third of an acre.

450
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:39.570
And remember I told you the average farm size is only one 10th of an acre.

451
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.050
So this guy's rich.
He's got a third of an Acre,
three times as much.

452
00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:44.700
Why does he have so much?

453
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.510
Because it's carved out of a rocky hillside in a dry region,

454
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.910
so you can't survive on a 10th of an Acre there.

455
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.220
You need a three tenths of an acre.

456
00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:57.090
The aquifers have been so depleted that in some farming regions,

457
00:28:57.091 --> 00:29:00.450
wells have to go down a half a mile before striking water.

458
00:29:00.451 --> 00:29:03.510
All the water that's less further down has already been used up,

459
00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:07.620
and so they're going through this drought.
These people in good times,

460
00:29:07.621 --> 00:29:10.380
on the third of an acre,
on a hilly,
rocky,
dry hillside,

461
00:29:10.381 --> 00:29:15.120
you're not going to make a lot.
And now with the economic collapse in the world,

462
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:20.450
there's millions of migrant workers coming back into the farm,

463
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:21.600
the countryside,

464
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.260
and they're going to have to now somehow be supported on this very,

465
00:29:25.261 --> 00:29:27.300
very poor agriculture.

466
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:35.100
Okay,
so finally after the Korean War,
and I met,
forgot to mention the Korean War,

467
00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.580
where the United and some elements United States said they were going to invade

468
00:29:38.581 --> 00:29:39.031
China.

469
00:29:39.031 --> 00:29:43.540
This was the time when they were threatening to bomb trying to back to the stone

470
00:29:43.541 --> 00:29:46.570
age.
Do you know that,
you know that expression.
So,
you know,

471
00:29:46.571 --> 00:29:50.050
it was Senator William Nolan from California who was the main advocate of

472
00:29:50.051 --> 00:29:54.940
bombing China back to the stone age.
Uh,
so,
uh,

473
00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:59.690
but the US did not invade China and China fought,

474
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.580
fought them in North Korea.
Very,
very nasty bloody,
uh,
situation.

475
00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:09.160
Uh,
but they,
they finally got this piece.

476
00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:12.430
The data seems to show that in 1952,

477
00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.850
which is at the end of,
of the Korean War,

478
00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.680
Chinese had a significantly lower per capita income than they had at the end of

479
00:30:20.681 --> 00:30:25.210
the Song Dynasty in the 13th century that there had been,
you know,

480
00:30:25.211 --> 00:30:28.090
700 years with a six,

481
00:30:28.091 --> 00:30:32.760
700 years with no progress,
a real progress for the people whose real mouth,

482
00:30:32.761 --> 00:30:35.440
who's in situation where the population had grown up tremendously.

483
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.120
Production had increased tremendously,

484
00:30:37.121 --> 00:30:40.660
but the two equaled out and no net progress.

485
00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.840
So there's the new communist government,
which was very powerful and not,
uh,

486
00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:49.060
not hesitant about using its power and being very autocratic,

487
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.300
but right away they did a number of very good things.

488
00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:53.590
They invested very heavily in,

489
00:30:53.591 --> 00:30:58.540
in public health and introduced the very basic measures of hygiene,

490
00:30:58.541 --> 00:31:03.170
disease control and pest control.
It's a big thing.
Loudspeakers,

491
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:07.240
this period,
loudspeakers everywhere in China were blaring to the people.

492
00:31:07.241 --> 00:31:11.350
You didn't have any time to think of their loud speakers everywhere at you.
Uh,

493
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:16.080
honorable elders,
please do not spit on the ground any.

494
00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:20.020
Your Chinese have heard this or stories this you have.
And,

495
00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:23.590
and there was a big campaign to Swat flies that just flies.

496
00:31:23.591 --> 00:31:25.690
We're spreading disease from,
from the feces,

497
00:31:25.691 --> 00:31:27.870
which was not in not flushed away and toilets.

498
00:31:27.871 --> 00:31:31.720
So flies would step the feces and step onto you have you get thing.

499
00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:33.520
So the same thing.

500
00:31:33.521 --> 00:31:37.450
Swat a fly and they killed zillions of flies and it flies eventually did get

501
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.260
controlled in China.
And whether it was due to the swatter fly campaign or not,

502
00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:43.210
uh,
I don't know.

503
00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:48.930
But due to these things by 1957 which when we have a devastated country where

504
00:31:48.971 --> 00:31:51.820
the government takes control,
and for nine years,
eight years,

505
00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:56.080
the death rate went to half.
What had had been,
that's an amazing,

506
00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.480
amazing achievement.

507
00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.680
But when you cut the death rate in half,
what happens?

508
00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:04.600
Population explosion.

509
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:09.580
So China had its most extreme population explosion after the communists came to

510
00:32:09.581 --> 00:32:14.260
power.
Now these were not,
not ignorant people.

511
00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:20.170
Were they worried about the puppet?
Supposing the answer is absolutely not.

512
00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.720
Marx's theory is very pro natalist.
Mark's hated Maltis.

513
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:30.670
There's a long literature of Communists,
socialists invective against,

514
00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:34.960
against small office.
They are really opposite poles.
Now it's sort of,
uh,

515
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:39.860
sort of the right wing and the extreme left wing that opposes morphis and

516
00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:44.090
liberals and moderates are more predisposed toward him.
But anyway,
the mix,

517
00:32:44.091 --> 00:32:48.860
his theory is basically says this,
look in a capitalist economy,
uh,

518
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:51.020
the capitalists take workers,

519
00:32:51.021 --> 00:32:54.440
they employ them in factories and they make a surplus.
They,
they,

520
00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.050
so the capitalist lives very well on the surplus.

521
00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:01.880
The socialist economy can do just as well.
It can employ the workers,

522
00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:04.070
they can make a surplus over them.

523
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:08.840
But instead of having big fat mansions in cigars,
the socialist candidate,

524
00:33:08.841 --> 00:33:13.280
we'll reinvest the money for the good of the people.

525
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:18.240
So the more people,
the merrier.
Mark's original Marxist doctrine.

526
00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:22.780
It was very,
very clear that since the capitalists can exploit labor,
so can,

527
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:27.470
can,
so can the state and that will redound to the benefit of the people.

528
00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:33.620
So,
uh,
the way,
the way this was translated from Mark's into China,

529
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.260
they call mouth and says theory,

530
00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:39.110
something like Ren all Lune,

531
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.140
which means man mouth theory,

532
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:46.190
which means that every man is born with a mouth.
He's a consumer.

533
00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.380
And that splits up the pie.

534
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:53.220
But the marks is translate their theory as um,

535
00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:59.270
uh,
I've got it somewhere here and I don't remember what it is,
but man,

536
00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:04.040
hand theory that a man is born not only with a mouth to consume but a hands to

537
00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:06.180
do work.
And the question is if the,

538
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:10.400
that the socialist state can employ the hands to produce more than the mouth

539
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:14.580
requires.
So they didn't buy,
they,
they were very,
uh,

540
00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:19.070
in favor of a high population.
So in 1949,

541
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.390
mal becoming in charge of a very devastated country says in this quote,

542
00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:28.100
revolution plus production will enable China to feed and employed the large and

543
00:34:28.101 --> 00:34:29.780
growing population.

544
00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:33.950
No worry until they got some facts.

545
00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:39.650
1953 the country was stable enough that they took their first national census.

546
00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:40.791
At that time,

547
00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:45.080
they thought they had something like 426 million people and that the number had

548
00:34:45.081 --> 00:34:49.070
not been growing in the century because of all the civil and foreign worlds and

549
00:34:49.071 --> 00:34:52.370
natural calamities in China was a disaster.
So they thought,
well,

550
00:34:52.371 --> 00:34:55.130
population could,
can't grow under those situations.

551
00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:59.120
But then they took a census and they counted 600 million people,

552
00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:01.690
which was 50% more,
uh,

553
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:05.600
a third larger than they had expected that were there.

554
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:08.350
And the error,

555
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.020
what they expected to find and what they did find was equal to the whole us

556
00:35:12.021 --> 00:35:15.920
population at that time.
So it was big,
a big shock.

557
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:20.810
So they finally responded a rationally and immediately.

558
00:35:20.811 --> 00:35:24.110
China pass the contraceptives and induced abortion act,

559
00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:28.400
legalizing the importation in sale of contraceptives and legalizing

560
00:35:28.401 --> 00:35:32.150
sterilization and abortion.
It's one small problem.

561
00:35:32.151 --> 00:35:33.440
They didn't have any contraceptives,

562
00:35:33.441 --> 00:35:35.460
they didn't have the manufacturing facilities.

563
00:35:35.461 --> 00:35:40.130
So they legalize the importation of them and imported they Chinese had,
well,

564
00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.420
no foreign currency at that time.
It was way,

565
00:35:42.421 --> 00:35:47.100
way before any kind of economic progress.
Uh,
and so,
uh,

566
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:51.570
they just didn't,
didn't have it.
And the city's gotten,
you know,

567
00:35:51.571 --> 00:35:52.780
there were always some money in the city.

568
00:35:52.781 --> 00:35:56.740
So the city has got some of the foreign contraceptives,
uh,

569
00:35:57.570 --> 00:36:00.030
and but,
uh,
in the countryside where the vast,

570
00:36:00.031 --> 00:36:03.060
vast majority of the people lived at the time had basically no access.

571
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:06.090
And if they did have access,
they would have been able to afford them.

572
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:09.780
So the government policy was basically a meaningless.

573
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:14.220
And so what was the government to do?
So in,
in 56,

574
00:36:14.221 --> 00:36:18.090
they realized that just proclaiming something doesn't,
doesn't help.
So they said,

575
00:36:18.091 --> 00:36:22.860
well,
let's use traditional medicine.
And uh,
so,

576
00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.780
uh,
they,

577
00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:28.950
they asked all the traditional Chinese doctors,
you know,
what to do,

578
00:36:28.951 --> 00:36:32.160
how you must have traditional ways of,
of contraception,
of,

579
00:36:32.161 --> 00:36:36.930
of keeping women from having children.
And,
uh,

580
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:40.230
one of these became very well popularized,

581
00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:45.260
popularized in the press on the third day following her period,

582
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:49.290
a woman should ingest 14 live tadpoles,

583
00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:52.500
then 10 the next day.

584
00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.550
And then the woman would be assured sterility for five years.

585
00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:01.020
If the woman did this twice than traditional medicine,

586
00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:03.180
said that the woman will be permanently sterile.

587
00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.710
It's not totally clear whether this was the policy that the government was

588
00:37:07.711 --> 00:37:09.630
really behind.
This is the procedure of governments.

589
00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:13.050
But the press picked us up and it was a very big press thing,
uh,

590
00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:16.320
in China and was,
it was very,
um,

591
00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:19.500
very much followed by the people.
And the,

592
00:37:19.501 --> 00:37:24.240
the very small ecological movement in China really got worried to China.

593
00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:29.100
Then frogs would go extinct because people are eating all the,
all the tadpoles.

594
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:32.820
So finally the Chinese Academy of Science took it up,
uh,

595
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:34.860
got this distinct and I get did some experiments.

596
00:37:34.861 --> 00:37:39.810
I don't know exactly what they did,
but they said,
no,
this doesn't work.
And so,

597
00:37:39.811 --> 00:37:42.420
okay,
it's kind of go back through,
back to the drawing.
What are we going to do?

598
00:37:42.421 --> 00:37:44.340
So the next round,
57,
58,

599
00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:48.540
was used acupuncture as a contraceptive [inaudible] puncture and try has never

600
00:37:48.541 --> 00:37:51.510
been used for the kinds of things it is used for here.

601
00:37:51.870 --> 00:37:55.080
And there's no evidence of any effect from this for anything except the spread

602
00:37:55.081 --> 00:37:57.540
of hepatitis because the needles weren't sterilized.

603
00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:59.400
You can see that throughout Asia.

604
00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.480
I may have mentioned this in the previous lecture,
but so they said,
okay,

605
00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:06.240
let's try it for contraception.

606
00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:09.840
And of course that didn't work any better or whatsoever.

607
00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:17.190
So,
um,
so politically the government,
again,

608
00:38:17.191 --> 00:38:20.580
it's a very new thing and the traditional Marxists,

609
00:38:20.581 --> 00:38:25.440
we're still opposed to family planning and other more modern aspects.

610
00:38:25.441 --> 00:38:28.950
The government on favorite,
so the government was uncertain and divided on this.

611
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.690
But in 1956,
the premiere join lie at the time,

612
00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:37.000
very powerful guy urged limitations on childbirth.

613
00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:42.130
And he was supported by influential economists who were very much influenced by

614
00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:46.690
Western ideas,
but from Martha's onward Western ideas on population.

615
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:49.720
But the very next year,
so in 56,

616
00:38:49.721 --> 00:38:53.290
which was when they started all this really trying to push a birth control,

617
00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:58.550
the very next year,
that was one of the Chinese purges and 57,
they had the,
uh,

618
00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.440
the campaigning,

619
00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:03.550
the what they call the anti rightest campaign and people who are too influenced

620
00:39:03.551 --> 00:39:06.220
by Western ideas.
And Western economic ideas.

621
00:39:06.221 --> 00:39:10.840
Remember Malthus is considered the father of western economics were purged and

622
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:15.040
with them when,
uh,
the family planning a campaign.

623
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:20.590
So in the end,
the early back and forth thing on,

624
00:39:20.591 --> 00:39:23.290
on family planning came to no effect.
There were no methods,

625
00:39:23.291 --> 00:39:27.070
no train family planning personnel and no facilities in rural area and no

626
00:39:27.071 --> 00:39:29.080
tradition of anything.

627
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.660
In 1958,
uh,

628
00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:37.090
the party started organizing communes and you probably know a fair amount about

629
00:39:37.091 --> 00:39:37.211
them.

630
00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:42.211
These were giant agricultural enterprises with something like 5,000 families in

631
00:39:42.641 --> 00:39:46.780
a single communion communion mean all the production from all the farm land it

632
00:39:46.781 --> 00:39:51.781
owned by 5,000 families was pooled and they produce together and they consume

633
00:39:52.301 --> 00:39:56.530
together.
And that particular summer for climatic reasons,
the harvest was,

634
00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:01.330
was turned out to be excellent.
And as the data came in,
the,

635
00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:02.620
the,
the leaders of,

636
00:40:02.621 --> 00:40:05.440
of Communist China at the time decided that the communes were the answer.

637
00:40:05.441 --> 00:40:10.441
Look at how well we've done under this commune system and the [inaudible],

638
00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:14.290
the lower down cadres who are going to be rewarded or punished depend on their

639
00:40:14.291 --> 00:40:18.610
production.
They,
of course,
inflated figures,
uh,
wildly.
And,

640
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.020
uh,
they,
they claim that the rural production I had doubled,

641
00:40:23.021 --> 00:40:26.860
had increased 10 fold or even scores of times.

642
00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:30.190
So it was really,
there was indeed a good harvest,

643
00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:33.470
but then that got inflated enormously due to the,
uh,

644
00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:38.740
so we say the weak political process.
Um,

645
00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:44.680
and so in 58,
after a couple of years of trying this,
uh,

646
00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:49.050
uh,
officially pushing family planning,
but,
but without any,

647
00:40:49.051 --> 00:40:50.350
any real policy that worked,

648
00:40:50.351 --> 00:40:54.520
and with getting rid of the rightest who were in favor of it,
in 58,

649
00:40:54.521 --> 00:40:59.000
they reversed again.
They went away from family planning and they,
they said,
uh,

650
00:40:59.080 --> 00:40:59.621
the central,

651
00:40:59.621 --> 00:41:04.180
the Communist Party's central committee said in 1958 that the communes were so

652
00:41:04.181 --> 00:41:08.950
successful that China no longer had to worry about overpopulation to the

653
00:41:08.951 --> 00:41:11.910
contrary.
The forthcoming problem would be quote,

654
00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:15.520
not so much overpopulation as the shortage of manpower.

655
00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:20.290
And basically what they get carried away with Jonathan Spence and his history of

656
00:41:20.291 --> 00:41:22.540
China talks about this and says,

657
00:41:22.541 --> 00:41:27.320
the vision of Utopia was altogether intoxicating.
Whenever your,

658
00:41:27.321 --> 00:41:30.820
your view of the world gets out of kilter with the reality,

659
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:33.010
disasters is right behind.

660
00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:38.180
And the disaster was indeed not far behind.
And that was the great leap forward.

661
00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:43.490
So the context of the great leap forward is that the u s in particular had

662
00:41:43.491 --> 00:41:47.330
threatened China,
had been threatening China with nuclear,
basically annihilation.

663
00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:50.300
And now had answered with this that I have so many people,

664
00:41:50.301 --> 00:41:54.870
if you kill a couple of hundred million,
who cares,
you know,
very,
very brutal,
uh,

665
00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:59.360
response and counter and counter response.
But the answer,

666
00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:02.900
Mao and everybody trying new ways to industrialize as fast as they possibly can

667
00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:05.930
to catch up to America in military might.

668
00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:11.360
And he decided that China was not industrializing fast enough and had to catch

669
00:42:11.361 --> 00:42:15.950
up to the western level right away.
And so he told,

670
00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:19.600
he ordered the orders,
went out from the central bureaucracy,
uh,

671
00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.060
to put all their efforts into industrialization.
Forget about farming.

672
00:42:23.061 --> 00:42:26.750
We have plenty of food.
The communes are producing plenty of food.

673
00:42:26.751 --> 00:42:31.370
We don't have to worry about that.
Uh,
in fact,
in your backyard,

674
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:35.790
put iron smelters in,
build,
build little furnaces.
And,
and,

675
00:42:35.791 --> 00:42:38.750
and smell your iron in your backyard.

676
00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.620
And so people didn't have any iron ore.
So what they did,

677
00:42:42.621 --> 00:42:45.260
they took their pots and pans,
put it into the smelter,

678
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.050
then they took their farm implements and put it in into the shelter.

679
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:49.360
And if you're from China,

680
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.110
remember your parents or somebody talking about these days.
Again you're doing,

681
00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:57.800
we don't have too many native borns there,
but it was a very,

682
00:42:57.801 --> 00:43:00.020
very big thing though.
The backyard iron.

683
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:05.870
And it resulted in two things.
One,
when you destroy agricultural implements,

684
00:43:05.871 --> 00:43:08.720
your I go to a really does go go to hell.

685
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:13.130
And the iron that you can smell it in backyards is not very good iron.

686
00:43:13.131 --> 00:43:15.470
So it's not very actually very useful.

687
00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:19.040
But decide result is that agricultural production crashed,

688
00:43:19.041 --> 00:43:23.900
absolutely crashed at the same time as part of the communes.

689
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:29.230
The communal kitchens were established where everyone could get together and the

690
00:43:29.691 --> 00:43:32.690
purpose of they're the original purposes was twofold.
One,

691
00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.660
they want Chinese work very hard to modernize the country,

692
00:43:35.661 --> 00:43:36.710
to build up the country.

693
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.340
And each family going home for lunch and dinner is a huge amount of labor

694
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.230
involved in preparing meals,

695
00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:45.760
especially with a fairly primitive of food cooking and gathering,

696
00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:46.940
preparing technology.

697
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:51.860
And so if you have a staff dedicated per food and you make food for thousands of

698
00:43:51.861 --> 00:43:54.680
people,
it can be done very efficient in terms of time.

699
00:43:54.681 --> 00:43:57.320
It's economically very efficient sort of thing.

700
00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:02.750
It also was a fit pro feminist measure that who had to do the work at home was

701
00:44:02.751 --> 00:44:05.390
the women,
the women were working in the fields,

702
00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.310
then the men could come home and relax,

703
00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:10.160
but the women had to then take care of the children and bill the food.

704
00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:15.260
So it was both an economic rationalization measure and it was a pro feminist

705
00:44:15.261 --> 00:44:19.670
measure put.
The result was that consumption sword,

706
00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:23.540
uh,
traditionally like all poor people around the world,

707
00:44:23.541 --> 00:44:27.890
the Chinese are very a abstemious.
No,
every grain of rice counts in,
in a,

708
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:29.930
in a poor family.
If there's food available,

709
00:44:29.931 --> 00:44:34.931
you eat just exactly what you need to stay alive and you store away the rest for

710
00:44:35.401 --> 00:44:37.800
the future because the future is always very uncertain.

711
00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.350
But when you have a communal kitchen,

712
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:44.190
it doesn't do any good to not eat your fill because if you don't eat your fill

713
00:44:44.191 --> 00:44:47.940
someone,
someone else will.
There's no individual,
uh,
accounting,

714
00:44:47.941 --> 00:44:49.620
no individual responsibility.

715
00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:54.860
So everyone ate a lot and consumption sword at just the time that production is

716
00:44:55.891 --> 00:45:00.130
going down.
And The d,
The concatenation of those two things was,

717
00:45:00.131 --> 00:45:01.320
it was the disaster.

718
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:05.460
And as the disaster unfolded,

719
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:10.030
China was sufficiently authoritarian at the time that the,

720
00:45:10.050 --> 00:45:14.160
the cadres have to pass up good news to the higher levels.

721
00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:18.660
So news of the disaster that was unfolding before,
uh,

722
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:21.840
the local people's eyes was not passed up higher levels.

723
00:45:21.841 --> 00:45:25.230
And apparently the higher levels really believed that the agriculture was

724
00:45:25.231 --> 00:45:30.231
keeping up with all this consumption or the higher levels only receiving,

725
00:45:30.361 --> 00:45:33.630
especially now cause evenly glowing reports of production,

726
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.640
agricultural production in the countryside.

727
00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:40.830
So what happened was the great famine of the great leap forward,

728
00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:45.820
several hundred million people,
uh,
became under nourished,
uh,

729
00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:46.853
during this period.

730
00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:52.310
And then people start sources undernourishment and then people starved massive

731
00:45:52.681 --> 00:45:55.410
famines from 59 to 61.

732
00:45:56.130 --> 00:46:01.110
We don't know how many people died in these famines.
The estimates are 20,
30,
40,

733
00:46:01.111 --> 00:46:04.740
50 million people dying of starvation.

734
00:46:04.741 --> 00:46:09.680
But what it was,
we don't know.
So this is uh,

735
00:46:09.720 --> 00:46:11.640
let me show you the other one for us.
This is an old,

736
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:16.830
this is world population and you can go it back further except for the black.

737
00:46:16.831 --> 00:46:18.660
There is no other bleeds.
See that blip there?

738
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:24.750
That's the great leap forward in China as part of world population there is,

739
00:46:24.751 --> 00:46:27.090
if you carry world population back further,

740
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:30.090
you don't see any blip like that except the black death.

741
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:35.370
All the other disasters are not comfortable with this shows sort of a western

742
00:46:35.371 --> 00:46:37.280
aesthetic going from something like a,

743
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:41.400
a loss of 30 or 40 million people.

744
00:46:42.090 --> 00:46:47.090
The official Chinese statistics show the death rate going from 10 million to 25

745
00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:50.550
million.
And you have to look at the area and that cause there's one,
two,

746
00:46:50.551 --> 00:46:51.840
three years of it.

747
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:57.100
So they're estimating more like maybe 25 million deaths.
This,

748
00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:58.770
the official Chinese statistics.

749
00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:02.160
And of course in that extreme poverty that the birth rate just,

750
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:06.010
just crashes and then recovers when,

751
00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:11.090
when food becomes available again.
So the,
the,

752
00:47:11.091 --> 00:47:14.130
the moral of the story is that,
uh,

753
00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.680
the Chinese seem to have a,
in the early stages of,
of the commune system,

754
00:47:19.681 --> 00:47:22.080
the Chinese seem to have eradicated famine.

755
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:26.400
They had had 115 years of miserable history.
The communists come in,

756
00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:31.300
things get better very quickly,
very fast.
They decide,
they have the answer,

757
00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:35.500
they decide they don't have to pay attention to basic realities like population.

758
00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:37.120
And uh,

759
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:42.340
so they get a very unreal view of reality.

760
00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:43.870
And meanwhile,

761
00:47:43.871 --> 00:47:47.680
the country is actually still walking on the edge of disaster before they were

762
00:47:47.681 --> 00:47:50.590
under the edge and falling off to disaster before the revolution,

763
00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.710
after revolution,
they were still on the edge.
But that wasn't realized.

764
00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:54.970
So was stupidity.

765
00:47:54.971 --> 00:47:59.971
A political mistake pushes them over the edge and you have this huge amount of

766
00:48:01.391 --> 00:48:06.220
death.
And so you should be aware that when people talk about,

767
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.050
you know,
environmental limits,

768
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:11.470
what happens with population and the world,

769
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:14.560
that there's all kinds of physical limits to the number of people.

770
00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.920
But the most delicate thing that humans make,

771
00:48:17.921 --> 00:48:21.940
other social and political arrangements,
when things get very tight,

772
00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:27.240
it's almost always not an underlying fundamental resource problem or something.

773
00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:30.490
It's people's political response to it.

774
00:48:30.491 --> 00:48:34.210
There their interpersonal response to it that goes out of whack and they start

775
00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:39.160
making massive mistakes like this and then the world false,
false apart.

776
00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:43.390
So it's the political and social arrangements that people make with each other

777
00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:46.670
that are the most delicate and,
uh,

778
00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:51.670
population stress we'll usually have it's disaster effects through acting

779
00:48:51.671 --> 00:48:55.330
through the political and social arrangements.

780
00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:03.300
Okay.
Then the Chinese did not have any rest after this.
Uh,

781
00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:08.020
the great leap forward of the 60s and the early sixties got transformed into the

782
00:49:08.021 --> 00:49:10.780
cultural revolution of the mid sixties,
sixties,

783
00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:16.060
and there was more cows and after the great famine and the government learned

784
00:49:16.061 --> 00:49:19.990
its lesson and again tried to institute birth control,
Flip Flop,
flip flop.

785
00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.380
And again,
the method was largely a propaganda

786
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:29.260
and the kind of propaganda this time was aimed a lot at men and the kind of

787
00:49:29.261 --> 00:49:33.850
things that the cronies press,
we're counting we're men before the age of 25.

788
00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:34.391
Remember again,

789
00:49:34.391 --> 00:49:39.391
it's a restriction on the young men from sex were described as if you have sex,

790
00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.610
excessive dissipation of blood,
bodily fluids,

791
00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:47.680
sexual neurasthenia,
low spirits,
headaches,

792
00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:52.300
discomfort all over the body.
Emaciation dizziness,

793
00:49:52.301 --> 00:49:55.720
tension,
memory loss,
premature old age,

794
00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:59.410
mental and physical pain and impotence.

795
00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:02.710
Now I've heard this from students as as their problems,

796
00:50:02.711 --> 00:50:05.440
but they usually now attribute to lack of sex.

797
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:10.040
But the Chinese at that time were attributed to sex.
So you,

798
00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:14.640
you take your chances.
Nevertheless,
uh,

799
00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:20.160
the situation in the cities was such that the conditions there,

800
00:50:20.531 --> 00:50:22.450
the housing scares scarcity,

801
00:50:22.451 --> 00:50:26.980
the poverty were such that people indeed in the cities did,
uh,

802
00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:29.930
reduce their fertility.
And by 1960,

803
00:50:29.931 --> 00:50:32.450
somewhere in 1964 and 1966,

804
00:50:32.540 --> 00:50:37.490
a window of the urban fertility drop too low,
three births per woman.

805
00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:43.100
Uh,
uh,
and by 1974,

806
00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:46.220
urban nonagricultural,
uh,
women,

807
00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:50.780
their fertility was reduced to replacement level.

808
00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:55.640
So rather rapidly urban fertility came down and it's continued to come down.

809
00:50:56.030 --> 00:51:00.830
And in 1980,
it was one,
1.1 very low,
uh,
urban,
uh,

810
00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:05.870
fertility,
but during the culture revolution had,

811
00:51:05.871 --> 00:51:09.560
had remained very high cause it was chaos and nobody was watching the store.

812
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:14.370
In 1970,
it was 6.4 among rural women,

813
00:51:14.371 --> 00:51:18.710
6.4 children,
which is basically the traditional number from way,
way back.

814
00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:20.780
And so there was basically no conscious,

815
00:51:20.781 --> 00:51:24.110
no conscious fertility control among the rural women.

816
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:26.440
By 1969,

817
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:31.450
the population past 800 million and in 1970 21% of births,

818
00:51:32.571 --> 00:51:37.430
one out of five were first births,
17%,
almost the same.
We're second births.

819
00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:42.640
But 62% were third or higher order births in in 1970.

820
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.980
So almost everyone was having three or more children.

821
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:52.920
So when political stability was finally restored after the disruption of,
of,

822
00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:56.000
of the cult,
the great leap forward than the culture revolution,

823
00:51:56.360 --> 00:52:00.230
the government really introduced a serious vigorous family planning program

824
00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:05.240
starting in 1971.
Uh,
they introduced the port in one,

825
00:52:05.241 --> 00:52:07.790
she shao later,
longer,
fewer.

826
00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:11.900
And what they proposed was later marriage,
uh,

827
00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:15.860
longer birth into roles leading to fewer children over all.

828
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.760
And uh,

829
00:52:19.850 --> 00:52:24.710
this was propagandized very heavily,
but it's debate,
this is debatable,

830
00:52:24.711 --> 00:52:28.760
but there was generally considered to be not an awful lot of coercion involved

831
00:52:28.761 --> 00:52:32.300
in,
it was more or less a voluntary,
uh,
campaign.

832
00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:37.580
And I want to show you one graph if I can.
Okay.

833
00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:43.100
Here's the graph of the total fertility rate in China.

834
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:48.140
And I have,
I've taken out the years,
I'll show you the years in a minute.

835
00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:50.510
When do you think,
so you had the one,

836
00:52:50.511 --> 00:52:54.200
she shall the voluntary policy and then that lasted for about 10 years.

837
00:52:54.201 --> 00:52:58.700
And then you had the one child policy,
which was at least in the beginning,

838
00:52:58.701 --> 00:53:02.630
not very voluntary.
And you've heard about that.
Where do you think,
uh,

839
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:07.160
the one trial,
uh,
the one child policy starts,
we're in this graph,

840
00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.430
the effectiveness of political programs.

841
00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.633
<v 2>No idea</v>

842
00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:16.310
<v 0>what was,
do you think the one child policy was effective?</v>

843
00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:18.560
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

844
00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:19.880
<v 0>Yes.
Therefore you put it,</v>

845
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:25.830
make a guess.
I know you don't have

846
00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:30.450
right about there.
Okay.

847
00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:35.970
That's the great leap forward decline.
The one child policy starts here.

848
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:37.920
Levels off.

849
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:42.920
This decline taking about 10 years was though during the won,

850
00:53:43.051 --> 00:53:46.050
she shall period during the,
the,
the,
um,

851
00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:51.860
during the more or less voluntary a period that the big drop in Chinese

852
00:53:52.321 --> 00:53:56.790
fertility happens here.
And then they introduced the one child policy.

853
00:53:56.791 --> 00:54:01.770
Actually right about here this,
I'll just show you the actual dates or not.

854
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.330
So here's 1980.

855
00:54:03.331 --> 00:54:08.331
The one child policy is introduced here and immediately the fertility rises and

856
00:54:08.821 --> 00:54:11.160
then stabilizes.
And I'll show you later.
Eventually.

857
00:54:11.161 --> 00:54:16.080
It does slow down for all kinds of reasons.
Let me go back.

858
00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:20.490
So the,
the important thing to know is that it was the 19th steps.
This,

859
00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:24.060
the drop is 1970 19 in this 10 years,

860
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:29.450
the 10 years before the one trial policy is when Chinese fertility really took

861
00:54:29.761 --> 00:54:34.080
this,
uh,
enormous drunk.
And,

862
00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:39.570
uh,
what happened was an until the 1970s,
as I've described,

863
00:54:39.571 --> 00:54:43.680
there were really no family planning services and the vast rural areas and only

864
00:54:43.681 --> 00:54:46.410
limited facilities and in a few of the large cities,

865
00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:49.530
but starting in the 1970s as part of this policy,

866
00:54:49.531 --> 00:54:53.280
contraceptives were made available,
a huge amount of propaganda.

867
00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:56.070
I was made to counteract any taboos.
I mean,

868
00:54:56.100 --> 00:55:00.000
peasant people have water to booze and established late marriage and the small

869
00:55:00.001 --> 00:55:02.370
family as the desirable norm.

870
00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:06.600
And uh,
this,

871
00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:11.430
this drop we've seen drops something like this fast since then.
But this drop,

872
00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:15.300
it was at the time just incredible,
uh,
to,
to,
uh,

873
00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:17.160
foreign observers that in,

874
00:55:17.161 --> 00:55:21.870
in one decade to go down from six to half year for more than half your failures

875
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:26.100
is about two and a half in one decade in a place as so vast.

876
00:55:26.101 --> 00:55:30.600
And so traditional is trying to,
was at that time just unbelievable.
I mean,

877
00:55:30.601 --> 00:55:33.750
it turned out to be true.
The Chinese statistics were indeed,
uh,
uh,

878
00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:38.180
quite good on this.
And,
uh,
it,

879
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:43.200
it shows what a family planning program in this case introduced with the full,

880
00:55:43.630 --> 00:55:47.260
uh,
effort of,
of,
of the government,
uh,

881
00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:49.050
can really accomplish.

882
00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:53.190
And scholar said is the most extraordinary reduction in fertility and a large

883
00:55:53.191 --> 00:55:55.620
population ever recorded in human history.

884
00:55:57.660 --> 00:55:59.430
But in 1979,

885
00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:03.020
the results of the second national census,
uh,

886
00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:07.650
were released and it was clear that the population was approaching 1 billion

887
00:56:07.651 --> 00:56:10.380
people.
Now to us nowadays,
you know,

888
00:56:10.410 --> 00:56:13.200
we're used to hearing of China as having more than a billion people.

889
00:56:13.201 --> 00:56:14.250
But back then,

890
00:56:14.251 --> 00:56:18.390
the idea of a single country having a billion people was absolutely mind

891
00:56:18.391 --> 00:56:21.030
boggling.
And remember,

892
00:56:21.031 --> 00:56:25.600
1979 was way before the economic miracle.
So these were a billion,

893
00:56:25.601 --> 00:56:30.040
very poor people,
uh,
that were going to be on earth.

894
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:32.050
And as the Chinese saw it,

895
00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:36.910
very explicitly sought the population they had had very good economic gains to

896
00:56:36.911 --> 00:56:38.890
the time.
Nothing like the boom that happened later.

897
00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.930
But they really had made good progress,

898
00:56:41.110 --> 00:56:46.110
but they perceive their population growth had eaten up all of their gains.

899
00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:48.670
So for instance,
uh,

900
00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:53.700
gay grain production increased in any rate of 2.3% between 57 and 78 the year

901
00:56:55.361 --> 00:56:59.530
before the census.
But per capita consumption,
which had started extremely low,

902
00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:04.210
increased only 0.2% during this time.
So it's very small,

903
00:57:04.540 --> 00:57:06.460
huge production increase in production,

904
00:57:06.461 --> 00:57:10.950
2.3% per year over a 10 year,
20 year period.

905
00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:14.710
21 year period is very,
very good.
But when your population grows,

906
00:57:14.711 --> 00:57:15.610
it nearly the same rate.

907
00:57:15.611 --> 00:57:18.760
You end up with a very tiny improvement in standard of living

908
00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:24.550
housing,
spaced increased by half a billion square meters.

909
00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:28.250
They went on a house and home building,
you know,
poor small home,
but,

910
00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:32.410
but something,
a half a billion square meters,
meters like a square yard.

911
00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:37.990
Uh,
but uh,
but because,
but the per capita,
because population growth,

912
00:57:37.991 --> 00:57:42.991
the per capita housing was down from 4.5 square meters to 3.6 square meters per

913
00:57:43.601 --> 00:57:47.980
capita,
the s three s three meters or nine feet by nine feet,
you know.

914
00:57:47.981 --> 00:57:52.890
And that was what the per capita housing down in this period of,
of,
of,
uh,

915
00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:56.290
of,
uh,
of,
of an improving economy.

916
00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:01.720
The arable land fell from a quarter of an acre in 1949 from a half an acre in

917
00:58:01.721 --> 00:58:06.460
1949 to a quarter of an acre in 83.
And it's gone down since then.

918
00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:12.930
Also the government from the census realized how young the population was and a

919
00:58:13.901 --> 00:58:16.660
young population means what's going to happen,

920
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:20.280
momentum that the,
there,

921
00:58:20.281 --> 00:58:23.170
there are so many more young people coming into reproductive age than one's

922
00:58:23.171 --> 00:58:26.360
leaving it,
that you're going to have a lot more child bearers.

923
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:32.910
And they realize this from the 1982 senses a little bit.

924
00:58:33.791 --> 00:58:38.380
Another census they took the population period was 45 million women in their

925
00:58:38.381 --> 00:58:42.070
forties leaving reproductive age,
60 million,

926
00:58:42.130 --> 00:58:47.130
one third bigger in their thirties 80 million in their twenties and 125 million

927
00:58:48.251 --> 00:58:51.430
women in their teens.
So if the teens are coming,

928
00:58:51.431 --> 00:58:53.290
just starting to come into reproductive ages,

929
00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:58.390
that means basically a tripling of the number of child bearing women coming into

930
00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:02.230
three times as many childbearing women were coming into reproductive age as

931
00:59:02.231 --> 00:59:06.050
relieving reproductive age.
Uh,

932
00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:12.040
so even though they had achieved this books,

933
00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:16.030
this a rather incredible fertility decline,

934
00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:21.140
they realize that because of momentum,
that population would keep growing,
uh,
for,

935
00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:25.490
for,
uh,
for decades yet.
And they were really worried about it.

936
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:31.630
So at that time the TFR was something like 2.5 when they're deciding what to do

937
00:59:31.671 --> 00:59:33.530
with it.
And

938
00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:39.560
if they're not,
if you have at this age distribution,
this time,

939
00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:42.230
2.5 children per women,

940
00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:48.010
and if three times as many women are going to enter reproductive age,

941
00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:54.170
uh,
what do you have to do to keep this down?

942
00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:58.590
You have to go,
it's mathematically you have to have one third,
you know,

943
00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:00.650
three times as many women,
you have to have one third.

944
01:00:00.651 --> 01:00:03.770
The number of births they were having here,
three times,

945
01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:05.810
many women to keep the number of children their son.

946
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:07.700
And because you don't reduce the number of babies,

947
01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:10.430
you have to reduce fertility by one third,

948
01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:15.700
so 2.5 divided by three is 0.8 so the demographics of their current fertility

949
01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:22.340
loaf,
low fertility rate 2.5 the current low fertility rate,

950
01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:26.390
but the tripling of of women coming into reproductive ages,

951
01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:30.440
the mathematics tells you you have to say you have to get somehow get your

952
01:00:30.441 --> 01:00:35.441
fertility rate down to 0.8 and they decided that was going to be very difficult.

953
01:00:35.970 --> 01:00:40.340
And the institute,
the one child policy at that time,
at the lowest,

954
01:00:40.341 --> 01:00:44.360
their birth rate had ever been probably forever in Chinese history was exactly

955
01:00:44.361 --> 01:00:47.480
the time that they introduced the one child policy

956
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:54.350
years after implementation.
They were like an [inaudible] 86 which is six years,

957
01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:56.060
seven years after implementation.

958
01:00:56.270 --> 01:01:00.560
There's still a million more births than the worthy or earlier that the number

959
01:01:00.561 --> 01:01:02.510
of births kept rising.

960
01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:07.840
The policy was not a success in the sense in the extreme sense of the Chinese

961
01:01:08.691 --> 01:01:10.430
government wanted it to be.

962
01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:15.020
They wanted to keep the year in the year 2000.

963
01:01:15.230 --> 01:01:19.040
They want her to keep their population under one under 1.2 billion.

964
01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:20.610
When they started this they were,

965
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:24.740
they were like 800 and something billion and they were desperately hoping to

966
01:01:24.741 --> 01:01:28.670
keep it under 1.2 billion and they didn't do it.
Uh,

967
01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.880
it was 1.3 billion.
So

968
01:01:34.130 --> 01:01:38.810
on paper the policy was quite draconian.
Um,

969
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:41.930
in the 82 83 regulations included,

970
01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:46.160
each village would get a quota for the number of births that year in the
village.

971
01:01:46.161 --> 01:01:49.220
Leaders would have to ration this out on the basis of a waiting list.

972
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:54.800
And of course only couples with no prior children could get on the list that a

973
01:01:54.801 --> 01:01:57.510
mandatory IUD insertion,
uh,

974
01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.470
for women who already had one child.

975
01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:04.790
And if a woman had an unauthorized pregnancy and abortion was supposed to be

976
01:02:04.791 --> 01:02:06.200
mandatory,
and you,

977
01:02:06.201 --> 01:02:11.030
you heard the story about that really you should note that again,
it wasn't,

978
01:02:11.031 --> 01:02:12.790
the government had nothing.
The abortion that,

979
01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.950
that Chink told you about had nothing to do in one sense that nothing

980
01:02:15.951 --> 01:02:17.330
immediately to do with the government.

981
01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.670
She did the abortion way before anybody knew about it,

982
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:22.950
who coworkers didn't know about it at her workplace,

983
01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:26.070
didn't know about government officials,
didn't know about it.
It was the suasion.

984
01:02:26.071 --> 01:02:29.190
It was the effect from other people.
It was these village,

985
01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:33.090
these committees that would keep visiting you and keep bugging you that cost her

986
01:02:33.091 --> 01:02:37.230
say,
okay,
I'm going to avoid all this pain and just have the abortion right away.

987
01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:41.640
So in a sense the government didn't have to do anything about it.

988
01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.230
The spectrum abortion,

989
01:02:43.231 --> 01:02:48.231
the statistics are very interesting in China that sometime a little after this,

990
01:02:50.010 --> 01:02:54.300
uh,
unmarried sexuality started happening in traditional China that at least

991
01:02:54.301 --> 01:02:55.830
officially just plain didn't happen.

992
01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:00.270
But as the country modernizers one of the things you get into is,
is,

993
01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:02.010
is unmarried sexuality.

994
01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:05.580
And so girls were getting pregnant in an unmarried state and this was an

995
01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:10.120
unthinkable sort of thing.
So what happened to those girls that were pregnant?

996
01:03:10.170 --> 01:03:15.170
Non-Married their parents forced them to have an abortion.

997
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:19.350
So some statistics show that the number of abortions,

998
01:03:20.070 --> 01:03:21.970
which parents required their daughters,

999
01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:25.560
their unmarried pregnant daughters to have exceeded the number of abortions

1000
01:03:25.561 --> 01:03:29.160
forced under the one child policy because the one Jon Pelz also push

1001
01:03:29.161 --> 01:03:33.300
contraceptives.
So actually,
and contraception were decent.

1002
01:03:33.301 --> 01:03:38.130
So the number of abortions while high was not not off,
off,

1003
01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:41.400
off the map.
So,
uh,

1004
01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:44.250
the one child policy proceeded then.

1005
01:03:44.251 --> 01:03:48.270
There were absolutely no doubt about major human rights violations.

1006
01:03:48.271 --> 01:03:53.070
You heard about one story forced sterilizations forced abortions is absolutely

1007
01:03:53.071 --> 01:03:55.750
happened.
Uh,
and this was as you heard,

1008
01:03:55.751 --> 01:03:59.340
especially true if people had government jobs or worked in government own

1009
01:03:59.341 --> 01:04:01.890
factories and that was a big fraction of the economy.

1010
01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:06.450
Remember this was a socialist state and uh,

1011
01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:10.020
and abortion pills to be mandatory and sterilization,

1012
01:04:10.021 --> 01:04:11.640
even for any couple that had two more children.

1013
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:15.263
Did they have

1014
01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.010
<v 3>number of children dropped off</v>

1015
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:24.990
two adopted children.

1016
01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:29.780
So I mean a lot of people weren't supposed to have more than one child.
Yeah.

1017
01:04:29.850 --> 01:04:31.920
So did people didn't go through it.

1018
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:37.270
You are able to manage to have another child and drop their kids off it again?

1019
01:04:38.810 --> 01:04:42.020
<v 0>Yes,
I haven't.
Yes,
I haven't seen good statistics about that.</v>

1020
01:04:42.021 --> 01:04:45.050
And I don't know if the Chinese government,
let's help good statistics on that.

1021
01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:48.200
But the huge number of girls,

1022
01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:53.090
almost all girls were sent to two orphanages and

1023
01:04:55.340 --> 01:05:00.340
because of the poverty of the orphanages mean it was a lot of rural orphanages

1024
01:05:00.591 --> 01:05:01.940
that didn't have much money to begin with.

1025
01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:04.820
They basically couldn't take care of the babies.
Huge death rate,

1026
01:05:04.821 --> 01:05:06.690
huge maltreatment rate.

1027
01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:11.510
This is when American started adopting Chinese babies kind of en masse and many

1028
01:05:11.511 --> 01:05:14.960
Americans went over to pick up the baby and the stories that came back about,

1029
01:05:14.961 --> 01:05:17.590
you know,
children just tied into the May,

1030
01:05:17.591 --> 01:05:22.540
she hated soars over the body and really very,
very bad situations.
So yes,

1031
01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.470
yes,
indeed.
As far as we can tell,
but I don't have good statistics.
Yes.

1032
01:05:26.471 --> 01:05:29.170
A big surge in,
