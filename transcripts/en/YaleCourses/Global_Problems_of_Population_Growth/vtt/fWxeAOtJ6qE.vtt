1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.140
So this is data from Bolivia came out the end of last year and it's from the

2
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:08.220
year 2003.

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.550
Demographic data is always delayed because it takes a long time to collect it

4
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:14.040
and analyze it and so forth.
And this is

5
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.360
a family standard thing that's happening.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.180
This is various year bunches.
They take these surveys every five years.

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.390
This is from a thing called the demographic and health surveys,

8
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.620
which are done basically in every developing country of the world by their own

9
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:32.970
statistical service.

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.010
Every country has a fairly decent census and statistical service and they go and

11
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:39.960
ask,
uh,
either all the women,

12
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.650
if it's a census year or a subset of the women,
uh,

13
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.740
if it's not a census year and ask all kinds of questions,

14
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:47.880
some of which you will see.

15
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.710
The first thing of course is how many children do you have?
And they use,

16
00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:55.050
when they started these kinds of surveys,

17
00:00:55.051 --> 00:00:57.960
they used to ask men and they'd get a number,
the husband,

18
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.570
then they'd ask the wife,
get a different number.

19
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.800
And when they checked it turns out the woman who was right and the man had no

20
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:07.860
clue.
And Vena will tell you maybe some stories about,

21
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.560
it's not even a simple question even to the woman,

22
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.880
how many children have have you had.
Um,
uh,

23
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.440
but uh,
in a,

24
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.500
in a lot of ways men's data was unreliable and in the early days they really

25
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.310
were lynched in getting a real grounded,

26
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.100
they didn't know how many people that were in the world,

27
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:28.800
what the fragility rates were,
how fast population was growing.

28
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.560
So just to get the basic ideas,

29
00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.650
women were asked and from that data on,

30
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:37.560
men have somewhat been excluded from the data collection.

31
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.040
So a lot of what we know,
in fact almost all of what we know is,
is,
is about when,

32
00:01:42.041 --> 00:01:43.410
but nowadays it's changing.

33
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.460
Last number of years people realize it takes two to tango and men are starting

34
00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:53.541
to come more into the picture anyway here by 19 this is,

35
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:56.190
so this five year age group and this is the total fertility rate.

36
00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.640
And in 1965 and 70 and the years they were having six roughly 6.6 children.

37
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.700
Then gradually every five year increments it came down until the most recent

38
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.390
number is 3.8 children now.

39
00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:16.740
And keep that 3.8 number in mind cause we want to compare that to some other

40
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:21.180
things.
And uh,
you probably know a little about Bolivia.

41
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.510
It's totally Catholic,
it's quite poor,

42
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.290
it's mostly guys agricultural.
It's not very urbanized.

43
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.750
Education is at a fairly low level.

44
00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.570
And the status of women there is not really wonderful.

45
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.740
So with all those indicate what they call socio social indicators,

46
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.980
what would you think about the fertility desires of women in Bolivia high,

47
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:47.040
low,
high,

48
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:51.120
all of those are sort of standard classical factors that would make you think

49
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.230
that they want a lot of children.
But when you look at the actual data,

50
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.080
it's rather moderate.
It's uh,

51
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.050
it's still very high by our standards of,
of one or two children,
but still a,

52
00:03:03.051 --> 00:03:06.970
and it's still important for the world because at 3.8,
uh,

53
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.140
you don't double the population almost every,
not quite double it.

54
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:12.940
Every generation.
So this is quite high,

55
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:17.941
but it's nothing like a six and a seven child thing or in the past,

56
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:18.161
you know,

57
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:23.110
the traditional number of seven or eight or maybe nine children per woman.
So,

58
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.610
uh,
it,
it's,
it's a,
it's a situation of moderate,
uh,
fertility.

59
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.530
Now what the next kind of set of questions is,

60
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:35.590
well this is the number of children you're having.
How many do you want?

61
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.370
And they ask,
this is asked,
it's a very tricky kind of question as you,

62
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.160
you'll probably hear.
So there's a lot of different ways of spinning,
uh,

63
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.670
this question.
So the first is the ask you,
uh,

64
00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.910
did you want your last child?

65
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.870
And that has a whole complicated set of answers and just look out here for the,

66
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.500
for the total numbers that,

67
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.760
did you want the child at the time that you had it?
Well,

68
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.830
38% of women said,
yes,
I wanted it when I had it,

69
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.090
but not wanted it all somewhat larger.

70
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.650
40% of women didn't want it at all.
That's a surprising split.

71
00:04:20.651 --> 00:04:25.651
And then in between is another 20% of women who gave a more ambiguous answer.

72
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.190
Well,
I didn't really want the child right then,

73
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:33.190
but I probably would have wanted a child in the future.

74
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.250
And there's a lot of guesswork on the part of the respondent in that,

75
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:39.910
but what their future desires will be.
And as you know,

76
00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:43.810
humans change their mind every five minutes on important topics.

77
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.220
But that's in a very interesting statistic that there's more children unwanted

78
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.560
than are wanted.
And uh,
that's somewhere in,
in between.

79
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.510
Um,
now this probably a lot of bias in this data.

80
00:04:58.511 --> 00:05:03.010
This is not considered wonderful data because you're asking a woman who's just

81
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:06.190
had a child or fairly recently had a child.
Did you want that child?

82
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.590
What's the bias
to say yes?
I mean,

83
00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:16.090
it's very,
you have to really not like not like that child in order to say,

84
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:18.460
Oh yeah,
I had him,
but I didn't want them.
You know,

85
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:23.110
it happens and you see that at 40% of women do say that,

86
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.041
but this is,

87
00:05:24.041 --> 00:05:28.420
data is probably biased to put more kids in this category.

88
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.400
Then what the woman really feels,
although again,
uh,

89
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:39.310
intentions are,
are very changeable and attitudes toward other people,

90
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.230
husbands,
children,
you know,
one minute you love them,

91
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.140
next minute you hate them and so forth.
So that's problematic.
Uh,

92
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.710
the data there.
So,
oh,

93
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.100
so one way of getting around that particular problem is to ask him,

94
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.830
do you want another child in the future?
That's,

95
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.360
that's more volitional.

96
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:02.660
That's not saying I did something wrong or if something that I didn't want.

97
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.960
And so here's that,
uh,

98
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.170
set of data and all this from the same demographic and health survey.

99
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.180
And again,
it's sort of what you would expect.
This is women who don't want,

100
00:06:14.181 --> 00:06:16.730
want to stop childbearing,
don't want any more children.

101
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.750
If they've had no children already,
very smooth,

102
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:25.310
very few of them don't,
don't want any children's six,
six and a half percent.

103
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.840
And they've had one child,
30 already,
30% say one child's enough.

104
00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.410
I'm ready to stop.
If they had two children,

105
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.580
you're up to two thirds of the women.
Now say,
that's enough for me.

106
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:39.920
I want to stop.
And when you get to three,

107
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.250
you're almost at the maximum and then foreign above here into the 90 to 91,

108
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:48.440
92%.

109
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.850
So you'll notice it's kind of interesting that it rises and then it stays flat.

110
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.510
So there's about 8% of women who no matter how many children they have,

111
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.090
they always say,
no,
I want more.
I don't want to stop.

112
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.360
So this is what we call very traditional women,
uh,

113
00:07:06.361 --> 00:07:11.160
that as many as God gives me.
Uh,
here,
here comes,
uh,

114
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.370
in,
in one version of it,
but it's 8%.

115
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:18.371
It's a very small number of women who don't seem to have an idea that of some

116
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:21.410
number at which they want to stop or some of them they've already had,

117
00:07:21.411 --> 00:07:25.820
whether they want to now,
now stop.
Okay,

118
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.800
so now you can,

119
00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:36.350
you can ask another kind of question.
Uh,

120
00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:41.390
you say this is called an an ideal number of children.
And you ask a question.

121
00:07:41.391 --> 00:07:45.080
Like,
if you could go back to the beginning before you had any children,

122
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:49.310
how many children would you have wanted as your ideal number?

123
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:54.790
And you get these kinds of numbers that women who have no children want to have

124
00:07:57.681 --> 00:08:02.240
to point who now have no children asking what they think their ideal was.

125
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.930
They want 2.1 children,
women who already have one children,

126
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:11.170
2.1 those that have to say 2.4 and then the number goes on up,

127
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.450
including women who have six or more children.

128
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.460
Now it's pretty

129
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:26.350
clear that one should really expect this kind of thing because the simplest,

130
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:30.110
most obvious reasons,
women who want more children have more children.

131
00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.660
So as you have more children,

132
00:08:32.661 --> 00:08:36.050
that's a sign that you wanted more children and that certainly may be the

133
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:38.720
biggest factor,
just a very simple kind of thing.

134
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:43.280
Another factor is women who have had more children are older.

135
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.700
Remember we're talking about a period in history.

136
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:51.350
I mean this is recent where ideas are changing fertility's changing standards

137
00:08:51.351 --> 00:08:53.690
and norms and personal desires are changing.

138
00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:58.691
So these older women just by the age factor will probably be of a somewhat older

139
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:04.920
generation and they won't go into.
But this looks at that.

140
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:09.150
Here's the age of woman.
And again,
how many,
if you went back to the beginning,

141
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:11.010
how many children would you have liked?

142
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.840
And you get just an age factor would not wildly different from this.

143
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:21.000
So just generational change,
uh,
is a bigger factor in that then,

144
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.310
uh,
you might expect,

145
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:27.120
and also in this rise is what we've just talked about,

146
00:09:27.121 --> 00:09:29.640
that women already had a bunch of children,
you know,

147
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.170
when they reconstruct back what they used to think or now think that they would

148
00:09:34.171 --> 00:09:35.730
think that,
you know,
again,

149
00:09:35.731 --> 00:09:39.060
well I have three on either happy or whatever they think about it,

150
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.680
it's hard for them to say,
no,
I don't want,
uh,
this many.

151
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:49.140
So have you noticed anything funny?
Now you think about the number,

152
00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.270
these numbers and the number I told you to remember,

153
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.590
no class of woman wants more than 3.3 children.

154
00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.870
Most of the women are in the two range and only those that have six and more

155
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:07.770
children want 3.3 and the same.
If you look it out by age,

156
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:12.030
no group of women wants more than three.
What did I say about how many?

157
00:10:12.031 --> 00:10:15.690
They're having 3.8.
So,
okay,

158
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.630
this now accords with the other stuff that you've seen,

159
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:23.220
that women want few,
it looks like women want fewer children,

160
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.540
then they're having,
well this is Bolivia.
Uh,

161
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:32.660
maybe there's something a little bit special about Bolivia and you always have

162
00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:36.600
to check and see whether you're getting some sort of outlier or is this the

163
00:10:36.601 --> 00:10:41.601
general situation so that you don't have to look at that too closely yet?

164
00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.430
Uh,
so one of the,
uh,
an economist at the World Bank I named Lance Pritchard,

165
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.500
uh,
did a paper and the first thing he did was collect all that data,
uh,

166
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.520
that from every country in these demographic and health surveys are published.

167
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.780
Uh,

168
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:02.430
every time a country does its own statistical demographic survey.

169
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:06.930
And so all of this information is available and now it's computerized and so

170
00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:09.760
forth.
And it's,
there's a uniform as a com,

171
00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:14.400
a group called macro international that sort of helps,

172
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:19.290
uh,
these various countries design these surveys so that they can be con come

173
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:20.320
compared to international.

174
00:11:20.321 --> 00:11:24.930
You can get fairly good comparability of the data.

175
00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:27.450
And what he did is of these various ways,

176
00:11:27.451 --> 00:11:32.280
various statistical ways of finding out how many children women want and they

177
00:11:32.281 --> 00:11:35.370
have different numbers.
This is average ideal number of children.

178
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:40.340
This is desired total fertility rate.
Uh,

179
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.660
and here's the third one.

180
00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:46.140
The wanted total fertility rate and they all correct for different factors in

181
00:11:46.141 --> 00:11:46.974
different ways.

182
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.600
But the only thing I think that you have to sort of notice is that a,
whoops,

183
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.540
that they're all about the same.
No matter how you spin this,

184
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:59.770
you get a picture that looks something like this.

185
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.110
And uh,
what is it one and TFR in this cases,

186
00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:08.110
how many children does the woman want self report.

187
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:11.680
This is how many she says she wants.
She wants two,
three,
four,
five,
six,
seven,

188
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:13.660
eight.
And this is the total fertility rate.

189
00:12:13.661 --> 00:12:16.750
How many children is she actually having?
Having?

190
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.540
So the countries are luckily all named here.

191
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.850
And you can see a Syria for instance,
the uh,

192
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:28.880
women want five children and they're having seven point something.
Uh,

193
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:33.820
children,
uh,
here is pick another in Pakistan,

194
00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:38.830
they want four children,
they're having six children.

195
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:44.580
And so you can look at that in every country,
uh,

196
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:45.993
is in there.

197
00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.830
And one important thing is how important the desire whatever children want.

198
00:12:52.811 --> 00:12:57.811
That is a very strong correlation between the number of children that you want

199
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.880
and the number of children you actually have aggregated by country.

200
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:04.210
I mean we're taking a lot of people in lumping them into two numbers.

201
00:13:04.211 --> 00:13:07.810
This number and this number and it's a great variation of course within each

202
00:13:07.811 --> 00:13:11.110
country but that's certainly an important factor.

203
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.790
But the key line cause Pritchard and gathering the state of wanting to make a

204
00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:19.000
different point,
which we're not going to get to today but he left.

205
00:13:19.001 --> 00:13:22.150
It leaves out a really important line here,

206
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.010
which is this line that I've drawn this sin in.
What line is that?

207
00:13:27.130 --> 00:13:30.970
That's the line where as if you want to children,
you have two children.

208
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:35.650
If you want three children,
you have three children.
If you want nine children,

209
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:39.760
you have nine children.
So any country that was on that line,

210
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:43.030
people are having the number of children that they want.

211
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.940
What do you notice about all these countries?

212
00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.170
Every single one of them is above the line,

213
00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:55.620
meaning that in every single country they're having more children than they want

214
00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.670
what they want.
That's what they have.
They're all above that line of equality.

215
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.840
This is some of the cleanest social science data I've ever seen.

216
00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:07.640
The way they're all one side of a line there,

217
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.690
there follow very nicely the regression line.

218
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:15.220
This is the regression line that he drew in,
which is just a line,
uh,

219
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.700
that uh,
is closest to all the points together,

220
00:14:18.701 --> 00:14:23.701
a statistical way of making a line as close as possible to all of the points.

221
00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:29.140
So this,

222
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:34.590
this gap here between what people want if they,

223
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.430
if they got what they wanted and what they're actually having.

224
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.910
It's called unmet need,
very complicated idea,

225
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.930
much argued about and being may or may not discuss it.

226
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:51.020
But what it tells you is that there's a,

227
00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.150
a very noticeable difference between,
uh,
the,

228
00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:57.860
it's describing that difference between the number of young people have and what

229
00:14:57.861 --> 00:14:58.694
they want.

230
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.760
And it's roughly one child per family here.

231
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.930
And this number in principles should be one and a half children.

232
00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:13.280
But there are certain connections actually about one child per family.

233
00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:16.370
The difference between what they have and what they want.

234
00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:23.000
Now,
um,
in the developing world,

235
00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:26.420
this is a little bit old data,
but in the developing world today,

236
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:31.720
the average fertility rate is about 3.5 in order to come to stable population,

237
00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:35.840
the developing world,
it has to come down to 2.1

238
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.880
but if all the women here and these countries that are reporting what they want,

239
00:15:40.881 --> 00:15:44.360
if they actually had the number of children that they want,

240
00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:48.380
you'd subtract out from the 3.51 child,

241
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:53.660
you're down to 2.5 and you're actually very close then to replace what's called

242
00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:57.380
replacement level fertility.
This 2.1 children.

243
00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:02.950
And so this difference of what women want and what they have is an extremely

244
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:07.100
important issue.

245
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.930
And one version of the kind of thing that planned parenthood and other

246
00:16:11.931 --> 00:16:16.931
international and domestic organizations do is help women get to the fertility

247
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.180
that they want as not as pushing them into something,

248
00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:27.380
but uh,
giving them something that they already want.

249
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:33.500
So,
but this data as in old data brings up a whole bunch of questions.
One,

250
00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.720
does this really reflect people's data?

251
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:38.210
Have we actually have these kinds of questions?

252
00:16:38.211 --> 00:16:41.720
And this kind of cystical analysis really tapped into the real emotions and

253
00:16:41.721 --> 00:16:46.610
feelings of the people.
You always have to question these kinds of survey data.

254
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:51.970
And you remember that you read this as the readings and Africa,

255
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:55.160
that when the women were asked how many children do you want?

256
00:16:55.161 --> 00:16:58.010
It was a meaningless question to them.
They said,
whatever Allah says,

257
00:16:58.011 --> 00:17:01.820
whatever God says,
they can't do it.
You're just not in there.
What they,

258
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:04.700
the technical terms is the calculus of rational choice.
Well,

259
00:17:04.701 --> 00:17:08.650
there's women like that in the survey.
And what number do you put down?
Uh,
uh,

260
00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:13.610
for them.
Um,
uh,
this woman,

261
00:17:13.611 --> 00:17:17.000
as I've said,
is basically is all collected from women.
What about men?

262
00:17:17.001 --> 00:17:20.330
Do men want more children?
Do they want the same?
Do they want less?

263
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.110
Is it women's desires?
Don't matter.
Is it men's desires that,
that,

264
00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.640
that really matter?
Um,

265
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:29.620
why do women up here in,

266
00:17:29.621 --> 00:17:33.860
in Kenya and Molly at this time want so many children?

267
00:17:33.861 --> 00:17:34.970
And have so many children.

268
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:38.900
Whereas countries you might not think of wildly different.
Trinidad,

269
00:17:38.901 --> 00:17:43.520
Dominican Republic,
uh,
Fiji,
you know,
various other places are way down here.

270
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:47.450
Why some countries here and some countries,
uh,

271
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:52.860
they're um,
another thing is that in most of the world,

272
00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:53.850
uh,

273
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:58.740
people actually know about contraception and here is a date again from the

274
00:17:58.741 --> 00:18:03.270
Bolivian survey,
2003 and [inaudible].

275
00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:07.770
Do they know of method of contraception?
Well,
they know any method.
Yeah.

276
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.310
95% of the women know about contraception.

277
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.340
And even the modern methods which are listed here,

278
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.380
92% of the women they know about it.

279
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.710
And many of the women know about more than one method.

280
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.150
So 80% know about the pill and other 80%,
the IUD and other 80%.

281
00:18:24.151 --> 00:18:27.840
The injectables that means is in a lot of overlap between these.
They not,

282
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.950
they don't know what method they know.
Two,
three male condom.

283
00:18:31.951 --> 00:18:35.610
They know about female sterilization,
they know about and so,
so on.

284
00:18:35.611 --> 00:18:37.440
This is lactational Amen area,

285
00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:42.300
which is the traditional method that we've talked about of of spacing births.

286
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.440
And half the women know that if you breastfeed,
uh,

287
00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.890
you'll prolong the interval between your births.

288
00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.940
Not only do they know about the method,
but they've used the method.

289
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:56.880
77% of women have tried something.

290
00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.560
A fair amount of that is 20 20% of these women are using only traditional

291
00:19:01.561 --> 00:19:03.070
methods,
uh,

292
00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:08.420
which is includes rhythm type methods and but still 57% have actually used a

293
00:19:12.061 --> 00:19:16.680
modern method currently using drops down.

294
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.220
They've tried it and for some reason they've stopped.

295
00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:31.203
Um,

296
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:37.550
so one is this medical problem that the dominant reason why women say they're

297
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:45.540
not using contraception.
So you've seen the data,
they want to stop child bearing.

298
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.350
So overwhelming.
You saw like,
uh,
I believe you have,
what was the final number?

299
00:19:49.351 --> 00:19:52.830
I don't even know.
I pointed that out.
70%.
I think.

300
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.550
Let's go back here.
Trying to find,
oh thank you.

301
00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:01.020
Remember that came from something like 70% of the women say,

302
00:20:01.021 --> 00:20:04.020
I don't want any more children ever.
I want to just plain old stop.

303
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.070
And then if you add in those that are not sure about the future,
but they say,

304
00:20:08.071 --> 00:20:11.580
well at least not in the next two years and then beyond two years,
I don't know.

305
00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:16.440
So you had at least another 10% something like 80% of women want some kind of

306
00:20:16.441 --> 00:20:20.470
protection,
either one mostly stop totally or uh,

307
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:25.080
at least for the next two years.
And you can even go down.
This is again,

308
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:28.260
older data from Bolivia.
That's one of my favorite places.

309
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.590
I was sent some good times there.
Um,

310
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:37.350
if you just take teenagers age 15 to 19,
already,

311
00:20:37.351 --> 00:20:41.220
about 40% of them say I ever had all the children I want for the whole rest of

312
00:20:41.221 --> 00:20:46.200
my life.
And the average age of that sample is 17 years old.

313
00:20:46.410 --> 00:20:50.100
So you have this huge number of women who don't want,

314
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.130
want to stop child bearing.

315
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:57.070
And yet if you look from the demographic and health surveys at the contraceptive

316
00:20:57.071 --> 00:20:58.840
prevalence,
like in Bolivia,

317
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:02.710
again at the time of the Robey article that you're have read last night are

318
00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:06.620
going to read the women who want protection either either.

319
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:11.800
Our Bat,
we're about 80%.
And the women that were using pressure was like 12%.

320
00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.460
And you ask them why.
And uh,

321
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.520
largely,
uh,
and especially more and more recently it's medical reasons.

322
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.220
There's first of all at campaign by,

323
00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:28.720
by conservative and especially religious people in places like Kenya to,

324
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.520
uh,
they're opposed to the use of contraception and they really blow up,
uh,

325
00:21:33.910 --> 00:21:37.840
medical problems.
So the people are getting very poor information on it.

326
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.270
Now,
here's,
here's an example.

327
00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:44.260
So one of the undergraduates that took this course some years back,
uh,

328
00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:48.790
very energetic young lady and she was got interested in this stuff.

329
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.710
And so I arranged for her to go to Kenya to answer exactly this,
this question,

330
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.670
why is it that women,
and you'll hear a little later,

331
00:21:57.671 --> 00:22:01.750
why is it that women who say they don't want any children,

332
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:05.330
they're living in Nairobi and there's plenty of contraceptives available in

333
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.650
Nairobi and you can get them more or less free,

334
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:12.040
a small costs and they're not using it.

335
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:17.170
Then they get pregnant and they can't have that baby.
They don't want the baby.

336
00:22:17.171 --> 00:22:20.800
So they go to some Bush doctors and you know,
it's illegal in most of Africa,

337
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:24.700
sub Saharan Africa,
all of Africa,
abortion is illegal,
but here they are pregnant.

338
00:22:24.701 --> 00:22:29.140
So they go to some horrible doctor and the death rate is very,
very high.

339
00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.280
So here's women who don't want children,
uh,

340
00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.640
don't use contraception even though it's available to them.

341
00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:41.380
And yet when they get pregnant,
they're willing to undergo an operation,

342
00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.960
a very crude Optima,

343
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:48.580
illegal operation by an untrained practitioner,
uh,
that will,

344
00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:52.000
that will lead to a very high rate of death.
And their Wello well aware of that.

345
00:22:52.001 --> 00:22:55.510
They,
everybody knows somebody who's died from a botched abortion.

346
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:58.090
And you've read some of that in the European,
the,

347
00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.200
in the era in America and Europe when that was a common.

348
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:06.780
So she went there and it turns out that women are very much influenced by rumors

349
00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:12.580
what they hear because their education is not really their,
their thing.

350
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.190
And so she called this student,
does he yell?
Undergraduate,
uh,

351
00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:20.770
collected these rumors.
And one of the rumors,
one of the most extreme rumor was,

352
00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:26.080
well mostly in African,
I think you read this,
uh,
the,
the,

353
00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:26.920
you know,

354
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.560
people that haven't been the university don't distinguish between stomach and

355
00:23:29.561 --> 00:23:32.890
uterus.
It's all one big cavity.
There was that in one of your readings,

356
00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:38.140
you think it was in anyway,
it doesn't matter.
It's all one thing there.

357
00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:41.970
So now you take a pill and they know something about pills,
penicillin,

358
00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.200
everything.
But every day for the rest of my life,

359
00:23:44.201 --> 00:23:48.170
why do I have to keep taking this pill?
Why didn't I take the pill and that,
that,

360
00:23:48.171 --> 00:23:52.990
that settles the issue.
Well,
they figure I get pregnant and the,
and the,

361
00:23:52.991 --> 00:23:57.290
the fetus starts to grow inside me.
Well,
what does the pill do?

362
00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.280
The pillow goes down and dissolves.
They have some idea that it's wet,

363
00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:04.910
so that dissolve and then reforms over the face and starts coding it.

364
00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.790
But every day they know the fetus is getting bigger.

365
00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:11.240
So you need to take another pill to add to the code of it.

366
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:17.240
And at the end,
what you grow and what you get is a mummy.

367
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.840
You get a fetus that can be fully grown or newly flew coated with white stuff

368
00:24:23.151 --> 00:24:25.250
like an egg and that's what you deliver.

369
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:28.670
Well if you believe something like that,

370
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.040
you're not going to go anywhere near pills.
Right.

371
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:36.520
And some of these similar kinds of stories happen with everything else.

372
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.200
This young lady herself got the,

373
00:24:39.201 --> 00:24:43.100
the five little silastic implants in her arm when she came back,
she was very,

374
00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.260
she got it in Kenya.
One could,

375
00:24:45.261 --> 00:24:48.920
she wanted it and to do you want to show the women's,
see it's not dangerous.
I,

376
00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.790
I'm even doing it myself,
but that's irrelevant.
Okay.
So the one thing is the,

377
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:58.700
the any no clue about medical stuff,
physiology,

378
00:24:58.701 --> 00:25:02.720
digestion,
anatomy inside,
you know,

379
00:25:02.721 --> 00:25:07.100
huge numbers of women don't have any clue about this,
but this girl,
uh,

380
00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.680
did a very clever thing.
You know,

381
00:25:09.681 --> 00:25:13.550
she was a Yaley and she then asked the women,
you know,

382
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:17.510
Kenyan women are not any stupider than anybody else.
They're,
they're smart women.

383
00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:19.460
He said,
do you believe such a rumor?

384
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.400
Because they were just reporting it as a rumor and they,

385
00:25:22.410 --> 00:25:25.130
women that were of course,
very skeptical of this.
Well,

386
00:25:25.131 --> 00:25:26.120
I've heard that and you know,

387
00:25:26.121 --> 00:25:29.180
it's true or not and they were properly skeptical of it.

388
00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.410
So she collected this whole range of rumors and she found it.

389
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.490
She asked which ones do you believe more than others?

390
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:39.530
And she's sort of could get a ranking on it.

391
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:43.820
And then she asked all kinds of questions and it turned out that it was very

392
00:25:43.821 --> 00:25:47.870
simple that they believed something depending on how many times they had heard

393
00:25:47.871 --> 00:25:51.440
it in terms of this particular room was not one of the most prevalent.

394
00:25:51.441 --> 00:25:55.640
Some other rumors were equally not true.
But if you hear it a lot,

395
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.880
then you believe it because they don't have a sense of

396
00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:05.740
expertise,
scientific competency,
any of that sort of stuff.
And uh,

397
00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.730
on,
uh,
a sociologist at Penn,
Susan Watkins,

398
00:26:08.731 --> 00:26:11.390
so I may have mentioned before and certainly we'll mention again who works in,

399
00:26:11.391 --> 00:26:16.010
in Kenya and the low region,
different,
not in Nairobi,
a different region.
Uh,

400
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:16.920
she,
uh,

401
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:21.410
attended a lecture where a local woman speaking local dialect had gone to

402
00:26:21.411 --> 00:26:25.010
Nairobi and gotten trained nurse type.
She wasn't a trained,
uh,

403
00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:29.480
an official nurse working in that kind of assignment once an Arab and got

404
00:26:29.481 --> 00:26:32.480
trained to be uh,
uh,
uh,

405
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:34.490
reproductive health educator.

406
00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.900
So she comes back and just having some sort of a white coat or a uniform or a

407
00:26:38.901 --> 00:26:43.250
blouse or something and she gives a lecture to the women with,
um,

408
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:47.970
they have these model bay models of pregnancy models of internal anatomy slides.

409
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.020
Very nice.
And she,
she was good at it and the women are absolutely wrapped,

410
00:26:52.021 --> 00:26:55.640
you know,
they're listening to every word,
but as they left the room,

411
00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.240
they started sort of staring at each other.

412
00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:59.100
What are we going to make out of this?

413
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:04.590
And outside there was a woman's scrubbing the floor Washer woman there and these

414
00:27:04.591 --> 00:27:08.070
women just dove onto the washer woman and said,

415
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:11.550
she telling me what she telling is true.
Is this good for us as she,

416
00:27:11.551 --> 00:27:14.210
the are kind of women that the and,
and,
and,

417
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:18.270
and really ask the washroom and all kinds of questions about this information.

418
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:20.580
Which of Washington had no technical expertise.

419
00:27:21.090 --> 00:27:26.090
The Iba idea being that they don't have this sense of that knowledge comes from

420
00:27:27.601 --> 00:27:32.430
some sort of expertise that more knowledge comes from someone like me is a more

421
00:27:32.431 --> 00:27:33.510
important variable than that.

422
00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:36.660
You've been to Nairobi and gotten some kind of training and the washer woman

423
00:27:36.661 --> 00:27:40.740
they perceived was closer to them than the woman who had gotten some education

424
00:27:40.741 --> 00:27:45.120
even though it was a local,
a person from that,
that local community.

425
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:50.720
So it's a very complicated issue and the big battle is in people thinking about

426
00:27:51.241 --> 00:27:54.240
this and trying to do something that is sort of what she said.

427
00:27:54.241 --> 00:27:59.241
How much of this difference in how much of of the people in general having more

428
00:27:59.941 --> 00:28:03.270
public,
how much of it is that?
Is that there's something wrong with this data?

429
00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.060
They really do want a lot of children and many of the,
you know,

430
00:28:06.061 --> 00:28:10.050
many countries were up there and they wanted five,
six,
seven,
eight children.

431
00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:15.230
And how much of it is,
uh,
they don't have access.
Now acts,

432
00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:18.750
if I have to,
I guess I have to stop access to hear you,
but you're not leaving.

433
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.410
Access doesn't mean just handing out condoms.
So there's a famous,

434
00:28:22.411 --> 00:28:24.020
I'll tell this last story,
you know,
shut off.

435
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:29.610
So there's a famous story of the passes around family planning circles about

436
00:28:29.611 --> 00:28:34.611
someone going into an African village and finding in front of each hot a stick.

437
00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:39.570
And the stick was an unrolled condom.
And of the one that was very strange.

438
00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.360
And so they went and asked what this is.
Oh,

439
00:28:42.361 --> 00:28:45.630
we had a family planning worker come here and they showed us how to prevent

440
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:49.560
pregnancy and they had the stick in and they showed us how to unroll it.

441
00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:50.783
And they did that.

442
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.200
And I've heard this kind of story any number of times and I tossed it off,

443
00:28:55.201 --> 00:28:59.010
you know,
it's something like I had the doubts,
well more doubts.

444
00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.910
I just tossed the story off.
Then I'm inclined tower.

445
00:29:02.911 --> 00:29:04.440
And I came out one night,

446
00:29:04.441 --> 00:29:08.730
I work late and then the forestry was having a party and,
and some,
uh,
of the,

447
00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.900
of the graduate students were out back smoking or chatting or something.

448
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:14.770
So I chatted him up and one of them had been in an,
uh,

449
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:18.900
a part of South Africa called [inaudible].
And what she told me,

450
00:29:18.901 --> 00:29:21.770
she went into this village and what did she see?
It wasn't,

451
00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:26.100
it was cucumbers and holding people had cucumbers with condoms and rolled on.

452
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.340
So this is a student who's here at Yale right now that's solace with her own

453
00:29:29.341 --> 00:29:32.460
eyes.
So it's another one of these amazing stories.
That's true.

454
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:37.420
And it gives you sort of at least an anecdotal hint into what's going on.
Uh,

455
00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:42.060
be scratching beneath her.
There's this data.
Okay,
see you next week.
