WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.773
So wheels,

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.040
let's start a little slow because I'm sure some people are coming.

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.630
So,
uh,
this will continue with abortion.

4
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.750
So we had two lectures ago,
we talked about abortion.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.340
So the center of the abortion debate is when does life begin?

6
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.800
And uh,
luckily that's a question that biology can say something about.

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.020
Um,
what statement is the most common statement made on this?

8
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:35.310
Not Your own personal opinion.
Uh,
and not an educated opinion,

9
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:38.940
but what do people on the streets say mostly about when life begins,

10
00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.470
but if,
what do you here,
right

11
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.710
at conception and

12
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.900
all right.
Yes indeed.
That's,
that's the most common sort of thing that,

13
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.440
that people say life begins at conception.

14
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.630
And so this is in the newspapers.
This is common.
This is an all or the media.

15
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.680
So George will,

16
00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:07.770
how many of you heard of George will have famous Washington correspondent?

17
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.420
He's sinned.
You've heard of miss?
Syndicated like,
like everywhere,

18
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.290
everywhere quote.
It is a biological fact,

19
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.540
not a theological postulate.

20
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.320
That such life as a continuum from conception to death.

21
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.650
And then just before I was writing this lecture,
the first time,

22
00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:29.040
most scanning the New York Times as I always do,

23
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.060
and there was a letter from the editor letter to the editor from a prolife

24
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.923
writer.

25
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.250
It is a scientific fact is any basic biology text,

26
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.460
we'll confirm that life does begin at conception.

27
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.620
The fetus is alive,

28
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:47.520
human being distinct from while dependent on its mother.

29
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.740
It deserves the full protection of its rights.
And that's,

30
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.710
that's what's coming out there.
Not only is it what people,

31
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:58.260
most people personally believe,

32
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.440
but is generally considered to be a scientific fact.

33
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.840
And I've heard this from prolife people in pro choice people almost

34
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:11.100
indistinguishably.
So the question is you've all had high school biology,

35
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:15.990
at least.
How many of you had a college biology?
A few of you.

36
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.640
And guess what,
that isn't what,
uh,

37
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.750
that isn't at all.
What a,
what a beginning biology textbook says.

38
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.190
And what does it say?
This is from,
uh,
you know,

39
00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:31.440
they send professors free copies of textbooks.

40
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.510
So I just opened up one that they happen to send me and it shows something quite

41
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:37.344
different.

42
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.470
It shows life as a cycle and there's no start point here.

43
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.910
Fertilization is one of the events going around,
uh,

44
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.920
the cycle.
This is the essence of sexual reproduction.

45
00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.450
We also know that there's asexual reproduction which doesn't have their stuff at

46
00:02:57.451 --> 00:02:58.284
all.

47
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.380
And the cycle is the switch between a haploid genome,

48
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:08.581
which means one copy of each chromosome and haploid and diploid,

49
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.800
that each cell has two copies of each chromosome.

50
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.090
And when the sexual reproduction,
there's usually,

51
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.130
there's always some version of this one copy to copy a cycle.

52
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.660
And when you look in detail,
this is again from the same freshmen,
very popular,

53
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:31.460
very big selling,
uh,
freshmen,
uh,

54
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.670
college biology text.

55
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.030
It talks about three different sexual life cycles and in the most one that

56
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:42.010
you're most familiar,
one,
which is animals.

57
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.430
What happens is you start with a two and a multicellular organism organism.

58
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:50.950
That's you.
And then my Osas a certain,

59
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.130
the splitting of the chromosome so that the gametes get this as to an and being,

60
00:03:56.771 --> 00:03:59.860
the number of chromosomes start from to end.

61
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:04.861
There's a process called meiosis in which pairs split and you get cells with

62
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:10.570
only one copy of each chromosome.
Those are called gametes or germ cells.

63
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.020
And then from another individual get a second end and you'd go back to the

64
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:17.500
deployed phase.

65
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.360
So it's again the cycling around between one copy and two copies of the

66
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:26.680
chromosomes.
Meiosis in fertilization,
knowing most animals,

67
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.670
it happens that the big stage like us is deployed.

68
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.720
But that is not a universal rule at all.

69
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.080
That here is a stage which is fungi and some algebra algae that have it the

70
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:43.600
other way round.
They go through the same cycle.

71
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.610
But now the big organism is the haploid stage where there's only one,

72
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.070
uh,
one copy of each chromosome and that's growing in your garden.

73
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:59.071
There'll be a lot of stuff like this in most plants and some algae you have a

74
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:01.840
third possibility,

75
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.900
whereas both are multicellular organisms.

76
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.670
There's the diploid stage is multicellular and the haploid stage is

77
00:05:09.671 --> 00:05:14.590
multicellular and the cycle goes,
goes,
goes around.

78
00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.660
So the basic idea is not that there's a beginning,

79
00:05:19.661 --> 00:05:22.480
but that life is a cycle.
This is what,

80
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.970
I don't know what Your High School Textbook Trey.

81
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:26.770
I was afraid to go look at high school textbooks.

82
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:29.650
My colleagues who read high school textbooks aren't always horrified.

83
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.810
So I didn't go lower than a college.
A standard college textbooks.

84
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.250
And,
and again,
this is not the only mechanism of reproduction.

85
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.200
There's of course a whole variety of asexual means of reproduction.

86
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.300
So what kinds of things reproduce asexually with none of this

87
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.730
bacteria,
yeast.

88
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.420
Yeast to make your bread rise.
Yeast makes your beer used.
It ferments your wine.

89
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.770
And,
and he's used as fungi.
Between your toes.
They,
they,
they,

90
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.270
they reproduce by what's the mechanism there?
Reproduction.
Budding.

91
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.370
They bud off my ptosis.
Um,
what else?

92
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:16.130
What grows in your garden that you eat?
Many mornings,

93
00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.520
strawberries,
strawberries reproduce.
Oh,

94
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.700
all right.
You are,
you are disconnected from nature.
Strawberries grew up.

95
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.280
None of you have strawberries in your garden when your backyard.

96
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.230
Do you know who has a garden?
Yeah.

97
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.100
Why don't she has strobe has done,
they have runners,

98
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.070
they have what's called rhizomes,
they're called runners.
And you know,

99
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.310
and you have one plant and when it gets big enough and has enough energy,

100
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:50.420
it sends out a runner that grows the root and it grows up a strawberry.

101
00:06:50.421 --> 00:06:53.720
And then it doesn't matter whether the runner is eventually cut and lots and

102
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:57.560
lots of things grow by,
uh,
by runners,

103
00:06:57.561 --> 00:07:00.890
which has got another asexual form of,
of reproduction.

104
00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.780
Again,
you,
since you don't have yards,
so pricker bushes,

105
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:09.140
the Bain in the northeast had a pricker bushes grow

106
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.620
runners.
That's why your garden gets just overtake.

107
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.490
You don't get your clippers out and be very brutal.

108
00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.180
Your Garden just is overtaken by pricker Bush.
Brackin is the,
is the,
uh,

109
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.700
is the more technical term for that.
So there's a lot of stuff that reproduces,

110
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:30.500
but here the grass,
a lot of the grass grows this way.
Um,

111
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.820
and parthenogenesis anybody know who reproduces birth in a genetically,

112
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.150
what a lot of,
some fish to,
uh,
uh,
et cetera.

113
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:45.650
This fish worms,
all kinds of things reproduce a Partha genetically.
So,

114
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.270
um,
the idea that life begins at conception,

115
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:54.140
that life is any start point and it is really not what,

116
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:58.000
what textbooks are saying.
It's saying life is a cycle.
Uh,

117
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.520
the repeated organisms use different versions of the cycle and,

118
00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.360
and many organisms reproduce asexually with no version

119
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.500
of that.
Okay.

120
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:14.030
This gets a little more interesting when you go from a freshman textbook to an

121
00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:17.600
upper level textbook.
So a few years ago I

122
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.340
got an old copy of the uh,
the upper level.

123
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:25.400
This is biology to 41 re reproductive biology.

124
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.430
And I assume none of you have taken that.
Now it gets really interesting.

125
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.680
So this is,
uh,

126
00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.850
the beginning of an embryo in your grandmother or your grandfather.

127
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:43.340
It doesn't matter.
And what's you and you know,
can you see now this is not,

128
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:47.480
can you see tiny little dots here?
Maybe if we turn off the light,

129
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:49.580
you can see them,
but it doesn't matter.
Believe me,

130
00:08:49.581 --> 00:08:52.730
there's tiny little dots that this line is pointing to.

131
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:58.170
So this is inside your grandmother's.
This is your mother or your father.

132
00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:02.460
When isn't ever,
that's your mother or father sitting in there,

133
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:07.290
an outside your mother and father in the Yolk Sac,

134
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.210
which you'd think it was just for eating.

135
00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.610
There's an epithelial wall and epithelium,

136
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:16.611
just a set of flat cells like a skin that bound Oregon's and mostly covered

137
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:18.270
around in an epithelium.

138
00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:23.640
And some of the cells in the epithelium start differentiating differently than

139
00:09:23.641 --> 00:09:28.641
like a skin cell and they pop out into the center here.

140
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:33.210
Then as development goes on of your mother,

141
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:36.390
inside your grandmother or your father inside your,
your grandmother,

142
00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.180
not inside your grandfather,
uh,
uh,

143
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:44.300
these cells crawl up into the embryo through a tube and they sit in,

144
00:09:44.371 --> 00:09:49.200
they come to sit up here in the cells of going to become the rest of your
gonads.

145
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.810
So your germ cells start when a,

146
00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.100
when a developmental biologists or reproductive biologists discusses this.

147
00:09:56.370 --> 00:10:01.370
This is in a sense the start of life in your grandmother and your mother or

148
00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:04.230
father's embryo inside your grandmother.

149
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:09.600
And then more events happened in the whole book is about those events.

150
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.850
Well,
one of those events,
many.
And so this is on page seven,
the beginning.

151
00:10:14.851 --> 00:10:18.840
This is what happens in the beginning and when do we get to fertilization?

152
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.560
Well,
here's the next time code is and fertilization,

153
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.620
and this is on page 201.

154
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:29.700
So there's 200 pages of events that take place in between.

155
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.660
And fertilization is not the first or the second,

156
00:10:33.661 --> 00:10:38.060
but it's the third kind of event,
even in this one chapter and it's purposes.

157
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:42.990
The establishment of diploidy,
again,
referring to the cycle of haploid diploid.

158
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.160
And just to let you know that fertilization is not an essential event.

159
00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:53.060
It includes parthenogenetic activation as an equivalent step that that can be

160
00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:56.430
done in the cycle as well as fertilization.

161
00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.810
The differences between asexual reproduction and parthenogenetic is asexual

162
00:11:00.811 --> 00:11:05.811
reproduction doesn't go through a having an a doubling of the chromosomes in

163
00:11:05.851 --> 00:11:10.230
pathogenesis.
You in fact start with a haploid cells,

164
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.370
haploid organism.

165
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:15.410
And then that has mechanism for just doubling it without bringing in,
uh,

166
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.980
genes from somewhere else.

167
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:22.400
So it's like what a cell does is my ptosis is the normal state where sales

168
00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:27.210
double a,
but then they split.
This is a,
this is,
uh,
uh,

169
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.990
a doubling of the chromosome,
but no snow split.

170
00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:33.750
So you go from a haploid stage to a diploid stage.

171
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.220
And so while we're on Parthenogenesis,

172
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:43.030
I actually didn't know this till my until I,
until I read this.
Uh,

173
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.220
it,
it deuces with this format.

174
00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:49.320
A zoned induces many remarkable changes in the oocyte,
the at fertilization,

175
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.120
but it's not essential for many of them.

176
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:57.050
And Osi maybe accurate pathogen by a variety of bizarre stimuli such as electric

177
00:11:57.581 --> 00:12:00.100
shock,
exposure to various enzymes or to alcohol.

178
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:05.100
So you guys that think you're having a big role,
just bring your electric shock.

179
00:12:05.101 --> 00:12:09.610
Her son,
it'll do almost as well.
And they,
they mimic whatever it is that the,

180
00:12:09.611 --> 00:12:14.560
that the sperm does.
And what's interesting is the embryo,
the partner Jane,

181
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:18.790
this is a human,
this is a textbook of human reproductive biology.

182
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.480
It can undergo cleavage implantation and elementary sage or beating heart.

183
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.330
So mites and four limbs.
The,
the,

184
00:12:25.331 --> 00:12:29.110
the stage at which a lot of the right to life for show you as well.

185
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:31.150
This is a human already actually can,

186
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:35.110
can happen without any intervention of sperm whatsoever.

187
00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.510
Eventually in a human,
uh,
there are parthenogenetic animals and other organisms.

188
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.480
But uh,
in a human,
the embryo,

189
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.370
eventually the fetus eventually dies.
But apparently it's,

190
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:53.170
it's a deficiency in the placenta,
not in the fetus itself.

191
00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:57.490
So it's quite amazing and again,
loosens up your whole mind.

192
00:12:57.491 --> 00:13:01.930
But what is biology actually saying about life?

193
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.050
And it's not saying that it has a beginning and it's certainly not saying the

194
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:08.650
beginning is that fertilization.
Okay.

195
00:13:08.651 --> 00:13:13.600
So having started this train of thought for myself,
we've done a freshman texts,

196
00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:18.040
we've done an upper level text.
Now let's get into the research literature.
Oh,

197
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:22.630
I've just underlying these,
here's a research load.
This is science magazine,

198
00:13:22.631 --> 00:13:25.300
which is when all scientists read it,
it has the latest,

199
00:13:25.301 --> 00:13:29.740
greatest stuff you wish you could publish in it and so forth from 2007.

200
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.830
And it's about the Germline,
which is,
you know,

201
00:13:32.831 --> 00:13:37.831
eggs and sperms and in the early embryo cells decide B between becoming Soma or

202
00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:43.720
germline.
So when I showed you the yolk sac and your grandmother,

203
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:45.370
the Soma,

204
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.870
the body are the cells that stay in the yolk sac and form the lining of the yolk

205
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:53.590
sac and produce the enzymes I think which digest the yolk sac.

206
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:58.030
Those that migrate out become the germ germ line.

207
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.800
And evolution doesn't want the germline to go through a lot of divisions because

208
00:14:02.801 --> 00:14:05.620
every division introduces the possibility of a mutation.

209
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.310
Every time you have to copy your chromosomes but you can get into trouble.

210
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:14.050
So it very early on in fact in your grandmother separates out the germline and

211
00:14:14.051 --> 00:14:18.100
holds it in a band's for decades,
uh,
often.

212
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.970
Now again,
uh,

213
00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:26.050
the important thing is this constancy of the,

214
00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.560
of the germline for is necessary for species continuity.

215
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.760
That's all the kind of stuff.
And here again,
all kinds of events take place.

216
00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.860
The only mention of fertilization in this whole introduction to this special

217
00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:39.371
section,

218
00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:44.371
this is special section just on this issue is where is is in one of the later

219
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.990
paragraphs.

220
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:54.980
Now I was being very pleased with myself for getting exactly the right things

221
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:59.981
that I wanted to show you and make this point that at all levels of scientific

222
00:15:00.111 --> 00:15:03.470
discourse,
life does not begin at conception.

223
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:06.050
And then I stepped back from a little bit and what do I notice?

224
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.430
What's the logo up there?
The logo is a fertilized egg being fertilized,

225
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:17.450
right?
And they said,
oh my gosh,
that contradicts everything.
I'm trying to say,

226
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:22.550
cause it sort of marks out that the most important thing about this whole

227
00:15:22.551 --> 00:15:27.440
process is fertilization.
But after my initial shock,
I get over it.

228
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:32.030
I look at and say that's a fake fertilization does not look like that.

229
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.110
And He,

230
00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.930
and you've got to anybody who's taken a biology course and seeing these big,

231
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.760
there's first of all,
a whole lot of sperms.

232
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.660
This isn't just one for sperm sitting.
Like that's a whole lot of them.

233
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:47.080
And that would be a very nice trick to get a green and a red sperm together.

234
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.370
And I said that's a fake picture.

235
00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:54.050
And you know that you're not supposed to do that kind of fakery in science.

236
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.290
But it turns out the scientists didn't do that.

237
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.830
But these journals is a mass produced things science sells millions of copies

238
00:16:00.831 --> 00:16:01.581
all around the world.

239
00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:05.590
So they have an art department and I don't know if you can see this,
uh,

240
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:10.130
but that picture,
uh,
is made by,

241
00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.590
uh,
I've written this Getty images.
Getty is one of the big con,

242
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:20.240
uh,
Getty images,
visuals unlimited.
They're not limited there unlimited.

243
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.210
So this was put in not by the scientific authors,

244
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.590
it's not mentioned in the article.
So you're not supposed to take it seriously.

245
00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.760
And in fact,
you know,
when you go after this kind of stuff,

246
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.300
I just looked at about two pages later and,

247
00:16:35.301 --> 00:16:37.790
well here it is blown up so you can see that better.

248
00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.020
And there's the exact picture from which it's,

249
00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:45.890
it's com and you can see the flatness here and this little thing here.

250
00:16:45.891 --> 00:16:46.790
And if you go back,

251
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:52.550
they show you the flatness here and a little thing here.
They've,
they've,

252
00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.850
they've shown you exactly inadvertently,
they don't mention this at all.

253
00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.280
They show you exactly where they faked it from.

254
00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.850
And what they did is took this image and then took a red sperm image from

255
00:17:01.851 --> 00:17:06.050
somewhere else,
lays them on top and gay and put them on there.

256
00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:11.660
So,
uh,
yes,
I was going to say something about laying it on going.

257
00:17:11.661 --> 00:17:14.120
I won't,
you can guess.

258
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.630
So what's the moral of the story of this last little bit?

259
00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.320
Is it even prestigious scientific journals when they're not thinking

260
00:17:21.321 --> 00:17:24.330
scientifically will lapse into the common parlance,

261
00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:25.910
the society in which they live.

262
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.300
The important thing about reproduction is fertilization.
That's,

263
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:32.120
that's the common thing.
It's not a scientific thing,

264
00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.000
but even scientists and scientific journals can,

265
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.710
can mess that up.
Okay.

266
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:45.070
So the whole phrasing of this debate in terms of when does life begin,

267
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:48.050
uh,

268
00:17:48.050 --> 00:17:52.680
is a cultural hold from the many centuries when there was no scientific

269
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:56.670
understanding of reproduction.
So you have to think,
well,
when does life begin?

270
00:17:56.671 --> 00:18:01.230
What is the alternative to it being a cycle from life's coming from life that we

271
00:18:01.231 --> 00:18:05.340
now know is the case?
Well,
it's got to come from something that's not alive.

272
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:07.920
Right.
And,
um,

273
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:12.090
and then that then the question comes to very naturally to think life comes from

274
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.340
something not alive.
And he'd say,
well,
when does life begin?

275
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.840
And what is that called when you believed that life comes from not life?

276
00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:25.300
Oh,
come on.
You had this in high school.
Oh listen,

277
00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:29.810
dead spontaneous generation.
Right?
And did,

278
00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.600
when did they,
do you remember when this was shown to me?
Not the case,

279
00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.123
<v 1>right?</v>

280
00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:41.150
<v 0>Pastor was the final step in it.
It actually comes earlier.</v>

281
00:18:41.151 --> 00:18:43.850
The first guy was Francesco rating.
Well first let me tell you.

282
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.400
So what are the observations that make,

283
00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:51.430
that made people think that there was spontaneous generation and uh,

284
00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.480
take a caterpillar in them off.

285
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.930
So you have a caterpillar and it's one kind of organism and crawls around.

286
00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:01.160
It puts itself up into a cocoon.
And if at any time,

287
00:19:01.161 --> 00:19:03.070
not the very beginning and not the very end of,
in the middle,

288
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:06.630
you open up a cocoon.
A,
what you see is Google the,

289
00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:11.510
the caterpillar has just sort of decay,
just fallen apart into,

290
00:19:11.511 --> 00:19:12.344
into a goo.

291
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.640
But then you look sometime later and out pops is beautifully formed.

292
00:19:16.641 --> 00:19:20.240
Butterfly and it doesn't look anything like the Caterpillar.

293
00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.600
So the only reasonable way of interpreting this is that indeed the caterpillar

294
00:19:26.091 --> 00:19:30.380
died.
It put itself into a little coffin and it,
it rotted,

295
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.690
it fell apart.
But that's very nutritious.

296
00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:36.530
And out of this nutrition somehow came the butterfly,

297
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:41.690
spontaneous generation.
And that was what was believed,
uh,
about that.

298
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:46.550
Um,
he take rotting meat.
Where do you find flies coming out of maggots?

299
00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.150
Where do you find maggots?
Rotting meat.
Rotting food.

300
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:54.680
So you do an experiment,
you go around,
you find some roadkill or something.

301
00:19:54.681 --> 00:19:56.240
They didn't really have cars back then,

302
00:19:56.241 --> 00:19:59.840
but this is all late 1,617 hundreds.

303
00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:02.360
It changes it at that time.

304
00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:06.860
So they take a dead animal and maggots come out of it.
Well,
what it is,

305
00:20:06.861 --> 00:20:11.060
you can take the dead meat that you find around and put it in a jar and close it

306
00:20:11.061 --> 00:20:15.920
up.
And if you haven't actually killed it,
very fresh outcome,
the maggots,

307
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.550
and you haven't led any maggots,
crawl,
crawl into it.

308
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:23.480
So that where the fish come from?
Well,
shallow,

309
00:20:23.481 --> 00:20:26.690
most people who fish a lot.
No,
it comes from shallow water mostly.

310
00:20:26.691 --> 00:20:28.040
And they grow up in the reeds.

311
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:33.170
So the fish come from the reads and then you get a little imaginative about it.

312
00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.370
And if you read the literature from this era,
which I haven't,

313
00:20:37.371 --> 00:20:41.300
but there's a lot of books that they do and tell you the juicy tidbits is

314
00:20:41.301 --> 00:20:45.290
believed that it was possible to create mice by putting a dirty shirt and a few

315
00:20:45.291 --> 00:20:49.330
grains of wheat into a sealed jar and letting it sit for 21 days.

316
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:54.340
So that scientifically tells you the gestation period of a mouse is 21 days when

317
00:20:54.341 --> 00:20:56.560
it's made from a dirty shirt.
And,
uh,

318
00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:00.640
I think some of you undergraduates probably know that from,
from experience.

319
00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:04.300
So,
and as we'll see in a little bit,

320
00:21:04.301 --> 00:21:07.540
human life was presumed to come from menstrual blood,

321
00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:11.590
which is also dead.
And as a sort of a coagulation kind of process,

322
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:16.510
I'll show you what that was about.
So in everything from an insect,
uh,

323
00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:21.380
to,
to a human spontaneous generation was,
uh,

324
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:24.700
the most obvious interpretation of what,
what,

325
00:21:24.701 --> 00:21:28.780
what you could observe for many hundreds of years until the experimental

326
00:21:28.781 --> 00:21:33.781
techniques really took over and people started showing that was not true.

327
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:39.280
So the first real break,
and this was Francesco Rady,
uh,

328
00:21:39.281 --> 00:21:42.410
in about 1668,
uh,

329
00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:46.390
who studied butterflies and he did a very carefully,

330
00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.760
they hadn't really used scalpels before.

331
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:53.530
And so if you pull apart a cocoon without a really nice sharp knife,

332
00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:58.210
uh,
we get more mush,
get much at all stages.
He used a scalpel,

333
00:21:58.211 --> 00:21:59.044
cut it apart,

334
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:04.050
and he could see that early on that actually inside the caterpillar you could

335
00:22:05.111 --> 00:22:06.600
see the rudiments of,

336
00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.330
of the adult moth a happening and then you,

337
00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.540
he could watch the development inside the caterpillar that was stunning to the

338
00:22:13.541 --> 00:22:15.350
world when,
when he,
he,

339
00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:20.020
we started talking about this to scientific societies that,
uh,

340
00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.170
that are most,
did not come from the,

341
00:22:22.171 --> 00:22:24.460
the rotting caterpillar but came from the cell.
The,

342
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.620
they didn't have the idea of cells back then,

343
00:22:26.621 --> 00:22:30.790
but came from the body of the Caterpillar itself.

344
00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:34.870
Then Spolin Zani when I went to high school at Spelman,
Zani was the hero.

345
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.140
I don't know why instead of Rady.
And he did the next step of it.

346
00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:42.610
And that was the next century 17.
He worked around the 1750s.

347
00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:43.541
And finally,

348
00:22:43.541 --> 00:22:48.541
Louie Pastor showed that it was true also for microorganisms.

349
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:53.680
That was what pastor put the final nail in the coffin.
Now only animals,
plants,

350
00:22:53.681 --> 00:22:58.240
insects,
which are animals.
But finally microorganism.
So by,

351
00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:03.220
by the later 18 hundreds is when this idea of spontaneous generation for

352
00:23:03.221 --> 00:23:06.970
everything alive,
uh,
disappeared.
And the phrase,

353
00:23:06.971 --> 00:23:09.100
which was originally much earlier but not prudent,

354
00:23:09.101 --> 00:23:14.101
was omnia ex vivo x over everything comes from an egg that there's always some

355
00:23:14.441 --> 00:23:18.310
sort of a cycle of generation.
So,

356
00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:24.100
uh,
so we've known for about 250 years that,

357
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.510
uh,
uh,
that there is no spontaneous generation,

358
00:23:28.511 --> 00:23:32.650
that life is a cycle and they're in a cycle.
You can't point to a beginning.

359
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:37.690
So it's,
it's,
so it's very hard.
You know,
it's a sign of,

360
00:23:37.691 --> 00:23:38.890
they're just the persistence of,

361
00:23:38.891 --> 00:23:42.970
of cultural ideas that the culture is somehow hasn't caught on to that.

362
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:48.890
Now,
more educated people when discussing this in more detail,

363
00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.850
understand that it's a cycle,
but they decide that the,
uh,

364
00:23:52.851 --> 00:23:57.380
that fertilization is the final genetic sets,
the final genetic constitution,

365
00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:02.510
uh,
of the fetus.
And therefore we can legitimately say point that as,
as,

366
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:07.520
as the origin point.
Uh,
but of course that's not true either.

367
00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:12.521
Now we know him in great detail and I don't want to not of course in

368
00:24:12.621 --> 00:24:15.140
reproductive biology,
but somewhere

369
00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.430
<v 1>I've got
what's going on here?</v>

370
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:26.950
Oh,
not good.
Not Good.

371
00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:29.560
Why is this stopped working?

372
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.750
Something is going slow here.

373
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:43.770
<v 0>All right,
well it doesn't matter.
So actually at the time of fertile,
yeah,</v>

374
00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.100
there's hotel,
I'll talk about this this later.

375
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:51.230
I don't know why this is going slowly.
Um,
at the time of fertilization,

376
00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.813
the,

377
00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:57.680
the nucleus of the egg is still deployed and it's only after fertilization.

378
00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:02.990
Then sometime later that the,
uh,
the,
the,

379
00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:06.410
the female nucleus go through its final division and that's random,

380
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.460
which chromosomes are going to be included in the,
uh,

381
00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.600
in the embryo in which chromosomes are not.
So the final genetics,

382
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:15.830
the part of this step,

383
00:25:15.831 --> 00:25:19.280
one of the steps of the final Jetta constitution happens after fertilization.

384
00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:22.790
If you're getting defined fertilization as the entry of the sperm,

385
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.800
and then even further,
uh,
the female has two xs,

386
00:25:27.801 --> 00:25:32.000
but in every cell,
only one x is going to be active.
So it again,

387
00:25:32.001 --> 00:25:33.710
at a later stage in,

388
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.740
in fact way after this multicellular division has already taken place in each

389
00:25:40.101 --> 00:25:40.640
cell in it,

390
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:45.640
one of the xs gets inactivated and basically crumples up and gets thrown away.

391
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:51.130
So the final genetic constitution is not set till a good bit of time after

392
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:55.130
fertilization.
And we can see this in Calico cats.

393
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:59.510
Calico cats have these sort of biggish black patches and biggish orange patches.

394
00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.990
You know what?
We don't have that with our hair.
Our hair was,
this is,

395
00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:08.090
it's usually all one color until it turns gray.
Uh,
but in Calico cats,

396
00:26:08.091 --> 00:26:10.910
what you're seeing is at a certain point in development,

397
00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:12.740
and you can count the number of patches.

398
00:26:12.741 --> 00:26:16.250
So you know how many cells this comes from.
In one cell,
there's,

399
00:26:16.251 --> 00:26:19.540
there'll be two sets of genes,
one which will have the melanin gene too,

400
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:21.260
to make melon and make the black.

401
00:26:21.261 --> 00:26:25.910
And one will miss that and make an orange patch.
And in this cell,

402
00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.290
the gene for orange turns off.
And,
and so you get a black,
uh,

403
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:32.030
the chromosome that has no arms,

404
00:26:32.031 --> 00:26:36.320
the whole chromosome is turned off and you get a black patch.
And then this one,

405
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:40.130
the one for,
for melon and gets turned off and you get an orange patch.

406
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:45.490
And the number of patches tells you at what sales stage this process happened

407
00:26:45.691 --> 00:26:50.550
because each of those patches are the descendants of a single cell in a somewhat

408
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.730
advanced embryo.
So the,

409
00:26:53.731 --> 00:26:58.500
the number of genetic things that happen after fertilization is,
is,
is,

410
00:26:58.501 --> 00:27:00.600
is quite a significant.

411
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.240
And so even moderately sophisticated things,

412
00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.060
uh,
that educated people,
you know,

413
00:27:09.061 --> 00:27:12.790
believe about development and when it begins,
uh,

414
00:27:13.330 --> 00:27:15.750
or just plain wrong.
Um,

415
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:20.970
so the only scientific,
uh,
response to,

416
00:27:20.971 --> 00:27:25.350
to the question of when life begins is when does one say,
well,

417
00:27:25.351 --> 00:27:27.330
4 billion years ago,
you know,

418
00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:32.390
when the first cell in some slime of some sea somewhere or something,

419
00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:37.350
uh,
life began.
And since then cells have replicated,
uh,
cells.

420
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:38.311
So in a sense,

421
00:27:38.311 --> 00:27:42.780
since every cell in your body is the result of a split of some prior cell,

422
00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.670
in a sense,
every cell in your body has been alive for 4 billion years.
You know,

423
00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:51.120
there's never been anything,
anything dead in,

424
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:55.890
in the past of that.
Okay.

425
00:27:55.891 --> 00:27:59.220
There's really more,
a very more interesting things about development

426
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:06.180
if I can get this to work.
Okay.

427
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:11.070
So development,
it is very,

428
00:28:11.071 --> 00:28:14.820
very chancy,
uh,
repairing very,
very chancy,
uh,

429
00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.100
operation there.

430
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:21.750
So this is the germ cells.
This is in a female,

431
00:28:21.751 --> 00:28:25.290
but everything I'm saying about a female happens in a male.

432
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:30.310
And what happens is,
uh,
from conception,

433
00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:33.580
this is the number of germ cells that they can count.

434
00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.120
And they get up to like 7 million germ cells.

435
00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:41.770
And then again,
before birth,
they start dying.

436
00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:45.130
So,
for instance,
in a woman,
most of the classes is female.

437
00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:49.900
You're born with this number of potential eggs.
Uh,
no you're not.
And I'm sorry,

438
00:28:49.901 --> 00:28:54.040
and I'm one of the,
you develop this many eggs,
then most of them die right away.

439
00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:58.390
And then as,
as gestation continues more than die at birth,

440
00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:02.590
then they keep dying.
And by the time you're sexually mature,

441
00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.350
there's only a very few left.

442
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:10.490
And we used to believe and maybe still believe that that's all the eggs you're

443
00:29:10.491 --> 00:29:11.750
ever,
ever going to have.
You know,

444
00:29:11.751 --> 00:29:16.350
and a similar sort of thing happens with sperms,
not quite the same.
Uh,

445
00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:21.070
there's now recent,
uh,
research that sinks sure.
That there are some set,

446
00:29:21.130 --> 00:29:22.510
some stem cells,

447
00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:26.440
the kind of cells that originally produced all these oocytes,

448
00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:29.740
that there some stem cells than hang around.
And that in fact,

449
00:29:29.741 --> 00:29:34.680
after this period you can make females can make more eggs.
And for the,
uh,

450
00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.890
the artificial fertilization,
artificial reproduction clinics,

451
00:29:38.891 --> 00:29:40.900
this another really hot area of research.

452
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:44.110
Can we find those stem cells can for infertile women,

453
00:29:44.111 --> 00:29:48.820
can we get them to now make a egg cells later?

454
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:54.460
So,
uh,
so that's one set of,
of a,

455
00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.790
a real decrease in the,
in the,
in the potential.

456
00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:01.540
So you start with 7 million potential eggs and,

457
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:06.400
but you'll opulate like 400 eggs during a woman's life.

458
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:10.530
And this is what solution looks like.
This is,
this is a,

459
00:30:10.531 --> 00:30:15.040
an ovarian cyst proper thing.
And this is the egg that's coming out in there.

460
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:16.360
This guys,

461
00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:21.300
this doctor I guess is trying to extract the egg for some,

462
00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:26.320
one of the either experimental or in Vivo fertilization kind of procedure where

463
00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:28.870
they can take the egg and injected a,

464
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.500
fertilize it externally injected back in into the theme that all kinds of

465
00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:36.100
wonderful things
can happen.

466
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:39.790
Um,
now

467
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.940
after fertilization,
this winnowing of the,
uh,

468
00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:49.000
continues,
uh,
very largely.

469
00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:52.660
So there's a lot of genetic death though.
Now you have your fertilization.

470
00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:57.960
The early events of really setting the genetic constitution have taken place and

471
00:30:59.201 --> 00:31:00.310
often they don't work.

472
00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
And it turns out that from fertilization in the next few weeks,

473
00:31:07.661 --> 00:31:11.050
something like 80% of conceptuses die,

474
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.960
it's a quite striking phenoms called,

475
00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:17.860
it's called a pregnancy wastage.
Wastage.

476
00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.160
And humans have it much more than other animals and it's,

477
00:31:21.161 --> 00:31:25.750
we don't understand why it all,
all mammals have the same process,

478
00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:30.040
but it's really extreme in humans and there's nothing but theories about why,

479
00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:34.180
why this happens and it's mostly genetic death.

480
00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:39.010
So I told you that you start with a diploid cell,
the germ cell,

481
00:31:39.011 --> 00:31:43.720
it's crawling out of the sack and it has two copies of each chromosome and the

482
00:31:43.721 --> 00:31:47.740
chromosome unfolded as you know,
a huge thing and it has to fold itself up.

483
00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:51.600
It has to pair,
they have to older clinic,
what is it,

484
00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:56.140
26 pairs have to pair and then they have to split nicely.

485
00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:01.000
Well that is a very complicated process that frequently does not work and what

486
00:32:01.001 --> 00:32:04.840
you end up with is instead of one copy going each way,

487
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.880
you get two copies in this,

488
00:32:06.881 --> 00:32:11.470
say ag or this sperm and Wa and no copy in the other one.

489
00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.740
Then as events go on,

490
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:19.120
if you have two copies here and it gets fertilized by a sperm,

491
00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.900
then you have three copies and that's lethal for almost every chromosome.

492
00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:25.930
And if you have no copies and it gets fertilized by sperm,

493
00:32:25.931 --> 00:32:29.050
you get one copy and that's lethal for almost every chromosome.

494
00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:34.620
So the only chromosome which there isn't lethality is the downs syndrome

495
00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.440
chromosome where you can,
I think it's 23,
you can,
you can survive,

496
00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:44.540
uh,
with three copies of that.
And that's down syndrome.
And you know,

497
00:32:44.541 --> 00:32:48.830
the frequency of Down's syndrome,
one in however many thousand it is.

498
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:50.420
And you know,
for every trip low,

499
00:32:50.421 --> 00:32:52.890
that's called triple because you have three copies of that chromosome doesn't

500
00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:56.360
know low,
you'll get no car,
you get no copy,
you get the,

501
00:32:56.361 --> 00:33:00.030
or just the one from the sperm or if it's the sperm that has this problem,

502
00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:01.910
you get the one from the egg.
So,

503
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:06.620
and that dies and every other chromosome dies is one of the problems somewhere.

504
00:33:06.621 --> 00:33:10.790
There's some viability.
So you take the frequency of Down's syndrome,

505
00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.640
you double it for that chromosome,
for the novel.

506
00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.640
Then you multiply it by the 46 chromosomes,

507
00:33:16.641 --> 00:33:18.650
23 pairs of chromosomes that there are,

508
00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.820
and you get a number that just from this process,
which is called nondisjunction,

509
00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:27.950
what the death rate of the oocyte of the fertilized eggs is.

510
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.730
And then there's all kinds of other genetic problems,
which I won't go into.

511
00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.590
But the experimental Lee observe the empirically observed thing is that the

512
00:33:36.591 --> 00:33:39.770
action of the 78%,
I say 80%,
but if you read the paper,

513
00:33:39.771 --> 00:33:44.771
it's 78% of fertilized concept doses then die very rapidly of,

514
00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:51.650
uh,
genetic death.
And,
uh,

515
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:55.880
the mother doesn't even know that she's pregnant because she doesn't know

516
00:33:55.881 --> 00:33:59.750
anything in the first couple of weeks.
Her period may be a little bit delayed,

517
00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:03.470
maybe not,
not,
uh,
delayed at all.

518
00:34:04.490 --> 00:34:09.490
And you get really interesting legal and religious,

519
00:34:10.390 --> 00:34:12.860
uh,
complications if,

520
00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:18.110
if it,
well,
there's some theology here,

521
00:34:18.111 --> 00:34:20.120
which you're gonna ask me about later if you want to know.

522
00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.630
But Standard Christians is supposed to believe that resurrection is in the
flesh,

523
00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:28.310
so that your comeback in the pretty much the same state that you,
you've died.

524
00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:34.160
And,
uh,
if 80%.
And if you believe then that if you add to that,

525
00:34:34.161 --> 00:34:35.720
that life begins at conception,

526
00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:39.790
that means that the fertilized egg then that means that 80% of the,
of the,

527
00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:44.360
of the embryos of the resurrected bodies in heaven are going to be in a test

528
00:34:44.361 --> 00:34:48.320
tube.
They're there,
they're just a few cells big.
So it gets into,

529
00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:53.000
into very serious,
uh,
kinds of religious,
uh,
complications.

530
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:57.710
It also gets into legal complications is just something a little out of place

531
00:34:57.711 --> 00:35:02.480
here.
But,
um,
I can't remember what state it is.
It's,
uh,

532
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:04.850
a woman got pulled over.
So this state,

533
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:07.070
which she was on a highway and an Hov lane,

534
00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:10.940
a high occupancy vehicle language proved to have at least two people in the car.

535
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:14.900
And she was pulled over by the cop because it was just her and the cops are

536
00:35:14.901 --> 00:35:17.450
writing or ticket and she says,
no,
no,
I'm pregnant.

537
00:35:17.900 --> 00:35:20.330
And so there's two of us in this car.

538
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.210
And it became a serious kind of court case.

539
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:28.620
And so if legally one decides that,
uh,
uh,

540
00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.540
an embryo or fetus is a person from the moment of conception,

541
00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:34.320
then uh,

542
00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.210
every time a woman doesn't have a baby or she drives,
you know,

543
00:35:39.211 --> 00:35:43.920
the police are going to have to carry around pregnancy tests and examined this.

544
00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:49.430
Um,
it's uh,
so the,
the,

545
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:51.120
the conclusion not that good,

546
00:35:51.121 --> 00:35:54.990
but another point about this is anybody know roughly how long it takes to get,

547
00:35:55.500 --> 00:36:00.360
uh,
get pregnant if you're trying five months.
Does that tie up with anything?

548
00:36:00.361 --> 00:36:01.194
I just said,

549
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:06.210
if 80% of concept this is di,

550
00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:11.340
that's four out of five and if it takes five months to get pregnant in what

551
00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:12.390
month the other four happen.

552
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:16.020
Well those are the four months that you on average did not get pregnant.

553
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.440
And that though,
this is not proven,

554
00:36:19.441 --> 00:36:22.620
but the numbers work out that there's really no other reasonable interpretation

555
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:26.040
that when a woman is having regular sex without protection,

556
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:30.210
not trying or not trying to get pregnant,
she gets pregnant every month.

557
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:35.760
And,
but four out of the five months,
the fetus,
the,
the,
the conceptus,
the early,

558
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:39.720
the fetus dies barely.
And she doesn't even really necessarily know about it.

559
00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:45.060
So,
and then in the fifth month on average outcomes a fetus.

560
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.931
So again,

561
00:36:45.931 --> 00:36:50.931
legally and religiously that if one has the decides for themselves that life

562
00:36:53.041 --> 00:36:57.750
begins at conception and you're,
and a woman is having sex,

563
00:36:57.751 --> 00:36:58.980
that means every month,
uh,

564
00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:04.030
a human being has died and there has to be a death certificate.

565
00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:09.030
There may have to be in question of why did this fetus di did the mother like

566
00:37:09.031 --> 00:37:12.240
drink alcohol or smoke or do something that might have caused that to die as she

567
00:37:12.241 --> 00:37:17.040
causing the death of this,
this full human being.

568
00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:22.200
And religiously you'd have to have a burial in Morrill master.

569
00:37:22.201 --> 00:37:25.920
You'd have to do all the religious things that,
that attempt to death.

570
00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:31.670
So the fact that it's not widely appreciated that 80% of conceptus has died

571
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:32.513
genetically

572
00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:39.150
sits uneasily with,
with an idea that that life begins

573
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:41.640
at conception.

574
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.863
<v 1>Okay.</v>

575
00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:50.550
<v 0>So the,
so we're talking about the,
the,
the,</v>

576
00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.710
the chances of the reproduction.

577
00:37:52.711 --> 00:37:56.520
We saw that out of all these eggs that are started,

578
00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:59.820
so many die before you're born.

579
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:02.250
And then even those that get fertilized,

580
00:38:02.251 --> 00:38:05.610
not many of them get fertilized because most people aren't having sex all the

581
00:38:05.611 --> 00:38:06.810
time.
You don't have four.

582
00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:11.250
So there's 400 eggs that you aveo late and only a small fraction of those will

583
00:38:11.251 --> 00:38:13.620
get fertilized no matter what your sex life is like.

584
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:18.270
So the big death fair then of those that do get fertilized,
80% of them die.

585
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:22.750
Then of course you're well aware from this course and once a child is born,
uh,

586
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.750
up until very modern times with his medicine,

587
00:38:24.751 --> 00:38:29.520
something like a third of the kids die as infants or children.

588
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:30.601
So it's a very,

589
00:38:30.601 --> 00:38:35.601
very chancy procedure and there's elimination at all kinds of stages.

590
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:39.461
Okay.

591
00:38:39.461 --> 00:38:43.780
So I sort of hit you over the head over the idea that life is a cycle and that

592
00:38:43.781 --> 00:38:47.140
is of course the only scientific way to look at it.

593
00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:53.230
And when does the cycle begin?
You know,
can you even say something like that?

594
00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:57.640
Well,
sometimes it's necessary to arbitrarily put a beginning to the cycle.

595
00:38:57.641 --> 00:39:00.850
So when those come cycle is,
the seasons is the year,

596
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.610
the years a cycle of gets warm and then it gets,

597
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:08.670
it gets cold and different cultures choose different need times to start the

598
00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.210
year.
So in our culture,

599
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:15.570
it's January 1st and why is January 1st it's close to the winter solstice where

600
00:39:16.391 --> 00:39:19.810
the lowest point of the sun and the sun starts coming up after that,

601
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:21.610
which is December 22nd.
Well,

602
00:39:21.611 --> 00:39:24.100
the calendar's weren't very good and they didn't get it quite right.

603
00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:29.050
Christmas and new years in December 22nd or 21st I supposed to all be the same

604
00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:32.630
day,
but the calendars were not good enough to do that.
Uh,

605
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:36.790
the Romans put at the ides of March,
remember Julius Caesar getting killed then?

606
00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.240
And I just read the history of that.
They changed their calendar many times,

607
00:39:40.241 --> 00:39:44.980
but during most of their period,
it was the ides of March,
which is March 15th.

608
00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:49.120
Uh,
Chinese put their new year in February,
they had lunar calendar,

609
00:39:49.121 --> 00:39:52.660
so it rolls around a little bit,
a Jewish new years in September.

610
00:39:52.661 --> 00:39:53.890
And then that's a lunar calendar.

611
00:39:53.891 --> 00:39:58.891
So that rolls rolls around a little bit and every culture decides how it wants

612
00:39:59.621 --> 00:40:03.940
to set the beginning of the year.
It's,
it's conventional,

613
00:40:03.941 --> 00:40:07.520
it's not a scientific statement.
It's whatever any of the culture decides.

614
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.330
And similarly with when does life begin?

615
00:40:10.331 --> 00:40:15.331
Different cultures have decided different start points for this cycle of life.

616
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:23.610
One of the common ones is that life only begins after the worst period of infant

617
00:40:24.191 --> 00:40:27.400
mortality.
As many emotional economic,

618
00:40:27.401 --> 00:40:30.880
legal reasons that you really don't want to consider someone a human until

619
00:40:30.881 --> 00:40:31.660
they've,

620
00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:36.550
you're somewhat somewhat sure that the infant is going to stay alive.

621
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.220
So among the felony of West Africa,

622
00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:44.260
Nigeria and infant becomes a person and has given a named seven days after birth

623
00:40:45.041 --> 00:40:47.080
because that's the most extreme period.

624
00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:53.110
The Navajo in America don't consider the child is alive again,

625
00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.170
uh,
for this period of infant death and after delivery,

626
00:40:56.171 --> 00:40:59.590
it's kept in a cradle board as a kind of an extension of pregnancy.

627
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.240
They'd comes out,

628
00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:05.350
it's putting in a cradle board and that's considered the mother is still
pregnant

629
00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:10.450
with the baby.
And this is very nice.

630
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:13.030
When the child laughs for the first time,

631
00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:17.530
then it's considered a to B to be a human being and to be alive.

632
00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:21.670
And then they march,
they have a big ceremony to mark this child's birth

633
00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:24.850
in some cases and collect that.

634
00:41:24.851 --> 00:41:29.650
You read about a birth happens at puberty and some of the New Guinea tribes,

635
00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:32.140
uh,
the infant stays with a woman,
uh,

636
00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.950
until puberty and even boys were considered to be women there.
They're,

637
00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:39.690
they're just team of boys and girls are not differentiated.
Um,

638
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:44.870
and at puberty the males steal the boy away and they have a big,
uh,

639
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:49.670
birth ceremony.
You remember reading about this and in New Guinea,

640
00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:51.363
um,

641
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:56.890
or upon becoming a mother even because it's so in traditional China,

642
00:41:57.471 --> 00:42:01.850
which means up until the communist revolution and if not later,

643
00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:06.350
um,
a woman has sort of two lives,

644
00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:10.610
as you may remember from one of your readings that often a woman,
a girl child,

645
00:42:10.611 --> 00:42:13.820
is not even given a name.
Number one girl,
number two,
girl,
number three girl,

646
00:42:13.821 --> 00:42:18.740
they don't even get a name and they have sort of a a I existence.

647
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.210
And in,
in this,

648
00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:23.720
these parts of Chinese culture and mother is considered to start her life all

649
00:42:23.721 --> 00:42:26.390
over again at the birth of her first son,
not a daughter,

650
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.010
but the birth of her first son.

651
00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:33.520
The mother takes a new name at this time and she has a show by that time have a

652
00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:37.450
family name,
but the sun is never allowed to learn what her,

653
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:41.480
the name of her prior previous life was.
For all intents and purposes,

654
00:42:41.481 --> 00:42:44.690
her life begins at the birth of her first son.

655
00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.390
You read the article about the Egyptian woman,
remember what her name was,
um,
Gat.

656
00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:55.130
And that means mother of Gab.
So again,
she takes the name,

657
00:42:55.131 --> 00:42:59.340
which she has a whole life that starting a new,
a sense that when she has the,

658
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.630
the first son,
a mother of Gab.

659
00:43:05.060 --> 00:43:05.660
Okay.

660
00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:10.660
So the idea is that different cultures have very different takes on when life

661
00:43:12.171 --> 00:43:14.300
begins.
Since it's a cycle and it's arbitrary,

662
00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:19.010
cultures have a perfect right to choose whatever point they want for the

663
00:43:19.011 --> 00:43:23.910
beginning of this cycle.
And even within a culture.
And,
and,
uh,

664
00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:27.800
and I'm talking about culture of my friends who are largely no medical people.

665
00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:33.220
They all have very strong ideas about when life begins,

666
00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:35.123
um,

667
00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:40.240
and the obstetricians and gynecologists,
uh,

668
00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:44.000
because the vast majority of fertilizations do not result in a fetus.

669
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:47.810
And the mother doesn't show any,
any signs of it.
The mother doesn't know.

670
00:43:47.811 --> 00:43:52.370
There's no change in her body.
You can't test anything about the body.
Uh,
the,

671
00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:57.520
they consider implantation really early embryo sits into the uterine wall.

672
00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.650
And at that point there's hormonal signals going back,

673
00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:04.430
bouncing back and forth between the fetus and the maternal one.
At that point,

674
00:44:04.431 --> 00:44:08.640
the mother's body starts changing.
And so they consider that,
uh,

675
00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:13.790
the beginning point.
And when they say when you're pregnant,

676
00:44:13.791 --> 00:44:16.970
they're not talking about fertilization,
they're talking about implantation.

677
00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.820
And this causes lots of debate depending on where you define this.
Some,

678
00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:26.060
uh,
like birth control pills and various devices are supposed to work after

679
00:44:26.061 --> 00:44:28.010
fertilization,
but before implantation,

680
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.840
and we asked someone who's talking about beginning of life at fertilization and

681
00:44:31.841 --> 00:44:33.530
you'd say that's abortion.
If you're talking to someone,

682
00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:37.950
the beginning of life is that implantation that's not a abortion.

683
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:43.160
And this is almost never put out when people are arguing fiercely about these

684
00:44:43.771 --> 00:44:46.650
things that they're just using different definitions of,
of,

685
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:48.960
of when things begin.

686
00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:55.080
Another very standard one very important in western history is the ability to

687
00:44:55.081 --> 00:44:58.770
move.
So back then,
starting back from Aristotle,

688
00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:03.700
the difference between dead and alive was whether something had the power of,

689
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.420
of motion.
And that was called animation.
When you,

690
00:45:06.421 --> 00:45:08.340
when you move your animated like a cartoon,

691
00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:12.150
the cartoon is a fixed image and a comic book or something.

692
00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:17.070
Then you have animated cartoons and that's where they move around.
So the motion,

693
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:21.960
and you probably heard the,
the quick and the dead quick referring to movable.

694
00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:22.891
There's a famous book,

695
00:45:22.891 --> 00:45:27.120
the quick and the dead and it's a very common expression that you're either dead

696
00:45:27.121 --> 00:45:31.140
or you have the power to move.
And so,

697
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:36.990
uh,
Saint Thomas Aquinas tied together,
it actually comes from Aristotle.

698
00:45:36.991 --> 00:45:40.560
We'll go back to that in a minute.
Tied in Catholic theology,

699
00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:45.810
the ability to move with animation being alive.
And that happens at,

700
00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:50.340
uh,
we now call it quickening when the mother can feel the fetus,
uh,
start,

701
00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:55.710
uh,
to kick.
And because that's another way.

702
00:45:55.711 --> 00:45:59.610
So you're going to have,
uh,
when the embryo implants,

703
00:45:59.611 --> 00:46:02.190
when the embryo starts to move,
um,

704
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:06.480
the neonatologist are various in fetal viability.
You know,

705
00:46:06.481 --> 00:46:10.350
can the fetus stay alive outside the mother?
And they argued that this is,

706
00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.430
this is a sign of,

707
00:46:11.431 --> 00:46:15.330
it's an independent being cause it can live outside the mother.

708
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:19.350
And so that turns out to be the most delicate thing is when the lungs can

709
00:46:19.351 --> 00:46:20.730
function that a,

710
00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:25.570
a fetus or a baby can live outside the mother as long as there's enough lung

711
00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:26.370
function.

712
00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:30.900
So for the neonatalogist life begins when there's enough lung,

713
00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:35.280
lung function so that it can live outside the uterus.

714
00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:39.390
Now neurologist,
I'm a neurobiologist of neurologists are closest to my,

715
00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:42.180
I don't know to my heart,
but they're,
they're close to me.

716
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:46.980
They always defined the beginning of life.
You know,
when is someone human,
uh,

717
00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:51.780
as referring to some mental capacity,
uh,
that they can do.

718
00:46:51.781 --> 00:46:52.950
It might be motor response,

719
00:46:52.951 --> 00:46:56.820
it might align with the ability to move that they're looking for motor
responses.

720
00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:00.660
It might be brainwaves and might be ability to sense something.

721
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:06.230
A one variant of the neurologist's point of view has gotten to some extent

722
00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:10.740
embedded in the public debate.
And this is when,
uh,

723
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:15.410
the fetus can feel pain and that's,
that's the point at which,
uh,

724
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:18.630
life begins for legal purposes and they perceive it.

725
00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.540
And there's some research on this question on an awful lot.

726
00:47:21.541 --> 00:47:24.420
It's very hard to tell.
And what you can take,

727
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:29.170
what you can determine experimentally is we know this pain receptors on the

728
00:47:29.171 --> 00:47:32.720
surface,
like a few electric shock something and burn it or something.

729
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:36.220
There's pain receptors.
We can identify those,
we can stimulate those.

730
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:40.030
And we know the pathways by which it goes up to the CORTEX.

731
00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:44.110
And so by the seventh month,
at the beginning of the seventh month,

732
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:48.670
those neuropathways are mature enough so that at least the information that

733
00:47:48.671 --> 00:47:53.200
there's some pain has gone into the Cortex,
we still have no information of what,

734
00:47:53.201 --> 00:47:56.710
if anything,
the CORTEX does,
does with that information at this stage,

735
00:47:56.920 --> 00:48:00.040
it may not be ready to have any kind of response to it.

736
00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:06.880
So,
uh,
I got go on.
But all of these different ways of defining the beginning of,

737
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.920
of,
of a cycle,
beginning of the cycle of life.
And it's,
it's up to you.

738
00:48:11.921 --> 00:48:16.360
It's up to your cultural or scientific or academic predilections.

739
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:17.920
You can do it whatever you want.

740
00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:21.610
All of those designations are equally legitimate and equally illegitimate.

741
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.680
And none of them are a scientific question.

742
00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.470
Science will describe you all the stages of the cycle,

743
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:29.290
but it won't say anything about,
you know,

744
00:48:29.291 --> 00:48:32.680
where you should say the beginning of the cycle is,

745
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:36.280
it's a chicken and the egg problem.
Just,
just very,
very simply.

746
00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:41.530
Okay.
So now you have this thing that it's,

747
00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:44.940
it's not a scientific question.
Uh,

748
00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:47.770
there's a tremendous cultural diversity on it.

749
00:48:47.771 --> 00:48:51.170
There's tremendous diversity within,
uh,

750
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:55.300
the public of one culture like ours about it.
So,

751
00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:58.000
but the law has to define murder cause you know,

752
00:48:58.001 --> 00:49:00.910
I can't go and murder a ta because they gave me a bad grade.

753
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:03.850
And so the law has to define,

754
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:08.910
some has to accept one of these points and there's law has had a variety of,

755
00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:15.730
of things.
Wah w the law,

756
00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:19.660
what the law likes is what they call a bright white line that it's clear to

757
00:49:19.661 --> 00:49:23.230
everybody when you've crossed this line.

758
00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:28.120
And since the development of the fetus in the uterus is continuous,

759
00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:31.930
there's no particular point in time that you can say,
you know,

760
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:37.460
this stage is different than the day day before.
So no point during,
uh,

761
00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:41.260
a gestation would be a bright white line that everyone agrees that either

762
00:49:41.261 --> 00:49:45.400
happened or didn't happen.
Uh,
so what they,
the bright white line today is birth.

763
00:49:45.401 --> 00:49:48.310
Everybody knows when something has,
has given birth.

764
00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:53.380
And I'll tell you the moment that in,
in a Jewish rabbinic law,

765
00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.980
uh,
it's even more specific.
It's when half the head sticks out,

766
00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:01.570
then it's it.
That's,
that's,
that's when growth happens.

767
00:50:01.571 --> 00:50:05.140
That's when the fetus becomes a baby.

768
00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:11.160
And pretty much the courts have stuck so far in America with this conclusion

769
00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:18.010
that that birth is the bright white line.
Everybody can agree on that.

770
00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:23.770
There's also a fair amount of religious opinion,
everything that quickening,

771
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.980
that's another at least to the mother identifiable of hat.
No,

772
00:50:27.981 --> 00:50:31.420
an outside person can't necessarily tell this,
but the mother doesn't eat it,

773
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:35.150
does not know whether she's pregnant until quickening until she feels the baby

774
00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:36.980
kick.
She can miss a period.

775
00:50:36.981 --> 00:50:40.010
But there's quite a few reasons for missing a period other than pregnancy.

776
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:43.110
So some of the earlier laws and,

777
00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:47.690
and continuing into some of the abortion laws refer to quickening as,

778
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:50.240
as bright align as you can get,
but they're,

779
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:52.310
the mother knows it before everyone else.

780
00:50:52.311 --> 00:50:55.430
Eventually you can put your year and your hand to her to a pregnant woman's

781
00:50:55.431 --> 00:50:58.640
stomach and feel the kicks,
but the mother knows early.

782
00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:01.730
But since that happens over in different pregnancies,

783
00:51:01.731 --> 00:51:06.380
over quite a wide range of time,
over actually a month,
month and a half before,

784
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:11.330
uh,
the kicks become sensible.
Uh,
it's not a very,

785
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:14.030
very good,
uh,
kind of align.

786
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:20.370
Okay.
So,
uh,
we so far have that.
The,

787
00:51:20.371 --> 00:51:24.080
the idea of the beginning of life is not a scientific idea.

788
00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:27.230
It's very variable in,
in cultures.

789
00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:32.330
And so we still haven't really answered the question of why this idea that life

790
00:51:32.331 --> 00:51:35.660
begins at conception is such a prevalent idea in the west.
Again,

791
00:51:35.690 --> 00:51:38.720
other cultures have very different kinds of ideas.

792
00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:42.320
And one thing of course it pops up to mind is,
is it biblical?

793
00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:47.180
Because so much of our culture comes from biblical ideas and well,

794
00:51:47.181 --> 00:51:48.890
you know,
what some,
what is life?

795
00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:53.420
What does the Bible say about when life begins?

796
00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:58.100
Anybody know?
Nobody does all this fundamentalism in American,
nobody here.

797
00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:02.180
Um,
well what is the cycle of life described in the Bible?

798
00:52:02.181 --> 00:52:04.970
This is common and literature and the literature major should know this

799
00:52:06.770 --> 00:52:11.270
dust to dust.
How many of you have heard dust to dust?
Yeah,

800
00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:15.920
or something translated at,
at uh,
earth to earth.
Um,

801
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:16.790
uh,

802
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:21.350
it's genesis to some God formed man of dust from the ground till you return to

803
00:52:21.351 --> 00:52:24.500
the ground for out of it.
You were taken,
you are dust and to dust,

804
00:52:24.501 --> 00:52:27.500
you shall return.
That's the cycle of life.

805
00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.090
And if this is the beginning of cycle,
at what age did God create Adam

806
00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:39.050
does something moderately explicit method created Adam in his own image?
Well,

807
00:52:39.051 --> 00:52:42.680
the image of God is not a two Sonata fertilized egg,
right?

808
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:47.370
Whenever you perceive the image of God,
it's more or less an adult,
uh,
uh,

809
00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:49.610
a person.
And of course right away,

810
00:52:49.611 --> 00:52:52.970
Adam was able to receive commandments to not eat the fruit and so forth.

811
00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:58.160
And suddenly eve was born out of his ribs,
certainly not a to sell,

812
00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:02.270
uh,
a cycle.
So,
um,

813
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.560
again,
in the Old Testament,
there's just no,

814
00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:11.590
no support whatsoever for the idea that as a biblical idea that life begins at

815
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:18.140
conception.
And there is no in the New Testament,

816
00:53:18.141 --> 00:53:20.720
the issue just doesn't come up at all.
There's no,
no,

817
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:22.910
no statement about when life begins.

818
00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:28.330
We'll come to some statements which are very loosely interpreted in that way,

819
00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:31.710
in a minute.
So very interesting.
Uh,

820
00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:36.860
there's two great Catholic and then Christian because Christians inherited most

821
00:53:37.021 --> 00:53:40.150
of the theologians,
Saint Augustine and Saint Thomas Aquinas.
You,

822
00:53:40.151 --> 00:53:44.550
you've heard them all.
Saint Augustine came first 300 and something.

823
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:49.590
And in his confessions he's interested in this question and he says,

824
00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:50.730
tell me,
God,

825
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:56.040
tell me whether there was some period of my life which preceded my infancy is

826
00:53:56.041 --> 00:53:58.830
this period that I spent in my mother's womb.

827
00:53:58.890 --> 00:54:01.470
Was I anywhere or any sort of a person?

828
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:05.730
I have no one able to tell me that neither my father,
no my mother,

829
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:08.250
nor the experience of others nor my own memory.

830
00:54:08.970 --> 00:54:11.490
So here's one of the greatest Catholic saints and,

831
00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:14.760
and Theologians who's of course read the Bible,

832
00:54:14.761 --> 00:54:19.290
knows it backwards and forwards and he is very well aware that there isn't

833
00:54:19.291 --> 00:54:22.380
information in that to tell him that answer.

834
00:54:22.830 --> 00:54:26.670
So the conclusion is that this isn't a really a biblical,

835
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:31.990
the idea that life begins at conception is not something that comes from the

836
00:54:32.341 --> 00:54:33.174
Bible.

837
00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:34.683
<v 1>MMM.</v>

838
00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:38.990
<v 0>Okay.
I'm going to switch a little bit and come back to this,</v>

839
00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:41.000
these kinds of thoughts.
Um,

840
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:46.930
a little bit of the history of abortion and abortion has been known in history

841
00:54:48.201 --> 00:54:50.540
as far back as we can trace.

842
00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:55.400
The oldest reference is from an Egyptian hieroglyphs in tomb paintings.

843
00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:58.250
So we're talking about the very early civilization.

844
00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:03.450
As soon as people can write the writing about abortion by the time of the Roman

845
00:55:03.651 --> 00:55:04.490
empire,

846
00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:08.810
there were lots of references to abortion in the literature and there are no

847
00:55:08.811 --> 00:55:13.440
laws against the Romans didn't consider it.
And in the,

848
00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.710
as I've just mentioned in the New Testament,

849
00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:19.700
it's not mentioned at all in this course,
nothing,

850
00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:23.210
nothing was forbidding it.
So the New Testament,

851
00:55:23.211 --> 00:55:26.450
the Roman empire or a contemporaneous of course.

852
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:30.260
And so the conclusion is that even though abortion was very,

853
00:55:30.261 --> 00:55:35.120
very common at that time,
uh,
and used by all classes of people,

854
00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:36.710
uh,
there were,

855
00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:41.270
there it was not an issue for the new testament writers.

856
00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:44.473
And

857
00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:50.940
at the end of the Roman,
this classical period,
uh,

858
00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:55.980
this Judeo Christian way of thinking about things comes into the mainstream of

859
00:55:55.981 --> 00:55:57.540
Western civilization.

860
00:55:58.590 --> 00:56:03.590
And there is an explicit passage about abortion in the old testament.

861
00:56:05.330 --> 00:56:07.410
And anybody,
I don't call it out,

862
00:56:07.411 --> 00:56:10.860
but anybody know at least at least one person ought to know what this passage
is.

863
00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:16.410
One too.
So it's a very,
very minor number of people.

864
00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:21.180
So,
uh,
the 10 commandments,
which you all know,

865
00:56:21.181 --> 00:56:25.250
and you all know this passage also,
but I'll get to it.
Uh,
uh,

866
00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:29.110
the 10 commandments are an exodus 20,
and the six of the commandments is,

867
00:56:29.111 --> 00:56:32.350
you know,
you shall not kill.
And but what does this mean?

868
00:56:32.351 --> 00:56:35.320
What do all these laws means?
So the following chapters,

869
00:56:35.820 --> 00:56:38.940
there's an explanation of how to interpret these laws.
Uh,

870
00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.280
there's various violent acts that men do and which ones are accepting you.

871
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:45.880
May you beat your slave,
may you kill your slave,
may you do this,
may you do that.

872
00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:47.860
And there's a lot of jurisprudence in there.
You know what,

873
00:56:47.861 --> 00:56:51.300
what are these one sentence,
10 commandments.
What are they,
how do,

874
00:56:51.370 --> 00:56:56.200
how do you interpret them in particular cases?
Uh,
in Exodus 21,

875
00:56:56.201 --> 00:56:57.970
for instance,
what to do in cases of murder.

876
00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.880
What if one man hits another with a stone or his fist.

877
00:57:00.881 --> 00:57:04.460
What if a man kills the servant water from and kills a thief,
et Cetera.

878
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:06.770
All of this,
uh,
exegesis.

879
00:57:07.540 --> 00:57:12.190
And then in this package where it's explaining the 10 commandments hooding thou

880
00:57:12.191 --> 00:57:16.990
shalt not kill.
Uh,
it describes a crime that is much worse,

881
00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:21.850
uh,
than a modern abortion.
So in a modern abortion,
a woman for whatever reason,

882
00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:26.740
doesn't want to be pregnant.
She goes to doctrines is please doc,
I want,

883
00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:31.300
I want an abortion.
I don't want to be pregnant and here's 150 or $200,

884
00:57:31.301 --> 00:57:34.270
or whatever it costs,
and please do this for me.

885
00:57:34.271 --> 00:57:38.410
So it's voluntary on the part of the woman.
Uh,

886
00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:44.280
this passage in the Bible describes a worse situation where a man violently

887
00:57:45.791 --> 00:57:50.210
against the woman's will,
uh,
causes her to miscarry or,

888
00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:51.063
or abort.

889
00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:56.350
And this the quote when men have a fight in her to pregnant woman so that she

890
00:57:56.351 --> 00:57:58.930
suffered a miscarriage,
man is fighting with a woman there.

891
00:57:58.931 --> 00:58:01.570
So he goes after the wife rather than,
uh,

892
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:06.790
the husband when men fight and her to pregnant woman said that she suffers a

893
00:58:06.851 --> 00:58:09.820
miscarriage but no further injury.

894
00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:15.100
The guilty one shall be fined as much as the woman's husband demands of him and

895
00:58:15.101 --> 00:58:19.540
he shall pay in the presence of the judges.
Now that is a,

896
00:58:19.541 --> 00:58:24.541
is a standard HEBRAIC old testament law for property crime that you do a crime.

897
00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:28.180
Uh,
everyone knows,
you know,

898
00:58:28.181 --> 00:58:33.010
they decide that you actually have stolen this from the person and the victim

899
00:58:33.160 --> 00:58:36.400
gets to say how much is proper recompense for this?

900
00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:38.860
But the victim can't ask for anything outrageous.

901
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:43.270
So judge has to basically approve the settlement that if the judge approves

902
00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:45.280
some,
that you steal something,
well,

903
00:58:45.281 --> 00:58:48.010
I want that same thing back or 10 times as much or whatever it is.

904
00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:51.580
It goes before a judge.
The judge approves it.
If the judge approves it,

905
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:56.500
it's paid that,
that settles it.
So that's what happens if,

906
00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.870
if the fetus comes out,
if there's this miscarriage but no further injury,

907
00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:05.260
uh,
that's the result.
But it continues to passage.

908
00:59:05.261 --> 00:59:09.280
But if injury and sues you shall give life for life,

909
00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:13.300
eye for eye and tooth for tooth.
How many of you heard that sentence?

910
00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:17.170
Oh my God.
That's everywhere in Western civilization.

911
00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:19.960
Everybody should have heard that.
That's called the Lex Talionis,

912
00:59:20.170 --> 00:59:22.930
the law of the sort of thing and it,

913
00:59:22.931 --> 00:59:27.920
and it's very standard retribution for retribution.
So it's very,
very,

914
00:59:27.970 --> 00:59:32.450
uh,
interesting because it has an eye for an eye life for life.

915
00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:34.670
Well if you're talking about the baby or the mother,

916
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:38.990
life for life could be either,
even though it says the baby is gone already,

917
00:59:38.991 --> 00:59:43.460
you can still,
you know,
people fit a little bit life for life,
eye for eye.

918
00:59:43.461 --> 00:59:47.330
And then what is the third thing that she was tooth for tooth that lets you know

919
00:59:47.331 --> 00:59:48.680
right away babies don't have teeth.

920
00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.420
It's sort of the one thing that they're missing.

921
00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:55.840
And the fact that that this passage select that as the third thing to describe

922
00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:59.600
is very clear indication that,
you know,

923
00:59:59.870 --> 01:00:03.740
it's not the fetus they're talking about,
but it's the mother.
So this is very,

924
01:00:03.741 --> 01:00:08.330
very clear,
uh,
both from that so that she suffers a miscarriage.

925
01:00:08.330 --> 01:00:11.030
But no further injury then it's a property crime.

926
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:15.440
You've taken away something that,
that the father particularly wanted,

927
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:18.680
and the father's the one that gets to decide on it.

928
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:23.030
But if you do damage to the mother,
then you have to really,
really pay for it.

929
01:00:24.530 --> 01:00:26.690
So,
um,
that's,

930
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:29.960
that's the most explicit passage in the Bible about abortion.

931
01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.910
And it's totally clear that it's the life of the mother,

932
01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:37.220
the life and physical health of the mother.
That's the important thing.

933
01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:42.740
And the Jewish Talmudic law,
which is not the,
my book writing about it says,

934
01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:46.690
if a woman is in hard travail,
quote,

935
01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:50.300
enter life cannot otherwise be saved ones cut one,

936
01:00:50.301 --> 01:00:55.301
cuts up the child within her womb and extracts it member by member because her

937
01:00:55.491 --> 01:00:58.310
life becomes before that of the child.

938
01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:02.420
But if the greater part of the head was delivered,

939
01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:04.730
one may not touch it for one,

940
01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:09.250
may not set aside one's personal life for the sake of another.
So again,

941
01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:13.580
a very explicit statement that before birth,

942
01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:15.560
defined as half the head out.

943
01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.770
It's the life of the mother is the only critical thing.

944
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:23.330
But once that birth has actually proceeded,
uh,
then they are equal.

945
01:01:23.331 --> 01:01:27.230
And you can't even save the mother's life in this case.

946
01:01:27.590 --> 01:01:29.330
And what kind of procedures this is,

947
01:01:29.331 --> 01:01:32.690
this describing that's become politically very important now,

948
01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:37.880
partial birth abortion.
It's,
uh,
you know that the,

949
01:01:37.881 --> 01:01:39.470
the right to life people are very much opposed to,

950
01:01:39.471 --> 01:01:42.480
but here it is from biblical scholars,
uh,

951
01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:46.130
talking about it as when a woman is hard to Availon,
uh,

952
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:49.670
there's nothing to do but that then you go ahead and do that.

953
01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:56.150
So,
and of course this emphasis on the mother is exactly,

954
01:01:56.210 --> 01:02:00.050
uh,
what is reflected in the supreme court decision.
I've given you the,

955
01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:04.670
to read the Roe v Wade decision.
Um,

956
01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:09.440
uh,
and again,
it's,
it's the mother that is,
uh,

957
01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:14.210
that is the central interest.
But you may remember that the new,

958
01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:19.230
that the Roe v Wade divides up pregnancy into three trimesters the first three

959
01:02:19.231 --> 01:02:21.540
months,
the second three month,
and the third three months.

960
01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:25.740
And the first three months,
uh,
completely at the mother's discretion.

961
01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:30.510
The second three months,
the state can put some controls on it.

962
01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:33.120
And the third three months after the sixth month,

963
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:37.920
then the state has a lot of lot of say in this.
So the Supreme Court decision is,

964
01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:41.490
is kind of a balance.
And why did they decide to break it up?

965
01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:45.300
Might not haves a why into three months.

966
01:02:45.550 --> 01:02:50.310
And that probably again comes from,
uh,
is a biblical thing.

967
01:02:50.730 --> 01:02:55.140
So one of the quotes that that right to life is use a lot,

968
01:02:55.330 --> 01:02:57.540
and again,
you probably don't know this,

969
01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:00.690
but to go talk to right to life or if you're pro choice,
whoever,

970
01:03:00.691 --> 01:03:03.630
whenever side of this thing has a talked to Spock seriously to someone on the

971
01:03:03.631 --> 01:03:07.620
other side,
it's very,
it's always very informative.
Um,

972
01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:12.980
so there's this passage where Elizabeth is pregnant with John the Baptist and

973
01:03:14.221 --> 01:03:19.221
then Mary gets pregnant and she goes and to see Elizabeth and John the Baptist

974
01:03:19.291 --> 01:03:23.580
inside a Elizabeth's womb jumps for joy.
And have you,

975
01:03:23.581 --> 01:03:26.520
any of you heard this passage used in these,
these debates?
Again,

976
01:03:26.790 --> 01:03:31.530
just a few of you.
It's a very,
very standard sort of thing.
And,
and it goes,

977
01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.440
it's a in a,
in Luke.

978
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.690
And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary,

979
01:03:36.691 --> 01:03:39.840
the babe leaped in her in her womb.
For behold,

980
01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.210
when the voice of your greeting came to my ears,

981
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:46.250
the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
And so this is taken by,

982
01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.190
by right to life people that the baby in the womb is already as sentiment,

983
01:03:50.260 --> 01:03:54.360
a sentient person,
a full person.
Interestingly,

984
01:03:54.361 --> 01:03:59.250
the story gives,
gives extra information.
Zechariah,
that's Elizabeth's husband.

985
01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:01.920
They're very religious and they're old and they have no children.

986
01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:05.490
But then God rewards their goodness by making Elizabeth pregnant.

987
01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:09.690
It's a recast of the Jacob story,
or his life wasn't,

988
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:13.410
couldn't get pregnant.
And after these days,

989
01:04:13.411 --> 01:04:17.160
his wife Elizabeth conceived and for five months she hit herself.

990
01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:18.390
In the sixth month,

991
01:04:18.391 --> 01:04:21.630
Gabriel was sent to announced to Mary that she would bear Jesus.

992
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:26.700
And the Angel Gabriel explicitly explains to Mary to marry that Elizabeth is now

993
01:04:26.701 --> 01:04:30.840
six months pregnant.
And behold,
your kins woman,
Elizabeth in her old age,

994
01:04:30.841 --> 01:04:35.220
has also conceived a son.
And this is the sixth month with who?
With her,

995
01:04:35.221 --> 01:04:38.290
who was called barren.
And it's,

996
01:04:38.590 --> 01:04:42.660
it's amazing because the Bible is not in and no other passages that explicit

997
01:04:42.661 --> 01:04:47.340
about the stages of pregnancy and this repetition that at six months,

998
01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:52.590
something special happens is very diagnostic and is,

999
01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:55.080
is almost undoubtedly,
they don't explicitly say it.

1000
01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:59.070
The reason why the supreme court said it instead of enhance in these thirds of

1001
01:04:59.071 --> 01:05:03.750
the six month because that in a sense is in accordance with,

1002
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:08.070
with one interpretation of these Bible passages.

1003
01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:13.620
So it also is scientifically reasonable because of the cords with,

1004
01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:14.700
uh,

1005
01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:19.080
the time when the fetus does respond to external stimuli that by,

1006
01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:22.600
by six months if something,
if the mother gets excited or something,

1007
01:05:22.601 --> 01:05:24.820
you can detect it in the fetal heartbeat and so forth.

1008
01:05:24.821 --> 01:05:28.150
If there's a physical bang or something that you can detect it in the fetus.

1009
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:32.170
So at six months there's some sort of responsiveness,

1010
01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:35.710
neural responsiveness going on in the fetus.

1011
01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:40.690
Um,
the,
uh,

1012
01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:45.780
there's other passages and I put them all in your reading packet that I put the

1013
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:49.410
exodus passage,
which,
uh,

1014
01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:52.870
pro pro choice people refer to if they know it.

1015
01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:56.980
And the prolife passages,
I put them on your reading packet and you,
you can,

1016
01:05:57.010 --> 01:05:59.080
you can read them all.

1017
01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:05.830
So given the basic,
the silence,
except for this explicit,

1018
01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:08.720
really accepted the explicit passage in exodus about the,

1019
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:13.030
the criminal causing an abortion of this woman.

1020
01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:17.040
The Bible is really quite silent on this issue and yet it's a theater

1021
01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:20.680
theological we great importance.
So what has happened is the,

1022
01:06:20.681 --> 01:06:23.890
is the Christian theologians had to rely on the opinions of,

1023
01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.540
especially the ancient philosophers because when they,

1024
01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.500
this all started in the Roman empire,
those were their philosophers that were,

1025
01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:31.300
that were of importance.

1026
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:37.180
And as I mentioned to you that Aristotle argued that the matter of the fetus

1027
01:06:37.181 --> 01:06:39.700
came from menstrual blood and,

1028
01:06:40.030 --> 01:06:42.850
but he had gotten interesting after the discharge is over.

1029
01:06:42.851 --> 01:06:46.210
So he thought pregnancy started after menstrual flow has stopped.

1030
01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:49.780
So in a cycle where there was a menstrual flow,
he says,

1031
01:06:49.810 --> 01:06:53.230
after the discharge is over and most of it has passed out,

1032
01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:58.510
then what remains begins to take shape as a fetus,
the female menstrual blood,

1033
01:06:58.511 --> 01:07:00.910
however,
is incapable of doing this by itself.

1034
01:07:01.270 --> 01:07:03.430
It must have the stimulus and the male semen.

1035
01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:06.860
They didn't know anything about a spurns at that time,
but they,

1036
01:07:06.861 --> 01:07:10.300
they of course didn't know about semen and they knew that intercourse was

1037
01:07:10.301 --> 01:07:12.160
required.
What it did,
they had no clue.

1038
01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:16.270
Male semen does not contribute to the material of the fetus.

1039
01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:19.420
He wondered what guided the development of the blood and fetus.

1040
01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:24.040
And he thought there must be some agent that is introduced by the sperm,

1041
01:07:24.070 --> 01:07:27.920
which causes this coagulating blood to uh,

1042
01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:33.310
to take form.
And he coined the Greek word for this,

1043
01:07:33.370 --> 01:07:36.160
which later gets translated his soul and the,

1044
01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:40.150
the western idea of soul really comes from this Greek,

1045
01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:45.320
this era's Tutelian image of,
of whatever it is that comes in,
in the semen,
uh,

1046
01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:48.730
that org is,
does not contribute physically to it,

1047
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:52.710
but organizes this whole thing and much later in the,
in the,
uh,

1048
01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:58.300
in the,
uh,
you know,
1500,
16 hundreds when these issues became hot again,

1049
01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:02.980
this is one of the pictures of Aristotle's coagulum.
So this is is the womb.

1050
01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:07.930
And inside this stuff is,
uh,
uh,
mother's menstrual blood as,

1051
01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:09.100
as it is presumed.

1052
01:08:09.550 --> 01:08:12.850
And it's gradually getting organized where you really can't see much of the

1053
01:08:12.851 --> 01:08:14.710
organization in there,

1054
01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:18.710
but you can see is the blood vessels starting to form.

1055
01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:23.810
And if in fact you do a do dissections of,
of,
uh,
of a fetus,

1056
01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:25.670
the first thing that forms is the placenta.

1057
01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:29.420
This is the most obvious thing is the blood vessels of the placenta.

1058
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:33.230
The mother has half the placenta and the fetus has half the placentas.
I hope,

1059
01:08:33.231 --> 01:08:33.950
you know,

1060
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:37.640
and that that's where nutrients get exchanged and wastes gets taken out.

1061
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:41.420
And then,
uh,
I guess in the original,

1062
01:08:41.421 --> 01:08:44.720
somehow you could see that there was a gradual formation of the fetus,

1063
01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:47.940
but finally,
uh,
the,
the,

1064
01:08:48.010 --> 01:08:53.010
the fetus forms as some sort of coagulation of this blood under the influence

1065
01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:57.410
of,
uh,
of,
of,
of,
of semen.

1066
01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:02.120
And these are,
you all know this story.

1067
01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:04.610
So we,

1068
01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:08.040
we now interpret,
um,

1069
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:13.670
concepting concept is actually a very vague word.
Uh,
and I have in here,

1070
01:09:13.671 --> 01:09:14.501
but there isn't time read.

1071
01:09:14.501 --> 01:09:17.600
You're like what the Catholic encyclopedia says it isn't,
it's very,

1072
01:09:17.601 --> 01:09:21.230
very complicated.
It's not anything that,
that,
that,
that you think it is.

1073
01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:25.850
But we interpret now is more educated.
What,
how do we interpret conception?

1074
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:28.940
We use it as the same ideas,
fertilization.

1075
01:09:29.770 --> 01:09:34.400
Then if you make a distinction between conception and fertilization,
no,

1076
01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.790
I'm not gonna ask the opposite question.
Uh,

1077
01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:41.630
but fertilization has a specific current scientific concept.

1078
01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:45.020
Conception is an old thing that something undefined,

1079
01:09:45.290 --> 01:09:49.850
that an act of intercourse is needed and ejaculation of sperm is needed and

1080
01:09:49.851 --> 01:09:51.800
something goes on unknown,

1081
01:09:51.801 --> 01:09:55.490
but something goes on and that leads to a conception.

1082
01:09:56.570 --> 01:09:57.403
Um,

1083
01:09:57.650 --> 01:10:02.650
but our current interpretation of this as fertilization is often now taken to be

1084
01:10:04.041 --> 01:10:07.280
the traditional Western view,
the traditional Christian view.

1085
01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:11.810
But when was fertilization discovered?
When,

1086
01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:15.590
when we're sperms discovered,
I think you know this,

1087
01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:20.660
what's the name person who discovered invented microscopes?

1088
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:24.860
Antonie van Lavan Hook.
You've heard of Lou and Hook,

1089
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:26.690
I'm sure in high school you went through this.

1090
01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:29.200
He was the one that first found a little anamolecules.

1091
01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:32.030
He took drops of water and uh,
you know,

1092
01:10:32.031 --> 01:10:36.260
from ponds and looked at it and sold these little things swimming around.
And uh,

1093
01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:39.410
he defined them as anamolecules little animals.

1094
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:43.250
And then he looked in sperm and they were the little things swimming around

1095
01:10:43.430 --> 01:10:46.950
apparently,
I'm not sure that this is proper history.
They,

1096
01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:51.020
the spice trade was real important back then and they want to know what it was

1097
01:10:51.021 --> 01:10:53.280
that gave spice,
it's Tangy,
tangy flavor.

1098
01:10:53.281 --> 01:10:56.510
So He's invented a microscope to look at spice.
So let's see.

1099
01:10:56.511 --> 01:11:00.020
So cause very expensive to get spice all the way from the Middle East going

1100
01:11:00.021 --> 01:11:03.610
through mostly Muslim countries,
which who charged a lot to passage it.

1101
01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:05.390
And so it's very expensive and they wanted to know this,

1102
01:11:05.391 --> 01:11:07.580
the secret of spice and they thought there was something in it.

1103
01:11:07.581 --> 01:11:09.410
So then his microscope to look at that.

1104
01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:13.140
But what he found was a little anamolecules and eventually looks at sperm and he

1105
01:11:13.141 --> 01:11:15.900
sees the out of molecules in it.
What does he do?

1106
01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:18.870
He interprets it as the same amount of molecules in the water.

1107
01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:21.990
Well the sperm is made of something,
the,
I'm sorry,

1108
01:11:21.991 --> 01:11:25.290
the semen is made of something and the sperm are little contaminants,

1109
01:11:25.291 --> 01:11:29.610
which are eating it up there.
They're just like,
uh,
like the,

1110
01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.860
the little guys he saw in anything that was,

1111
01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:35.880
that was writing and um,

1112
01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:41.620
so that,
that was,
uh,
uh,
a sperm,

1113
01:11:41.621 --> 01:11:46.540
but they didn't have any idea of,
of what,
uh,
what,

1114
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.110
what it meant.
And then it was much later,

1115
01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:51.900
they didn't see human eggs and mammals,

1116
01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:56.160
even mammo eggs that you can see eggs with chickens.
Uh,
you can see eggs,
vin sex,

1117
01:11:56.161 --> 01:11:59.340
that's pretty obvious.
You can see eggs of fish,
that's pretty obvious,

1118
01:11:59.550 --> 01:12:03.750
but the egg of a mammo is so tiny that it can't be seen.

1119
01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.600
And so,
uh,
it was actually William,

1120
01:12:06.690 --> 01:12:10.350
this is a number of guys who are sort of gradually saw it and gradually realized

1121
01:12:10.351 --> 01:12:14.610
what it was.
But William Harvey,
the same guy that,
that,
that saw the circulation,

1122
01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:17.950
they figured out the circulation of blood,
um,

1123
01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.350
was one of the first ones to see an egg,

1124
01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:26.040
but they just knew about an egg and they,
and they said,
well,

1125
01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:29.160
that's sort of got rid of this blood coagulum stuff.

1126
01:12:29.161 --> 01:12:33.030
And he still had no idea what was in semen,
even though they saw sperms,

1127
01:12:33.031 --> 01:12:35.010
they didn't know that was in ag.

1128
01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:39.960
So it wasn't until 1840s that finally fertilization,

1129
01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:41.640
it was discovered in mammals.

1130
01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:45.060
And that is actually the physical matter of the sperm and the physical matter of

1131
01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:48.980
the egg,
uh,
comes together.
So,
uh,

1132
01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:53.940
the conclusion of all this is that the culture,
our culture,

1133
01:12:53.941 --> 01:12:56.550
and especially the religious parts of it,

1134
01:12:57.180 --> 01:13:02.180
believe that life begins at conception and believe this is a traditional idea,

1135
01:13:03.331 --> 01:13:07.200
that it goes way back to the beginning of Christianity,
even into the Bible.

1136
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:10.680
But in fact,
the whole idea of fertilization only dates from 1840.

1137
01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:15.770
And so it's a very modern idea and the whole,
and then going further,

1138
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:20.760
the whole idea of life having a beginning just doesn't make any scientific sense

1139
01:13:20.761 --> 01:13:24.570
because we know and have known for hundreds of years that that life is a cycle.

1140
01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:28.230
And so there's much more,

1141
01:13:28.231 --> 01:13:30.780
you have some very interesting reading on this topic and there's an infinite

1142
01:13:30.781 --> 01:13:35.220
amount of reading that you can do on it.
But that's all I'll say on it for today.
