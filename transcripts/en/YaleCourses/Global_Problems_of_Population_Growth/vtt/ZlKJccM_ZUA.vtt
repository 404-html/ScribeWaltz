1
00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.860
No,
I've been describing the relationship,

2
00:00:05.861 --> 00:00:10.600
the intimate relationship between sex and violence than the chimpanzee social

3
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:11.434
system.

4
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.370
This lecture and forever after we can shift our focus to humans and we ought to

5
00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:21.910
ask what's stayed pretty much the same and what has changed.

6
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.340
And today I'm going to discuss two topics,
uh,
one war in humans,

7
00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:31.120
which hasn't changed all that much or even certainly see a continuity.

8
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.280
And then I'm going to talk about,
uh,
fecundity in,
in humans,

9
00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:39.790
how many children we bear compared to chimpanzees.

10
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.060
And you'll see there's a very big difference there.

11
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.240
So,
uh,

12
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.930
the most obvious similarity and the one that gets the public quite excited is

13
00:00:53.411 --> 00:00:54.850
this similarity in,

14
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.730
<v 1>oops,
that was wrong.</v>

15
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.890
Come on.
Oh,
there we go.

16
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.473
Come on.

17
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.033
<v 0>Okay.</v>

18
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.400
So a violent death has always been very important aspect for humans,

19
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:42.010
especially,
well all the time.

20
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.210
But I'm going to talk now about what's called primitive times.

21
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.260
And this is data from a tribe that's in Paraguay,

22
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.420
in South America in the period just before it had real contact with Western,

23
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.250
<v 1>uh,
uh,</v>

24
00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.520
<v 0>people.
So it has nothing to do with,
with,
with maternity.</v>

25
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.930
This is apparently the way they lived for time in memorial.

26
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.410
And what this table does is list the number of deaths by age,

27
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.400
getting,
putting them in different age groups.
And here's just children,

28
00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:19.670
or we would call them infants almost zero to three years.

29
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.650
And you can notice this at Navigant,
amount of death.
This is all illnesses,

30
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.740
that's communicable diseases and all kinds of other diseases.

31
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.360
That's the percentage of deaths from that.
And then there's other causes,

32
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:37.010
a congenital degenerative accidents and some,

33
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.190
but here's violence.
Various forms of violence.

34
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.460
56% of infants from zero to three died because of violence.

35
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.080
Here is children age four to 14

36
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.673
<v 1>and</v>

37
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.930
<v 0>again,</v>

38
00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.930
we see that all illnesses about percent accidents,

39
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.130
violence,
74% violence.

40
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.810
Now adults during this as a 45 year period,
the,
the number,

41
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.950
the number of years in the periods are not equal.
And here his illness,

42
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.000
28% not insignificant accident,
not insignificant,

43
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.020
but the various forms of violent deaths,

44
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.530
46% and it's only when you get over 60 years of age.

45
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.930
So in each of those three age categories,

46
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.050
violent deaths have been the dominant form of death.

47
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:38.680
It's separated by males and females,
males,
females total.

48
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.010
And that's true for males and for females.
The song I'm showing you,

49
00:03:43.011 --> 00:03:47.620
this sum totals,
it's only even after age 60,

50
00:03:47.621 --> 00:03:51.220
violent death is still the dominant cause,
the third of deaths,

51
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.410
but it's the only age at which it doesn't really be 50 approximate,

52
00:03:56.411 --> 00:04:01.030
at least half the deaths only when you get that old.

53
00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.340
So it's,
it's quite striking.
Uh,

54
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.720
how significant a violent death is.

55
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.750
Inhuman demography and several things should be noticed there.

56
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.880
Uh,
that communicable diseases are less important for hunter gatherers.

57
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:23.070
These were very primitive hunter gatherers.
The RJ and one of your readings is,

58
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.040
is from their own description of,

59
00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:30.980
of the way they live in the dangers that they face,
um,

60
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.920
that communicable diseases are less important because the population density is

61
00:04:35.921 --> 00:04:40.210
so low later we'll see.
And so diseases just don't get to pass around.

62
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.740
We'll see later that the influence of disease rises drastically,

63
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:49.360
especially among infants when the population density gets high enough so that

64
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:53.530
people pass around diseases quite common.
Another thing.

65
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.450
You may notice from this that more individuals die in the first three years of

66
00:04:58.451 --> 00:04:59.284
infancy,

67
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.030
131 deaths than in the 45 years of adulthood,

68
00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:05.830
126 deaths.

69
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.040
So deaths in infancy are 50 per year or 15 times as common as deaths,

70
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.250
uh,
in a,

71
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.310
in adulthood and have 383 people who are catalog year.

72
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:21.610
Only seven people died of old age.

73
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.380
All of them had other really identifiable causes.

74
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.930
So,
uh,
given this background of the significance of violence,

75
00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:34.430
and this includes more than just war,
uh,

76
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.390
but does not include deaths from animals being eaten by animals,

77
00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:39.430
which is an ax considered an accident.

78
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.960
So,
um,
uh,

79
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.210
defining war talk going back to is we talked a lot about chimp,

80
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.680
what you might call chimp war and now talk about human wars.

81
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.020
Let's take a definition of war as the intentional killing of members of one

82
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:05.060
group by members of another group.

83
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.870
And the killing is done because they are members of a group,

84
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.550
not because of any prior or a particular individ conflict between individuals.

85
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.500
It's a group thing that determines the two sites that they're going to kill each

86
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:19.334
other.

87
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.270
So the human social system in primitive times and uh,

88
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.050
in some politically correct circuit,
not supposed to,

89
00:06:27.051 --> 00:06:28.800
you were use the word primitive,
but I,

90
00:06:28.801 --> 00:06:33.801
I use it in its original sense of living closer to the way humans did millions,

91
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.940
thousands,
many thousands or millions of years ago.
It's an early,

92
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.830
an early form of,
of being human.

93
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:45.730
So during that time we lived in small tribal groups and they're molting male

94
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:49.040
groups.
Again,
we talked about most animals,

95
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.170
solitary males with strong male bonding,
competition for status,

96
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.090
lots of intergroup conflict,

97
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.880
competition for females and violence against females.

98
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.960
Everything that we know says that humans have,
have lived in that,

99
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.870
uh,
in communities with those characteristics since as far back as as we can,

100
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:10.880
uh,
as we know.

101
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.680
And that is the same description you would put on chimpanzees.

102
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:17.400
Uh,

103
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.400
the archeological data shows that through early farming times we lived in these

104
00:07:23.931 --> 00:07:28.250
small dispersed settlements and the average size seems to be in the same range

105
00:07:28.251 --> 00:07:33.110
as current chimpanzees about 40 individuals size and communities range.

106
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.280
But when you dig up these,
the archeologists dig up these old settlements there,

107
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.280
that ballpark.
Uh,

108
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.430
the anthropologists studying currently alive,

109
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:48.350
people again find that the smallest organized group of humans is a politically

110
00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:53.300
autonomous group consisting of 20 to 50 individuals with the headman head man.

111
00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.710
And they called this the proper anthropological term is a band.
And again,

112
00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:00.200
basically the same size as a chimp community

113
00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:07.340
among chimpanzees as I've described to intergroup violence as a hit and run a

114
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:08.910
affair,
uh,

115
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.670
with small groups of groups of chimps from one community patrol their boundary.

116
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:17.300
They detect a,
an isolated individual,

117
00:08:17.301 --> 00:08:21.020
a very small group or even better,
a single individual and other community.

118
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.820
And then they attack in,
in,
uh,

119
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:29.520
anthropologists tell us that primitive warfare has exactly the same,
uh,

120
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:34.210
characteristics,
uh,
among current primitive groups.
Uh,

121
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:37.240
the communist form of combat is called raids and,

122
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:41.690
and bushes and communities are constantly engaging in this hit and run.

123
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.280
These hit and run raids on each other and they spring ambushes to,
uh,

124
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:50.000
to catch loan members of the other group.
Uh,

125
00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.480
I live for a while among headhunters in Borneo.

126
00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:57.450
Presumably they weren't headhunters anymore at that time and it was perfectly

127
00:08:57.451 --> 00:09:00.930
acceptable for them to go out and find a child from a neighboring community.

128
00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.390
Same,
same tribe,
same everything,

129
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.970
but the neighboring community playing by the river,

130
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.060
catch him and take off his skull.
And they had their addicts were,

131
00:09:10.061 --> 00:09:13.530
were decorated with skulls.
None of this was big.
You know,

132
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:16.500
that whole community fighting that whole community.
But little raids,

133
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:21.150
finding individuals didn't matter.
Child,
adult,
uh,
nothing,
uh,

134
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:26.040
mattered like that.
So,
uh,

135
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.950
so you can draw many similarities between,
uh,

136
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.150
to chimp organization of,
of these,
this lethal rating.

137
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:37.800
And if human warfare.
And so how does one think about this?
Well,

138
00:09:37.801 --> 00:09:39.180
there are two possibilities.

139
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.580
Either whatever you think of the chimp warfare and the causes of it,

140
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:48.570
you have to think that a lot of that is still causing human warfare.

141
00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.110
Or you can say as many,
uh,

142
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.470
utopians do that they're different,
that no human,

143
00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:57.360
human warfare has nothing to do with chimp warfare.

144
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.080
One of the ways to prove or disprove that,
uh,

145
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:05.190
would be to look in history as far as we can tell.

146
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.770
And if it has different causes,

147
00:10:07.771 --> 00:10:10.950
what you have to assume as we know for sure that this is what chimps do.

148
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.910
We presume that their ancestors,

149
00:10:12.911 --> 00:10:17.040
so millions of years ago before we split did that,
but we don't really know that.

150
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.990
Uh,
but we presume it's true that chimps did,
did that.

151
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.020
And then some time in human history we have to find a period where we stopped

152
00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:29.010
doing it.
And then at a later period we started doing it again.

153
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:33.300
But now for totally different set of reasons than for the chimp reasons.

154
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.040
So the strategy of trying to figure out this question is then to go back in

155
00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:42.000
history and gathered the archeological,
anthropological,

156
00:10:42.001 --> 00:10:44.940
whatever data we can gather and try to find out,

157
00:10:44.941 --> 00:10:49.290
has there been a period in human history where we were not,
uh,

158
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:52.920
did not have this intercommunal violence.

159
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:59.490
And the people who believe that war has different causes,

160
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.810
uh,
is,
uh,

161
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:06.300
they think agriculture started because land becomes valuable or private property

162
00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:10.260
of some sort.
People wanted to get each of those private property or governments,

163
00:11:10.261 --> 00:11:11.970
modern state governments,

164
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.660
or very commonly you'll hear that it has something to do with maternity.

165
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:21.020
That civilization has somehow corrupted the pure nature of early humans who were

166
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.540
a wonderful human beings and didn't go to war.

167
00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.550
So what was the situation for prehistoric humans?

168
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:34.080
So we can go back to the neanderthals which are close to as kind of sisters

169
00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.040
subspecies.
And these guys as you know,

170
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:43.170
heavy musculature,
robust bones,
they were strong,
obviously strong characters.

171
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.260
But when you take your study there,
graveyards,

172
00:11:46.590 --> 00:11:51.590
40% of neanderthal skeletons have head injuries and that.

173
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:58.090
How does one attribute that either they were very clumsy and accident prone and

174
00:11:58.091 --> 00:12:01.510
always somehow managed to fall on their head?
As far as we know,

175
00:12:01.511 --> 00:12:04.920
they didn't climb trees very much and hang upside down and fall.
Uh,

176
00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.800
or there was a lot of club wielding and head bashing going on.

177
00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.120
Homo Sapiens,
not,
not neanderthals.

178
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:18.150
The earliest human burials that haven't just decayed away are about 20,000 to

179
00:12:18.851 --> 00:12:22.720
35,000 years ago.
And when you dig them up,
what do you find?

180
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:27.430
Spear points embedded in the bones.
Cranio fractures,

181
00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.040
scalping marks and so forth.

182
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.260
These burial grounds are found wherever archeologists look a,

183
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.590
some of the most prominent ones are Italy,
France,
Egypt,
Czechoslovakia,

184
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:42.340
that because that's where archeologists have had access to dig,

185
00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.720
had a 13,000 year old cemetery in Sudan.

186
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.320
Over 40% of the skeletons had spear or Arrow points embedded in them.

187
00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:56.080
The wounds,
there were children buried there.

188
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.840
The wounds found from the children that's in the cemetery.

189
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:01.840
We're all execution shots in the head or the neck.

190
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:07.090
They're just bashed to death in the head of the neck.

191
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.930
This was not like one burial from one horrific incident.

192
00:13:10.931 --> 00:13:14.560
It was color used over several generations.
It was a continuing cemetery.

193
00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.300
And many of the adults show not only the wounds that caused their death,

194
00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.730
but many prior,
uh,
wounds,

195
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.670
bone cracks and skull cracks that had healed.

196
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:29.740
So you can see both a wound from some prior conflict which had healed and the

197
00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:32.380
new wound,
which caused the death at this moment.

198
00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:36.310
And individuals had gotten into a lot of conflict.

199
00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:39.520
One skeleton had 20 different wounds,

200
00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:44.730
that means bone cracks that you could still see a 13,000 years later.

201
00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.220
And soft tissue,
soft tissue injury,

202
00:13:48.221 --> 00:13:50.650
we just don't have any way of knowing about

203
00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.800
when you get to modern times are still prehistoric mean before we have any

204
00:13:56.801 --> 00:14:00.970
written records,
uh,
before anything you'd call civilization,

205
00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:05.500
things get a little stylized that,
that clearly culture is advancing.

206
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:10.180
There's a middle stone age cave in Germany,
only five or 10,000,

207
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:14.290
five to 10,000 years old where there are two caches of skulls,

208
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:16.240
just the skulls are there.

209
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:21.310
They're neatly arranged like eggs in a basket and they are then disembodied

210
00:14:21.311 --> 00:14:25.180
heads of men and women and children with multiple heads,

211
00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.350
multiple holes knocked by axis into their skulls.

212
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.130
And uh,
I don't have,
you didn't show a picture of that,

213
00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:36.430
but this is a modern version of this actually from Thailand.

214
00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.760
This is the way skulls can get,
uh,

215
00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.020
arranged this,
this,

216
00:14:43.021 --> 00:14:46.810
that picture has a totally different kind of purpose.

217
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.920
Um,
you,
how many of you remember ice man,

218
00:14:50.921 --> 00:14:55.220
the guy that got unfrozen from the Alps,
you're all aware,
aware of this?

219
00:14:55.221 --> 00:14:57.440
So in 1991,
uh,

220
00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.240
one of the glaciers in the Alps disgorge the stone age man who died,

221
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.940
they think 5,300 years ago,

222
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.240
and as at least a good number of,
you know,

223
00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:12.140
he had a lot of press and he was called the iceman,
uh,
ends.

224
00:15:12.141 --> 00:15:15.140
And since it took 5,300 years for him to come down the mountain,

225
00:15:15.141 --> 00:15:18.230
he must've died pretty high up,
uh,
in,

226
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:20.810
in some high point to the past in the mountain.

227
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:25.160
So it was just assumed that he died,
uh,

228
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:30.200
froze to death while trying to cross the Alps and a gun case in the ice.

229
00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:34.400
And 55,000 years later came down,
so for 10 years,

230
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:39.150
academic opinion said that.
And then they finally got it,
got around to,
uh,

231
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:43.250
taking a cat scan of the body,
and guess what?

232
00:15:43.251 --> 00:15:45.560
They found a two centimeter Flint.

233
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.560
Arrowhead had ripped through his scapula and,
uh,

234
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:52.760
lodged six centimeters deep into his shoulder.

235
00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:57.920
He had been shot from behind by an Arrow and he died of internal bleeding.
Again,

236
00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:03.340
a violent death.
You come to even more recent times,

237
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.500
a native American settlement,
American Indians,
uh,

238
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.010
for about 13,
25 Aidy.

239
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:14.270
So almost 200 years before their contact to have any contact with,

240
00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:18.800
with Westerners.
And this contains the remains of 500 men,

241
00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:23.150
women and children.
And this is kind of not a great picture,

242
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:25.410
but again,
uh,
what,

243
00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:29.870
what you see that these victims had been scalped mutilated.

244
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.700
And then something a little unique left exposed for a few months to scavengers

245
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.410
before,
uh,

246
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:40.550
being buried again as a form of punishment,

247
00:16:40.551 --> 00:16:42.710
disrespect or whatever for the victim.

248
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.410
You're not only slaughter than mutilate them,

249
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.160
maybe mutilate and then slaughter them,
and then you leave the scavengers to,

250
00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:53.090
to chew on them.
And then finally they get buried

251
00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.440
in short archeology,
documents,
warfare,

252
00:16:57.441 --> 00:17:00.560
and every well studied region for the past 10,000 years,

253
00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:05.510
which is when we have very good records.
Okay?
So that's what you can dig up.

254
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:11.000
The other thing is to look,
uh,
at,
uh,

255
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:13.010
currently primitive human beings.

256
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:16.790
And they ask how many of them are truly a peaceful?

257
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:22.600
And so the anthropologists now take over from the archeologists what the

258
00:17:22.851 --> 00:17:27.851
anthropologists funds that 90 to 95% of known societies have been involved in

259
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:32.600
war,
that we can document of one sample of 50 societies,

260
00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:34.130
45 engaged in war,

261
00:17:34.131 --> 00:17:39.131
frequently for did not engage in war because they had recently been driven into

262
00:17:39.471 --> 00:17:42.350
isolated refuges,
uh,
by warfare.

263
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:47.710
And if any of you been to the Indians and Mara Indians in Lake Titicaca in Peru,

264
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:50.790
it's a big tourist spot.

265
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.420
There's an island in the middle of Lake Titicaca and they're very peaceful

266
00:17:54.421 --> 00:17:56.760
people.
They live on reads,
they don't have anybody to fight.

267
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.360
They were pushed off the mainland by war and they've just been isolated.

268
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:02.010
So that's one of the group that said,
well,

269
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.400
we haven't seen them get into any wars,
but they have no possibility,

270
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.430
<v 1>uh,
of it.
Uh,</v>

271
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.120
<v 0>and one which is called peaceful in the monarchy,</v>

272
00:18:14.121 --> 00:18:17.270
which live actually in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California.

273
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:21.860
They say we'll calm,
peaceful because they only rarely go to war.

274
00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.950
Another study,
66% of primitive societies who went to war every year,

275
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:31.520
75% at least every two years,

276
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:35.810
and up to 90% went to war at least once every five years.

277
00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:39.310
So the evidence is mounting up that,
uh,

278
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.430
so called primitive humans are not a terribly peaceful lot.

279
00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:48.940
The Donnie tribes in of New Guinea had seven full battles and nine raids in one,

280
00:18:49.431 --> 00:18:50.840
five and a half month period.

281
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.540
We can tell some anthropologists for sitting there for five and a half months.

282
00:18:53.541 --> 00:18:56.420
And that's,
that's the number that he counted.

283
00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.480
One Yanomamo village that's,
uh,

284
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:03.980
in Venezuela it was rated 25 times in 15 months.

285
00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.190
In the u s west,
80,

286
00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:12.400
86% of the Indian tribes went rating or had to resist rates at least once a

287
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:18.400
year.
Now you come to groups that are usually peaceful.

288
00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:23.050
So there's a group in Malaysia called the semi,
and they were recruited.
So,

289
00:19:23.051 --> 00:19:24.550
but during World War Two,
as you know,

290
00:19:24.551 --> 00:19:29.551
the Japanese took Malaysia and the British incited a sort of a guerrilla

291
00:19:30.671 --> 00:19:32.890
movement against the Japanese.

292
00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:38.020
So they retained a scouts by the British,
uh,
to fight.

293
00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:39.400
And I'm sorry,
this was later.
This was,

294
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:45.200
there were scouts to fight the grill and grill insurgency by coming by I suppose

295
00:19:45.201 --> 00:19:46.034
to communists,

296
00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:50.860
but eventually some of the guerrillas killed a few of the semi,

297
00:19:50.861 --> 00:19:54.960
a few of their kinsmen.
And then even though they had never been known to be war,

298
00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:59.590
like they became extremely war.
Like when say semi veteran recalled,

299
00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.630
we killed,
killed,

300
00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.260
killed the melees would rob the corpses,

301
00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:09.310
but we did not want anything.
We thought only of killing.

302
00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.400
Why truly we were drunk with blood.

303
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.780
Sounds like that.
There are cultural,

304
00:20:16.781 --> 00:20:21.781
like many cultures have repressed the killing for some instinct or killing

305
00:20:21.821 --> 00:20:24.340
propensity for for one reason or another.

306
00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:28.880
And then when the cultural controls came off,
boom,
the,
the,

307
00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:32.890
the instinct just roars up totally full blown almost instantaneously.

308
00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:38.440
And we've seen that in so many cases that Yugoslavia recently where people live

309
00:20:38.441 --> 00:20:42.630
together for a very long time in moderate harmony.
Uh,

310
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:47.120
all of a sudden,
Bang,
they start killing each other.
Uh,

311
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.120
the Germans in the 19 before the depression in the 1920s were among the most

312
00:20:52.121 --> 00:20:55.540
civilized people on earth and science and education.
Boom.

313
00:20:55.541 --> 00:20:58.480
They become savages almost immediately.

314
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:03.610
So I think the indication is there is something inside of us ready to pop out.

315
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.260
Culture can repress it,

316
00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.440
but demagogues know how to stick their finger into populations and pull out that

317
00:21:11.141 --> 00:21:16.141
us them and vilify the them and bring us right back to chimpanzee days.

318
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.660
Uh,
you all know,
yeah,

319
00:21:19.661 --> 00:21:24.661
it was the center for study of the Cambodian genocide where now one group of

320
00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:25.600
people,

321
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.330
the Cambodians sort of split into two and the slaughter,

322
00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:32.890
it was terrible.
How have you seen,
how many of you seen the movie,

323
00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:36.910
the killing fields?
How many of you know about the Cambodian genocide?

324
00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.800
Again,
most of you,
but not,
not all of you.
It's one of the most recent,

325
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:44.500
most terrific,
uh,
kinds of killing

326
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:48.700
and the,
this killing is,
can be,

327
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:55.060
what basically happens is that one group does not consider another group.
Humans.

328
00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.030
And if you look in primitive languages,

329
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:01.390
very often the word for human is the same as the word for their group,

330
00:22:01.391 --> 00:22:05.470
whatever their group is.
And in the American Indians,

331
00:22:05.471 --> 00:22:08.860
that was also,
uh,
a common,
uh,
kind of phenomenon.

332
00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:13.930
There's a good report from March 18th,
1690,
uh,

333
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:18.760
in salmon falls,
New Hampshire were a girl named mercy short lived.

334
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:23.580
They were rated by the Abenaki Indians that was at that time,

335
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:25.660
69.
Of course,
a real frontier town.

336
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:30.430
Mercy saw them kill her parents and three of her brothers and sisters,

337
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.120
she was taken to on a long winter march to Canada.

338
00:22:34.121 --> 00:22:38.740
The captors sort of dragged her up to Canada.
During that March,

339
00:22:38.741 --> 00:22:41.410
he saw a five year old boy chopped to bits,

340
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:46.660
a young girl's scalped and was forced to watch with her hands tied as another

341
00:22:46.661 --> 00:22:46.961
fellow.

342
00:22:46.961 --> 00:22:51.961
Captive was stripped bound to a stake and tortured with fire after which the op

343
00:22:52.321 --> 00:22:57.321
and Aki danced about him and it every term turn they did with their knives,

344
00:22:57.461 --> 00:23:02.461
cut ups of his flesh from his naked limbs and throw them with his blood into his

345
00:23:02.981 --> 00:23:06.610
face.
Remember,
there's someone who's already a captive with the hands tied,

346
00:23:06.611 --> 00:23:09.190
so there's no immediate threat.
It's a,

347
00:23:09.191 --> 00:23:14.191
it's a clear sign of just not considering these outgroup individuals as humans

348
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:21.050
that all group chimpanzees have once one set of morals Torta in,

349
00:23:21.611 --> 00:23:25.480
in,
in group.
And as a,
as I've told you that in the wild,

350
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.530
the male male conflicts never result in death nor did the male female conflicts

351
00:23:29.531 --> 00:23:33.910
within a group.
Uh,
but in an outgroup if possible,

352
00:23:33.911 --> 00:23:38.380
they always result in death.
Now what is,

353
00:23:38.381 --> 00:23:42.110
when one think of that,
of this,
there's a very interesting story,
uh,

354
00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:47.670
from early America is actually a miracle vis Bucci after whom America is named.

355
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.230
And you know,
Columbus discovered America 1492,
10 years later,

356
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:59.060
uh,
they were exploring all around and Vespucci went on,
uh,

357
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:04.240
one of the exploration expeditions along the coast to South America and he had

358
00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:10.910
some interaction with the local tribes people and had some interpreters on
board.

359
00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:16.090
Columbus had brought some natives back to Europe and they were able to do some

360
00:24:17.331 --> 00:24:21.500
kind of translation and he was very interested that how different they were from

361
00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:25.370
Europeans.
Their marriages are not with one woman,

362
00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:29.120
but with as many as they like and without much ceremony.

363
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.340
Meaning they just get married very casually.

364
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:35.180
And we have known someone who had 10 women married to him.

365
00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.860
They were very prolific people,
meaning having lots of children,

366
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.890
but they have no heirs because they hold no property.

367
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.430
Even childbirth is without pain.

368
00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:51.910
Coke women in parturition do not use any ceremony as ours do the everything go

369
00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.990
on the same day to the fields and wash themselves.

370
00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:01.460
It seems that they hardly feel their parturition,
parturition giving,

371
00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:03.080
giving birth.

372
00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:08.500
Now you can see that what he's dealing with is the 15 hundreds there were in the

373
00:25:08.571 --> 00:25:12.470
late renaissance attitude,
political science theory.

374
00:25:12.471 --> 00:25:17.450
What is it that causes wars between societies,
which it had lots of back then.

375
00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:22.370
And one of the issues is original sin.
These are very religious people.

376
00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.440
And uh,
what was the,

377
00:25:25.441 --> 00:25:29.510
the major punishment for Eve's eating of the apple.

378
00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:32.730
<v 1>Okay.</v>

379
00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.220
<v 0>Pain in childbirth,
severe pain in childbirth.</v>

380
00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:38.000
Here were some people that had no pain in childbirth and he,

381
00:25:38.001 --> 00:25:42.210
he waxes poetic about that,
where they absolved of original sin.

382
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.080
Uh,
that's the kind of issue that,
that's an in his mind.

383
00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:52.260
He also says they are people who lived in many years and according to their

384
00:25:52.261 --> 00:25:56.250
succession,
we have known many men who have four generations living.

385
00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:00.270
So that's about 80 is what is he referring to here again from the Bible,

386
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.393
<v 1>this,</v>

387
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.770
<v 0>the span of life.
What's the span of life?
70 years.</v>

388
00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.510
Very hard to fit four generations into that.
So again,
he's reflecting that this,

389
00:26:10.511 --> 00:26:13.690
these are not people,
uh,
like European people.

390
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:19.240
So he goes on with all the wonders of their civilization or there and

391
00:26:19.241 --> 00:26:23.400
civilization,
whatever you want to call it.
But he says quote,

392
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:28.120
they are a warlike people.
And when they fight,
they do so very cruelly.

393
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.530
And that side,
which is Lord of the battlefield,
bury their own dead,

394
00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:35.860
but the enemy dead,
they cut up and eat.

395
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:41.350
One of their men confessed to me that he had eaten the flesh of more than 200

396
00:26:41.351 --> 00:26:42.184
bodies

397
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.500
continuing for speechy talking.

398
00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.780
The most astonishing thing about their wars and cruelty is that we could find no

399
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:56.781
reason for them since they have no property or lords or kings or desire for

400
00:26:58.171 --> 00:27:00.090
plunder or lust to rule,

401
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:05.430
which seems to me to be the causes of war and disorder.
Again,
straight,

402
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:08.250
late renaissance theory,
political science theory.

403
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.960
When we ask them to tell us the cause of the war and disorder,

404
00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:18.000
they could give no other reason except that this war began among them a long

405
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:22.380
time ago and they wished to avenge the death of their ancestors.

406
00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.350
So it's,
it's a,
it's a very interesting passage.
Um,

407
00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:33.930
the Indians,
you know,
Vespucci is ideas that original sin is what causes this.

408
00:27:33.931 --> 00:27:37.650
And then political,
the,
the,
the sins that humans do have,

409
00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:42.210
the lust for power,
et Cetera,
is what causes all these wars.

410
00:27:42.211 --> 00:27:46.290
And none of that fits,
uh,
these South American Indians.

411
00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:51.470
Uh,
the same message that the color,

412
00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:55.200
it's not obvious what the cause of these wars is,
comes from modern anthropology.

413
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.131
So,
you know,

414
00:27:56.131 --> 00:28:00.360
the Yanomamo of Venezuela and Brazil who are very violent people there,

415
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:05.010
there was a book called the fierce fierce people that describes them.

416
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:09.780
They're very,
very warlike there in that border between Venezuela and Brazil,

417
00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:14.700
they're involved in almost constant warfare.
And yet,
what are they after?

418
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:19.020
Yanomamo villages,
a Shriner by abundant unoccupied territory.

419
00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.290
They're just not settlement to settlement to settlement.
There's,

420
00:28:22.291 --> 00:28:24.930
there's plenty of space in which they could expand.

421
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.210
Napoleon Shania on you may have heard of the anthropologist who studies the

422
00:28:30.211 --> 00:28:34.320
animal believes that the fighting between them was department apparently

423
00:28:34.321 --> 00:28:38.340
motivated only by desires to exact revenge and capture.
Women

424
00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:44.160
seem to come across this before,
but again,

425
00:28:44.161 --> 00:28:47.950
just as an within,
as in chimpanzees,
in primitive warfare,

426
00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:51.570
females are killed as often as they are captured.
Uh,

427
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:56.970
and most of these primitive tribes as well as modern peoples have difficulty,

428
00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:01.290
uh,
getting food not as a cause of war,
but as a result of war,

429
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:06.620
things get so disrupted by war that that's the reason they have trouble getting

430
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.750
food.
Okay.

431
00:29:09.751 --> 00:29:14.751
All of this is archaeological and anthropological studying times or peoples who

432
00:29:15.511 --> 00:29:18.060
don't have really any writing system.

433
00:29:18.061 --> 00:29:21.210
So in a sense it's pre historic.

434
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.670
Once we come to writing the record,
the record of violence

435
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:31.480
slows hot and heavy.
Uh,

436
00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:36.690
the first account of the exploits of mortals are our military histories.

437
00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.430
The earliest writing of the Chinese,

438
00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:43.300
the Greeks and the Romans are concerned with wars and warrior kings the most.

439
00:29:43.301 --> 00:29:47.620
My,
my in hieroglyphic texts are devoted to the genealogies,
biographies,

440
00:29:47.621 --> 00:29:50.530
and military exploits of the Mayan kings.

441
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:55.030
The earliest Egyptian hieroglyphics record the victories of Egypt.

442
00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:58.630
First Pharaohs,
uh,
the first,
uh,

443
00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:03.010
secular literature written in cuneiform recounts the adventures of the Warrior

444
00:30:03.011 --> 00:30:04.870
King Gilgamesh.

445
00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:11.380
The early and extreme more lightness of the earliest civilizations is laid out

446
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:12.370
in the Bible.

447
00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:16.020
You're just read the Bible and you get the whole message I'm giving you.
Uh,

448
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:21.330
the earliest written part of the Old Testament exodus recounts the brutal Hebrew

449
00:30:22.121 --> 00:30:26.890
conquest of Canaan.
So numbers,
uh,
31,

450
00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:31.510
seven,
18,
uh,
the Israelites get the 10 commandments,

451
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:35.890
thou shalt not kill,
and then they go off to conquer Canaan with,

452
00:30:35.891 --> 00:30:37.480
with lots and lots,
lots of killing.

453
00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.080
They wage war against the Midianites as the Lord.

454
00:30:41.081 --> 00:30:43.520
This is one of my favorite passages.
Uh,

455
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:47.800
they wage war against the Midianites that the Lord had commanded Moses and

456
00:30:47.801 --> 00:30:49.330
killed every male among them.

457
00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:53.800
But the Israelites kept the women of the Midianites with their children as

458
00:30:53.801 --> 00:30:57.010
captives.
When Moses learned about this,

459
00:30:57.011 --> 00:31:00.340
the captains came back thump their chest.
We've had a great victory.

460
00:31:00.341 --> 00:31:03.580
We've killed all the men.
And here we have the women and children as captives.

461
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.290
Moses becomes angry.
So you have spared all the women why?

462
00:31:08.291 --> 00:31:12.100
They are the very ones who prompted the unfaithfulness of the Israelites toward

463
00:31:12.101 --> 00:31:15.160
the Lord slay.
Therefore,

464
00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:19.330
every male child in every woman who has had intercourse with a man,

465
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:22.330
but you may spare and keep for yourselves.

466
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.180
All girls who have had no intercourse with a man,

467
00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:31.840
an echo of the chimpanzees,
who when a female tries to transfer,

468
00:31:31.841 --> 00:31:36.190
if she has children,
she's a goner.
If she's young,

469
00:31:36.191 --> 00:31:40.210
presumably a virgin,
then she will probably be allowed to transfer.

470
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:42.220
After the fall of Jericho,

471
00:31:42.221 --> 00:31:46.780
the Israelites quote put to the sword all living creatures of the city,
men,

472
00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:51.220
women,
young and old,
as well as oxen,
sheep and asses.

473
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:56.080
Next,
they attacked.
Uh,
I,
there fell that day,

474
00:31:56.081 --> 00:32:00.240
a total of 12,000 men and women,
the entire population of I.

475
00:32:01.290 --> 00:32:02.123
<v 1>Okay,</v>

476
00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.910
<v 0>so the,
the clear thing,
it's quite striking how this come.</v>

477
00:32:05.911 --> 00:32:09.650
So soon after the 10 commandments that was clearly going on is just as engine.

478
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:14.210
There's an Ingroup and clearly the 10 commandments has made intended for the

479
00:32:14.211 --> 00:32:18.320
ingroup.
Thou shalt not kill straight chimpanzee.
However,
outgroups

480
00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:23.930
if you don't kill them all,
you're,
you're,
you're not obeying God's commandments.

481
00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.370
So in very modern times,
uh,

482
00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:35.140
atrocities continue with no lessening of,
of the,

483
00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:40.070
of the horrific nature of it compare to chimps,

484
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:44.930
early human beings.
And they'll describe one of one famous event to which,

485
00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:50.240
how many of you know about the rape of Nanking?
Again,
not all of you,

486
00:32:50.241 --> 00:32:54.920
all of you should know these things that I referred to are very important
things.

487
00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:59.120
Uh,
this is during World War II in I think it was 1937,

488
00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:03.590
the Japanese were trying to conquer China and there's a big place and they were

489
00:33:03.591 --> 00:33:06.900
getting rid of the frustrated cause.
They're in Japan is a small place in China,

490
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:11.870
a huge place and it's not an easy thing to do,
but they captured a city called,

491
00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:15.560
uh,
nine king and the south of the Yangtze River.

492
00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:21.590
In short order.
The Japanese Cloeter 350,000 people,

493
00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.900
the total population of nine king at the time,

494
00:33:24.901 --> 00:33:29.901
it was only about 650,000 and several hundred thousand had already fled.

495
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:30.891
In short,

496
00:33:30.891 --> 00:33:34.370
they basically killed every Chinese that they can find just like the Bible

497
00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:36.710
stories or the chimpanzee stories.

498
00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:42.280
A Japanese newspaper reporter watch Chinese prisoners being bayoneted on the top

499
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:46.010
of the city wall.
One by one.
The prisoners fell down into the,

500
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:49.400
to the outside of the wall.
Blood spattered everywhere.

501
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:54.380
The chilling atmosphere made one's hair stand on end and limbs tremble with
fear.

502
00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:58.880
So this report is talking only from Japanese and we'll see not Nazi sources

503
00:33:58.881 --> 00:34:02.390
because the possibility the Chinese sources may be exaggerating or something,

504
00:34:02.391 --> 00:34:05.880
but the belief is that neither the Japanese,
no,

505
00:34:05.881 --> 00:34:08.420
the Nazi sources would exaggerate.

506
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.060
Another Japanese military correspondent,

507
00:34:11.061 --> 00:34:15.810
even more constraint described another locale where the murders were by Samurais

508
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.100
style decapitations those in the second row,

509
00:34:19.101 --> 00:34:23.210
we're forced to dump the separate bodies into the river before they themselves

510
00:34:23.211 --> 00:34:27.620
were beheaded.
The killing went on nonstop from morning until night,

511
00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:32.840
but they were only able to kill 2000 persons that way.
The next day,

512
00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:37.580
tired of killing in this fashion,
they set up machine guns so great.

513
00:34:37.581 --> 00:34:41.330
Was the slaughter that the Japanese general complained that he could not find

514
00:34:41.331 --> 00:34:45.020
ditches deep enough to bury the enormous pile of corpses.

515
00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:51.230
Tens of thousands of Chinese women were raped often in schools and nunneries

516
00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:56.300
thousands more were put into sexual slavery,
forced into prostitution.

517
00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.620
Who knew referred to in Japanese as public toilets.

518
00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:03.170
The women forced into prostitution's.

519
00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:09.350
Many soldiers went beyond rape to disembowel women slice off their breasts,

520
00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:12.020
nailed them alive to walls.

521
00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:14.810
Fathers were forced to rape their daughters and sons.

522
00:35:14.811 --> 00:35:17.840
Their mothers not only did live burials,

523
00:35:17.841 --> 00:35:21.770
castration and the carving of Oregon's and roasting of people become routine,

524
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:26.240
but more diabolical torches were practice like hanging people from their tongues

525
00:35:26.241 --> 00:35:31.241
on iron hooks are burying people to their waists and watch them being a tour and

526
00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:33.860
watched them being torn apart by German shepherds.

527
00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:39.300
So sickening was the spectacle that even the Nazis in the city were horrified

528
00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.010
when the Japanese took Singapore.
Right after Pearl Harbor,

529
00:35:44.011 --> 00:35:48.030
they shot and decapitated another 20,000,
uh,
Chinese.

530
00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:49.240
So that was just a,

531
00:35:49.241 --> 00:35:54.241
a modern example to show you that whatever this is in humans that makes us

532
00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:57.870
wanting to kill members of another group,

533
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:01.930
it is totally unfettered by anything that you might call a control or,

534
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:06.390
or a civilization when it breaks out.
The violence is just incredible.

535
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:13.490
So the bottom line is that war seems to be characteristic of almost all

536
00:36:14.611 --> 00:36:18.300
[inaudible] and possibly all human societies at all times in our history.

537
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.180
There is no example,
no,
no period,

538
00:36:21.181 --> 00:36:25.290
which we can find out where there's a discontinuity between the chimpanzee

539
00:36:25.291 --> 00:36:30.210
behavior and our current behavior.
And so again,
I think whatever

540
00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:35.910
you think of what's causing the chimpanzee more,

541
00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.720
you're probably have to consider very much the same explanation for,

542
00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:42.750
for human war,
the amount of death.

543
00:36:42.751 --> 00:36:46.530
I showed you one example from one tribe,

544
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:49.620
the achene South American,
any one tribe,
uh,

545
00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:54.270
good experience may or may not be characteristic.
This is from a book,
uh,

546
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.140
Lawrence Keely,
a war before civilization,

547
00:36:58.141 --> 00:37:01.110
which traces a lot of the information I've been giving you.

548
00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:06.120
And what he does is he,
he collects all the data than anybody has ever captured,

549
00:37:06.121 --> 00:37:07.860
not just that,
that are sort of,

550
00:37:07.861 --> 00:37:11.310
he can get some idea of the percentages of deaths by war.

551
00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:16.740
And this is percent of deaths from warfare.
This is males.
Uh,

552
00:37:16.741 --> 00:37:18.540
and this is everybody together.

553
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.890
So in these are different tribes at different times for whom we have data.

554
00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:25.320
And you'll see that the numbers,

555
00:37:25.321 --> 00:37:30.321
the mail numbers go up to 50 or 60% of male deaths are from these wars and the

556
00:37:32.041 --> 00:37:36.350
deaths of everybody,
which is,
which is this is somewhat smaller,
uh,

557
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:40.290
a fifth or a sixth,
15 to 20% of deaths,

558
00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:44.940
but going up of course to two,
uh,
40% of deaths.

559
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:48.420
So what the point he's trying to make with this graph is,

560
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:53.580
here's primitive warfare.
These are darkly colored bands.

561
00:37:53.581 --> 00:37:58.350
What he calls primitive warfare.
And the white bands,
uh,

562
00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:02.790
are uh,
so called civilizations and he called civilization.

563
00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:05.790
Anything that has a state like the Aztecs had a state.

564
00:38:05.791 --> 00:38:10.791
And one of these is as techs and from the data that one has,

565
00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:12.990
we are,

566
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:16.440
even though we think of World War II and all of these current incredible wars

567
00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:21.441
and all our technology devoted towards what's happening is that we have much

568
00:38:24.681 --> 00:38:27.690
more,
many,
many more people die than did in the past.

569
00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:32.690
But the population of humans has grown so much that the percentage is not so

570
00:38:34.501 --> 00:38:38.890
huge and our wars are less frequent rather than having raids almost

571
00:38:38.891 --> 00:38:41.140
continuously,
as in a lot of primitive warfare.

572
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:46.090
We have wars every 15 or 20 years or so.
And J in general between any,

573
00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.400
any two groups fighting each other.

574
00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:51.970
So what he shows again from the data that one has,

575
00:38:51.971 --> 00:38:56.350
which has large and unknown error bars,
the civilized warfare,

576
00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.300
which is the Aztecs,
uh,

577
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.790
France in the 19th century with the Napoleonic wars and the 1870 war,

578
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.660
uh,
western Europe in the 17th century.

579
00:39:07.661 --> 00:39:10.540
Lots and lots of wars in the 16 hundreds,
uh,

580
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:14.290
US and Europe and the 20th century will go one world war two and so forth.

581
00:39:14.650 --> 00:39:17.950
That as far as he can tell,
the fraction of,

582
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:22.840
of all deaths that is caused by war is decreasing.

583
00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.700
And one possible,

584
00:39:24.701 --> 00:39:29.701
very nice way of looking at human history is that humans have some sort of a

585
00:39:30.551 --> 00:39:32.380
propensity called an instinct.

586
00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:37.380
If you like to identify an Ingroup and everyone else's outgroups these in groups

587
00:39:37.781 --> 00:39:41.240
can be nationality,
they can be religion,
they can be color of skin,

588
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:45.550
they can be language.
Language is a big source of conflict in Canada and Belgium,

589
00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.880
all kinds of places.
Uh,
almost anything we'll,

590
00:39:48.881 --> 00:39:52.630
we'll do it can be Yale versus Harvard or Berkeley College versus Calhoun

591
00:39:52.631 --> 00:39:57.100
College.
Uh,
and you know,
red sox,
you know,
Pete with a red sox fan,

592
00:39:57.250 --> 00:40:00.430
the English who were generally very civilized get into a soccer stadium and they

593
00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:01.630
start killing each other.

594
00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:07.050
So humans have this enormous desire to identify ingroup and outgroup and you

595
00:40:08.101 --> 00:40:09.890
know,
we even now pay,
you know,

596
00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:13.540
you to advertise the company cause anything that looks like a group membership

597
00:40:13.541 --> 00:40:18.440
symbol.
Humans love that and we'll pay a lot to have no hat or a,
uh,

598
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:22.630
uh,
a name of,
of some team or even some company on them.

599
00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:28.410
And we have very different morals toward the ingroup and the outgroup.

600
00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:31.660
And uh,

601
00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.840
it seems that that's what still still going on,
uh,

602
00:40:37.210 --> 00:40:42.130
to us that as Tom,
we have that still.
But as time goes on,

603
00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:45.970
because of increased communication and increased education,
probably the,

604
00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:50.050
what we consider the ingroup grows.
First it was your little village of,
you know,

605
00:40:50.051 --> 00:40:51.730
little hamlet of 40 people.

606
00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:56.080
Then maybe you organize it into some sort of a tribe of a thousand people and

607
00:40:56.081 --> 00:40:58.540
gradually grows you.
If you read the history of Europe,

608
00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:00.100
they're all these little cities,

609
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.230
say Greece would city states a whole city could consider one family with a lot

610
00:41:05.231 --> 00:41:09.070
of divisions within it.
A renaissance,
Italy,

611
00:41:09.071 --> 00:41:12.130
you have the metta cheese in the potsy killing each other,

612
00:41:12.131 --> 00:41:15.130
families within cities,
but gradually grows.

613
00:41:15.131 --> 00:41:17.800
You get nation states and as they grow,

614
00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.110
the wars get less because people within say,

615
00:41:20.111 --> 00:41:22.330
France don't generally have wars with each other,

616
00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.910
but France will have a huge war with Germany.

617
00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:28.300
So the group that people consider us gets larger,

618
00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:31.600
the frequency of war goes down,
but since you have so many people fighting,

619
00:41:31.601 --> 00:41:32.434
so many people,

620
00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:37.770
the war causes more and more deaths and possibly this is optimistic that as we

621
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:42.020
become more interconnected and we'd consider more people,

622
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:43.820
us and fewer people them,

623
00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.480
that gradually this behavior will disappear.

624
00:41:47.481 --> 00:41:50.270
But that's just guesswork.

625
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.970
Okay.
Um,
now Keely who gathered a lot of this data,

626
00:41:56.360 --> 00:42:01.360
he has his own summary and again in frustration about not really understanding

627
00:42:01.761 --> 00:42:04.490
other than what these wars are all about.

628
00:42:04.491 --> 00:42:08.180
He does not accept any idea that there's any biology involved.

629
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:09.590
He says,

630
00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:14.591
he says since he can occasionally find some group that hasn't been to war for 20

631
00:42:14.781 --> 00:42:17.570
years or something like that,
then it can't be biology.

632
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:22.550
And the view of biology that many social sciences have is sort of that

633
00:42:22.551 --> 00:42:26.540
everything is,
if it's biology to knee,
knee,
jerk reflex,
know if you're not,

634
00:42:26.541 --> 00:42:31.130
if your nervous system is not impaired,
every time I hit your knee with a hammer,

635
00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:34.460
your knee will kick out and there's no volition.
And they say,

636
00:42:34.461 --> 00:42:38.210
so if we ever seen a human not doing some behavior,

637
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:43.270
that behavior cannot be instinctual.
Of course that was disproven,
uh,

638
00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:47.360
in around 1910 by Pavlov,
you all know about Pavlov.

639
00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.110
So he takes an instinct as basic as eating,

640
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:56.180
and a dog sees a piece of meat start salivating and then very rapidly he rings a

641
00:42:56.181 --> 00:42:57.950
bell a minute before,
uh,

642
00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:02.870
the dog sees the meat and the dog starts salivating to the bell.
So since 1910,

643
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:07.730
at least,
we've known that even the most basic behavior,
uh,

644
00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:11.060
can,
uh,
can be,
uh,

645
00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:15.920
can be controlled by something with a small,
smaller brain as a dog,

646
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:19.160
even though one would never say the dog does not have an eating instinct,

647
00:43:19.161 --> 00:43:21.710
does not have a salivating instinct too.
Of course they do.

648
00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.700
And yet dogs can control it.
I tell a story about my dog,

649
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:30.380
so a smallish whites,
Samoan,
and I'm at work all day.

650
00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:33.200
I work long hours.
And so she's at home all day and you know,

651
00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:35.960
by the time I come home,
she's a little frustrated,
you know,

652
00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:40.100
she's been cooped up and I'm a little frustrated.
So you know what happens?

653
00:43:40.101 --> 00:43:43.400
I get down on my hands and knees and I growl at her.

654
00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:47.210
She immediately picks up the queue.
Okay.
Snarling back at me

655
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:51.950
and I,
I swatter one,
you know,
genital spot,
but she gets,

656
00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:56.030
she snipped back at my hand and we go at it.
We have a great time.

657
00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:00.900
Unfortunately my dog has died,
but we have it.
We had a great time.
Uh,

658
00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:05.030
and in the course of these,
you know,
she's snapping and she's aroused.
Oh,

659
00:44:05.031 --> 00:44:09.870
her hair is standing on an,
her tail is straight up.
Her fangs are,

660
00:44:09.871 --> 00:44:11.120
are showed and she's,

661
00:44:11.121 --> 00:44:15.260
she's snapping away at me and I get maybe

662
00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:21.830
shift.
We do 20 minutes or so,
maybe at least 50 to a hundred.

663
00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:26.940
You know,
bites.
Where she actually,
she went,
I know I,
when I smack her,
she wins.

664
00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:28.661
And,
but what's,

665
00:44:28.661 --> 00:44:33.450
so that means over the years I've had many tens of thousands of times where

666
00:44:33.451 --> 00:44:36.900
she's,
you know,
grab me and all that.
And guess what?

667
00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:40.830
Not once in all those many thousands of bites,
has she ever pierce my skin?

668
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:46.020
All right,
this is a peaceful house door.
She doesn't know anything about killing.

669
00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:50.220
No,
not true.
In the morning I take her out and running in the woods.

670
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:51.930
I know that she takes me to her,

671
00:44:51.931 --> 00:44:56.070
I take her and if she sees a bird or a squirrel,

672
00:44:56.850 --> 00:45:01.260
she's off and she comes back with a dead dead bird in her mouth,

673
00:45:01.261 --> 00:45:03.510
clearly killed.
She clearly been through their skin,
you know,
very,

674
00:45:03.511 --> 00:45:06.030
very proud walking there with a dad's girl.

675
00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:09.380
So here's an animal and I love her dearly,
but her brain was,

676
00:45:09.381 --> 00:45:14.381
is not very big and she can get into the depths of really instinctual responses.

677
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:21.770
And yet her brain is clever enough to be able to control it and not end to kill

678
00:45:22.441 --> 00:45:27.060
the squirrel,
but not to kill me or not to even break through my skin.

679
00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:32.610
So I think the idea is a lot of people think when you describe a biological

680
00:45:32.611 --> 00:45:36.270
basis for behavior,
that it's inevitable.
Human species are lost.

681
00:45:36.271 --> 00:45:40.890
We're never going to change.
But that's,
that's nonsense.
Humans are like,

682
00:45:40.891 --> 00:45:44.710
chimpanzees are quite intelligent and we are caving.
We haven't in,

683
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:46.950
I believe that we have instincts for sure.

684
00:45:46.951 --> 00:45:51.360
You'll see it come out in the most horrible ways and some of the good ways,
uh,

685
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:56.010
but it's not that difficult to control.
My dog can do it.

686
00:45:56.550 --> 00:46:00.330
You guys can do
the other issue,

687
00:46:00.331 --> 00:46:05.190
which these are good topics for discussion in the sections is some people also

688
00:46:05.191 --> 00:46:10.191
say when I describe like ducks rape or orangutans rape that of by describing it

689
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:15.180
and saying that animals do it,
I'm justifying it,
you know,

690
00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.560
and there's this whole thing now that what's natural is good and what animals do

691
00:46:19.561 --> 00:46:21.210
is natural and therefore it's good.

692
00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:25.270
And this slops over into foods and everything.
But uh,

693
00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:29.820
this whole idea of natural law,
uh,
that,

694
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:32.950
that you can tell from nature what is good and what is bad is,

695
00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:39.210
is,
is,
is not to be taken seriously.
Okay.

696
00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.960
That finishes that topic and I think you've had enough violence.

697
00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:48.900
I want to skip a switch to the opposite side.

698
00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.440
Now demography is of course,
births and deaths,

699
00:46:52.441 --> 00:46:54.930
that those are the two main things in demography.

700
00:46:55.440 --> 00:47:00.060
And we've been talking about one of the main causes of human death on one side.

701
00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:04.680
And we find that there is a clear continuity between chimpanzees and humans.

702
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:08.730
Now let's talk about the other side births.
And they're surprisingly,

703
00:47:08.731 --> 00:47:12.090
humans are drastically different from chimpanzees.

704
00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.450
And so how do we know this?
Well,

705
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:19.890
chimpanzees who are never very successful demographically,
uh,
at their peak,

706
00:47:19.891 --> 00:47:24.840
there may have been 2 million chimpanzees,
uh,
a very small Chinese cities,

707
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:29.830
2 million individuals.
Um,
and,
uh,

708
00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:33.790
because of the rise of humans,
they're taking over their territory.
They,

709
00:47:33.791 --> 00:47:37.030
the guests is,
they'd been reduced to about a hundred thousand,
uh,

710
00:47:37.031 --> 00:47:40.480
5% of their early of their peak population.

711
00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.850
They're restricted to central Africa.
They have never spread,
uh,

712
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:48.680
beyond central Africa.
Humans,
on the other hand is,
you know,

713
00:47:48.681 --> 00:47:50.080
a number in the billions.

714
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:55.360
We spread to the farthest corners of the earth from the ice cap around the North

715
00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:59.860
Pole to the hottest desert and jungle.
Um,

716
00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:04.480
there are 10,000,
tens of thousands of times as many people,

717
00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:09.430
humans as there are chimpanzees,
and humans have become absolutely dominant,

718
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.320
basically everywhere on earth.

719
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:17.200
So from a demographic point of view,
maybe the first question we should ask,

720
00:48:17.201 --> 00:48:20.290
why are there so many humans?
And so few chips.

721
00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.920
What is the secret of our demographic,
uh,
success?

722
00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:30.340
Let me give you a clue about the timescale.
We separated,
uh,

723
00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.230
from chimps about 6 million years ago,

724
00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:39.130
and I've shown you,
oh,

725
00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:43.920
this is another version of the deaths.
Uh,
don't worry about it.
Uh,

726
00:48:44.350 --> 00:48:45.810
remember this,
this,
uh,

727
00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:50.880
the family tree here and here is the split point where humans branched off from

728
00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:57.130
chimps and Bonobos and it's ballpark 6 million years ago,
uh,

729
00:48:57.370 --> 00:49:01.240
that we split off the population size.

730
00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.980
What is believed that the population size,
uh,

731
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:09.440
of the,
all of the,
the,
the,

732
00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:14.290
the group that became these three species was only about 50,000 individuals at

733
00:49:14.291 --> 00:49:17.980
the split point that comes from the genetics,

734
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:22.160
the variation in genetics.
And,
uh,

735
00:49:22.210 --> 00:49:27.010
this a small group branched off and started behaving,
evolving quite differently.

736
00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:28.653
Uh,

737
00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:33.160
so what happens when you have a small group to begin with,

738
00:49:33.161 --> 00:49:38.140
a 50,000 breeding individuals and then a small groove breaks off and they may

739
00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:42.460
further subdivided into small groups that may not come much in contact with each

740
00:49:42.461 --> 00:49:46.010
other.
You have inbreeding,
inbreeding,
uh,

741
00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:51.330
caused a lot of genetic problem to also allows evolution to go very rapidly for

742
00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:53.140
mutation that is beneficial,

743
00:49:53.141 --> 00:49:57.400
appears it can spread to a small population very rapidly where it's extremely

744
00:49:57.401 --> 00:50:00.670
difficult for to spread into a large population.

745
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:02.450
So the tininess of,

746
00:50:02.451 --> 00:50:07.451
of the number of our human ancestors allowed a rather rapid evolution away from

747
00:50:08.770 --> 00:50:11.020
the other groups who are also evolving of course,

748
00:50:11.021 --> 00:50:12.520
cause they're also in small groups.

749
00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.810
And um,

750
00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.280
that at,

751
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:25.240
at this split you start going down this pathway and it's shown here as a single

752
00:50:25.241 --> 00:50:27.980
line,
but it's all of,
you know,
from the newspaper,
there are many,

753
00:50:27.981 --> 00:50:32.981
many species splitting off at different times with different characteristics all

754
00:50:33.231 --> 00:50:37.250
in the,
the humanoid,
the hominid line and,

755
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:42.320
but by chance all of those other species went extinct except one.

756
00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:43.550
And that's another characters.

757
00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:47.210
If you're a small group then it's very easy to go extinct.

758
00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:49.480
And for all of the other,

759
00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:54.500
we know 120 30 other hominid species and all went extinct except one the genus

760
00:50:59.570 --> 00:50:59.990
Homo,

761
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:03.890
which is the group of species in which we set the region is about two and a half

762
00:51:03.891 --> 00:51:05.060
million years ago.

763
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:10.450
And they start calling skeletons homo sapiens about a half a million years ago.

764
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:14.800
But even though they're homosapiens,
their brains are,

765
00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:19.860
are at that time significantly smaller than ours are now in an anatomically

766
00:51:20.001 --> 00:51:21.440
modern humans date,

767
00:51:21.441 --> 00:51:25.040
only from about a hundred to 150,000 years ago.

768
00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:29.150
And all during this period,
the number of humans was clearly very small.

769
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:35.440
And so it's very humbling to realize that with a small group that's evolving

770
00:51:37.371 --> 00:51:37.941
rapidly,

771
00:51:37.941 --> 00:51:42.740
which means it's not yet mastered its environment because you don't want to,

772
00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:46.840
your,
uh,
have optimized your relationship to environment,
uh,

773
00:51:47.240 --> 00:51:50.450
evolution slows down.
But if we are evolving rapidly,

774
00:51:50.451 --> 00:51:52.910
that means we haven't yet mastered it.
So a small group,

775
00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:56.630
a struggling in its environment,
very likely to go extinct.

776
00:51:57.050 --> 00:51:59.300
Most of our sibling species went extinct.

777
00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:02.750
And I think with a very small roll of the dice differently,

778
00:52:03.170 --> 00:52:06.410
the line towards humans could easily have gone extinct.

779
00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:11.360
It seems.
Uh,
and had about a hundred thousand years ago,

780
00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:16.361
there was a bottleneck in the growth of human species and the humans living at

781
00:52:17.571 --> 00:52:21.760
that time,
a small group where the ancestors to all current,
uh,

782
00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:22.790
human beings,

783
00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:28.340
there was a small population of about two to 10,000.

784
00:52:28.341 --> 00:52:33.341
They believe that was the total human population from two to 10,000 of humans

785
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:37.460
living in Africa and interbreeding there may have been other human population

786
00:52:37.461 --> 00:52:40.970
somewhere else that,
that that disappeared.
We don't know.

787
00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:42.950
And the numbers two to 10,000,

788
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:47.630
some research puts them a few times higher.
We don't really know.

789
00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:50.510
Uh,
but again,
very small number.

790
00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:53.370
We know from that period that there was substance,

791
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:55.550
no substantial population growth.

792
00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:58.920
So that means the average number of surviving children was,

793
00:52:58.921 --> 00:53:03.080
was two or maybe eensy weensy a bit higher than two.

794
00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:08.210
So that meant when you have on average two children per couple,

795
00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.670
that means that most lineages have died out.

796
00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:16.030
That most individuals who are living at that time of this small number now leave

797
00:53:16.191 --> 00:53:20.030
no descendants at all.
And if you trace back,

798
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:24.320
the genetics suggests that all current humans,

799
00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:29.380
all races over the world are the descendants of a single human female that every

800
00:53:29.851 --> 00:53:32.790
other line from the time when she was alive has died out.

801
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.920
And similarly for males,
we are the,

802
00:53:36.921 --> 00:53:39.660
all the descendants of a single human male,

803
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:42.840
all other lines have died out.

804
00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:46.380
And those two didn't have to live at the same time.
In fact,

805
00:53:46.381 --> 00:53:47.940
almost certainly did not live at the same time.

806
00:53:47.941 --> 00:53:50.430
It's just the randomness of lines dying out.

807
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:55.590
And the genetics tells us that we know the rate at which DNA chain mutates and

808
00:53:55.591 --> 00:53:59.910
diverges.
And so we,
and we know the range of variation in current humans.

809
00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:04.800
So we just sort of narrowed that back and it goes back to this,

810
00:54:04.801 --> 00:54:09.090
what did I say a hundred thousand years ago?
So that's the,

811
00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:13.530
the,
the genetic eve and the genetic Adam that the newspapers just,

812
00:54:13.531 --> 00:54:16.530
just love this story.
But it's,
you know,

813
00:54:16.531 --> 00:54:21.060
it's just a common result of a slowly at population that doesn't have a lot of

814
00:54:21.061 --> 00:54:23.880
surviving children lines are going to die out.

815
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:27.660
You can read that the royal houses of Europe is where you're all exposed to it.

816
00:54:27.661 --> 00:54:29.460
Look how few generations,

817
00:54:29.461 --> 00:54:33.360
the royal houses last before they don't have any heirs and that's in modern or

818
00:54:33.361 --> 00:54:36.780
these are the richest people at their time and have all the food and protection,

819
00:54:36.781 --> 00:54:40.410
everything that they want and they can't stay going for more than a few

820
00:54:40.411 --> 00:54:44.380
generations.
And so in primitive times,
the rate of extinction of,

821
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:46.710
of lines was,
was great.

822
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:52.590
So about 50,000 years ago,
so we were to spend a few million years in Africa.

823
00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:57.600
Then about 50,000 years ago,
a group of humans migrated out of Africa.

824
00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:01.110
And again,
the numbers and the time,

825
00:55:01.111 --> 00:55:05.100
some people say it was as late as 25,000 years ago,
that they migrate it out.

826
00:55:05.970 --> 00:55:10.230
But then amazing things happen once they burst out on the rest of the world.

827
00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:14.670
They spread everywhere.
Humans are found everywhere on the Eurasian continent.

828
00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:19.440
And that's from Siberia to Spain.
Um,

829
00:55:19.810 --> 00:55:24.390
uh,
by about 20,000 years ago.
And then from Siberia,

830
00:55:24.391 --> 00:55:28.770
they crossed the Bering strait,
which was a land bridge at that time,

831
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:33.180
and expanded it into the Americas and reach the very tip of South America by

832
00:55:33.181 --> 00:55:35.400
10,000 years ago.

833
00:55:36.750 --> 00:55:39.100
So in 40,000 years,
uh,

834
00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:42.120
which is a blink of an eye in evolutionary terms,

835
00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:46.440
humans spread everywhere on earth,
an incredible population explosion.

836
00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:50.730
This is the first and greatest explosion of population explosions of humans.

837
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:56.390
And you should note that something was making us superior at that time and

838
00:55:57.271 --> 00:55:59.940
clearly has nothing to do with modern technology.
This,

839
00:55:59.941 --> 00:56:04.941
all of this fantastic expansion even predates the invention of agriculture and

840
00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:10.040
most of what we consider a civilization,
uh,
starts with,

841
00:56:10.070 --> 00:56:11.070
with agriculture.

842
00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:17.040
So what does the main difference set of law has allowed this story that humans

843
00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:21.900
have done this and chimps have,
have done this?
And will you ask,

844
00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:26.290
what is the reproductive rate of chimpanzees?
Well,

845
00:56:26.291 --> 00:56:31.120
I've told you is that a chimp mother has one young every five to eight years.

846
00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:36.100
So at that rate,
it's going to be very hard to increase at any,
any great speed.

847
00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:40.620
But human females have babies much more frequently.
Uh,

848
00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:45.580
it's quite possible to have a baby every year or every year and a half or two

849
00:56:45.581 --> 00:56:48.640
years.
And this is common.
My,

850
00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:51.670
my brother was born 20 months apart from me.

851
00:56:51.850 --> 00:56:56.520
How many of you have siblings less than two years apart?
Yeah,

852
00:56:56.770 --> 00:56:57.490
most of you.

853
00:56:57.490 --> 00:57:01.510
So humans are quite capable of doing something that chimps just cannot do.

854
00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:03.233
Uh,

855
00:57:03.490 --> 00:57:08.490
they have a rate of reproduction about four or five times slower than we do the

856
00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:16.570
mothers.
The chimp mothers cannot take care of more than one young at a time.

857
00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:20.710
They will have a young that's clinging to them and then perhaps an adolescent,

858
00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:24.130
a son or daughter with them,
but they'll never,

859
00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.540
you're never see two infants at a time.
Whereas humans,

860
00:57:27.940 --> 00:57:31.300
it can easily take care of two infants at a time.

861
00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:33.593
<v 2>What</v>

862
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:35.870
<v 0>twins in chimps?</v>

863
00:57:37.370 --> 00:57:42.350
I have never heard or read anything about chimps occurring in twins occurring in

864
00:57:42.351 --> 00:57:47.000
chimps.
And I don't know whether
they ever do.

865
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:51.410
It may be just that we don't have a enough observation that may be occasionally

866
00:57:51.411 --> 00:57:53.750
Chin twins do happen,
but it's not,

867
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:56.760
not been reported that I've seen anybody take it.

868
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:58.410
<v 2>Oh,
not about two months.</v>

869
00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:02.550
I was just going to ask you if that's regulated completely.
Like,

870
00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:07.050
like you would say that on lactation stops.
Yes.

871
00:58:09.790 --> 00:58:11.040
Maybe for five years.

872
00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:15.090
<v 0>Uh,
they're nursing them for a long time.
I don't recall what the,</v>

873
00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:18.990
what the number is,
but there's many behavioral mechanisms.
So in nursing,

874
00:58:19.350 --> 00:58:23.520
the actual physical stimulation of the nipple releases hormones,
oxytocin,

875
00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:26.400
which prevents ovulation again.

876
00:58:26.640 --> 00:58:29.970
And that can be prolonged for quite a period of time,
but it's not absolute.

877
00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:32.580
So there are other behavioral mechanisms,

878
00:58:32.581 --> 00:58:36.660
other internal hormonal mechanisms which ensure this and chimpanzees,

879
00:58:36.661 --> 00:58:40.020
we very hard to capture a chimp and do the physiology and experiment.

880
00:58:40.021 --> 00:58:44.740
So we basically probably don't know most of the answer to the,
to that question.

881
00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.330
Okay.
So the,

882
00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.690
a major difference in the,

883
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:56.700
in between humans and chimps is a tremendous increase in human fecundity.

884
00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:01.800
Now,
in,
in demography,
we use word fecundity means,
uh,

885
00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:03.270
the ability to have children.

886
00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:08.190
Fertility means the number of children who actually have in common.

887
00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:09.710
That's comes from French usage.

888
00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:12.210
The French use the word sort of opposite to the way we do.

889
00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:16.020
And demography was born in France.
So when I say fertility,

890
00:59:16.021 --> 00:59:20.040
I don't mean the ability to have children,
that's for [inaudible],

891
00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:24.320
but I mean the number children that any given set of women actually have.

892
00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:31.270
So we have to ask ourselves what evolutionary factors allowed this change and

893
00:59:32.241 --> 00:59:33.074
for quantity.

894
00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:39.160
And so what limited a chimp population and expand what limited chimp for

895
00:59:39.321 --> 00:59:41.780
Kennedy.
Well,
in primate evolution,

896
00:59:42.350 --> 00:59:47.350
the main factor is the time that brain development takes a body that's capable

897
00:59:48.411 --> 00:59:51.860
of walking and chewing and so forth can develop rather rapidly in all kinds of

898
00:59:51.861 --> 00:59:56.420
animals develop on very short timescale on her immediately capable of doing

899
00:59:56.421 --> 01:00:00.020
those things.
But if you're going to have a species with a big brain,

900
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:04.010
that's a slow process.
And so in,
in all the,

901
01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:07.280
all the higher brain,
the bigger brain primates,

902
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:10.130
the slow thing is his brain development.

903
01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:14.420
And in order to not have to carry this baby,

904
01:00:14.421 --> 01:00:18.770
like for till the brain is mature,
it at like age 13 or something,

905
01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.870
they say we don't really progress beyond adolescence.
Uh,

906
01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:25.790
so in humans and,
and great apes,

907
01:00:25.791 --> 01:00:29.150
the baby is born with physically somewhat mature,

908
01:00:29.151 --> 01:00:31.580
but the brain is still growing enormously.

909
01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.080
So really there's postnatal fetal development of the brain.

910
01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:40.970
So even at the nine months of pregnancy,
we're not at the end of the period of,

911
01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.890
of brain told the brain is nowhere near its final size or complexity.

912
01:00:47.030 --> 01:00:50.330
Um,
so,
uh,

913
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:53.900
that limits the,
uh,

914
01:00:54.260 --> 01:00:58.030
the rate at which one can have childbirth.
And because of the,

915
01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.880
the infant is born in chimps and humans is born,
uh,

916
01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.580
incapable of taking care of itself.

917
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:09.410
The mother has to stay with the child and,
and,
and take care of it.

918
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:11.180
And in chimps,

919
01:01:11.181 --> 01:01:16.181
the mother stays exclusively with her infant for several years.

920
01:01:17.930 --> 01:01:22.530
Um,
and the chimps get very little,
as I mentioned,

921
01:01:22.531 --> 01:01:25.580
to very little in the way of resources from the males.

922
01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:27.170
They mostly you watch and they do,

923
01:01:27.171 --> 01:01:29.840
they don't come in contact with males all that much.
They,

924
01:01:29.841 --> 01:01:32.880
they and their young forage by themselves and etc. Etc.

925
01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:34.910
And the males are just patrolling.

926
01:01:34.911 --> 01:01:38.900
They see them every so often in the males protect,
uh,
the boundaries.

927
01:01:38.901 --> 01:01:40.820
But in terms of taking care of the young,

928
01:01:40.821 --> 01:01:45.821
the males basically have no role whatsoever as a result of this need to have

929
01:01:45.981 --> 01:01:50.120
intense care of the young and no help from anyone.

930
01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.990
Sometimes other females will help but basically no help at all.

931
01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:58.010
The period in which the mother has to devote herself exclusively to that one

932
01:01:58.011 --> 01:02:02.750
young is quite prolonged.
Now in humans,

933
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:07.100
males do play some more intimate part in child rearing,

934
01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:09.170
not anywhere near as much as a,
as a female,

935
01:02:09.171 --> 01:02:13.250
but they do bring resources in general.
In most human societies over time,

936
01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:17.780
males are responsible for bringing some resources to the female on a rather

937
01:02:17.781 --> 01:02:19.530
continuing basis.

938
01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:23.640
And we don't really know how this evolved because these things,

939
01:02:23.641 --> 01:02:27.360
you can't really tell these things from fossils.
Um,

940
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:29.460
but what we know is that Africa,

941
01:02:29.610 --> 01:02:34.260
the chimps started in the jungle and then Africa started drawing out.

942
01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:39.800
And so some subset of the chimps maybe pushed out by stronger individuals are

943
01:02:39.811 --> 01:02:44.811
clever individuals were pushed into this drawing out more grasslands where there

944
01:02:45.481 --> 01:02:49.500
was a west cover and less fruiting trees.

945
01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:54.540
Dry Land doesn't produce the big fruiting trees that chimps depend on.

946
01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:01.170
So as the different twin chimps and Bonobos,
when there's a lesser food density,

947
01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:05.220
the population has to spread out that if an individual is going to find any
food,

948
01:03:05.221 --> 01:03:07.230
they're not going to find enough for a large group.

949
01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:12.480
So individual females would have to go forward,
uh,
quite separately.

950
01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:18.480
And you can speculate further that as the female spread out,

951
01:03:18.690 --> 01:03:23.190
the dominant males could no longer keep watch over and control over these

952
01:03:23.191 --> 01:03:27.330
females.
They were just too far a spread geographically

953
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:33.900
and so wildly in chimps.
A while a male and a female may go off for a short time,

954
01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:38.310
uh,
period,
uh,
in,
in what's called the concert ship.

955
01:03:38.311 --> 01:03:42.060
And there may be meetings at that time.
There's no lasting,
no,

956
01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:46.380
no continuing a relationship between any particular male and a female.

957
01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:49.540
Uh,
the chimpanzees,
as I mentioned,

958
01:03:49.541 --> 01:03:52.440
her mail bonded and they spend more time with each other.

959
01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:57.270
Male to male than the males do.
Uh,
with the females in humans,

960
01:03:57.271 --> 01:04:00.420
of course,
we still have a lot of what they call male,
male bonding,

961
01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:04.440
military units,
sports teams,
whole male clubs,
football,
wedding parties,

962
01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:06.780
or watching football,
watching parties,
et cetera.

963
01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:12.260
But we've evolved in the direction of much more male female interaction and

964
01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:17.390
context.
Female sexuality,
uh,

965
01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:22.260
changed a while.
Chimpanzees always made from behind humans.

966
01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:24.630
Humans engage in frontal copulation.

967
01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:29.130
And since the face is how humans,
and also chimpanzees,
uh,

968
01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.360
detect each other,

969
01:04:30.361 --> 01:04:35.280
they know individuals largely by their facial structure and they detect
emotions.

970
01:04:35.281 --> 01:04:36.720
It's very important part of mutation,

971
01:04:36.730 --> 01:04:40.950
detect the emotions and respond to each other's by,
by facial cues.

972
01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:44.070
So this face to face interaction,

973
01:04:44.071 --> 01:04:46.620
especially in the intense intensity of a sexual encounter,

974
01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:50.640
it considered a large part of the evolution of male,
female bonding.

975
01:04:51.210 --> 01:04:53.370
And sorry,
I forgot to show you last time,

976
01:04:53.371 --> 01:04:58.310
but this an excuse to show you this time here is,
uh,
uh,

977
01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:03.210
uh,
uh,
button Bonobo,
uh,
engaging in,
in fund to funds sex,

978
01:05:03.211 --> 01:05:06.670
male and female here.
And she's grinning.
She's clearly,
uh,

979
01:05:07.020 --> 01:05:08.610
being pretty happy about this.

980
01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:13.350
And I also said I would show you this is two females,
uh,

981
01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:16.920
doing the same thing.
If you didn't,
if I didn't tell you it was,

982
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:20.380
this was two females,
you wouldn't know the difference unless you're watching.

983
01:05:20.381 --> 01:05:24.330
You can see that they both have their,
their swellings on.

984
01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:27.160
That's how you tell that,
that they're two females.
I mean,

985
01:05:27.161 --> 01:05:30.760
the guys take the picture obviously a lot more,
but you can tell it.

986
01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:35.110
So this is what I described that the locals called it Hoka Hoka.

987
01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:36.903
And

988
01:05:38.350 --> 01:05:42.510
so this whole evolution of sexuality,
um,

989
01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:47.430
in,
uh,
the human line,
the cliteracy has moved forward,
uh,

990
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.220
for fee,

991
01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:53.220
which in face to face copulation probably makes it a more female pleasure

992
01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:58.060
during,
uh,
the act of copulation and therefore again,

993
01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:00.630
reinforces this bonding.

994
01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:07.000
So another big difference is this is not an extreme case of,

995
01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:10.630
of,
uh,
of,
of the rump.
Um,

996
01:06:12.310 --> 01:06:14.410
that's another,
another time,
um,

997
01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:19.600
that humans do not advertise their estrus.

998
01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:21.880
Not only do we not remember the,
the,

999
01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:24.880
the chimps advertise their estrous in order to get the males together and have

1000
01:06:24.881 --> 01:06:27.910
the males compete for them.
Humans keep it secret.

1001
01:06:28.330 --> 01:06:32.680
Not only don't the males know when a,
when a female is in estrus a,

1002
01:06:32.681 --> 01:06:35.890
but the female herself does not know when she's in estrus.

1003
01:06:36.430 --> 01:06:40.810
And for a very long time it was believed that females are fertile during their

1004
01:06:40.811 --> 01:06:41.644
periods.

1005
01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:45.970
And it was only in the 1930s that it was found out by a Japanese group that

1006
01:06:45.971 --> 01:06:50.920
females are fertile in the mid period between their periods.
And even further,

1007
01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:56.040
it was believed in the 1930s that females are fertile a few days before and a

1008
01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.990
few days after the middle of,
of,
uh,

1009
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:02.710
oscillation in the middle of the period.
And in fact,

1010
01:07:02.711 --> 01:07:05.470
we now know just from about 10 years ago,

1011
01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:09.400
that the actual fertile period always is only precedes of ovulation.

1012
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:12.070
That intercourse must take place before ovulation.

1013
01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:17.230
So not only do we do human female is not advertised to the females they don't

1014
01:07:17.231 --> 01:07:21.160
know.
And scientists with all our invasion of just now finally figured out,

1015
01:07:21.161 --> 01:07:26.110
we think,
uh,
when a human female is fertile.
So this is a big,

1016
01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:27.910
big,
big change.
It's such a big part,

1017
01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:32.610
the advertising such a big part of a primate sexuality,
uh,

1018
01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:36.130
why as it disappeared in humans.

1019
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:41.290
Um,
so,
uh,

1020
01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:47.500
it may be sort of the reverse that if females are out there alone and there's

1021
01:07:47.501 --> 01:07:50.560
carnivores,
you read about this from the Rj that are,
you know,

1022
01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:55.570
lions and tigers out there ready to eat them and they need protection of various

1023
01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:57.850
sorts and maybe help in finding food.

1024
01:07:58.030 --> 01:08:02.710
So it's important to have a male hanging around and a male evolutionary purpose.

1025
01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:04.630
He wants to inseminate the female.

1026
01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:08.410
So if he knows when a female is having estrus,

1027
01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:11.020
he has to be there then to inseminate her.

1028
01:08:11.560 --> 01:08:13.690
But if he knows when she is an actress,

1029
01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:18.840
he also knows when she is not in estrus and when she's not an estrus,

1030
01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:22.550
he may have no evolutionary pushed to stay there,

1031
01:08:22.551 --> 01:08:25.610
but go out and try to find some other female.

1032
01:08:26.090 --> 01:08:31.090
So the purpose of not showing your estrus may be to keep the mail uncertain of

1033
01:08:32.001 --> 01:08:35.930
when you're fertile and therefore he has to attend to the female all the time.

1034
01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:37.003
And once he's there,

1035
01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:42.100
he might as well help her because that will ensure that whatever inference come

1036
01:08:42.291 --> 01:08:46.670
along are,
are in good shape.
So,
uh,

1037
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:49.580
if that's correct,

1038
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:53.900
and certainly males and females started spending more time together and they're

1039
01:08:53.901 --> 01:08:58.070
more disperse,
that reduces a male male competition.

1040
01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:02.090
Remembering the male male competition is the result of a group in which a lot of

1041
01:09:02.091 --> 01:09:05.210
males stay together.
When you're more dispersed,

1042
01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:08.360
male male competition has to be reduced.

1043
01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:13.520
And so it looks like the in,
in the evolution to humans,

1044
01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:18.080
that's what switching is from the advertising,

1045
01:09:18.081 --> 01:09:19.940
which allows the males to compete in the female,

1046
01:09:19.941 --> 01:09:21.920
gets the mail with the best jeans.

1047
01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:25.430
She's switching to wanting resources from the mail.

1048
01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.430
She's no longer interested so much in male competition,

1049
01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:33.120
but in whatever resources the male can bring to her by having a male around,
uh,

1050
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:38.060
continually,
this story is rather complicated and very controversial.

1051
01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.810
This is a very nice reading,
uh,

1052
01:09:39.830 --> 01:09:43.700
in your packet might be interesting too.
Oh boy.

1053
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:46.430
To consider that.
Uh,

1054
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:51.850
how does the male respond to this change in strategy?
Um,

1055
01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.090
if Mona,
if the road to monogamy starts going down,

1056
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:59.600
then paternity becomes more certain that in a,

1057
01:09:59.601 --> 01:10:03.050
in the chimps where of females copulating with everyone.
Uh,

1058
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:07.190
there's no reason to be certain of paternity,
uh,
at all.

1059
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:12.140
But once it becomes clear that yes,
this child is,
is almost certainly mine,

1060
01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:15.740
then it becomes evolutionary advantageous for the mail to start putting

1061
01:10:15.741 --> 01:10:20.741
resources into this mother and child because that ensures their survival and

1062
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:25.160
things start developing in a different direction.

1063
01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:28.430
We're stabled pairing becomes evolutionarily advantage.

1064
01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:30.380
The male putting resources into the,

1065
01:10:30.381 --> 01:10:34.520
into the payer is for evolutionary advantage.

1066
01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:35.930
So it's,

1067
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:40.070
it seems pretty clear that an increase in the mail contribution to child rearing

1068
01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:45.440
is one of the major reasons for the increased fertility of humans.

1069
01:10:45.650 --> 01:10:49.250
Why humans are able to out reproduce.
Chimpanzees,

1070
01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:55.000
of course is as you all are aware of,
monogamy has not by any means,
uh,

1071
01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:59.890
taken human societies totally over and some societies,
uh,

1072
01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.340
overtly a sanction polygamy.
But even in our culture,

1073
01:11:04.341 --> 01:11:09.341
which Europe and North America genetic testing shows that 10 to 15% of humans do

1074
01:11:10.181 --> 01:11:12.410
not have the father that they're supposed to have.

1075
01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:17.010
That father is usually defined as the resident mail is not farther.
And that's,

1076
01:11:17.150 --> 01:11:21.860
uh,
quite a large percentage.
American women,
uh,

1077
01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.220
report six different sexual partners lifetime,
uh,

1078
01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:30.510
and males report 16 female partners lifetime.

1079
01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:34.650
Now one thing we know quantum,
if you're at all mathematical that the,
since two,

1080
01:11:34.651 --> 01:11:37.200
it takes two to tango,
the average has to be the same.

1081
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:42.540
So he can't be both six and 16.
And uh,
who knows?

1082
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:44.700
Possibly somewhere in between is correct,

1083
01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:48.330
but probably higher because these things tend to be under reported.

1084
01:11:48.331 --> 01:11:51.420
No one wants to really say how well females certainly don't want to say,

1085
01:11:51.421 --> 01:11:55.620
how come the skew us?
They are.
You're usually,
and also there's old data.
Uh,

1086
01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:58.650
this is,
uh,
from 2001,

1087
01:11:58.830 --> 01:12:01.800
and with the change of sexual mores in the Western countries,

1088
01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:06.120
I'm sure the numbers are exponentially increasing.

1089
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:08.383
Uh,

1090
01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:16.130
so what's another thing about this thing with respect to human evolution is that

1091
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:20.970
when you're a chimpanzee,
the mail,
the main form of competition is male,

1092
01:12:20.971 --> 01:12:23.070
male fighting,
male male status,
jocking,

1093
01:12:23.071 --> 01:12:26.130
which takes certain amount of intelligence to arrange coalitions and so forth.

1094
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:29.700
But basically,
evolution is pushing you to be a big and violent.

1095
01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:34.900
Now the individual dispersed the male stays with the female and male starts

1096
01:12:34.901 --> 01:12:37.650
springing resource violence is decreased.

1097
01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:41.580
The importance of that in the mail evolution decreases.

1098
01:12:41.850 --> 01:12:46.320
And the importance of being able to provide resources becomes evolutionary

1099
01:12:46.321 --> 01:12:47.010
important.

1100
01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:50.910
So the kind of intelligence required to find food in a scarce environment,

1101
01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:55.530
to find shelter,
to protect from animals and so forth becomes important.

1102
01:12:55.770 --> 01:12:59.550
So a fair reason for the increase in human,
uh,

1103
01:12:59.570 --> 01:13:04.410
mental capacity might also be this shift from a dependence on violence for

1104
01:13:04.411 --> 01:13:06.430
competition to,
uh,

1105
01:13:06.670 --> 01:13:11.400
a dependence on resource acquisition of resources for competition and for

1106
01:13:11.401 --> 01:13:14.130
evolution.
So,
okay.
Um,

1107
01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:18.420
I'd run out of time and so we will continue,
uh,

1108
01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:22.650
with humans and how they are different from chimps.
Next time.
