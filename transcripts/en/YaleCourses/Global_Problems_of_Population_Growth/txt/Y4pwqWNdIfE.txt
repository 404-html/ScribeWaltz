Speaker 1:          00:10          This is one family's experience in a string says it's, it's quite different, different people. But what you should realize is that this is one of 300 million such stories. The stories may be different, but there's 300 million of them. That's what the Chinese government is now saying that the one child policy has averted 300 million births in China, that the population, instead of being 1.3 billion now would be 1.6 billion. And that 300 million people is the total population of the United States. So China has as, as they perceive it as they claim, averted, putting another United States worth of population into the world. And that's the significance of, of spending two full lectures on China. And we could of course spend a lot more, is that China's just so big that everything that happens there has these tremendous, uh, significances both on an individual personal level for each individual or family that experiences it could also on the global level, one out of every five human beings lives in China.

Speaker 1:          01:20          So it is very big. Um, we'll talk in a later lecture explicitly about the one child policy. But there's information I have to give you today to understand what it's about. But let me just say now that the Chinese government has of course, well aware of the human and human rights sacrifices of the individual people and, but they argued that the benefits outweigh the suffering. And so just to give you a little hint of, of the way the government thinks about it and, and many other people in China that the great economic boom that China has had a most economists now around the world are attributed, uh, the kickoff of that to the reduction in fertility that they don't, they didn't have to cope with so many children and that's the cause of their economy taking off. So, uh, they perceive that the one child policy has allowed China to merge from this, you know, grinding poverty that they were in and become a modern, uh, we start to become a modern nation in the world.

Speaker 1:          02:23          Another story, another data set that I just recently came across was had to do with carbon emissions that uh, three at at, at a world average of, of carbon usage, which is probably below what China's actually using, a 300 extra million people would have produced 1.5 billion. That's billion with a B billion tons of co two each year. And that's more than the total CO2 production of an industrial giant like Germany. So if you're looking at this issue from an environmental point of view, the reduction of people there, their environmental impact, it makes again, a huge difference. And uh, the Chinese for instance, feel that because of the one child policy alone, they have done more than any other country to ameliorate the environmental crisis. Okay. That's just a hint of very difficult, uh, things. How do you weigh, uh, the, the story of a family and 300 million families like, like you've just heard against the sort of macro issues and it, it is not easy.

Speaker 1:          03:32          So the question I want to set up today, which is to go backwards, is this kind of policy happens only in China. This kind of enormous population as the Chinese proceeded, overpopulation happens in China really? And in India in terms of massive stuff. And we've, we've talked a little about India and South Asia, but the question is what's special about China? Why did this happen in China? Why did, uh, as they perceive it, population got so out of control that the government felt that they had to introduce such a draconian policy is there's such a stringent, uh, kind of policy. And the flip side of that coin is why has China just now, uh, digging out from the abject poverty that, that the people were in when a Europe and America dug out 200 years ago? England started, but all of Europe and America, uh, went through this phase 200 years ago.

Speaker 1:          04:36          And, and why, why not China? Of course, this is a, is a very, very hotly contested issue among historians. And the basic setup of the story is that in about 1800 when morphis was writing, uh, China was very powerful, very strong, very rich country and, and the West was, was beginning to be that way. The industrial revolution with just starting in England. And you would have seen enormous differences between China and say England or Europe in 1800, but you would not have been able to predict which model was going to take over the world, which country was going to become bigger and stronger in the future. China was a very impressive plus impressive place in 1800 and Europe was beginning to be a very impressive place in 1800. And then I may go into a little bit the history a little bit more, but by 1840, when the British invaded, uh, with the Opium War, uh, the British started to Dick, the Chinese to opium and the Chinese government said, no, the British tried free trade and invaded to, to force China to accept a British opium, which they got a India.

Speaker 1:          05:54          Okay, that's a separate story, which we may or may not have have time for. Oh. But then so in a very short period of time, China goes from being one of the dominant countries in the world to being sort of, uh, the porn in the world that the, that the British start colonizing it, the, the German start colonizing it, the Americans take advantage. Everybody starts taking advantage of China, starts the colonization of China and starts the dismembering of China. And why did this happen is one of the major issues in, in world history. And there's many, many different points of view on this. There's 10 major theories or something. Uh, and in this class I just have to unwind one thread, uh, uh, one version of the story and only one thread of that story. And that's the relationship between the population of China, the wealth of China and the poverty of China.

Speaker 1:          06:50          This particular thread about population was obvious to Europeans visiting China, even in the European Middle Ages. And you know, Marco Polo visited China in the 12 hundreds and he described China's cultivation, how every little bit of land was under very intense, uh, cultivation already a popular snus that the population was already incredibly dense as viewed through European eyes of, of, of the same time and Indus Industry. The people work very hard and we're, whatever they did, they were very productive at it. So, and he, you know, they're the stories of Kubler con and all that were from Marco Polo that he sort of idolized China as this incredibly rich, uh, but very, very crowded place. Adam Smith in the 17th century, the guy who started modern economics said China has long been one of the richest, most fertile, best cultivated and most industrious and most populous countries in the world. So Adam Smith was aware of it and all of these great scholars of, of the, of the lady 17 hundreds were looking around the world.

Speaker 1:          08:02          Funny. There was enough, a seafaring us, they could go around the world and compare different things and try to figure out what was the best system for people to live under. A few years after Adam Smith Maltus writes and he quotes the information that Europeans were getting were mostly from Jesuit priests who had gone over to China to try to convert the population. And he quotes one a rather well known a Jesuit priest. Then China is code the richest and most flourishing empire in the world. But the priest goes on because of Oprah overpopulation, the people are the poorest and most miserable of all. And so right from way, way back people that where they're trying to was basically very rich country. But because of the huge population, the individual families were often in abject poverty. Well, if you looked at the, at the emperor and the, and the nobles, of course they had enormous wealth.

Speaker 1:          09:01          These early observers were certainly correct, uh, about the population issue there. So we have data from say 1750 and China had 500 people per cultivated a square kilometer. At the same time. Europe had about 70 people for the square kilometer. So China had to on the same farm land how to support seven times as many people. And of course numbers from 1750. Uh, don't take that as any kind of an exact number up to today. China has something like 20% of the world's population because the one child policy, the ratio was higher. They had more than 20%. Uh, but now it's down to about 20% because India is still coming up. A lot of the world is still coming up in China. Population is still increasing, but increasing at a, at a rather slow rate. It has now 20% of the world's population, but only six to 7% of the arable land, the farmable land in the world, the amount of farm land per person is 0.2 acres, uh, per person 10 times less than the United States has. So there's a real problem, uh, with China's population. And the question is why, why, why did China's population press up against the resources and riches of, of the land? So much more so than in, say Europe for most of history. Uh, China's, uh, population does not look terribly different.

Speaker 1:          10:48          Hang on. Anyway, you can, you can see this, that in the Han dynasty, which was the first unifying dynasty of China, very much the same time as the Roman empire, it had a population of 50, 60 million. Then according to this reconstruction of China's history and all of these reconstructions were very iffy. Uh, you notice population stays stable for a thousand years. Then during the Song Dynasty, which is one of the very most important dynasties and try very successful population rises and then it falls back down again. The one which is the Mongol invasions. This, this decline that probably is very much characterized by the Mongol invasions. The particular dates here are dates when we have censuses in the various emperors took census as an in between. You really don't know what's happening and you're also not sure how complete these censuses are. But anyway, the Mongol invasion then stays constant. And then some time in this period, uh, probably there's no census really.

Speaker 1:          11:51          They don't have any data between 1,417 50. So this curve in here is kind of guesswork, but sometime in the 17 hundreds, as in Europe, the population takes off something like this doesn't look wildly, uh, in shape, in magnitude. It's different, but in shape, it doesn't look very different than Europe. Uh, the third, uh, in the Han dynasty 60 million Chinese 1400 years later in 1,393, they kind of 60 and a half million of people, and in between the population went as low as 37 million. And then as I said, the Mongol invasions decimated the population and then just before the European black death, but a decimation in the same sense as the European black death. And then it took a long time per China's population, uh, to come back up by the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, one of the also very flourishing periods in Chinese history. China had maybe 75 million people up from up from 60 million, and then it starts doubling in the next 200 years.

Speaker 1:          13:01          It doubles, uh, and continues on up as in Europe, there were major epidemics in the 1640s, uh, there was some major epidemic that we can like him to play, but people really don't know what kind of a of a disease. It was an a Chinese scholar wrote in 1642, the pestilence, you don't know what the pestilence arose. Again, on a large scale effecting eight or nine of every 10 households in a household of 10 or 20 people, all would be afflicted and often all would die. At first, the bodies were buried in coffins and next in grasses. But finally they were just left in the places where they died in one big city in 1643, there were few suits. There was basically no signs of human life in the streets. Only the buzzing of flies broke the silence. Those are quotes from, from Chinese observers.

Speaker 1:          14:00          Very interesting. It was at this time and in the 1640s, that the Chinese having experienced this massive disease, developed a new theater, new medical theory of disease and epidemic spaced on. She knew all her cheat, which is supposedly sort of the life force that's involved in acupuncture and everything. And their view was that there was this sort of non material substance force, kind of like Phlogiston in the west and it had to be in balance. And when the CI on Heaven and Earth there was CI and heaven and she on Earth got disrupted, uh, then playing and then chaos broke out on earth and people started dying of various diseases. And of course, you know, Americans have recently become wildly infatuated with Chinese medicine and, and the, the chief theory of things and acupuncture. And uh, we can talk a lot about that privately if you wish. But, uh, the point of that did not help the Chinese at all. You can see the birth, the medical statistics as again, as far as we have them. And up until recent times from the practice of acupuncture, you don't see any form of disease lessened at all. And the only thing you see in, in China, and Japan also is a tremendous rise in hepatitis because of the transmission from the needles because they didn't understand anything about sterilization.

Speaker 1:          15:22          Okay. And then these plagues caused enormous political changes just just as in Europe. So the, the Ming Dynasty, for instance, fell possibly as a result of the depopulation and chaos of the, of the plague. And that allowed the Mongols to come in and set up their own dynasty. I'm sorry, the, uh, uh, the Manchu for Manchuria, the Manchu to come in and set up the Ching Dynasty. And similarly, uh, to Europe, uh, after one of these decimation of the population, uh, good land became available and people moved into the good land and they had a, a blossoming of, of, of wealth and culture for the, even for the peasants. And it's a cycle not very different than what morphous talked about, balancing the relationship between the number of people and the amount of land available throughout this whole period. A life expectancy was very poor. Uh, we have scattered statistics. So a village in the 1790s showed that one third of male children died in their first year of life and half of them died before they were, they were 20. And the female situation was comparable, but probably worse because of infanticide. So they're probably counting only those that got through the period of infanticide. Life expectancy was 32, uh, in this particular village, and only 4% of the population lived past 65. And again, it's not terribly different than what we saw in the statistic. The, the graph for CIS Alpine goal. We're about a third of the of the women are dead before they start their reproductive life.

Speaker 1:          17:03          But when the main came to power, uh, um, there was still land, uh, unoccupied land available. As Martha said, the best land was already used for agriculture, but there was less good land, uh, still available. And under the main, the population grew. We're talking 16 hundreds into 17 hundreds. Uh, the main, uh, uh, I'm sorry, the ends and the 1650 or so. Um, and the population grew, what the people do, they moved onto the marginal land and that meant higher into the mountains on steeper trying to farm on steeper slopes. They cleared forested areas, they moved into dry areas. And the result of all this was enormous soil erosion that especially the mountain sides and the dry areas, the productivity dropped because this land is just not good. And the erosion, the forest couldn't hold the water anymore. The period of China, China has always had floods.

Speaker 1:          18:01          It's a big part of Chinese history, but these really massive, massive uncontrollable floods date from this period where the people, the population increased and people started going into areas where, uh, it's ecologically very unstable, cutting down the forests. And then when it rains you get these enormous floods. And also the floods, not only uh, uh, there was the, but they devastated the agriculture in the low lands. So you not only had a poorer agriculture per capita in the high lands, but you also reduce the per capita of farming in the low lands. Again, population growth, uh, can, can make it difficult for everybody. So again, like, like Europe, like Africa, uh, American foods when they were discovered when into China, because they, as I said, have something like twice to kill caloric content of, of anything except rice. If you can grow rice, rice is as good as potatoes are just about as as good.

Speaker 1:          19:04          And so China picked up a sweet potatoes, especially peanuts, especially, uh, some white potatoes and they doubled food production. And guess what happened? The population doubled. So again, the introduction of these foods and the tremendous improvement in agriculture didn't help, uh, the per capita eating the per capita amount of food, uh, for individuals. And the, during the same period as people increased, uh, one farmer could grow more land, but the people that could eat needed more land for themselves. So they moved again out. And the land under cultivation increased by a factor of 4.5 times. But, but again, uh, during this sort of second round of population growth, one is after the, uh, when the main takeover in one is after American foods are introduced. Um, the erosion becomes extreme and it's so extreme that by 1978, about one, uh, one third of all arable land in China had to be abandoned because of erosion. So it's an, it's an enormous problem in, in China. And so this is really trying to experience small cysts, what I call my office with a vengeance. So this is, um, the, uh, cultivated only still didn't find it.

Speaker 1:          20:31          Oh, there it is. There it is. Okay. So, uh, this is cultivated land and you can see that here. 1700 sold. Basically, American foods come in and you can plant stuff everywhere and the amount of land under cultivation goes up like crazy. Some of this decline is, is, is very recent as industrialization, cities growing and some of it is you erosion. So the land thing looks like an enormous increase in the amount of land available for farming. But here is the per capita amount of land, the cultivated land, heck terrace per capita where this is, this is simple hectares. And, uh, it, it, it grows then it, then it crashes probably again to do with the Mongol invasions are just fewer people. Uh, I'm sorry, I've gone probably have this backwards rises here. The land per, uh, per capita because you just get rid of the people.

Speaker 1:          21:23          And then in the modern population growth, the land per capita just just crashes down and now it's, this is 0.2 hectares. Now we're 0.1 hectare per person, which is like a quarter of an acre, very small amount of land per person. And of course the Chinese realize this as well as anybody. And uh, it was in a matter of official concern during the Ming and the Ching dynasties. And in 1790 just before Malthus wrote a Chinese scholar and high government official a hung a young g, he started warning the Chinese about the difficulties that unchecked population growth would cause as an outrage. Chinese productive capacity. That's the way he phrased it. So it's clear that the original understanding of of China, that its population was pressing really severely against it. It's resources, uh, was accurate, but it still doesn't explain why was it in China that you got these incredibly dense populations.

Speaker 1:          22:31          Why didn't that happen elsewhere saying China or England. And so what, what jumps to your mind? Probably at a very high fertility. They had no in, in, in England we talked about the late marriage system and everything, which kept fertility down on Americans generally have the image in western history only have the image of uh, the Chinese, uh, reproduce, uh, have a lot of children all the time. It's like your grandparents or something. So in this makes good sense. In the Chinese culture, the principal goal of life was to produce sons as you've heard over and over again. And uh, this origin of ancestor worship I think is, as you just said, goes back at least the second and third millennium BC. So 5,000 years. What Ching said is, is, is the scholarly number. And uh, they did all kinds of things to get us on adoption was very, very calm, calm.

Speaker 1:          23:29          And you'll read about that in the reading if you haven't already. James Lee talks about very high rates of adoption. People who didn't have a son would get an adoption. And the filial piety that they had a confusion system, which I'll talk about in a moment where you know, the older, the younger brothers for instance, had to pay absolute obedience to the older brothers and they all had to pay up through the obedience to the father. So if a younger brother had a son and the older brother didn't do younger brother had to give that son, uh, to the older brother, my modern times, that was the same situation and chinks on the, of course, that confusion, that strict Confucian thing doesn't exist anymore. But in the old days it would always be the younger sons, no matter what the biological story was. It would always be the younger sons that did not have, uh, a male children.

Speaker 1:          24:18          And so in China, everyone was expected to marry, uh, and, and, uh, they married very young in order to secure a bride. Because, as I mentioned to you, I think with respect to the little sex selective abortion, traditionally China has always done away with 10 to 25% of its females. So there was always, not always, but as much as we have data, um, and so there's always been an excess of males and, and a lot of, you know, they can't get married. Uh, so they did all kinds of things to secure a bride for, for a son. And that included getting patrolled very, very young and, and starting reproduction as soon as puberty allowed. Um, and it was made worse by the fact that it was quite acceptable for males to take second wise or third wives or fourth wives down into concubines. And every time one male had more than one wife than some other nail and got no wife at all.

Speaker 1:          25:20          Okay. So let's look, so one of the possibilities is the obvious one is, is trying to have very high fertility and we'll see if that's true. So here's a bunch of of data. And what this is, is the age of, of the woman and they don't have much reproduction beyond age 40 in the sample of though modernly we would have the age of the woman and what her rate is per uh, I guess per thousand uh, uh, uh, women. And you can see, so women start out at age 20 with a very high rate and all these curves with a high rate of reproduction, it either goes down a little bit by age 25 or, or sometimes in some places it increases a little bit by age 25. And then as a woman gets older, a fertility drops off. There's fewer and fewer children per year at 40 year olds just have fewer children than 20 or 25 year olds. That's a very obvious kind of thing. Now these are two different sets of pop thing. This is date their data from one area of the world data from another area of the world. One area is cha, all of the data, China with one line from Japan. And the other set of data is a Europe, various European countries. And guess which is which

Speaker 2:          26:36          some hands, the big difference and fertility. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          26:48          You think John is the one at the bottom?

Speaker 1:          27:00          That's right. That's the lead article. So in the lecture where one, one lecture behind us, as you've probably realized already, and so the reading that you should do tonight actually gave away the answer. Yes. This is the European population. This is the Chinese population so that the Chinese once married within marriage and both places extra marital fertility is not a big deal. So this is, you can take this as general repression. But within marriage, the Europeans had a much higher rate of child bearing than the Chinese didn't. In fact, it's almost a factor of two from 200 to 300 to 400 to 500, that it was a lot. Uh, uh, the Europeans, once married one's having access to, to sex really had children uncontrollably as, as, as one says, where's the Chinese were doing something, uh, to control, uh, their, their births. And that was a shocker when this data came out.

Speaker 1:          27:56          And it's fairly recent data because the presumption from at least small offices time was that, you know, the Chinese just reproduced like, like like flies or something and that the Europeans had this wonderful restraint and it turns out that's just the opposite of what is what is true. And it's, and it's very surprising given the cultural emphasis on reproduction by the Chinese. So one of the big issues now under discussion is whether this is a sign that the Chinese were consciously doing some kind of birth control. They were consciously trying to limit their families or whether it was one of these cultural things where the culture in some sense stumbles onto a practice and it makes that cultural successful even though the people have no idea what the purpose of of it is. It may just be as sort of an as an artifact of culture and they will think the, the, the population will think this is due to their, uh, their following God's rules or the proper decorum or, or various cultural reasons.

Speaker 1:          28:58          They will give a cultural reasons why they have few children and not understand that that's what makes the whole society survive. And James Lee, who is, uh, definitely the, the world's foremost demographer of China are, he has no doubt, even though the data is not as solid as one would like, here's no doubt that it was infrequent sexual activity, uh, that led to the low of birth rate as a cultural thing, not as a conscious way of, of, of, of reducing, uh, fertility. And he describes a story where, uh, a young couple gets married and they're in the, what we perceive as the height of, of sexual desire and what their sleeping arrangements are. They have, uh, there's a double decker bed and the two, there's married, the young married couple of sleeps above and the grandmother is in the bed below and the grandmother has it, carries her cane to bed and we never upstairs, she started hears things starting to go on, Bang, Bang, Bang, cut it out.

Speaker 1:          30:00          And so that kind of thing that the old people didn't go along with this. And the reason for this, I mean as, as as the Chinese would see it, is that the confusion Etha ethic, they don't have, it's not right. It's not a religious thing and all. There's no, no sense of a deity or anything, anything supernatural going on. But personal relationships are what's important. The sub and their set of unequal, a personal relationship, a subject has to give absolute deference to the ruler is the emperor. A children have to give absolute deference to the parents and to elders. Women have to give absolute deference first to her brothers and that her husband's women to men. Uh, younger brothers have to give absolute deference to their older brothers and of these, the only relationship that's equal his friend, friend relationship. That's the fifth relationship. So you can be buddies with your friend, but you must be superior to wife.

Speaker 1:          30:57          New Wife must be inferior to you. And so you cannot be friends with them. Love or passion between the married couple. Not only didn't happen, it was not approved of. It was like be you're being bad. If you love your wife, if you have passion for why that an a not a good thing. And so husband and wife did not relate to each other as lovers or even as friends. And there's a very famous Chinese story, uh, where a young man had been married some years is walking with a friend with a mail from another male friend with whom he can be fun and converse. And he's bemoaning his fate that here he loves his wife. So extremely, but he can't have a, uh, he can't express his love for her to her. He can't have walks in the moonlight like he's having with his male friend.

Speaker 1:          31:46          He can't have this kind of a chat with her because that is against the morality and ethics, uh, of the, of the system. So, uh, these cultural things, which I think no Chinese of the time would describe as, oh, that's the way we keep our population down or what is the explanation for this rather than, uh, some kind of, uh, uh, of conscious effort. Also, another factor that is not a conscious sort of thing is the Chinese married younger than Europeans. So when you do an age adjusted thing by 20, they had been married for several years and is what's called the boredom factor going on now. And no matter what age, couple of Marriott, they have sex a lot in the beginning. And so they, if they're not protecting themselves, they have a, a high birth rate and then it falls down. And some fraction of this difference here may just be to due to the age of marriage. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          32:49          Yeah. So we're going to get to that. Uh, actually we may not get to it till next time, but that's still, again, we're pushing out. We still haven't explained why the population, uh, is more dense and it's getting time. Let me just finish saying something about this. 10 to 25%, uh, getting rid of the females, which again would reduce the population, would lead you to not think there was a such a density, uh, in the, in the 17th century. Uh, again, this is from Jesuit missionaries to China, uh, reporting back to Europe. They were horrified to find that in Beijing alone, taking it at the time, several thousand babies, almost exclusively females were thrown into the streets like refuse to be collected each morning by carriers who dumped them into huge pits outside the city. And it sounds very much like, like Europe of of a similar time.

Speaker 1:          33:45          And what's interesting is that right now China is approaching pretty much the same female with their sex selective in fancy, pretty much the same female deficits that's been as far as we can tell, the traditional, uh, level of it. But now there's all this moaning and groaning about, you know, all these unmarried males and how it will utterly disrupt Chinese society. And, and you know, it's a horrible sort of thing. And also, I think I mentioned this before, as you've seen in Europe, we're rather than, uh, 10 to 25% of the males not being able to get married because of Devs, a females, 40, 50, 60% of the males did not get married in Europe. I showed you the graphs of that when we discuss, uh, Europe.

Speaker 1:          34:31          So the Chinese, uh, system, uh, fertility system, which, which, uh, keeps their population manageable, not, it's not small, but manageable, uh, is, uh, moderately early, not extremely early, moderately early, a nearly universal marriage of surviving females. Uh, in 1998 for the prince, only 1% of Chinese women were unmarried by age 30, whereas in the West in that year, 15% are unmarried, 15 times as much, uh, even by age 14 in the West. And so the European system was that only about half of everybody got married. Uh, but once, uh, once married, they had births at about twice the rate of Chinese. In Chinese, all the women got married, but within marriage they had a low rate of fertility. So you have to cut your fertility down by half, either by the European thing of, of less than complete marriage or by the Chinese thing of less than complete a fertility. So it looks like, uh, that, uh, pop fertility there. The total fertility rates should be more or less the same, the same between China and, and Europe, but by essentially opposite kinds of fertility systems. And we'll see. I'm sorry. Next time we'll continue and we'll see. What is one of the theories for why China got into the, the difficulties. It was not just uncontrolled reproduction.
