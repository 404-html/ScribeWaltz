Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Join the first, a beautiful day and in quite some time. Uh, today, uh, we're very pleased to have William Ryerson as our guest speaker and he is president of the population media center, which by the end of the of the lecture period, you'll know what that is. Uh, he graduated from Amherst college and then he became one of us. He was a graduate student at Yale studying Mars, Mars, the entomology and the ecology of, of insects. And that field, people seem to realize that humans are pushing even the insects out of existence. So he then became interested in, in the human aspects of ecological and population kind of things. 33 years ago he started working in the field of reproductive health and then if I get 15 years and that he started, uh, being involved with a group that was making TV programs and radio dramas in developing countries and that are on social issues of things that are troubling the societies in which they're shown to.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       And eventually he founded this group, the population media center and is both the founder and the president of, of PMC. And the soap operas are different than the kind of soap operas that were used to in America. And their purpose is to explore the social change and deal with the issues that are of great currency for developing countries where the culture is changing rapidly in one direction or another, or not changing rapidly as as the case may be. And one of the big four is women's reproductive issues, population issues, HIV issues, child bride issues, all of the kinds of issues. A lot of the ones that we've been talking about in the class. What's nice about him and do do is SEL training of course, is that both in the design of of of these programs, he uses really good academic research. What's really known about social change and the induction of social change.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       They just don't go off and be artsy fartsy about it. Really study what, what is the successful way of doing this? And then not only that, then there's really three stages of professionals and one understanding the academic stuff so you know what you're doing. Then getting the very best people in whatever country you're working in. The real good actors, they're the major producers and you know, groups that really know what they're doing in terms of entertainment and that leads to great success, which you'll describe. And then further, the third step is once you've done it, did it work. And that's the real, real, real serious research finding out you've had, you've done something, you're hoping to inculcate some sort of social change. Well did it work? And that's not easy, but again, Bill's group has used the most careful and stringent academic research to try to get at that issue. And so these, these programs have turned out to be very popular successes and you will, you'll hear about that. And they have indeed been successful in fostering social change. And so I put bill into the category of people who have made a difference and this is not a huge category. Uh, and so I'm very proud to, to have to introduce him to you.

Speaker 2:          00:03:32       Bob. Thank you very much. Pleasure to be with you. Um, as Bob said, I started my career, uh, here at Yale as a graduate student in ecology and evolution. And it was just 40 years ago, last October that I sat in the audience at the forestry school and heard Paul Erlick talk about his then recently published book, the population bomb. Uh, he had been invited to give that lecture by Charles Remington, who founded this course and who was, uh, along with Paul and an attorney from a Connecticut named, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:04:13       uh, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:04:18       whatever his name was, an attorney from Connecticut. Uh, along with Paul and Charlie Remington founded zero population growth. Uh, immediately after the lecture that Paul gave and I had dinner with Paul at Remington's house that night, got very interested in Dick Bowers was the attorney's name. I know it would come to me sooner or later when those synapses connected. Um, I had dinner with a Erlick at Remington's house that night, uh, took a huge interest in this issue, which of course continues to this day. We're growing by the equivalent of a new Egypt every year, uh, on a global level, about 82 million net growth. And the environmental impact of that growth is immense. So I began at that point to think about how to address population issues, how to try to bring about a slowing of of population growth rates and um, how to also ameliorate the impact of humans on the planet.

Speaker 3:          00:05:25       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:05:27       The conventional wisdom at the time was set up family planning clinics, which indeed was a good idea. A lot of that happened particularly in the 70s with strong financial support and leadership from the u s government. Something that changed over the last few decades, but ha is coming back into popularity, uh, with the new administration. Um, but indeed what became evident even in the 70s was that the solution was not just the medical model of setting up family planning clinics. Uh, indeed, um, there was a need to get people to use them. Uh, there was great progress made, particularly in the 70s in meeting the already existing demand. So we went from 10% of the world's couples using modern methods of contraception in 1962, somewhere in the 40% percentile, um, in the late 1970s. And then since then it has crept up to 55% of adult couples using modern methods. The 45% non users, however, outnumber the 90% non users of 1960 because of population growth.

Speaker 2:          00:06:50       So, uh, we have as big a problem ahead of us as we did in 1960 but we also have another problem which is the reasons that they give for non use. Back in the early 1960s, the primary reason was lack of access to contraceptive methods. Now in country after country has less than 2% who give that as their reason. And the number one reason is wanting more children. That is the bulk of the nonusers of contraception. When you take them out, maybe 200 million, uh, uh, couples, there is um, another hundred million that are uh, not using contraception but don't want an additional pregnancy, at least not in the next two years, which is the standard question that's asked in demographic and health surveys. The top four reasons they give for their non use, our fear of side effects. They've heard it's dangerous, uh, male opposition, religious opposition and fatalism.

Speaker 2:          00:08:00       Now a couple of stories about these fear of side effects is something that indeed has been intentionally planted by some religious zealots who are spreading rumors, particularly around east Africa that condoms contain the AIDS virus. So people are actually dying because of this misinformation. They're afraid of using condoms. They heard that they contained the HIV virus, and so they're having unprotected sex and getting aids and dying. It's really a criminal misinformation campaign motivated by people who just think artificial methods of contraception or not a good idea for theological reasons that most of their victims don't understand. Um, and for that matter, that I don't understand, but I've tried. Uh, male opposition is in part male opposition and it's in part lack of communication between husbands and wives. So sometimes in traditional societies, women think they're husbands are opposed, but they've never had a conversation about it and their married life because this is something that they're embarrassed to bring up.

Speaker 2:          00:09:11       Fatalism, uh, is the subject of a very interesting paper by Etienne Vanderwall. I'll you've read it. Okay. So you know about fatalism and belief that whatever God has decided for you must be fine without any idea that you have the right in the ability to determine the, your own outcomes of your family life. And then religious opposition. I, when I say this in the mass media, I, all of a straw, a lot of fire, but there is no religion that as opposed to family planning, uh, you may have heard otherwise. There are religions like the Catholic Church and some conservative, uh, mullahs in Islam who are opposed to certain methods of family planning. But there is no religion that is preaching. Everybody should have as many children as possible. And indeed the, the Catholic church is in favor of people limiting their childbearing to those they can afford to care for and love.

Speaker 2:          00:10:07       So the issue is what methods are appropriate. Uh, and certainly we know from Catholic teachings that methods that are considered artificial are not approved. But indeed the church goes to great lengths to teach what we used to call the rhythm method, periodic abstinence as a way of avoiding unwanted or unplanned pregnancy. Um, in the world of Islam, there are liberal thinkers who are Islamic scholars, like could to Booton Aziz of Pakistan who have written that the Qur'an by calling on women to breastfeed their infants for at least two years is inherently endorsing family planning. The Korean doesn't mention family planning, but, uh, by asking that women breastfeed their infants for two years in low nutrition societies, this means woman must avoid pregnancy. So there are in fact official findings at all rom university to that, to that effect. And some Muslim countries are making huge strides and adopting family planning, leading one being Iran, which is now down at replacement level fertility, uh, in part driven by the ayatollah was in that country who are promoting family planning use.

Speaker 2:          00:11:25       And in Pakistan now, uh, the mosques are handing out contraception. So there's a dramatic change going on in the world of Islam. Uh, having been in the population field for a long time, uh, I happened to, uh, go to the first world population conference by the way, I got involved with Erlick and Remington and starting a Yale chapter of zero population growth that no longer exists. And, uh, ended up on the National Executive Committee of that organization, but went to work with the population institute in Washington and organization, which I now also am president of as of six months ago. Uh, just to keep me from running out of things to do. And um, at this first world conference on population held in Bucharest in 1974, I took 65 students in 20 faculty members from around the u s to cover this event for newspapers across the u s each of the students was accredited with a particular newspaper and they all went as reporters and they filed daily reports and it literally generated hundreds of news articles about this conference.

Speaker 2:          00:12:42       Um, Margaret mead happened to be at this conference, as did a colleague of mine from the Institute, David Poindexter, who now is the honorary chair of population media center. And the two of them looked at the proposed plan of action at the UN had put together and found that there was no reference to the status of women. So they sat down and wrote a paragraph about the status of women and took it to fill Claxton, who was the head of the US delegation, uh, staff members, the State Department under secretary of General, I mean, under secretary of state of the State Department on Population Affairs and said, Phil, the plan of actions has nothing about the status of women. So we've written a paragraph, could you please introduce this in the plenary session of the intergovernmental meeting? And he said, well, this is a meeting about family planning. What's the status of women got to do with it?

Speaker 2:          00:13:41       So by 1994, the most recent UN conference, which I also attended the world had come to recognize that the status of women is central to everything having to do not only with population, but with economic development view educate daughters. You Educate Flint families of the future. Whereas if you educate a man, you educate a man. So, uh, there is a huge need to change the bias among many people around the world that their daughter's places in the kitchen or for sale to some man in a polygamous marriage and their sons places in school. And so indeed promoting behavior change in that area and, and the human rights of women to play an equal role with their husbands and making decisions about family life is critically important. Now. Uh, the first real interest I took in the population field after hearing Eric's talk about the ecological impact of human encroachment on, uh, the wild lands of the planet and the threat to biodiversity was the impact of different age structures of human populations on a economic welfare.

Speaker 2:          00:15:02       There's a Princeton now deceased Princeton, a demographer and the economist named Ainslie Cole who has done, did a lot of work in this area. And I wrote a paper for my paper at the forestry school, um, about his studies of the dependency ratios that grow from different age structures. That is to say the number of nonworking children per working adult and in very large families, societies, I. E. Rapid population growth countries. Uh, which are mostly low income. People spend a very high percentage of their income on immediate survival needs of their children, food, housing and clothing. When they, uh, reduce family's eyes, even without any change in family income, there's money leftover and that money can be spent on elective goods which stimulate the manufacturing sector. It can be invested in education, it can be invested through the government and infrastructure, both of those build economic productivity and most important it can be saved and put into investments or just savings accounts that builds capital, that allows businesses to borrow money and grow building employment.

Speaker 2:          00:16:27       And indeed it's the lack of capital in many poor, rapid population growth countries that is keeping business from expanding. And that as a result, is leading to economic stagnation. So when you look at the history of the countries that have gone from developing status to develop status since World War Two, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, The Bahamas and Barbados, each of those countries first instituted strong voluntary family planning programs. And then their economies took off because once the fertility rate got down below about 2.3, money was leftover capital was formed, businesses expanded, and some of the Asian tigers, China being the lead among them now, uh, are undergoing rapid economic growth for the same reason. Uh, obviously economic policies and various other factors affect this. But demographics are a key aspect of economic welfare. Uh, infrastructure is also, as I mentioned, a key issue for economic productivity.

Speaker 2:          00:17:46       If you don't have roads to get your crops or to market, uh, you don't have airports. Uh, you don't have clean water and a lot of other things that public infrastructure, uh, consists of number one being education schools, uh, for the upcoming generations. Then your economy's going to falter. The average developing country spends $13,000 for public infrastructure, schools, roads, municipal offices, water, sewer, Cetera, electricity over the lifetime of each person. So per capita expenditure of $13,000, but when you multiply $13,000, times the net growth of the world's population every year of 82 million, what do you get? Have you done that in your head already? It's $1 trillion a year. So the price tag just to keep per capita infrastructure, even in countries around the developing world is that trillion dollars a year. They are coming nowhere near making this expenditure. They can't, they don't have that kind of money in part because of economic stagnation.

Speaker 2:          00:19:03       So that is being aggravated by rural to urban migration. Um, and so you see urban centers in developing countries where the urban infrastructure is totally overwhelmed. I was in Kinshasa year and a half ago and, uh, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and that's a city that has infrastructure designed to handle 600,000 people with 10 million people living there. So in fact, thousands, hundreds of thousands of people who are sleeping on open ground, they just have no place to sleep. Um, the city floods every time it rains, there's inadequate sewage protection or sewage treatment and the nuclear power plants that the Belgians in their wisdom put in before they left is sitting at the edge of an erosion zone. They don't have the money to stop it. So the plant is in danger of falling over and the environmental advisor to the governor of Kinshasa state who met my plane, said he's been trying to, uh, he and the governor have been trying to get the president of the country to shut the nuclear power plant down because if it falls over, it's going to make the whole area, including Brazzaville across the river uninhabitable for thousands of years.

Speaker 2:          00:20:26       But the president won't shut it down because he wants to get enough nuclear biproduct to build a bomb so he can bond and Rwanda because Rwanda has troops operating in eastern Congo, which I visited. I was in Goma about a little less than a year ago, and I thought congested was bad until I got to Goma Gomez where the fighting has been going on recently in North Kivu province. So, um, no, when you see these extreme examples of lack of infrastructure, you realize this analysis by Ainslie call was really prophetic. So, um, now, uh, the environmental impacts that Paul Erlick talked about have gone way beyond loss of, of wild lands and threat to biodiversity. In fact, one of the biggest environmental threats right now is pumping out water from underground aquifers. Uh, 80% of which is used for irrigation. So, um, in China, in India, in the American southwest in every continent.

Speaker 2:          00:21:36       Yeah, that'd be great in every continent on the planet. Uh, because of our growing population and the demand for food, which you may have noticed went up in price recently. Uh, the farmers of the world are pumping out the underground aquifers that rates higher than the rate of replacement by rainwater. This is a classic example of something that's not sustainable. It's like taking money out of the bank to pay for your daily living expenses. You can only do that so long. The water table in India is dropping by 10 feet a year. 1,000 farmers of India a couple of weeks ago, committed mass suicide. They are having crop failures as they can no longer drill deep enough to reach the water. Um, and India is green revolution, which bought India maybe 30 years of time according to Norman Borlaug who won the Nobel prize for his research on high yield, wheat and rice.

Speaker 2:          00:22:36       And by the way, who's a member of our program advisory board. Um, you know, the, the green revolution crops are dependent on high volumes of water for irrigation and cheap oil, uh, not only to run the tractors, but to make, uh, pesticides and fertilizer, uh, to keep these crops growing. And in fact, there's an article in the New York Times within the last week about the coming failure of the green revolution crops of India, but every country, or at least every continent is facing this problem. Thank you very much. Um, the, um, Yellow River in China does not reach the ocean two thirds of the year because it's all being used for irrigation. Uh, and what is keeping the rivers of India and China flowing periodically as the melting of the Himalayan glaciers, uh, that has occurred seasonally and waters those lands. However, with climate change, we're losing the glaciers and when they disappear, which will be in the century at the rate things are going and probably in the next three decades, uh, that combined with inability to find any more underground water will lead to dramatic crises with regard to food in, in Asia and for that matter, uh, the same thing is happening in Africa and we're losing farmland in the American southwest with the same process going on.

Speaker 2:          00:24:17       So this is a crisis in the making of global proportions combined with climate change, which is causing the rainfall patterns to change. And in some cases rainfall to decrease. So climate change is indeed the very visible example of why our current pattern is unsustainable. We are already above 350 parts per million in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide. That means even if we stop driving cars and stop heating with oil tomorrow and we burn no more fossil fuels of any kind, we are already going to have devastating climate change. But the arguments going on in the halls of Congress are, can we reduce the rate of increase or can we maybe be, can become so efficient that we level off or slightly decrease our rates of greenhouse gas output. But this is like arguing over which deck chairs to sit in on the titanic. And unless we actually stop producing greenhouse gases and find technology to withdraw carbon dioxide and methane from the atmosphere, the climate is going over a cliff.

Speaker 2:          00:25:43       The century now don't slit your wrists. Uh, there are things we can do. We have the technology to solve a lot of these problems. Uh, and indeed the population issue is a clear cut example. Population by the way, is the climate issue. How many children you have is a climate related decision. Because if as an American, which Americans have the highest per capita output of greenhouse gas, you have two children, each of whom consume 10% less than you do, you're still creating, uh, an impact on the environment. If you have three children, you and your partner spouse, uh, are more than replacing yourselves and you're having a potentially devastating impact. On the environment. If a lot of people make the same decisions. So decisions on reducing family size in developed countries in particular are the least expensive intervention we can make to reduce impact on the climate.

Speaker 2:          00:26:52       Even in the developing world where population growth is occurring the fastest, the rather optimistic median projection of the United Nations between now and 2050 is the addition of 2.5 billion people. That's eight times the U s population. But at the rates of greenhouse gas output on a per capital level, it's the carbon equivalent of adding to United States to the planet. So if we don't solve the population problem, we're not going to solve the climate crisis either. So there are a whole bunch of things facing us now. How do we address all of these behavioral things, including the behavior of Americans will clearly the mass media is influential. Is there anybody here who has never watched television? No. Now when I grew up, we did not have a television. They existed, but my parents thought they were a bad idea. Uh, and they may have been right. I don't know.

Speaker 2:          00:27:48       But, uh, we went over to our friends house and watch TV. But indeed we listened to radio programs. And in many of the developing worlds, uh, uh, countries, people still spend their evenings listening to the radio because they can't afford TVs in Ethiopia. Only 4% of the population can afford a television. But radio is listened to by a vast majority of the population. So in our programs, we use primarily radio, although this methodology that I'm going to tell you about came out of the world of television. Uh, these are the countries in which we've been working. We do long running, serialized dramas, sometimes referred to as soap operas in which characters evolve into role models for the audience, for elevation of women's status, daughter education, use of family planning, small family norms. We're looking at the idea of applying this strategy in the United States to address climate issues, uh, and teenage pregnancy issues.

Speaker 2:          00:28:52       Uh, we also do talk shows, we produce print materials, but it is the entertainment serialized dramas that are on prime time in these countries where we have the largest audiences and therefore have the biggest potential for impact. Uh, the creator of this methodology is a Mexican producer named Miguel Sabido who, uh, was vice president of the biggest commercial network in Mexico, Televisa until his retirement in 1998 in 1975 after looking at the social learning theory of Stanford psychologist Albert Bandura, who's still is looking at how role models influenced behavior psychologically, uh, still teaching at Stanford, uh, and is probably the world's best known psychologist and mode is the most frequently cited psychologists and professional journal articles of those who are living. Um, he went up to actually interview Bandura and went back to Mexico to create a program to promote adult education. And he realized from his work in overseeing the audience research division of the network that his programs, we're having a huge impact on audience members, so why not use them for good.

Speaker 2:          00:30:21       And He created a soap opera with three subplots, one of which had illiterate characters in it, and the other two just were pure entertainment with changes of fortune and cliffhangers at the end of each episode and all the stuff that goes along with a soap opera. And they were on at prime time, or this program was on a primetime, it was called Venkat Amigo. And it pulled in 33% of the nation's viewers. The, you know, melodramas defined as the battle of good versus evil. So the evil characters were telling the illiterate characters that they were too old or too stupid to learn and they should forget about that and stick with what they have. The positive characters are saying there's a whole infrastructure for adult education. You ought to give it a try and you can master it. You're not stupid. And one by one, these illiterate characters decided to go to classes and sign up and take the courses and get their diplomas.

Speaker 2:          00:31:22       And when they did, so their lives improved. And this huge audience witnessed this. And Sabido then became intentional in promoting this. And he ran an epilogue in which he gave addresses of registration sites for adult education. And this epilogue followed the episode in which is most popular character, God, his diploma and it, I don't speak Spanish and I broke down in tears what I watched this episode because it's so emotional. This man crying, holding his diploma because finally he can read all the letters he's gotten over the years from his granddaughter. And then there's this epilogue perhaps you two would like to do with this man has done. And Sabido warned the Ministry of Public Education. He said, you may be aware of the show I'm doing on Televisa. And they said, yes, we like it very much. It's reinforcing our public service announcements. And he said, well, uh, I may generate a crowd because I'm going to run an advertisement after an upcoming episode in which I give addresses of your registration sites.

Speaker 2:          00:32:28       Can you handle a crowd? And they said, oh, no problem. You know, last year before your program started, we signed up 99,000 people. So we're set up to handle large numbers. So he ran that episode and the following day, in a single day, 250,000 people came in to try to register and he continued to run epilogues, uh, for the remaining weeks of that 260 episode program. And by the time it was done, 840,000 people had signed up for adult education. Then he did a program called our companyi may come with me that promoted family planning as a solution to a problem of family harmony, which is a perfect subject for a melodrama. Um, a couple arguing over how many children to have and how to stay out of poverty and so on. And they ultimately adopt a method of family planning and the live happily ever after. Similar impact on family planning use. And it was during that program that David Poindexter, my colleague at Population Institute discovered Sabido doing this program, 1976.

Speaker 3:          00:33:41       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:33:42       And he did two things. He convinced Emilio scargo who owned Televisa to have Sabido do four more telenovelas dealing with teenage pregnancy prevention and family planning promotion. And he took Sabido to meet Indira Gandhi in India. Uh, I had been in India in 1975 when she imposed involuntary sterilization, um, around the country and it caused the family planning efforts in India to collapse. And she lost the next election that as she should have a, it was a total mess and she was very concerned about India's population problem, but she didn't try the right strategy. And ultimately she got reelected and before her assassination, Sabido was sitting in front of her saying, you don't need to use coercion. You can role model this, show people the benefits and they'll decide for themselves whether to do it. And so they ended up

Speaker 3:          00:34:39       okay

Speaker 2:          00:34:40       being sent to the head of the Indian television authority and Sabido trained the writer minority. I am Joshi who did India's first homegrown soap opera, which had a huge impact. It's a subject of a book called India Information Revolution. It pulled in between 65 and 90%. I'm anybody who had access to TV. It generated 400,000 letters from viewers to the Indian television authority. Half of them address the characters by name, uh, with advice on who they should marry and so on. But a lot of testimonials on how the program was impacted in the audience members.

Speaker 3:          00:35:20       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:35:20       So I got very interested in this strategy and got involved in studying the second Indian soap opera, which had huge effects on it's 230 million viewers with regard to attitudes about age of marriage, women and acceptability of women in the outside the home. So one of the reasons this strategy has been so effective where it's been tried around the world is the long running nature of the program. Um, because you can't get somebody from say the status of women of a woman in Sudan to Gloria Steinem was a 62nd public service announcement or with a one hour drama. You really need time to bring about meaningful change without creating backlash. And by having gradual evolution of the transitional characters and only in response to situations that the audience understands and themselves are experiencing. Can you bring about meaningful change? And the emotional content of melodrama is also very important for helping people remember what they learned from the programs as well as remembering the program itself.

Speaker 3:          00:36:32       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:36:32       Do you remember what you were doing on the morning of September 11th, 2001 and do you remember as clearly what you were doing on the morning of September 10th? Now what psychologists tell us is that emotional involvement enhances memory. So if you're a highly involved emotionally in an emotionally based melodrama and you learn lessons from it, you remember those the rest of your life. But if it's intellectual, blah, blah, blah, it may last not much longer than the final exam. And I'm probably guilty of that myself. Ah, there are several other theories that Sabido incorporated into a theoretical framework, both psychological and communication theories, uh, for the creation of this methodology. And I'm not going to take the time now to talk about them, but they're very interesting and I recommend you download this free book from our website that has those theories spelled out as well as examples of the strategy as it's been applied around the world.

Speaker 3:          00:37:39       She came to class last time,

Speaker 2:          00:37:42       she did red savvy, who is now working for population media center.

Speaker 3:          00:37:48       And

Speaker 2:          00:37:50       so he's flying to Nairobi today, um, in Tanzania in 1993. Um, I took, Everett Rogers was then associate dean of the Annenberg School of communications at University of Southern California and a research design scientists for Minneapolis named Peter Vaughan to help design an experimental

Speaker 2:          00:38:14       evaluation to measure the effects of a Sabido style radio. Surreal. It was the second one done in Africa. Um, and it was broadcast with this pattern. You can see the transmitting towers, the dots and the shaded areas around them or where you could hear the signal. But we intentionally chose early prime time when the tower in the Doma was broadcasting locally produced music with no social or health content. So twice a week for two years, a 208 episode program, uh, people in the shaded areas heard 20, not Wakati, let's go with the times or let's be modern qual in the control area. They heard music among the characters in this program was a negative character named [inaudible]. He was an alcoholic truck driver with a girlfriend that every truck stop in a subservient wife named two new waiting at home. Uh, and he was in Tanzania in society, every man's ideal.

Speaker 2:          00:39:21       This guy was a sexual athlete. He was having a wonderful time. Uh, he had girlfriends everywhere, you know, draping over him at every truck stop. Uh, and so it attracted a huge mail following more men than women in this audience, but overall 58% of the adult population listening much to him, Quad Jews surprised. He found he was married to a transitional character and to new, uh, perhaps having read some of the thousands of letters addressed to her coming into radio Tanzania advising her that her husband was cheating on her, stood up to him when he was home on one of his visits and told them she had heard about the aids epidemic and she knew what he was up to on the road and he was going to have to use condoms. And she made that happen. She eventually took a job and ultimately she founded her own business and became a role model for female entrepreneurship in Tanzania.

Speaker 2:          00:40:18       Now if you're a script writer, you probably figured out am quad to become sick and for some time the audience doesn't know what has affected him, but they find out he now has aids and two new throws them out, but have ultimately takes him back and cares for him in a separate bedroom until he dies. And the audience learned a few lessons out of this. Uh, we did nationwide random sample surveys of 2,750 people annually, starting with a baseline just before going on the air and then repeated annually for four years. [inaudible] 93 94, 95, 96, 97 and from 93 to 95, this was the pattern of broadcasting. From 95 to 97 we broadcast the program and the Doma, so we were able to measure and broadcast areas and non-broadcast areas. What was going on with regard to self reported knowledge, attitudes and behavior. I also got the Ministry of Health to ask new family planning adopters why they'd come to the clinics.

Speaker 2:          00:41:29       Now in the survey at the end of year to 58% of the adult population listening, 82% of the listeners said the program had caused them to change their behavior to avoid HIV infection. We were astounded by how high an impact it was. The most common change people said they had made was reduction in the number of sexual partners. We didn't have the budget to hire enough private detectives to verify those claims, but we got the condom distribution data from the national aids control program broken down by district and then the districts that made up the control area where they got all the national programs about aids except for the soap opera. There was a 16% increase in condom distribution. While in the broadcast areas there was a 153% increase in condom distribution. Now when we took all of the reported behavior changes across the country and extrapolated it to wherever you could hear this program, the cost per person who changed behavior to avoid HIV infection was 8 cents us on family planning, we saw a 10 percentage point increase in the number of family planning adopters in the initial broadcast areas and zero change in the control area around the dome a transmitter.

Speaker 2:          00:42:58       When we broadcast the program in Dodoma the following two years, we had a 16 percentage point increase in family planning adoption and in both areas at the time of the broadcasts were on the air and those areas, 41% of the new adopters named the program as their reason for coming in. The next most impactful intervention was named by 11% so four to one ratio of effects between this soap opera and the next most impactful intervention. Now. It was right after seeing this data that I started population media center and I took rose Haji who produced the Tanzanian program, Tom Kazoo, who was the first African trained by Sabido and the first radio person to use it and Sabido himself to Ethiopia. And we trained a team of writers to produce two programs. One in I'm heart, the national language, which was 257 episodes long and the second 140 episodes in Oromiffa.

Speaker 2:          00:43:58       The second most common language, and those were on the air for two and a half years, starting in June of o to the [inaudible] program was listened to by 47% of men, 45% of women. The OROMIFFA program pulled in another 25% of the population. So we had well over 40 million people listening to this program and it became the subject of daily conversations as well as thousands of letters, 15,000 poured into our office and Adis Abba. But during the time these programs were on the air, most of them in response to the arm Hark language program, which had a better time slot. One of those letters from was from a woman who said, uh, she was so happy we had addressed the issue of marriage by abduction because you may not know this, but in rural Ethiopia, the status of women is so low that it's considered socially acceptable for a man to grab a girl off the street.

Speaker 2:          00:44:59       And I mean a school girl take her home and rape her and then she's considered to be his wife and she stuck with her abductor for the rest of her life. So, and parents won't take the daughter's back because they're damaged goods and it would bring shame on the family. So they leave the girls with these abductors. Now this is starting to change in courts are starting to allow these women to escape. Uh, we dealt with this in this very popular program in this letter said thank you so much for dealing with the issue of marriage by abduction through your character. Wu Baalam, our own daughter was abducted on our way to school at age 14 and ended up married as a result. And we've been afraid to send our 12 year old girls to school for fear of the same thing. What happened to them when your program played and dealt with this issue?

Speaker 2:          00:45:47       The entire village which had listened to, it came together and we agreed to enforce the law against bearish by abduction and it's now safe to send our 12 year old girls to school. So this is the kind of qualitative information we got from those letters. We also had listening groups that filled out diaries after each episode and periodic focus group discussions for feedback to the writers and monitoring through 14,400 exit interviews at reproductive health clinics to ask people why they had come and baseline and post broadcast quantitative survey across the country at the 48 clinics where those 14,000 exit interviews were carried out at 63% of the new reproductive health clients were listening to the program or one of the programs. And over a fourth of the new clients cited one of the programs as the primary motivator for seeking services.

Speaker 3:          00:46:45       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:46:46       Radio Ethiopia is 100% public service broadcasting. Uh, and a lot of programs dealing with AIDS and family planning of all the people who named Radio Ethiopia or other radio programs, 96% named one of our programs, 4% named any of the other programs on the radio as their source of motivation. This shows increase in use of family planning from baseline to non listeners to listeners. The increase among the listeners was more than double the increase among non listeners and highly statistically significant and some of the non listeners were clearly motivated through conversations with listeners. Oh, this is a decrease in not knowing how to determine one's HIV status and this is actual reporting of going for HIV testing. Male listeners, sod HIV tests at four times the rate of non listeners, female listeners sought tests at three times the rate of non listeners. Now we've done similar work in these countries, uh, in Vietnam.

Speaker 2:          00:47:55       We're currently on the air with a program dealing with HIV AIDS on the voice of Vietnam in west Africa. We did a program dealing with child slavery. The, it was actually something that was brought about through a request by Ben and Jerry's. And funding from them to get started. And then funding from the u s government. And we measured a quintupling of awareness among listeners of the problem of child trafficking and child slavery and a doubling of interventions by listeners to stop the practice. Uh, we've just gone on the air and Molly with a program promoting family planning. Uh, we've done two programs in Nigeria. Uh, first one was at the request of the Rotarian Action Group on Population and development that was setting up a surgery to offer repair for women who have upstack obstetric fistula. Something that results from the daughter's in northern Nigeria being married off at age nine and getting pregnant at age 12 and trying to deliver with an immature pelvis and having obstructed labor and ending up somewhat torn to shreds and incontinent.

Speaker 2:          00:49:08       Uh, these girls married the older men in polygamous marriages generally then get thrown out on the street and live as beggars. And the rotary clubs of northern Nigeria set up a surgical center to repair them because for $300, he's women can be returned to a normal life, but they know if they are unrepaired, they're incontinent and they live on the streets and they smell bad and their social pariahs. So, uh, and in fact, there are 800,000 women in Nigeria with unrepaired fistulas. So we were able to measure by promoting family planning and delaying marriage and childbearing to adulthood. A third of the women coming to family planning clinics named our program as their reason for coming in. 54% of the women coming for surgical repair named the program as the reason they were at the Ho at the clinic. Uh, the second program that on the air currently as being named by 67% of family planning adopters as their motivation for seeking services in Rwanda, currently 57% of family planning clients and 59% of HIV testing clients name our program as their motivation for coming to the clinic.

Speaker 2:          00:50:25       We're also using the program to promote preservation of mountain gorilla habitat and more generally, uh, wilderness areas in Rwanda. In Sudan, the program addressed the issue of, uh, of uh, female genital mutilation, uh, opposition to FGM and Sudan. At the time that program was on the air, went from 28% to 65%. By the end of the program in Asia, we dealt with a child trafficking also and in Senegal we've just gone on the air with the two programs in two different languages. In the U S we're working with the Hollywood community and partnership was the Academy of Television, arts and sciences and the screenwriter's guild of America. We've done two briefings for members of the screenwriter's guild, the most recent one on climate, population health and security issues. We held in Hollywood and November. And the one before that, a bout a year and a half ago at Emory school of Public Health, uh, looking at the role of entertainment, television and addressing public health issues. And these are countries in which we are developing projects. I was in Papa New Guinea and Uganda in the development of new projects in the last two months. But we have projects in various stages of development in each of these countries. Now how are we on time?

Speaker 2:          00:51:59       So why don't I take just a few minutes and show you if I can make this work. A clip from a documentary done by a CNN vice president for environment, no longer with CNN, but she was head of environment for CNN and Turner Broadcasting Woman named Barbara Pile. Um, who did a documentary on this idea of social content soap operas, uh, in the Philippines where it's a seal. Alvarez, uh, produced a program. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to put this on full screen, but let's see. Well, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Let me do this. I'll reject it.

Speaker 3:          00:53:22       Hmm. Yup.

Speaker 2:          00:53:39       You sure can. It's right in here.

Speaker 3:          00:53:43       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:53:56       So this is a dock, a documentary about this Philippine program introduced by Jane Fonda and then the documentaries by Barbara pile of the storyline is about, uh, two sisters, one of whom we lopes, I think the age of 16. And has a baby every year trying to please their husband who wants a son and it's a tragedy.

Speaker 3:          00:54:18       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:54:19       So what do I do?

Speaker 3:          00:54:20       Okay. Uh, I think you've done it. Numbers, people, personal journey around the world. Yep. [inaudible] [inaudible] well let's fix that. Are there lights? Oh thank you.

Speaker 2:          01:01:58       That's a half hour documentary but you saw the part about it that is on that

Speaker 3:          01:02:02       a soap opera. Um,

Speaker 2:          01:02:05       and I guess with that I thank you for your attention and I'd be happy to take questions.

Speaker 3:          01:02:12       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:02:13       Are there any questions or comments?

Speaker 3:          01:02:18       Get cell phone once a week and, well, some are daily, some daytime. How is it, is that standard

Speaker 2:          01:02:31       at various all over the place and Latin America its daily day time man primetime in many countries it's twice a week. Some are once a week, but once a week is really not adequate because you have to hold the audience's interest for a whole week waiting for the resolution of the latest cliffhanger. So we like to do a minimum of twice a week and some of them are three times a week.

Speaker 3:          01:02:56       Yes. Having a program like, but halfway through the show. How do you

Speaker 2:          01:03:12       well, yeah, look, okay, thanks. The question was how do we deal with people who are drawn into the program halfway through a two year or soap opera? Um, and the, the answer is one of the beauties about having several hundred episodes is you can have a lot of discussion of what's going on in the past by the characters. So people who join the audience partway through, uh, the two or three years that are, might be on the air, learn a lot about it and they also may learn about it from other members of the community. Um, particularly in countries where we have very high listenership, like northern Nigeria, our most recent measure was 82% of the adult population are listening every week. So, uh, they're, you know, it's become a cultural event. Uh, so people who are joining it here, both about the program from their neighbors as well as hearing characters talking about the past and getting caught up that way.

Speaker 2:          01:04:15       One of the, one of the questions I'm often asked, and maybe I should wait until somebody asks me this question, is how do we decide what it is we're promoting? And, and, and in a sense, what gives us as an American organization the right to go into some country and tell them how to live. Uh, and indeed, one of the things that we've adopted as a strategy is looking at the policies of each country. Most countries are signatories with the Cairo program of Action on Population and development and of the Beijing Platform of action on women's rights. So if there are a signatory of those documents, then part of their national policy is incorporated in those documents, which are really global agreements on the rights and status of women and reproductive health. So we use that as a starting point as the basis for the values will be promoted by the program. And then the policies of the country may add nuances to that. So when we go into a country, explained to them, we are there to help them promote their policies. We're not trying to impose something from the outside.

Speaker 3:          01:05:24       Yes. How do you find that position from governments or other institutions?

Speaker 2:          01:05:29       Uh, hardly any. Uh, the question was do we have opposition from governments? Uh, one of the things about this strategy is because we're working to support the government's policies, they are very enthusiastic about it. And second, we get very little opposition from the public because of the very gradual evolution of the characters. And because by doing our homework and really understanding the culture before we ever get started and having writers from that culture, all of our programs are written, produced and managed by country nationals. We know what the taboos are and we steer clear of those. So we're not there to give people shock therapy. We're there to start where they are and move in the direction of a better reproductive health and women's rights. But we don't do it in a way that creates backlash or opposition. Yes,

Speaker 3:          01:06:36       they were made.

Speaker 2:          01:06:48       Um, and the, the question is with American shows like seventh heaven, are we, what's the comparison between narrow strategy for promoting, uh, not drinking and driving or abstinence with the kinds of programs we're doing? And the answer is there is some comparison that is producers and writers of American Hollywood shows are members of society and their parents and they're very aware of some of the problems and sometimes they attempt to address issues in the context of their program. Um, we had Neil bear as a speaker at an event we did at Hofstra University, uh, about a month ago, uh, who produces, um, law and order and, uh, w also was a producer of er, and they're very intentional efforts to use some of these programs to promote positive goals. They tend to do so in one or a few episodes as opposed to having a program that's designed around a set of issues.

Speaker 2:          01:07:57       So it tends to be briefer mentions of these issues. Uh, and sometimes they're done well and sometimes they're not. Uh, but indeed there are lots of examples of, of entertainment chosen Hollywood, like, um, the bold and the beautiful addressing aids through a character named Tony who finds out he's HIV positive. Uh, and they got a 800 number from Donna Shalala when she was secretary of Health and human services that they could run after those key episodes for people to call for information that show generated more calls to that 800 number, then 60 minutes treatment of HIV AIDS and 60 minutes has a much bigger audience, but it was the emotional impact of days of our lives that generated a huge response by the audience. So some of these have been very useful, um, interventions, but they're quite different in terms of methodology. Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:08:59       Followup studies like accepted of contraception.

Speaker 2:          01:09:11       There is some evidence, um, of course you're asking a fundraising question. Uh, it is hard to get grants for say, a 10 year study. Um, but there are, there is some evidence, for example with Sabido is family planning programs. They stopped, uh, addressing family planning issues that Televisa unrelated to the controversy or not of the content. They stopped doing social content broadcasting at Televisa in 1985 and the birth rate had come down dramatically. It was the most dramatic decline in birth rates of any developing country in the 20th century. During the 10 years. Sabido is five family planning, soap operas were on the air when they stopped the birth rate plateaued, but it did not go back up. However, our view is because there are new generations coming along every year and because people continue to need information on a whole range of health and social issues, uh, these programs should be seen as a long term intervention. We shouldn't say do a program for three years and then walk away in the same way that we wouldn't open a clinic for three years and then close it down and hope that the birth rate wouldn't go back up. So we really see this as a long term intervention. But the evidence that we have, probably not conclusive, but it appears that these programs lead to permanent change in norms.

Speaker 1:          01:10:46       Yes. Yup.

Speaker 2:          01:10:53       Uh, certainly in countries that have a mature media market like India, like Brazil, uh, we are adopting more a strategy of working with the producers of existing programs than trying to produce our own and compete. So in Brazil, for example, we're working in partnership, the Social Merchandising Department of Tele of TV global, which controls 65% of the Brazilian audience. And that strategy, actually the, their department, he emerged because of the partnership we formed originally through a meeting, uh, David Poindexter and I had with Roberto Marino who own the network and it was being done through the product placement division, but ultimately they set up a whole division to promote social causes through their telenovelas. And so we helped them do that and we measured the effects. For example, 36% of the women that planned parenthood clinics in Brazil were there because of one soap opera. We evaluated called, uh, [inaudible] Davita pages of life. Um, and, um, it's similar to what we're doing in Hollywood. We're not, you know, we may do a youtube soap opera, but we're not likely to get ourselves on the air on CBS. So we're instead focusing on working with writers of existing programs.

Speaker 3:          01:12:21       Yes. I mean if they're, if they're writing into the characters and even suggesting if that helps or hinders,

Speaker 2:          01:12:39       uh, it's, it's a question that, uh, we try to understand before we ever go on the air. What are their attitudes, perceptions of and consumption of entertainment media. Um, and indeed the audiences in terms of their sophistication, their media savvy, varied dramatically from a place like Ethiopia to a place like India. So there is no one generalization, um, but you know, there are many stories about our experiences in Ethiopia. For example, the actress who played the positive female role model for Corto in that first program I was talking about, um, went into a vegetable market and women recognized her voice from the radio show and one of them said, you're for Kirta. And she said, well, not really. And they said, no, no, no. We know you're for Kurt to, um, well we recognize you from Yak and cabinet. And one of them said, I named my baby daughter after you and hopes that she would be as wonderful as you are. So clearly they're, you know, they're not seeing the distinction between fantasy and reality. But on the other hand, how many times have you heard this about American audiences? So it's, it's hard to know really. Uh, but clearly, uh, probably the lack of sophistication leads to greater influence of the programs, but it's hard to know.

Speaker 3:          01:14:10       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:14:11       One more question.

Speaker 3:          01:14:13       Yeah. Applying this model to other social issues such as environmental degradation, because I mean really based on family relationships and people's relate to each other. And how do you see, what's your nozzles, what leaves the success rate of these environment issues, what other types of stuff?

Speaker 2:          01:14:35       The question is how do we feel about applying this strategy to other issues like environment as opposed to family life and family planning issues? And the answer is we feel great about it. However you point out, it might not be the most exciting soap opera to do a soap opera on recycling. So it doesn't have the same sex appeal or audience appeal as a program about people's lives. So we mix issues and we like to do programs about life in the country, in the eastern Caribbean. The nine countries where we're broadcasting a program. That program is addressing both family planning and preservation of the rain forest of the eastern Caribbean in Rwanda. Similarly, um, we're planning a program in Papa New Guinea that we'll address conservation of marine resources and family planning. And clearly family life issues are perfect subject for melodrama. Uh, you have to be very careful how much conservation kind of content you put into a program.

Speaker 2:          01:15:38       But indeed you can have the life of a village in a soap opera. And for example, in Papa New Guinea, one of the fishing practices that there's clearly a short term strategy is to use dynamite to blow up the reef and it stuns all the fish and they can scoop up out of the ocean, but that's not a sustainable livelihoods. So, you know, we can demonstrate that through a two year or soap opera in a way that might take many more years and be devastating to the marine environment. Uh, if it, if people just wait until they're starving. So, but, but the point is well taken. It's, it's something where we have to be careful not to overload it with messages and boring information. It really has to remain an exciting program or we'll lose our audience. Well, I think we better call it quits because we're past a adjournment time, but I thank you all very much.

Speaker 3:          01:16:40       Okay.
