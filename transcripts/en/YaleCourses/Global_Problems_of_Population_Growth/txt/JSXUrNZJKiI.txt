Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So you remember when I was talking about Europe, uh, we discussed the fact that during marriage, uh, Europeans just had babies in a sense willy nilly, but we all said it was nowhere near the maximum that humans are capable of, but we thought it was no sort of cultural constraints, late marriage and stuff like that. Now we come to China in which the birth rate within marriage was quite a bit lower. And I introduced the question of whether this was voluntary in the sense of individually decided individual decides what they want and act on it or was this low birth rate, uh, due to a cultural constraints, uh, in a crowded household would maybe the grandmother sleeping beneath you, there's no opportunity if the cultural rules say you can't be friends with your wife, there may be a reduction in passion. And the conclusion that I, that I gave you was that this didn't seem to be an individual decision kind of thing, but a cultural kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          00:01:06       Let me one of the eye, it's a little bit out of, out of place, but I just can't, I can't, I have to love this data so much. It's so, it's so very striking as an example of people that are not individually, voluntarily controlling their fertility. So how would you tell if someone is, you know, you have a big huge population, uh, you don't, you can't interview all of them. Maybe it's a dead population, know the old, uh, how do you tell a, whether they're making individual decisions? Well you have, one of the ways of doing is to consider individual events in their lives that you think under any reasonable idea of what it is to be a human would affect their fertility. And one of those events is a death of a child. There's many, there's a, I mean, I think you all would naturally say if you want a certain number of children are going to control consciously.

Speaker 1:          00:01:57       If your children die, you're going to try harder to have more, you're going to try longer. So here is a Chinese population from 1982. So we're talking about just at the time when the one child policy is starting and these are women who have finished their childbearing by 1980 82 so it's the generation exactly prior to the one child policy and it gives you a lot of data. But look over here it says what happened to the first four children and it gives you two cases. All all the children died or all survive. There's a lot of intermediate cases which which are not shown in this particular graph and it's spread out by age to seeing if there's some sort of age effect. And here is the mother's age at laughed last birth. So if all of them survived, if all of them died, you think the mother would really want to have more.

Speaker 1:          00:02:51       She stops giving birth at 30 at age 38.7 if they all survived one 10th of the year, she stopped giving birth one 10th of a year earlier, one month earlier, same if the a little bit older group, you have a point for a year, maybe four months later and here's 0.1 months. Again, for women who are 20, uh, a their age at first birth, I'm sorry. They, it, it, the age of which they stopped depends on the age at which they start to a large degree. So the numbers are this way different because they started at different ages, but there's no difference within an age group on whether all four children died or all four children survived. That's just to me, that's a, an amazing, uh, set of statistics that apparently the, the continuation, the attempt to have as many children as possible, just as not depend on, on that event.

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       Here's another example of this. This is, uh, as well as custom. Most of Asia, a lot of the world, and especially China, they need males. Sons are much preferred over daughters. So here's a crazy, very nicely displayed, a set of data, uh, saying how many sons have you had? How many daughters, here's, uh, that have had no sun or no daughter? And the question is, how many of them proceed these numbers or the fraction that proceed to have the first birth? So when they get married and they have no children, neither sun nor daughter point, uh, 0.95, eight, I'm sorry. They have, they have a son first. They have one son or one daughter. Those that have a son, 95.8% of them proceed to have a second child and then that can be the a boy or a girl. If their first child is a daughter, 96.8% proceed.

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       So you don't have to look up here and the details aren't important. But look at, for instance, those that have seven sons in a row, this is people that have seven and 72% 72 and a half percent of them proceed to get pregnant. Again, here's seven daughters in a row. They want the sons, they want daughters, 76% a three and a half percent difference. Almost no difference in their life. Again, how many of them after having seven sons, you're presumed that it's enough. I have a sense, whereas seven daughters, they would be desperate to have more, but there's a very small different, a a 3% difference between the fraction of them that proceed. And you can also see the numbers are very high. Those that have had seven children are already 76% proceeded to have another birth. They just keep going. And whether they have all daughters in a row or all sons in a row makes very little difference.

Speaker 1:          00:05:52       Finally at eight there is, it is a 10% different, less less than 10% difference, but whether that, that doesn't fit with the rest of the bath, but it's still very small difference. And here's the last graph of this, of this nature. And this is again the me, the age of the mother's last birth. And again, it's the same kind of graph, uh, those that have had eight daughters in a row versus those that have eight sons in a row. And you think in a sun desire in culture, if they were controlling their fertility in any individualistic way that the ones with a lot of sons I would say, okay enough. You know, and the ones with a lot of daughters would be desperate to finally have a son. But look at the difference. 41, the age of 41.4. If they have eight sons in a row and the age 41.7, again, three tenths of a year, the they try just a little bit, uh, longer, uh, three months longer. So basically, I think what this data is telling you is that people are for sure not responding to their most important fertility events in their life, either the sex composition of their children or the death of the children. They're just, uh, having, having children at not an enormous rate because of the cultural things that everybody is, is, is behaving under, not with respect to their individual experiences and desires.

Speaker 1:          00:07:19       Okay. So this is the context into which the one child, the first, the one she shouted, the later longer fewer policy drops in and then 10 years later the one child policy. So it gives you an amazing, here's a population that just finished childbearing when the policy starts and there's apparently no thought whatsoever of individually controlling, uh, fertility. And all of a sudden the government tells you, you know, hey, you gotta you gotta you got to have fewer children. And I showed you the rate of fall. The rate of fall during the 70s was just a fantastic. And then after that fall, again, as I told you last time to control momentum, uh, they institute the one child policy and the number of births levels off. And why does the number of births level off? Uh, this is again the fertility drop. Uh, this is the longer later fuehler a policy in the 1970s.

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       That's where you get the big drop. 1980, the one child policy, you don't get any further drops. And that was a sign of, well, uh, an incompetent government incompetently carried out fertility policy that turns out the one arm of the government was doing something the opposite to the opposite fact, have another arm of the government. So here the, the Chinese were, uh, for women's rights issues and uh, to, to control somewhat control the population. They are encouraging later marriage that didn't want girls married at 13, 14, 15 and so forth. So we've been very successful. The revolution is, is out here. Uh, and the age of marriage is already up to 19 and a half or so by 1965. And they're being very successful. And the age of marriage keeps going up until it reaches a quite respectable 23 that's older than basically all you are.

Speaker 1:          00:09:19       So most of you, not at all who it reaches a peak there. Then what does the government do? It says, well, we're doing great. We're now very worried. This is the year where they introduced the one child policy. Uh, we want to, uh, this to continue on up so they don't have good demographics, statistics, and they don't know this data. They don't actually know what age people are actually marrying at. So they have an official age which was actually above this and they, they they, I'm sorry it was both. They raised that age to prevent more marriages. But since people were below that, uh, what happened was, let's say I'm getting this backwards. They anyway, the result of a, of a policy, they had the opposite result that result of instituting new policy and tended to raise marriage age, reduced marriage age said. And then you see when they introduced the one child policy, the mean age of marriage goes down, it goes down quite significantly.

Speaker 1:          00:10:21       So the one child policy saying you have, should have fewer children is working oppositely two new policy that actually reduces the age at marriage and increases the span. And the result is this is the number of new marriages of first marriages and there's a rise here. Then it's kind of dipsy doodles. And then just in time for the one child policy, the number of new marriages goes crazy and this big rise in the number of marriages. And remember 98% of Chinese wind when they get married get pregnant right away. So the next year they have babies. This counteracts basically all of the effect of the one child policy and that's one branch of government making one set of laws, not, not having the data and not know and not being in accord with what another set of government is doing. And in fact, the one child policy, I don't want to leave you with the impression that the one child policy had no effect.

Speaker 1:          00:11:20       Uh, but you have to do different statistics. Remember the total fertility rate takes all the women that are in an age group, whether they're married or not, and asked how many children they're having. Well, when you have a big change in the fraction of women married, then you have to do use a different statistic. And when you change, uh, when the age of marriage changes as it didn't in China at that time, you have to now look at a new statistic called the parity progression ratio, which is very much like those triangle graphs that I showed you. This says this black line, uh, is, uh, how many that proceed from having no children to having one child, the fracture of the fraction of women. And this is in the 95% range or something. Basically all the Chinese women at this time when they get married, give birth to their first child.

Speaker 1:          00:12:14       Now the next number is those that already have one child. What fraction of them proceed to have two children? And the answer is before, before this policy, uh, even more than the one that you know, 98% of of women that already have one child, uh, proceed to have a second child. And that may be that in this group are a fairly, are sterile women, are sterile men. And so that may be the difference between here, but we don't have that data. So again, this is very, very high. And then the other numbers, those that have two children, what, how many go to three? Those that have three children, how many go to four or more and so forth. And we don't have data before this, but you can see that the first child is uninterrupted. The one she showered, the later longer, fewer policy. And the one child policy, uh, does not interrupt the first birth that goes on as normal, which is what is expected.

Speaker 1:          00:13:11       But going to a second child now at the time of the introduction of the one child policy, this, this crashes as does later births. And so the one child policy did have an effect, uh, if you look at those who are already married, but the two different policies, one lowering the age of marriage counteracts the effect. And for number of years, the fertility rate stays constant. And we've just had some visitors, oh, let me show you what that was talking about. This is the, the birth rate in China that what's called the total fertility rate. And here's 1970, when the later longer, fewer policy was introduced and it was the decade of the 1970s where the fertility rate in China fell in 1979, 1980 the one child policy is introduced and for about a decade or so, the birth rate does not decrease under that. So we have some guests apparently.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       Okay. So, uh, what was happening was that in the, in the cities, as I mentioned, uh, there was a very significant birth drop in the 60s, even before the government was on then the 70s during lunch Shao the city populations went down to below fertility level. Uh, but in the countrysides, even though there was a big drop in, in the 70s, it wasn't anything like it was in the cities. And as you heard from a chain who, who talked about her family's experience, uh, in the cities, there were many people that worked for the government. And so we're under tight government control. Many of them work in government owned factories or in tight government control. And in general in cities, uh, there is much more ability to control the people. However, at that time, 80% of Chinese people lived in villages. It was still a very rural a country.

Speaker 1:          00:15:08       And they're the store. So the story is different among other things in many villages, all the people that are related, they're all relatives. So, uh, the professor who's got the next lab too, mine is named John and his village. Everybody's, you're young. And they're all related. So if people don't believe, uh, in a policy, they don't want to obey the government and everybody's related, you know, your, your uncle second removed can't really enforce a policy on you if your relative, especially in a, in a culture where kinship means so much. And the relationship between relatives, uh, mean so much. So, uh, the, the, the, the one child policy was much, much less successful, uh, in the countryside. Similarly, the cities were beginning to have access jobs and people were screaming out of the country side also because of population growth, there was no land left. So they're streaming out of the country, countryside going into the cities. They didn't have, uh, uh, legal, uh, living permits. They have, they have a system where you have your document where you live and you have to stay there. And they were not allowed officially to come into the cities, but of course they did. And so the government didn't know where they were and basically had no control over them. And so they, uh, were, were very hard to control. So, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:16:29       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:16:29       even though among, uh, so, and then another thing that happens again just at this time is that previously everybody, the peasants had been in communes. I talked about them last time, you know, several thousand families in one big fan farm, uh, and under again, strict control of the government. Then that with a great leap forward, they realize the commune system has failed and the land goes back to the people. They break up the communes and people get their own plot of land. They don't own it now or sense, but they have the rights to work on that plot of land. Well, they start growing their own food, private markets for food, uh, grow up and the people are not getting everything they need from the government. So if they really oppose some government policy, then they can tell the government by, by, you know, I don't need anything from you. I'm now an independent farmer and I'll do, uh, what I want. And so the change to a market economy, the change to more economic freedom for the individuals led to all kinds of personal freedom and led to the ability to say no to the government.

Speaker 1:          00:17:42       And so you, you at at the time in the press, there are all kinds of examples of what was going on. And uh, for instance, here's one article from 1980. Again, I'm sorry this is too, I'm sorry, the year 2000. So the one child policy has been in effect for 20 years. No one can accuse. WHOA sweet. Far, I'm not knowing what he wanted. The 47 year old farmer dreamed of having a son after seven daughters, he finally got a male heir in 1989 ho named him. Why Fang or change in the weather? And then he stopped having children. So seven daughters and a son. So this, this person, most, almost all of that time must have been under the one child policy, eight, eight children. And he says it wasn't easy to have all these children, but it wasn't hard either. The farmer said if things became tough in our village, if there was a campaign to enforce the rule in their village and trying to has these political campaigns to get people to change their behavior quite routinely at this time, well my wife just went to another township to have the child and but what's the other side of the coin is this one now has a wife and eight children to support and how much land does he have?

Speaker 1:          00:18:58       One third of an Acre for eight, nine, 10, 10 people. This is not a good economic system and exactly why the one child policy was instituted.

Speaker 1:          00:19:11       So an American misconception fed by our presses that China's government is very monolithic. The chairman in pay gang or some bureaucrat, you know, says this is the rule, this is the law of spells it out. Everybody has to obey this law isn't the case Mo, there's whole books now on on, on how China is actually ruled. And the story is that the government almost gives a slogan. So one child policy, or they sometimes call it the only child policy is not a set of rules. It's, it's kind of almost a slogan. Then it goes down to the provinces and each province has to determine it in accord with local conditions as which is the official way of stating it in each province, gives it down to the prefectures and the same thing. It's interpreted by local under local conditions. And then it goes down to the villages where it's completely changed.

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       And so there's no absolutely no uniformity from village to village. And what that result in it, it was the policy was never able to be, uh, uh, uh, consistently put into practice. And the statistics give you the answer to that. The total fertility rate during this initial period of, of enforcement of the one child policy never fell below two. So the policy was one child, but it never fell below two children. Uh, in the rural areas, it never fell below 2.5. There's you saw and a couple of lectures ago, Ching showed you the, uh, the one child certificate where there a couple of promises is just a promise. This isn't, say you've done it and just even to promise that you're only gonna have one child. And uh, uh, less than 20% of married couples ever signed onto even that promise of having one child, which was telling the government, no, we're not going to comply with this policy throughout the 1980s, which again was when the policy was most strictly enforce. Uh, nearly half of all the births were second, third or higher order births. 80% of China's children had brothers or sisters or both. Uh, many had had had both and, and only one fifth of 300. The 300 million children under age 14 were from single child families. And in 1986, again, after the first

Speaker 3:          00:21:37       good question, what do you say? Inconsistent applications? The one child policy or a reflection on the pocket, the one child policy. Never to my understanding then one child, if you're not enough

Speaker 1:          00:21:51       both at this time, initially it was supposed to be one child for all except minority peoples who were very small part of the public. I'll turn minute that they, because of popular resistance, they immediately loosened it up. So the main thing which you're probably referring to a is that rather rather soon, uh, they said peasants, the p the, the city people had already had their fertility drop. Many of them were not very interested in having more than one child who was not a huge issue for you. One of your readings discusses that when the countryside, the peasants still wanted, uh, certainly a son more children. So the policy was changed rather rapidly. So that if you, if your first child is a daughter, you can have, you can have another one and try for a boy. But two is the limit. And of course two was, was not even, that was not always observed.

Speaker 1:          00:22:45       Um, so, uh, so the, remember I told you last time that the goal when the Chinese population crossed a billion or was looked like it was, it was very close to crossing a billion and the government sort of desperately wanted to keep the population below 1.2 billion in the year 2000. They didn't make it. The population was 1.3 billion, they missed by 100 million. And now it's a considerably over over that. And the population is still growing because of population momentum. Again, the age structure of China, China's population is expected to grow by another hundred and 50 million people by 2025. So even though they've worked so hard and suffered so much under these various policies to restrict fertility, they're still going to increase from now from 2008 to 2025 by half the total population of the United States. And again, comparable to a calculation I gave you earlier, uh, Hu Jintao who was president of China, uh, recently, uh, it says the party plans to quadruple economic output per capita in that time. This is before the economic crash that has just happened, but he wanted a quadruple, uh, the per capita income, which would still bring China up only to a low European level perhaps. And so with one, with a, a 1.3 billion population and you're quadrupling it, that's equal to 5.2 billion. And the whole population of the earth is only 6.3. I mean only. So you're talking about China's economic and population growth alone, almost doubling the world's economic activity and therefore something like doubling the economic drain on it.

Speaker 1:          00:24:39       So, uh, China's TFR now, after this period of stability and after the marriage thing got settled, it has drifted down slowly as, uh, almost all of the world has. It's now 1.6. It's still nowhere near one child per family. It's 1.6 now. But that will eventually reduce the size of the Chinese population if it is maintained. But we should keep in mind is this was the Chinese route, uh, to, uh, lower population. And I told, I described to you the popular they started with that was not paying any attention to, to individual desires and fertility. And they brought it down by a strong government policy, good amount of coercion and so forth. But the Chinese populations around other parts of East Asia have lowered their birth rate even more, or I should say they started Laura, they reached an even lower level. So China has 1.6 as I told you, the Chinese population of Singapore is 1.4 children per women.

Speaker 1:          00:25:44       Uh, the Japanese are not Chinese, obviously 1.3 Taiwan 1.1 South Korea again, not Chinese 1.3 Hong Kong 1.0 and Macau 1.0 none of these places were under the one child policy. Actually, I'm not sure about Macau, but all the others are not under the one child policy and they have a lower birth rate than the Chinese policy. And we'll have to discuss in a later lecture why this should be, should be. So we wanted to finish up talking specifically about China, uh, to mention a little bit economic globalization, which you're all aware of. And uh, because of globalization, the u s in China joined at the hip, I mean for the, for our both our economies to succeed, we have to buy a lot of Chinese stuff. They have to buy our bonds, they keep their people employed by shipping us stuff stuff and we send them green paper back.

Speaker 1:          00:26:41       The, the economics of this is quite crazy, uh, altogether because they can never use. What's interesting is they basically can never use the money that we send them, that if they have trillion dollars or so in, in us bonds, and if they ever tried to sell them, the value of the dollar goes to zero and there's, they have to sell them for nothing. Anyway, that's a separate story. It's crazy. A lot of causes or reasons for globalization, number one is shipping costs. The whole idea of the shipping when it went to containers, the cost of shipping something from China to the west coast of America, uh, dropped drastically. Ships carry an awful lot. The water floats in Lacrosse and they just have to, the only energy that's used is to, is to get, get over the friction of the, of the water that they go through.

Speaker 1:          00:27:25       Even many years ago, I was in Bolivia and, uh, discussing with an aid guy, you know, Bolivia is very poor. What can they do? Well, they have the mountains, but then they have a jug, a sloping down to the Amazon where they could grow rice. Very, very good agricultural land. And uh, and you know, why can't they give that to like Lima or to La Paz Lima in Peru where the importing rice. And the problem was that the Chinese can grow it in the Yangtze valley floated down the river to Shanghai, put it on a boat and ship it and deliver it to Kyle Lima's port cheaper than the Bolivians were right next door to Peru can truck it over to the Andes, sorta go up and down and up again and down again. Sorry. And they have to ship it to get to the coast. They have to ship it over to peaks of mountains on lousy roads.

Speaker 1:          00:28:14       And trucking is just very inefficient. So it's cheaper to get the thing from 15,000 miles away up in such one, uh, than to get it next door from the Amazon slopes of Bolivia. So shipping costs is very important. And of course for white collar jobs, telecommunication. Now, you know, we used to say, oh, well let's let the low, the cheap labor manufacturing jobs go to China. But now China and India, uh, we're in immediate contact by telecommunications. So the white collar jobs are going there, the engineering is going to India, the, uh, uh, the accounting is going to India, the call centers have gone to India, other jobs are going, uh, going to China. So this, what happens to population, I think in the longterm view and longterm means 25 or 50 years, we're not talking a thousand years. Probably the one most important thing which will determine the future of the u s economy is what happens to population in China and India.

Speaker 1:          00:29:14       And you could include Indonesia and the rest of Asia, but as long as they have an incredible number of people willing to work for incredibly needing to work for incredibly low wages, we can't compete with them. There is no economic reason why an American, uh, should earn a $40 a day or something. And we got plus benefits and that's a low wage for an American. Whereas you know, a third of China that per capita income is about a dollar a day for the lowest third of China. And that means the worker makes two or $3 a day and there's no way that we can earn without benefits that we can earn 40 or $80 depending on what your calculate and other people in the world earning three. So jobs are going to continue to go to China, not only from the United States, they're leaving Mexico. Uh, I told you the story in Thailand, the jewelry business in Thailand that moved to China, that there's just this vast, vast sea of people who are desperate to work for basically $2 a day.

Speaker 1:          00:30:16       Further thing that happened in the nouns, a few hundred million people floating around the cities. Migrant labor is trying to get jobs and now with the current economic class being thrown out of jobs, but Chinese agriculture is incredibly inefficient as they told you. The average farm size there is, is, is one quarter, uh, no 0.1 acre in, in China. And that's just economically unsustainable. The average farm size in the world is for in Japan, I'm sorry, it's 400 acres, I think. No, I'm sorry. In we're at 400 and a u s and economic us farmers like thousands of acres, a big farm. So we're talking about that eventually China is going to have to compete in the agricultural world on an even footing with the rest of the, which means their farms are going to have to combine and that's already happening. People are voluntarily sort of pooling their land, uh, having big things, enough of the land to make it worth them to buy a tractor and so forth.

Speaker 1:          00:31:11       So this economic, a rationalization of agriculture is, is happening. But think of the numbers there. You have 800 million peasants with uh, with like 1.1 acre each. When you combine it even to a hundred acre farm, which is still a small farm worldwide, that means you combined a thousand farms into one. In the modern world, a thousand a hundred acres can, is probably farm by one or two people. So you go from a thousand families living on 0.1 acre, each, two, maybe two families living on a, on a hundred acres of a combined farm. That means that something like 99% of the population of the countryside has to get jobs somewhere else. So if you have 800 million peasants and I, you know, almost 800 million new people are waiting for these economic changes to come on to the, the modern job market. And so there's a, there's a vast number of people waiting that are now competing with us in every other industrially advanced country and who will continue to wait with us.

Speaker 1:          00:32:21       Uh, the Chinese government is well aware of course of all this stuff. And October last year, uh, previously I don't, you know, they don't really own their land and they still don't, but they did what they call a land reform and the plan allows farmers for the first time to lease or transfer their land use to someone else. Basically the Chinese are now allowed to sell their farm, which will ease. Now they have to have very complicated collective arrangements where everybody is sort of still there. But once you can basically sale or alienate your land in some way, then you can totally leave the land and go into the cities. So the government has started encouraging this kind of push. What they'll do now with the economic collapse. I don't know. Uh, but uh, it's, we have a long way to go before the population issue in China is settled and our fate and all of the developed world depends very much on what happens in China.

Speaker 1:          00:33:23       So just to finish, uh, the Chinese have, have, you know, the achievement of the Cha of, of China is just mind boggling that in, in a half a century they took people from extremely poor country devastated by a over a hundred years of war. And now it's becoming one of the first juror rank countries in the world. And before this all started, no one would have thought this was possible. I mean, if you can read the literature of that time, China was w was hopeless. It was tech to fertility, which you'll see is a very important part of the whole story of economic success. Uh, they're, they're, they're declined. The rapidity of their decline to get a country like China to drop its fertility and 10 years is, is just an amazing, uh, achievement. Um, the judge, just incredible. Now, now we want to get onto this, this next question, uh, of that a student asked last time when I, when I was saying the Chinese, remember the Chinese started this population thing for economic reasons.

Speaker 1:          00:34:33       They said we're are popular, are our economy is going along. We're increasing, like I said, agricultural production, what was it, 2.5% a year, which is very good, but population is growing 2.3% a year. So we're not helping the people. So it was very overtly stated that the, the one child policy was to improve China's economy. They want to improve the standard of living of the people. At the time when they started this policy, the standard of living in China was very low as, I don't have to tell you that uh, health care was, was very, you know, it was certainly better than it had been, but still a very low level education, uh, was not widely available below the very early primary grades in China. So basically as the Chinese perceived at themselves and as they, they, they talked about it quite a bit. Their children are growing up, unhealthy and uneducated.

Speaker 1:          00:35:27       And when the Chinese talk about economic development, it's not only manufacturing more stuff, which they basically are not too interested in. They ship it to America. They were primarily incident, what they called the quality of the people. They thought their population was not of the quality that they wanted. And quality means health and education. They, they wanted that their children were growing up, not healthy and not educated. And they, like everyone in the world realizes that uneducated, sick children, sick adults don't, are not very productive. And Western economists for a long time considered capital as physical capital and your factories and machines that you have. And the idea of human capital is fairly recent and is now come massively into vogue in the west. That one of the most important determinants of the wealth of a country is one country rich and one country poor is not resources is not your physical capital base, but your human capital base.

Speaker 1:          00:36:25       So partly we've learned that from the Chinese, you know, I mean we learned it ourselves, but also the Chinese example is a very good example of this. And just to give you an example of what happens when people don't have education in this particular case, biological education is a story from again, the year 2000 so from not that many years back, this is a firm do, who was a local official in a small village. He said one day there were hundreds of people lined up at the entrance of our village. Oh, I thought it must be a vegetable market or a movie coming in. It turned out to be blood selling. I felt so terrified because there was no sterilization equipment at all. So this village official had some education. He understood about sterilization and he had seen these blood campaigns before. No sterilization villagers just tell the traffickers their blood type if they know it.

Speaker 1:          00:37:24       If not, they make it up. The village is just tell the traffickers their blood type and then lie down on the ground to offer blood. What is the result of this avast aids epidemic in these rural villages that are doing this because they used the same needle to repeatedly take blood from person after person that he's lying up on the ground and they stick one needle, take the blood. Needles are so expensive. The apparatus for collecting it as expensive so they, we use the same needle and of course when you use the same needle from person to person, the odds are if one person gets it, the next ones are going to get it. But actually the transmission rate by blood to blood contact by a needle is something like one in 200 it's not terribly efficient, but what do they do with the blood?

Speaker 1:          00:38:10       They collect blood from everybody. Then instead of keeping it individually, which is expanded, they dump it in to a big that they pool it, they take it to the city, they extract the components that they want, which is the Gamma Globulin, the clotting factor, and a few other components. And then they have a lot of blood left. And what do they do? They go back to the village and reinject the blood, the remaining blood into the people. So now you don't just have a needle stick. You've got pint of someone else of a mixed blood of everyone in the village going into your, your veins. And now for sure, if any, anyone in the village has aids, you're going to be infected with it. Do Continue. The villagers become crazy about selling blood because they are so poor and life is so hard. Uh, many had built their houses by selling blood.

Speaker 1:          00:38:57       Someone, even bribe traffickers to be able to sell more than once a day. The traffickers rooms and giving them back blood because then they'll make more blood. They can sell more blood again. But the people want to sell more than a pint. Uh, in each day. So they kind of lie and fake cause their support. Uh, the officials estimate something like 600,000 HIV cases that's probably nowhere near near correct. The Bud collections, uh, starting in the, uh, in the 90s, was protected by corrupt officials. This was of course against public policy, but it may have infected a million people. This blood selling in Henan province especially, and virtually all of them are poor peasants who sold the blood to make money. So that gives you an idea again, of the status of education, of the population and, and, and why human capital is so very important because you're collecting blood cell. The hospitals which will improve the health was presumably of some people who receive the blood, but not if they get aids. And while you're helping a few people who have transfusions, uh, you're, you're, you're infecting a millions of people, uh, uh, with eight. So you're making things totally worse.

Speaker 1:          00:40:22       Okay. So does cutting your population. So China had the idea and not alone, that if they reduced their population growth rate, their economy will improve. And, uh, is this true or not? Is this true? Uh, most economists at the time, uh, would certainly have said no. Um, the eye that's a mouth through Z and idea that population, uh, that, that economic development is limited by, uh, uh, by population growth. And people had thought to the industrial revolution had sort of gotten rid of them all. First Mothers' was irrelevant marks as I mentioned last time, hated morphous Marxism, totally opposed. And so a lot of the world's opinion was that no population growth was not detrimental to the economy. And in fact, they believe that population growth was good, uh, for an economy because it increased market and everybody wants to increase market, um, that you can do efficiencies of scale and all kinds of reasons.

Speaker 1:          00:41:30       That growing population was considered to be a wonderful thing. Businessmen, especially in the capitalist economies love population growth because the population of the United States runs is now growing at 1% a year, which is less than it had been, had been one and a half percent or so. And the economic growth rate is about 3%. So at my, at best and a very good year, in a good year, it's 3%. So population growth and population growth at 1% or one and a half percent, if you're a total economy is growing at two or 3%, population goes is half the increase in gross national product. And that means it's half of company profits. When you have like General Motors, it was counting every year on population growing and being able to sell more automobiles. So that was, that was basically the idea that the pup, that growth was not, uh, not a bad thing.

Speaker 1:          00:42:23       But in 1958, uh, to, uh, American, uh, demographer economist had a different idea because they looked at the developing countries which had enormous population, uh, uh, enormous population and very high growth rates and they weren't doing so well. So what's with this theory, they should be doing wonderfully. They should be improving tremendously. And they came up with a different understanding of the relationship between population and economics and this based on some very simple economics, uh, that economic development requires investment. If you want to produce something, you've got to build a factory that takes money. Where does that money come from? That comes with someone else? Saving someone, earns some money, might as Labor or by whatever earned some money. He can either spend that right away or he can put it in a bank and then the bank will invested forum where you can put it into stocks or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:43:19       So investment in a country within some kind of economy investment requires savings. One person has to save so that another can spend it as an investment. They borrow that. And um, so that's the key. That's the key idea in everything. Uh, that, that, that follows with Coolen Hoover realized is that if you have, if a family has a lot of children, if all the workers are married and have a lot of children, all of their income goes for food, clothing, shelter to support the children. They can't save any money. If a country has no savings, they don't have any money to invest. They don't make any, uh, economic progress. This had a big political effect. This theory was, and it seems so simple and so obvious, but it apparently they had good empirical sport. They studied, uh, Mexico and then a couple of other countries and showed that this really seem to be, uh, the case.

Speaker 1:          00:44:22       Well, at that time, the third world was the population explosion was happening and they were desperately poor. And so there were two groups. One, uh, conservatives were at that time worried about the cold war. America was locked in the Cold War with communists. And I know China, Russia, but especially Russia was, was our big enemy at the time. And we saw that all these desperately poor countries, the governments were not their current economic and political, so that we're not giving them what they want. They were poor and getting poorer as they, as they perceived it. And they were trying out all kinds of different political solutions, some of which were leftist. So in America, there was a big push by conservatives mayther the anticommunist to do something about the third world to save them from communism. Meanwhile, the liberals were less involved in this us versus them kind of controversy, but they sold these poor people in the world and wanting to help all the poor people.

Speaker 1:          00:45:18       So they thought we should do something about all these poor people. And the answer was economic development, economic development was universally approved, uh, in America. Oh by everyone as either a benevolent act to by someone who considered themselves liberal or by a self saving anticommunist act by someone who considered himself a conservative. Well, once the cool the, the, the, the coal whole Hoover a paper came out and people started realizing the Abi what was considered to be the obvious at that time, it was very clear that family planning programs had to be a part of economic development. That these countries, just these booming populations, and there were televisions is full of stories, especially about India, how it was starving people in India. China was kind of close to us at that time, but India was open. What a desperate situation that was in India and India had quite leftist governments and it was India going to go communist, et Cetera, et cetera.

Speaker 1:          00:46:16       So, so, uh, both sides of the American sort of the whole political spectrum believed in ha economic aid to the developing world and family planning aid. And it turns out that George Bush, the senior, the first George Bush president when he was a congressman who was one of the sponsors of the very first family planning bill, not only for domestic family planning but also for international aid, uh, for family planning. There were, there was, this is not a debatable issue. Everybody agree with it. And it was really due to this economic thesis by, uh, by, uh, by colon Hoover and you, you've read some of Ansley cold stuff already now, however, the economist keep working in the scholars keep

Speaker 2:          00:46:55       going and what I'm looking for, I'm going to get there. Don't tell me I'm not going to get there. Pardon my Greek.

Speaker 1:          00:47:23       All right, here's what I'm looking for. Sorry for that. Um, so what they did is they looked across nationally and tried to figure out, is it really true that uh, population growth rate would affect GDP, the growth of gross domestic product per capita. It's basically per capita income. And what did they find when they got all the countries they could find in the world? Here's the growth rate and here's a per capita economic growth. And what's the pattern? Zero. There is no pattern here. So it looks like that this was meaningless. That in fact the coal, the coal Hoover hypothesis was wrong, however nice the theory seemed, uh, you just couldn't get empirical evidence for it. And that was terribly important. Uh, again, again, a reversal. Now Reagan administration comes in and on the basis of information like that says, uh, economic, uh, population control is no benefit to, to an economy's growth.

Speaker 1:          00:48:30       And we as conservatives are opposed to government intervention in the private lives of people. So we're opposed to, we're not going to give out the anywhere near the level of, of family planning aid that we used to in the United States. Went from a big leader in funding family planning programs in the restaurants are trying to discourage it. We didn't drop to zero. There were still some programs that we've funded and they were very good by aid. Uh, but we were the main discourager in the world. We didn't like this whole idea. And what, what came up as an in opposition to this. Uh, and there was a big world congress about population and development in Bucharest, Romania at the time. And the kind of data that came out in this period is they, um, sorry, they came out with the idea that the way to get that it is good to have fertility down for a lot of reasons, but the way to do it that the causality, the cool, the coal Hoover causality is a reduction in population growth will lead to economic development because the idea of the reverse causality, not an increase in economic development will lead to a decrease in, uh, in, uh, in fertility.

Speaker 1:          00:49:48       So the, the, the, the slogan that came out of this, um, this, this Bucharest meeting of all the world leaders is that development was the best contraceptive that if you wonder lower birth rates, what you had to focus on was, uh, was economic development and that became the map mantra for the world. And the developing countries have bought into that. And it was very in sync as just at that time, Romania, the host of this thing was having the big, the most extreme family planning program ever, but in the opposite direction. They, at that time there, it was a Soviet bloc country that was doing poorly economically. Their birth rate was very low. Their mechanism of birth control was abortion. Four out of five pregnancies were terminated by abortions in, in Romania. For every one childbirth there was four abortions, Romania for not, not tracking, I'm going to put for nationalist reasons.

Speaker 1:          00:50:45       They wanted a bigger, stronger Romania. So they clamp down tremendously. They abortion, clearly de legalized, you couldn't get contraceptives anymore. And the end result was that, uh, the birth rate temporarily fell, but then the women establish networks of illegal abortion and gradually, uh, the birth rate rose, the birthrate rose because they didn't have any, any means, but it's, but very rapidly, within a year or two, they established, uh, illegal abortion networks and the birth rate came down and it never came down to its original level. And there's actually a fairly big total effect of their policy. But it was just the, the political, uh, chicanery going on that, that here Ceausescu who's running, running Romania as a very strong communist dictator who is doing a very strong pro natalist family pop policy. And but saying, no, uh, the opposite won't work. You have to go through economic development.

Speaker 1:          00:51:43       Okay. So, uh, but then the con then people went to work on that theory and here's the data that in this period of time, these are the countries with slow economic growth and their population growth rate was about 2.6%. And here's the ones with fast economic growth rate and they're popular affect Ferret, fast economic growth. And they're the same in terms of population growth. Here's you look some years later and you have the same story. Those were slow economic growth. Those with fast economic growth have the same, uh, population growth. So it is not true that development itself acts as, as a contraceptive. Uh, but you look at it, you spin the data at the same data but a differently, you look at those countries which have slow population growth, which are uh, he's, and while it wasn't an or fast population growth with an UC, does that affecting GDP?

Speaker 1:          00:52:40       And you're not seeing a big effect here in this time frame, but you are seeing a big time effect in this timeframe. Now something different is going on that here, those countries is slow. Population growth are increasing economically. Those countries fast population growth are decreasing economically. And the funny thing about this graph, she said, what's the same data? How can you come to opposite conclusions but it's not the same day to spun differently. This is the population growth rate in 65 to 80. And then the economic situation, uh, 25 years later, 15 to 25 years later. So something it looks like from this is, is, is not wildly conclusive data that something about a population growth much later has an effect on your economic growth. And that's what has now been figured out to be exactly the, the, the really important relationship between population growth and economic development.

Speaker 1:          00:53:42       So you've seen this graph many, many times. This is a standard demographic transition where the mortality rate, the death rate falls first, then after some delay, the birth rate falls and your population growth rate is this period when the birth rate is way above the death rate. Another aspect of that, here's the same graph again appear is that if you ask what does the, the share working look like, how many of these people working? You'd have an idea called the dependency ratio, which is your number of workers divided by your number of children and your number of old folks. Well, in developing countries the medical care is bad, so you don't have, you can almost ignore the old folks for, for, for quite a period of time. So basically the workers divided by the number of children. And what happens, uh, during this period is that, uh, as, uh, the, the, the fertility rate falls, what happens is you have a population, we, we've seen the population pyramid for that with a number of workers in the middle and then many more children than workers made a, you know, half again as many children as workers.

Speaker 1:          00:54:59       So each worker has to support like, uh, each person in working age has to support one and a half for two children of children's age. But then you get this fantastic fertility drop as we saw in places like China, where in in 10 years the fertility comes down. And what happened, this is your ball, this is, this is the big population of people sort of age and there's no children coming behind them, right? So kids are born, you have a very high population, kids are born, then all of a sudden the population stops having children basically, you know, drops tremendously. But you still have all the children born. It takes 15, 20 years for them to get into working age. So once you drop your fertility, you see no effect then because you still have to support all those children for the next 15, 20 years.

Speaker 1:          00:55:51       It's only after delay of 15 to 20 years that you have this huge number of people in working ages, very few children behind them. And the ratio of workers to dependence becomes very good. This is the people inside this and the snake, that's a takeoff on another. You are here graph that I showed you the population explosion. Anyway, forget that. So here is, you've seen this for China, but here's for all of East Asia, this be, this is the death rate and the death rate is really basically down by 1970 I've showed you that for Egypt and all around the world that the mortality rate, uh, comes down fast and then it doesn't make an awful lot of progress since then. This is people aging. So this is where we are now about 29. So this stuff is all guessing about the future. But basically since 1970 the death rate has been pretty constant. But the birth rate comes down. This big drop in the 70s. Again, this is all of East Asia, but primarily what you're seeing is China's big drop in the death rate. And so population growth narrows, narrows, narrows down to almost nothing. And presumably in the near future, uh, the, the death rate will climb above of the birth rate.

Speaker 1:          00:57:05       So in looking at age structure, this is a kind of a complicated graph of they're very cute. So this is sub Saharan Africa as as a comparison, this is the opposite situation. So here this is like a piece of a pyramid. This is your age group here you have very few old people here. You have in 1950, this stripe is for the year 1950, very few oldsters. This is your working age population in here, say from 20 to 60 or whatever numbers you want to put. And there's more children in any age group than any of them. You've seen the population per like that. Now as time goes on in a place like sub Saharan Africa, that does not go through fertility transition is that this shape have more children than also just continues. 1975, 2000 2025, he began to see they, they hope again, this is where we're, we're at now.

Speaker 1:          00:57:56       This is all guessing about the future. So up to now that shape have more children. Oh No, no, not doing it to me again. That shape have more children. Uh, down here, change stays unchanged. You're just the whole population. It gets bigger. It seemed that. Now contrast that to know it's working again, contrast that to East Asia, which in 1950 had what looks like sub Saharan Africa has, you know, many more children than people in working ages. And again, very few real old folk. And then time goes on. But then you start seeing funny things happen where, Oh, come on. Anyway, up there, follow the, the, so anywhere between 1975 and 2002, the left and you see now the number of children's starts dipping and up at the top it dips a lot. And the bulge of, of, of children becomes a bulge in the working ages. So when they have a lot of people in working agents, very few, uh, uh, children, no oldsters yet.

Speaker 1:          00:59:02       So the word you don't have anybody that you have to support. And what happens is you calculate this dependency ratio. This is the number of working age people to non working age. And look what happens in each east Asia. Uh, here's, here's the, the, the, the, the, the, the fertility decline is as soon as 10 years have passed, boom, boom, boom, boom. The ratio gets to be wonderful. And again, we're at this level, we're somewhere near the peak. This rest of this is guesswork off to the right of that line. So the dependency ratio just gets better and better for East Asia. And this has tremendous, this is what has tremendous economic consequences here is, is the difference in the economic growth per per year over. Now this is a 35 year timespan suite. We're not looking at, a single year is tremendously bigger than a place like Africa, which has not reduced its fertility.

Speaker 1:          01:00:02       And we say this is based a lot on savings and this you'll, you'll have a reading about this, which you won't like cause it's somewhat complicated economics. But uh, look at the savings rate in East Asia. It goes from 1955 before way before any of this, 14% to 35%. It goes up like a factor of two and a half or three tremendous saving and investment. Then since you're saving, you can have a, an incredible increase in investment which builds up your country economically. Now the catch and this, that savings equals investment, you can also borrow money from abroad. And so that's what they call the current account balance. How much money you can attract from broad to to get developed. And we in the West believe that it was western capital that went into China, loud them to build up and did wonderful things. But no, it was never huge.

Speaker 1:          01:00:57       This is a 4.8, uh, less than 5% was the current. Again, that's, that's a minus sign in front of it. That's what they're importing. But very rapidly. By 1980, uh, they start to be a net capital exporter that these poor countries have an excess of capital and they now export. Uh, so, so the development of China in particular East Asia in general is not as you would think, a result of west infusion of western capital. I mean, some of the early special cases, Hong Kong and so forth clearly were, but the main part of China, they produce their own capital because they're the, the sequence of causality is fertility decline. You wait 15, 20 years, all those kids grow up, there's not behind them. They all become workers. You start, you don't have children to support. You start saving those savings become investment and you become one of the economic miracles are one of the Tigers of the world now.

Speaker 1:          01:01:56       Until recently, this theory is about 10 or 15 years. We've gradually becoming to understand this idea about the economics and it was thought to have something special about Asia that yes, this was important, but also the culture of Asia, the, their, their propensity to saving. Oh, let me see. Go back up here. If I can find that saving number. Um, well the savings were it when China was poured the savings, we're not fabulous. They are fabulous now, but they weren't then that's a result of being rich. Um, so we thought there's something special about East Asia and China in particular. It's something cultural, something cultural and that when you did the econometrics, you had to say you have to have one set of prime. You can use the same model. We have one set of parameters for, for uh, Asia and a completely different set for Africa and another set for Europe.

Speaker 1:          01:02:49       When you don't consider the demographic a situation, once you put in the demographic situation, we now know that the same model fits around the world. And it looks like that this dependency burden is the key thing. And one of the things that first clued us into this was Ireland. So Ireland, which is totally different culture than in China had this, you know, totally Catholic and they really believed it. They used Catholicism as, as fighting as a mode of fighting the British. And so at a very high birth rate, and they didn't have legal contraception in 1980 the government legalize contraception, here's the birth rate, just takes the drive and then after a little blip continues downward. So again, it's a government action of legalizing contraception and the Irish birth rate drops. The death rate again is slowly going down and then sort of not really going anywhere in this period.

Speaker 1:          01:03:41       And so the population growth rate decreases. And again, this is the same thing. You get the same effect. The Irelands population looks like China's smaller scale. It's not anywhere near as big, but again, you have an underdeveloped country looking thing. It was a lot more children than middle than workers are old people. And then this continues going up until you start getting this declining. Now in this modern period, currently, there's a lot more workers in there are either children or old people. So the dependency burden looks real good. This is the graph of that. The, the, the purple curve on the bottom is sub Saharan Africa, which again, just consider what's up to the line because everything else is guesswork. And look here. Uh, the black is east Asia and the green is Ireland. Looks very, very similar. And guess what the result is? Uh, here's where they legalized birth control.

Speaker 1:          01:04:37       Boom, the economic growth rate just Boone's write up 10 or so years later. And now comparing, starting to compare this to India, here is uh, um, China's growth per capita. It started in 1960. China was poorer than India by a good bit. This is per capita income. The red is trying to, blue is India, 1960, they're poor in 1970, they per 1980, there poor once she shower, the, the, the later longer few of the fertility drop is in, is in this period and it starts going and then China takes off and exceeds, uh, India and is not due to the communist government or a good government and cause the, the, the, the kindness revolution is, is way out here. And, and you know, for a long time it was not doing any better than India. But the main event that happened then is the drop in fertility.

Speaker 1:          01:05:34       And this shows you the difference in China's fertility and India's fertility that hears this Chinese drop starting in 1970s and India slowly catching up, but it's taking its time about it. And this is the, uh, the dependency burden here again, the ratio of workers, uh, to, to non-workers very, really improving in China, not going anywhere particular in India. And when you compare it to sub Saharan Africa again, so we're comparing different parts of the world to show you the story just is the same. This is the birth rate, the black and the and the death rate. So a huge and continuing population growth rate. Again, up to the line. This is guesswork out here. Uh, and here is again, you seen this before. This is China's uh, east, I'm sorry, East Asia's a dependency ratio. Workers to children. This is Africa's a huge difference going on and they live in, this is a situation.

Speaker 1:          01:06:43       So in sub Saharan Africa, the working age population has gone up 2.6%. And even if you can keep all those people employed, when the dependent population goes up 2.7%, you're not making any, any progress where it's an East Asia, still a significant dependent population. They haven't stopped having children altogether, but the working age population is growing half again as fast as the dependent population. That difference is what one makes you rich and to makes you be rich enough to save and invest and develop your country. And you've gotten seen, seen this graph, the difference between East Asia and Africa. All right. Um, that, uh, is the main idea that I wanted to get me. I have to, by the way, on your schedule. This lecture was supposed to be given by David Bloom who's a professor at Harvard and one of the guys who did a lot of this work, uh, he wasn't able to come.

Speaker 1:          01:07:43       So I use this. He came in the last time I gave this class and I use a lot of the slides or are David blooms slides and uh, he's responsible for a fair chunk of, of this work. So, um, all right. So the end of this story is that, again, we talked about when I, long time ago when I described Algeria has how hard, how, how much Algeria has gotten their fertility down, but their population is still and they haven't been able to take advantage of reduction in fertility. The same thing happens with these dependency burden issues because you first have a lot more children than workers. Then you stop having children and that bulge grows and you get a lot more workers than children. But then those workers start to age as the population decreases labels out. So now you have the reverse situation of a small number of workers in a large number of old people always independence burned.

Speaker 1:          01:08:46       You should add children and old people. Uh, and as, as your, as your fertility goes down, your number of children goes down, your number of oldsters goes up. So it's not as bad. It's not as extreme a change as possible. But this would seem to incall call. This is called the, uh, the demographic dividend or the demographic bonus. Uh, this, this phenomenon. But it's a terminate. There's a, there's a time period when you can make great economic progress and then your people get old. And a lot of people leave. Japan is in that situation right now. There they have a very low birth rate and the number of old people is rising. And whereas in the past, old people cost almost nothing because just a little bit of food, they didn't eat much. But now with medical costs, old people require lots of money. And in the past children were expensive.

Speaker 1:          01:09:37       Old people were cheap. Now it's reversed. The things that children use, clothing comes from China's very cheap food is comparatively cheap around the world. I mean, forget the last half year or something. Uh, so, uh, so children used to be cheap children. Uh, used to be expensive. They're now getting cheaper. Oh, people are getting very expensive. So now the worry is that any country that goes through a slow demographic change and doesn't arrange its economics and its politics to employ the people, cause it doesn't do you any good. If you have a whole lot of workers, if they don't have any jobs, and like Latin America for instance, which is kind of an in between situation was very protectionist or nationalist. And uh, I, I can tell you a story, but you know, Bolivia nextdoor to Peru hadn't had so much conflict with Peru that they didn't want to form a carbon market with Peru and they'd rather buy plastic buckets from Brooklyn and rice from China than they would to trade with their next door neighbor.

Speaker 1:          01:10:38       So the story is that the, the demographic situation seems to be one of the major initiators of these economic miracles that have been happening around the world, but they can't do it by themselves. There has to be the economic and political substructure to employ these people to get, set them to work. And then a country gets rich and when it gets, once it gets rich, it gets the capital that it can keep it going, but you not have enough money to invest and keep going. Even though you may have to spend a lot on your old folks, you may be rich enough to generate the excess wealth to do that. Okay, so next time we'll talk about, uh, economics. Then the family. This has been macroeconomics, how economics works on our whole region wide thing, but what its effect is on a family.
