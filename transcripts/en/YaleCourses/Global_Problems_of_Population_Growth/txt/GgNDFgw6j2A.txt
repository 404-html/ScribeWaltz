Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Now I have, I do, I must tell you that I have very bad news for you. Oh God. She said it has nothing to do with the exams that I've been talking with my economist friends. And what they tell me is that you are inferior goods and they even tell me that Yale students are probably among the most inferior of all goods. So of course, you know, put on my naive face and said, what are you talking about? And this is what I learned. So you take, ah, I hope I've learned to bring my

Speaker 2:          00:00:46       yes, good.

Speaker 1:          00:00:51       This is standard economic kind of diagram. And what it shows is the amount of clothing that an individual buys and if they're very poor, they buy at the Salvation Army store and they spend very little bit, or they, they buy very few clothing when they get rich. Oh, they go to Brooks brothers and buy suits for thousand dollars. And that's probably an underestimate of what they actually spend. And so as their income increases, the amount that they spend with a number of things that they buy increases all very standard kind of thing. The ratio, there's an extra little Phillip to this, not wildly important for this course is how much this line increases. Uh, and for a particular change in income is called the elasticity. How, how big a change there is. And in clothing you really don't need an awful lot of clothing had to go on.

Speaker 1:          00:01:52       Uh, so, but you can, you know, spend a lot on it. And I know myself that when I was a graduate student, I used to buy all my clothing at the goodwill store and now that I'm professor of a little more income and they don't buy so much of the goodwill store, but it's still a great place to my things. And I see the other graduate, the graduate students know exactly what I'm talking about. They make, clothing has a big, uh, elasticity, but food down here, you know, you really can't eat that much more food. Uh, you know, we try of course, uh, but we don't succeed. So no matter what your income is, if you, uh, certainly if you measure the food in pounds, uh, you don't eat an awful lot more. If you measured in dollars, you can buy caviar and you know, live on caviar, but basically there can be a high elasticy city or or low Alasta city. Okay, so that's one of the clear clearance. Simple ideas that economics and I'm sure it's nothing new to you now. Can you think, think of a counter example to this? Something that as people get richer, they buy less of

Speaker 3:          00:03:05       what?

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       Spam. Good. Cheap food. What's a, what's a car that's, that's a generation. Go Spam. How many of you have ever eaten spam? You went to prep school or something? I have never eaten spam but Mcdonald's hamburgers. I wonder those kinds of things. And for people in a poor country like rice, what do they go from what?

Speaker 3:          00:03:30       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:03:31       brown rice. Unpolished rice is what the poor people eat or in India, millet. And then when they get more money to go to polish rice and they go to wheat, that in all countries, food is one of the important things that you eat up higher on the food chain. You change what you want to eat depending on your income and you can eat less. Of what you previously did. A lot of public transportation is another example of goods that you buy less of. As you get richer, you take you, you take it. If you get Richard to take a taxi or you have your own limousine and the show forward and so forth if you're really wealthy. So all of these things do the opposite, uh, thing to that. Economists have a word for that kind of a good and it is inferior. Good. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:20       Now what's another example of that you guys that one of the most robust uh, phenomena in the world is this fact that poor people have a lot of kids, rich people have very few kids. This works no matter how you spin it, you can compare a poor country cause I take any sub Saharan Africa country that, that you want to a rich country take any European American, Japanese country that you like. If this is income across countries as they say, cross sectional, uh, this is very, very true. If you look within a country like pick, pick any country, the rich people tend to have fewer children than the poor people. And also you can spin it a third way with time. If you look at when a country was poor, there'll be having a lot of children. And then as they develop economic and the get rich, they have fewer children. So this is an absolutely a robust kind of data. One of them. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:05:27       What have you measured? Valued children by investment per child.

Speaker 1:          00:05:31       Ah, we're going to get to that, that later, that that's at the end of a lot of intermediate stuff. So, but this is the number of children that you get. It's not how much you're spending on them, but the number of children that you have. So you have these three different ways that you can have a high slope, a low slope, and the slope can even turn down. Whoops, whoops. Whoops. This is some real data for, uh, this is, uh, the total fertility rate and going from one or even less up to eight children. And this is the gross domestic product per adult. And this is the log of it, cause it goes over six orders of magnitude. That's some, some bases earn an awful lot. Uh, more so there's not a linear scale but, but a log scale. But over that whole range you can see it's a very good correlation that uh, those countries which have a poor income have lot of children and those that have a lot of income, have few children.

Speaker 1:          00:06:39       And this is two different periods in time. 1960, which is really before the third world fertility transition in 2000 when you're in the middle of the third world fertility transition and you have these points for the 1960, the circles, the pluses for 2000. And you see, there's, what's happened is they've slid down this line. The countries have slid down this line. There's still pretty much the same relationship. Uh, but uh, the country's progressed in, their income grows up. This is the regression line, uh, for this regression line for 1960. This is the regression line for 2000 and small difference. Not, it hasn't changed very much. So again, this is really a very robust, uh, kind of thing. If you compare countries, a 10% increase in per capita income equates to a 13% decrease in fertility. And it's a very interesting thing. You have big cultural differences between countries within a country where you're under more or less, if you have a homogeneous country, more or less the same culture, the, the freedom of people to change their for chill, to control, to choose their fertility as much more limited within a culture. So now if you look only within a country, you get a much smaller change, a 10% increase in income correlates with only a 1% change in fertility. So it depends exactly how you run your statistics, how big an effect this is. But it's absolutely robust. Uh, we always find it.

Speaker 1:          00:08:18       So here's a, here's a great term paper for you, or even a research paper for the summer or something. So it's usually this respect to the Yale students. It's usually presuming that the families of the ELL students generally have a very good income, probably even within, I mean, we yell, tries to get a distribution of incomes, but within each class we probably do very well. So we're a high income group and it's probably also true that we generally have very few children, that your family's probably each have very few children. So you can take a ratio of a family income to number of children and that ratio for different groups. It's probably a measure of how you are, right? The higher the ratio income to number of children, uh, uh, tells you how much parents don't want children because they have a lot of income. And guess who has this data?

Speaker 1:          00:09:10       Where have you filled in this data admissions office? If you're applying for a scholarship, which I think at least three quarters of you apparently do some sort of financial aid, uh, they have income data on your family and they also have the number of siblings in your family. All that is data that they have. So if you can get it out of admissions, you could really do some very interesting study of what is that ratio for Yale students. And then once it's published from yell, everybody, every other school in the country is going to try to do it. And it'll do for different works. I haven't seen these kinds of things published that this ratio for various special socioeconomic groups. Okay. So this is kind of a surprising, uh, uh, phenomenon, uh, that, that, that, that rich people buy have fewer children. And one year I taught this course and there was a guy in it, somewhat older guy who was actually already a professor in Kenya, but he'd come to Yale for more education.

Speaker 1:          00:10:12       They took this course and after the course he told me that he was just blown away, that he had never realized coming from Ken that that poor people had more children than rich people actually put it the other way. He had no idea that, that one of the aspects of being rich was that you have fewer, fewer children using it. A college professor, a university professor in, in, in, in Kenya. So this is quite, uh, actually quite shocking. Um, you heard, I mean, a whole cultural story is that parents love children. Parents want children while they want them. Maybe they love them. Uh, well not when they're teenagers of course. Uh, and so you'd expect that more income would be an an an enabling factor, very big enabling factor that you in general have more children. But it isn't the case. Well this is anomalous.

Speaker 1:          00:11:01       Things are of great interest to scientists including social scientists. And so economists of course paid a good amount of attention to this. And the way they talk about children is that they tried to general just the way scientists try to generalize things, make Newton's laws, applies to everything. Whereas before there were a lot of different things. So they tried to use the same words they use for suits, who food for children. And the kinds of things they say are that children are a time intensive commodity. They take a lot of, a lot of time to, to either enjoy or bring up, uh, properly. Uh, women's value of time is a key component in the price of children that children have a price like any other, uh, good, uh, the time this, this all quotes out of recent articles, the time cost of children and other household production children are one of the things that households produce.

Speaker 1:          00:12:02       Then they talked about the opportunity costs for households to produce and consume a child. I loved the idea that, well, what parents are doing is consuming you and I will put on the web, uh, uh, an article by Jonathan Swift, you know, the same guy who did Gulliver's travels, you know, this article Amato's proposal. Exactly. And what he, and this is tongue in cheek in his part, but at that time and much earlier, much later, the English were concerned about the Irish problem. There are shoe, very poor. They had tons of kids and they didn't like to be ruled by England. Uh, so the, the Irish problem had to be solved in what swift's suggested was that the Irish eat their children and what this would do, provide good food for them, a lot of the protein and everything, so it would solve their starvation problem and reduce, uh, the population problem there. So of course this was tongue in cheek, but it makes really interesting reading and especially his notice his use of, if you, if you bothered to read it, it's not, not required. It's use of numbers. It's full of numbers. It's a real takeoff on what fairly contemporary. And he has people like the people starting to write a co economics. Uh, we're writing.

Speaker 1:          00:13:18       Okay. Uh, so this idea that economics deals with children just as they do with any other commodity. It's, it's, it's the gene, it's the genius of economics to be able to do that just as the genius of science to be able to make journalism. But it's also one of the reasons people reject the approach. They just, people generally don't want to consider themselves a commodities. So why should people want fewer children as, as they get richer? Well, the basis of essentially all modern economics is rational actor theory, uh, that people act to maximize their happiness or utility or preferences. There's a lot of different jargon words with slightly different meanings and they don't act against their self interests. Now there's new psychological economics or neuroeconomics, which finds out this isn't really true, but that doesn't matter. Most theory depends on rational actor theory. And so they'd be kind of believe that people decide what to do based on a calculation.

Speaker 1:          00:14:21       It doesn't necessarily have to be a conscious calculation which little problem there of what's good for them and they act that way. So somehow economists have to figure out why is it good for people who have money to have fewer children, what is in their self interest? And actually, uh, a guy wrote a paper, uh, Gary Becker in 1960 and then he got a Nobel prize for this, for bringing family when they go family economics into the mainstream of economics and treating children like any other good. And some of what I'm going to tell you, it really comes from, from Becker's theory. So, uh, as I mentioned, one of the fundamental ideas is that it costs money to rear children. And so they can be considered an item to be purchased. And so they call them a good, anything that you purchased. This is called a good.

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       So children are, there's different kinds of goods and children are all of them, or at least most of them. One, there are production good like a machine. And production good is something like you buy a machine for factory to do work. And children, of course, especially in poor settings, do various kinds of work. We'll come back to each of these things. Their consumption, good consumption good is something you buy and maybe eventually use up. But you enjoy it. You buy it because you get pleasure in some sense out of having that, not because it does work for you. And the third thing is they can be an investment. Good that you put money into a child when they're young and then when they're older you get something back for the return. Just like putting money in a bond, you put it in and then you wait some time and you get, uh, presumably more back.

Speaker 1:          00:16:09       So first consider a children as a production good, which is very largely the case in, in poor countries. Uh, uh, one thing that's pretty obvious as a child does not cost much to make. It's pretty cheap. Uh, and in a peasant family, children do a lot of work for the family. They can run errands, they collect firewood, they can fetch water, they take care of younger children, they weed the fields. There's a whole bunch of things that children will do. And you read, you have some readings on that in today's readings, uh, and they actually do a lot of work. Here's a, here's an example of a little bars. The name of the kid can run all over, fetch up cows out of the stock fields or oxen carrying stove wood in climbing the corn crib and feed the hogs and going errands down at his grandma's.

Speaker 1:          00:17:06       Guess where that description comes from? Could be anywhere in the world. It happens to be Kansas settler in the late 18 hundreds. So an American like other places in the farm economy, kids do an awful lot of work. There's a saying from Indonesia that by age seven, a child does more work for the family than the war family has to do for it. So where, so in to study that sociologists, anthropologists and economists actually go out in the field and observe in a peasant societies and the professor or a graduate student, uh, stays with the family or stays very in the same village with the family and always carries around a clipboard of these. And what they do is they write down everything that the parents do for the children and everything that the children do for the parents. [inaudible] mom is cooking. Ah, sister is washing vegetables.

Speaker 1:          00:18:02       Oh, little brother is sent to the neighbors for a bit of cooking oil. Oh baby. Just defecated. Yup. Mom. MOM stops cooking to clean up the baby, etc. Etc. You can imagine all this down on a clipboard. That's when a child is young. Uh, the family puts a lot of work into the child. As the child gets older, they require less and less from the family and they start doing more work for the family. And so economists count, you can calculate or anthropologists, anybody can calculate a crossover age. What is the age at which children do more work for the family measured saying ours. Then the family does work, uh, for the children. Uh, it's no longer quite as young as the seven that the Indonesians talked about, but modern calculations showed something like at age 13, children are doing more work in an agrarian society.

Speaker 1:          00:18:57       Children doing more work for the family, then the family puts in to them. In your reading packet is a story about ton of mom, ton of mine money, uh, from Malaysia and every year students don't. Why did, it's a wonderful story. Your love, why did, why did I put that in? And of course it's child labor. It shows you what, how exactly a little bit unusual instance, but how children are viewed is not romantic at all. It's a straight economic calculation. You maximize the amount of work that you get out of the child. Jonathan swift and thinks mentions age six as the age when children can begin earning money as pickpockets and David Copperfield was sent to work apparently at the age of 10 and Charles Dickens himself went to work at the age of 12. Currently calculations from the uh, United Nations International Labor Organization shows that there's something like 250 million children each five to 14 that are employed in half of these children employed full time, not as casual laborers but as full time.

Speaker 1:          00:20:03       And this estimate, this is not a decreasing phenomenon, but, uh, this estimate is up from earlier ones of 73 million children. So from 73 to a 250 million child labor is apparently increasing quite significantly in the world. So an agrarian societies just from the work that children do, children can be an economic benefit. And so people want a lot, a lot of them to work around the farm. And even in the early stages of industrialization, children are often sent, uh, into earning work or they earn cash. And, and in real poverty situations in industrially developing countries, even the small wages of children can make us sort of life and death, life and death difference in the survival of the family. But notice that this all changes. Now when modernization comes in, uh, one thing to have the children go to school and if they go to school, they have fewer hours to work at home.

Speaker 1:          00:21:06       So their costs there, their benefits goes down. Money has to be provided for tuition, for books, for clothing or uniforms for shoes. Children on the farm often don't have shoes, but when they go into the city to be proper, they usually have to have shoes. So their costs go up, their benefit goes down, their costs goes up. Another aspect of monetization medicine becomes available now for child gets sick, the parents have to spend money on doctors are on medicine or they perceive that they have to do such a thing if, if the families in the city and previously, and it gets to be a lot of children working, but they're also a lot of adults out of work. The government eventually puts in child labor laws and says children can't work and it makes it illegal and therefore you can, children can't work at all their benefit.

Speaker 1:          00:22:00       It goes down. So all of these things act to reduce the value of children as production goods. They're just not as good a production good as they used to be. Now considered children as a consumption. Good. Again, that's the pleasure that uh, or fulfillment that parents get out of having children. Uh, one article I read talks about children as a consumer durable. That's cause they last a long time and they're like refrigerators. They last a won't do either. A durable good and you see the reports every month or what, how do, how many more of less Stewart durable goods are being bought. Um, so it's very incent codes. The purchase of durable goods you don't usually pay cash for that. They go into credit card and an easy payment plan, uh, for later payment. And it's the same for children. They don't cost anything, they don't cost much to make and the costs come later.

Speaker 1:          00:23:02       I'm thinking of the child is kind of like a house if you poor, uh, or you can or could. And until the recent debacle by House with no money down, you don't have any, any money and you get a mortgage and it's later on after having the house that you have to every year pay off the mortgage, you've got to maintain the house insurance for the house taxes for the houses that the upfront cost is very small, uh, later. And as you know, a lot of people, uh, enjoy shopping very much. And then once they choose, they said, this is what I want. They go to get to get a big bang out of the actual purchase. And uh, making children is very similar. Uh, people enjoy the foreplay and then they get a big bang.

Speaker 1:          00:23:48       Well that didn't work very well. Okay, so another aspect finally. Got It. Uh, another aspect of this is children as consumption of goods. And this has to do with modernization is that you can't consider good separately one from the other. People have a certain amount of money and what they buy will depend not only on the cost of each individual good, but on their relative costs. And so what happens when a country modernizes the respect of children's at the cost of children is perceived to go up, that you education, health, all these, all these clothing, all of these costs go up in inexorably where at the same time the cost of manufactured items goes down or radio player, television, any of the goodies that you spend an awful lot of time with, as time goes on, technology improves. The cost of those goes down. So modernization increases not only the absolute cost of children, but more, even more intensely the relative costs causes their costs go up, costs of other things that people want a go down. So, uh, that's another cause why people might want fewer children as time goes on.

Speaker 1:          00:25:13       Another aspect is the time cost of children. An important idea is that people have not only in limited income, which they can spend as they choose, but also limit amount of time. And we all use the phrase of spend their time and economists take that as a serious issue and they think that time is spent in a rational manner. Time can be used for, for leisure time can be used, uh, for parenting or if the person works, time can be money, it can be used to work and earn money and each person has to balance where each family has to balance these things.

Speaker 1:          00:25:49       Most of the time, and I'll show you some data on this, required for child rearing is spent by the mother. In fact, almost exclusively in most societies, the mother does all basically all the work. Um, in the peasant society, the mother does all the housework, everything at home is jointly done by the mother. And this time is not valued at all. Mostly in peasant cultures. Women's work at home doesn't count. She may do the, she and the children may go out into the field to do an awful lot of work, weeding and everything. And also again, culturally this usually just doesn't count. So women's time is not particularly valued in traditional societies. And in traditional time she can't get a job, so she's not going to be able to get there, just no jobs available for her. But then modernization comes in and jobs available in the cash economy and cashews, what people value.

Speaker 1:          00:26:46       Cash in an agrarian society is so rare, so difficult to come by that that's what, what is really a valued jobs become available and in many de industrializing situations, you know, and especially in the third world now the first jobs that become available are low skill jobs like sewing that almost every country that enters into the modern war has started. It's in code industrial revolution by selling jobs in factories, Bangladesh, Indonesia, all over the world. Sewing is the first kind of thing. And this is largely women's job and you see this in China all over the world that some of the earliest jobs in the modern sector are for women assembly. You look at a of pictures of assembly lines and almost saying electronic goods, who's doing the assembly? Very largely, uh, women are doing it. Um, so the once job opportunities become available, then you start, you set up a competition between child bearing and working childbearing.

Speaker 1:          00:27:49       The woman is at home, she can't be out in the city working and her time is spent taking care of the children and therefore she doesn't earn an income or she can have fewer children or no children and go to work and earn income. So monitor what happens is the opportunity cost to women, which was considered essentially zero in traditional times, starts rising as jobs become available for women, the opportunity cost of having children rises. So that's another thing that is modernization, uh, proceeds. You might expect that families want fewer children as modernization, perceived people get richer and all of these effects might really not be due to the income, but just time going on, uh, in the way that I've been been talking about the changes that modernization brings. Now the third kind of thing we have to consider, uh, for children is to consider them as an investment.

Speaker 1:          00:28:50       Good. That means you pay now you get a return later. And of course the value of children doesn't stop once they grow up. If the culture has strong families, and that's a very important, if then the children when they grow up will perceive that they have a responsibility toward the parents and that they have responsibilities to support the parents in old age reason before old age. It's interesting to note that if there's no stock market in a country or banks and poor people really don't have access to these things in most places, at the earliest stage of industrious, there's nothing else for people to invest in. There's just no market for things. There's no market for their savings. Uh, because rats and insects eat up an awful lot of food, you can't really store the food. So, uh, basically the, oh, almost the only mode of investment is in children.

Speaker 1:          00:29:46       So children are indeed in a, in premodern society is very much an investment. Good. And uh, this is brought home, I mean, I read a lot about this, but the experience of it in a developing country, it's very interesting to hear. So we had a graduate student, he was from India and he was from an upper class family. Uh, and uh, that his family had only a few children and all his relatives, this whole class, the people he really knew I had already done their fertility transition, had very few children, but he was a good hearted soul and uh, wanted to um, help, uh, uh, poor people. So, um, he worked before he came to Yale, he worked in an adult literacy program and that's really one of the best things that you can do in this particular program was aimed at the very poorest people who are still illiterate.

Speaker 1:          00:30:42       And in the course they discussed everything cause you need vocabulary, you need to discuss it. So there's a lot of discussion as well as reading. And one of the things they discussed was family planning. In fact, a non had been speaking in class strongly in favor of family planning, trying to convince them that they shouldn't have so many children, that they would be better off with fewer children, which was the experience of his social class. But one day, one of the adults took it on this guy aside to, you know, you were wrong about family planning. I have no money to save for retirement. There's no social security. The government won't care for me in old age. I need a son to care for me in old age. I have 10 children. If even one of them survives and become successful, then I'll be lucky and have a comfortable old age.

Speaker 1:          00:31:34       So that was very nicely put what the, what the man said to a non, uh, but it's also a nice reaction. Was, was also very interesting that uh, even they grew up in India, had never thought of that about that before. He never heard about it. He never thought that he never perceived it from the point of view of a poor pres. And he was very impressed. And, and when he told me this story, uh, what he said, he, he was, he was just a, he was amazed at how compelling the argument was and he couldn't think of anything to say back to the person in support of his previous views.

Speaker 1:          00:32:10       Uh, so again of the very, for the very poorest people about the only strategy they have for old age is to have children to take care of them. And in most cultures that means a son who will take care of them. Kids cost very little in a poverty stricken uh, culture. Uh, they uh, they, they, they were a hand me down clothes that they don't have a toys or lots of any, anything like that. They get basically no school or medical care. Uh, the kind of food that poor people eat is fairly cheap and interesting in terms of time beyond the first child. Uh, if you have the first Saint John, as soon as they get up to be five, six, seven, they start taking care of the younger children. So the time burden on the mother sort of goes away once you have somewhat older children and older means like five, they can start scrapping the baby on their back and going around with the baby so that extra children are not, don't even cost much time off for the parents, they cost very little money. You already have all the hand me down things. So it's just a subsistence amount of, of cheap food that the child needs. So it's, it's uh, it's, it's, uh, children are very small cost and their benefit as old age insurance is perceived to be quite, quite great.

Speaker 1:          00:33:30       Okay. But what happens, uh, as, as modernization. So parents are basically willing, poor parents who are willing to invest a little bit that they have a little bit, uh, that's needed in a lot of children. How does modernization affect this investment? If jobs start to be available on the cities and, or possibilities open up for migration abroad to jobs? All the people from India and Pakistan that go to the Middle East to work in oil related jobs as the rich economies. There are people that come to America to find jobs. They all sent back. Remittances, at least the first generation is very, very good about sending back remittances, which is a huge fraction of, of poor people's income. And even though the remittances may not be a huge fraction of what they're earning in America or in Saudi Arabia, uh, in terms of the income that they're parents are living on poverty stricken, it can be a very, very big increment, uh, to their income.

Speaker 1:          00:34:31       And so children can be really good investment if they can get up, get a job in the city or get a job, uh, abroad. They are really good investment and that's modernization increases everything else. It decreases the value of children. But modernization increases their value of this aspect of their value as an investment. Several other things happen during modernization that increased the value, uh, investment. First of all, child mortality, the first thing in the demographic transition are usually the first thing that happens is of quite severe drop in infant mortality. And what that means is children now likely to grow up that previously children died very young or died, uh, various times, uh, in their, their young ages. And if something is going to disappear, like if somebody is going to get stolen from you, you know, you don't try to buy a really fancy car.

Speaker 1:          00:35:26       If you're pretty sure it's going to get stolen. And it's the same thing with children. If the odds are very high that your children are going to die, it's really not. And if the modern medicine isn't available, it's not really a good idea to put a lot of investment into a child, uh, that's going to, you're going to die. But as monitorization some ideas of sanitation, public health come into play, and the expectation that children will live increases, then there's a longer period for them to live and return income, uh, to the parents. The other side of the coin is, is pretty much the same. The parents are living longer. So, uh, in the old style of fertility, married people just kept having children until they became a sterile at 45 or something like that. And then at the old life expectancy, they didn't have much longer to live.

Speaker 1:          00:36:18       So, and they were still capable of working at 40, 45, and then they, and they die. So, uh, even if they have children that stay alive, there's not a long period of dependency where they'll get income from their children. So if you have your last child, it's a 40 or 45, uh, uh, then they're going to reach maturity when you're 60 or over something almost 60. And that's, uh, at or above the, the life expectancy in very poor countries. So the, the increased longevity of both children and parents, uh, make it a much better deal to have children as an investment. Good. Because as longer time they can pay you and you're going to be around for longer time to get this. So as opposed to the other ways that, that children are looked at economically as an investment, good. A modernization can massively increase the value of children. So that would be, so we have counter balancing. If people have more money as modernization goes on, you think they could afford more children, but they become less good as consumption goods. They become less good as production goods, but they come much better as investment goods. And of course as people have more money, they have more money that they can save. And one of the ways they save it is by investing in the children.

Speaker 1:          00:37:44       So one of the issues then is, okay, if, if the value of children is now mostly as an investment, good. How do you maximize, uh, this investment in agrarian societies? They're really no opportunities outside farming. That's, that's what the society does, period. We're done. If in indeed the agriculture is traditional, you're doing it exactly the way your grandfather did it and his grandfather did it. And that's a very safe way to farm because you're, you're, you're on the edge of thrive. The Vir crop doesn't grow, you're in big trouble. So if you try something new, there's always a danger that it might not work. If you do something the way it's been done for hundreds of years or thousands of years, or you perceive as thousands of years in your family, on your land, you're pretty sure that it's going to work. You may not get an awful lot out of it, but assure you it's going to work.

Speaker 1:          00:38:39       So peasants are very conservative, not only about their, their production, their agricultural production, but everything else in their life because they don't have any, anything extra to gamble, gamble with. So they're not going to take on anything new. And the old way of doing it, father passes it off to Sun. Exactly has been doing it. You don't need an education to do farming in a traditional kind of way. You learn it while doing, uh, with your father. Um, so, but when education gets modernize, when, uh, when agriculture gets modernized, there's fertilizers, there's new varieties of seeds. You have to pay attention to money. And when you enter into the market economy, you have to have some mathematical abilities to know about money. You may have to borrow money. This interest rates, this payback schedules, there's all kinds of things. So that education starts becoming very valuable even in agriculture.

Speaker 1:          00:39:36       And so early on, the combination of not needing, uh, education and the propagated that kids will die young invest with, there's really not much benefit in investing in education in an early agricultural society. Uh, so the best strategy at that time is to have a lot of children and put them in a minimal investment, in a minimal investment in each of them and hope that some of them don't die. And that's in fact empirically true that the investment, uh, before the for the demographic transition, the investment that people put into their children, each shore was indeed very small and subsistence carried on the way it always was. But now population increases cause, uh, foreign foods come in, all kinds of things happen and, and population starts increasing. Land become scarce. Now imagine you have a small farm and you yourself are living as a subsistence farmer and you've got a whole bunch of kids and now you're faced with dividing up your land among the kids.

Speaker 1:          00:40:45       Well, you know, the kids aren't going to be able to do it. You can barely do it on your size. Farmers who divided up among two, three or so sons, it just ain't gonna work. So you're in crisis. Uh, and when the kids inherit session, a little bit of land, not only are they going to have big trouble and then I can have any access to provide for you. So children's stopped becoming junior if they stay in the farm economy, stopped becoming any kind of a decent investment, uh, to, uh, to keep you going when you're, when you're getting a little old. So you've got to figure out what, what to do.

Speaker 1:          00:41:23       You're facing the crisis, but the outside economy is modernizing. You may not be modernizing, but the outside economy is modernizing and jobs become available largely jobs that requires some sort of education, white collar jobs. The government jobs are big, huge bureaucracies spring up, I'll mention that a little bit. And uh, parents rather rapidly realized that the only option is for the kids to go to the city and get a job. And, but there's all the parents, everybody reaches that state pretty much the same time. So the cities are just flooded with people coming in looking for the still scarce jobs. How do you have an edge up? It has to be education that the only way you can get these are white collar jobs. Absolutely need an education. In manufacturing jobs, you do better. You have to deal with machinery. You have to know things about the machinery.

Speaker 1:          00:42:19       I was in Peru quite a ways back and they took peasants off the Altiplano. There's high dry playing with there's no water and the land is terrible and they live on about a dollar a day. And in order to get a job in the mines, the first job is you take a shovel and you shove your, you know, there's big machines that eat away at the rock face and, but a lot of it drops down in the, uh, people with shovels to get the rest of it and dump it into the truck. So this is really a minimum skill, labor job. But they needed to have two things, which not everyone had one. To know that machines can be dangerous, that they can get hot from spinning around, that they can be electrified. They do. You don't just touch something unless you know what's going on. And the same thing, you have to know enough about time to get to the job on time.

Speaker 1:          00:43:06       Every day to shift comes on you. You've got to be there and the peasants don't, don't come knowing those sorts of things. And those that do know those things. Can, uh, uh, double their income to like $2 a day if they can get jobs in. So, uh, that's, that's even the most basic kind of job requires a kind of mindset and educational thing that you don't get a generally on a farm. Um, so education becomes an extremely valuable, uh, commodity. And uh, so in order to get the job and to stay live, kids have to be healthy. So you also have to put, you have to put money into education and you have put money into health for the kids. That's the projected to have. If you have a, you can have a bond like your kid, you got to have a safe deposit box for it.

Speaker 1:          00:44:07       That's like health insurance or health care for it and otherwise it's going to disappear on you. So this investment in children, which in education, in health care, uh, uh, becomes a very good deal that if you can manage to invest that much in your child, didn't go to the city or go abroad, get a good job and their income will be so much more than yours, that they can send you back a significant amount. These investments with children called human capital, the result of them is called human capital. It's the health and education of the population. And it's now realized that when the economists study, you know, why is one country rich and one country poor? Well, part of is their physical, their stock of physical capital, physical capital is the factories, the machines, the buildings, all the stuff that you come knock on. But they realize that that's not the biggest difference. The biggest differences. Human cat, what they call human capital, how educated and how healthy, uh, the population is. So it's a very big

Speaker 3:          00:45:12       thing.

Speaker 1:          00:45:14       And so an interesting thing we have to, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:45:19       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:45:21       different factors that are now in play. Why a child becomes a good investment, good one. With education, they can get a higher paying job. And with better health they can live longer and the parents can live longer. So they're paying you back not only at a higher rate if they're educated and healthy, but for a longer time period. So we normally think of the things they, well you get a certain benefit, uh, from uh, their education earning more per, per year and you get a certain benefit from their health. They're living longer and you might be tended to add those too, but in fact they multiply that you're getting a certain extra amount per year over 30 years or something like that. So the two factors multiply and that's one of the really big things in Becker's theory is how these factors that go into the income that a child will bring in the health and the education multiply with each other. And so even fairly small increments in either one, the to a very big, uh, return multiplication is a very large effect. So the end, the end of this, that as an investment, good investment in children's health and education is very rewarding. It's a really rewarding kind of investment in the kind of economic situation that we've been discussing.

Speaker 1:          00:46:46       But here's the catch that if you're poor, you can't make these investments in a whole lot of a lot of children. And so the best strategy, instead of having a lot of children of dividing up your assets among a bunch of them, you have a very few children and you concentrate your assets, your concentrate, what you can invest in a few children and you get them fairly good healthcare and as good an education as you can get for it. Children that have these two things, it's called the quality of the child. Again, that's another economic jargon term that the health and education child are of the quality of the child. And the way this change that goes in the demographic transition is called the switch or the trade off from quantity to quality before the transition. Uh, parents want a lot of children because the main thing they're worried about is the probability that they're just going to die.

Speaker 1:          00:47:45       And there's nothing in the parents can do about that. The local folk medicine is, is almost totally ineffective. So the kids are just going to die kind of randomly. But as time goes on, uh, that's, that's not true anymore. They can do something about it to keep their kids alive and they get the kids educated so that they can earn a good rate of, of, of income. And so they, there's this trade of the switch from wanting quantity to one in quality in the children. And parents catch onto this very quickly. Some of the, the very re rapidity of some of the third world fertility declines has been due to that. Uh, when the land gets filled up, my people, it becomes very obvious right away that you've got to do something. And the only job, the only thing available jobs in the cities, and it's very, they know very well that, that the kids need education to, to compete in that job market.

Speaker 1:          00:48:44       So in terms of policy, you get some really interesting kind of conundrums. So one is education is what the people want. They want it desperately. And yet if they keep having eight children, the country is going to be hopeless. So policymakers like the idea that in order to get an education, people have to reduce their, their fertility, but they also is with good hearts, wanted to make education free. So the question in a developing country of how much to charge for education is, is a very, very major issue because you need to strike a balance between allowing, setting the price low enough so that you can get a lot of your children educated yet setting some price so that it's an incentive to parents to not just absolute flood the system and overwhelmed, uh, everything. And wherever you set this, parents will always use strategies to maximize their, their, their benefit.

Speaker 1:          00:49:44       And one of the kinds of strategies that, that people worry about that parents can do is have the first child stays at home. Second child stays at home entry, that child grows up and starts doing work and then they can do the work around the house that's needed in the weeding the field and the work on the farm. Your third child is now in a sense surplus. You don't need their labor. If there's free education, get them educated, send them to the city. And you can do that. If there's no cost to getting a child educated third, fourth, fifth, sixth, there's no limit to the number of children that you can have. You send them all off to the city, they send you back money. Same with healthcare, that if you have a a welfare government and it doesn't set this just right. If, if, uh, hell, if healthcare is also a free or nearly free, then again, there's no cost to having the extra children. People may continue to have that many children and then the whole system just gets flooded and you have a failed experiment. So education and healthcare are, um,

Speaker 1:          00:50:51       some of the fundamental variables in this, uh, this religion between economic development, jobs becoming available and how many children that you have. And in developing countries, as you know, there's a lot of people, labor is cheap, but capital is scarce. They're not rich. They, they don't have a lot to invest in factories and everything. So it's hard for them to build a steel plant or a petrochemical plant that takes a lot of box in a lot of know how. But what about, uh, producing a teacher? Is that an expensive or cheap proposition? Teaching is labor intensive. It's not capital intensive. You need maybe a chalkboard and some chalk and some places don't even have have that. And so education is being labor intensive is one of the cheap things that countries can do. So basically even the poorest country can have a surplus labor law, largely female and give it a minimal amount of training or you have to do is make them basically literate and they can go out into the villages and teach children to read and to write, which is an amazing progress.

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       And then that bootstraps itself. And if you look at at developing countries, that's one of the things they really invest in is, is his first primary education. And they get a big return from that. They're very, they have the finances to do that. And in fact, almost all developing countries also have a pretty good, uh, university, uh, structure, not a research level university but a teaching university. So if you look at places they're producing doctors, uh, I don't know if you know this, but in America, something like half of all the doctors that get licensed or trained abroad now, some of them, England, Sweden, Germany or you know, train pretty much of the way we are, but they're coming in from India, Pakistan, Philippines, places like that. And the people just as smart as anywhere else there, there may be work harder, more and more ambitious.

Speaker 1:          00:52:49       Maybe it's harder even to get an to get into, but they can train thousands and thousands of doctors and you know, a medical school class in Mexico City will be like 3000 students or something. The law classes are all very, very huge because it's cheap and the, and the, the marginal cost, if you're ready, have a class in it, in physiology with somebody lecturing and another hundred students doesn't cost you anything. So education up to very high levels, uh, is is something that, that uh, developing countries can often afford because it's a labor intensive occupation. And when you think of, of, of the brain drain, what happens then as you get more doctors than India can support more doctors or the Mexico can support. So they want to come to the United States. You get the brain drain that the most highly educated people from all these developing countries, which the government has invested in to to pay for their education.

Speaker 1:          00:53:43       They go to England, they go to America, they go to France, they go to Japan if they're allowed in and they get a job. So that's the old style brain drain where the people physically moved to here. But it's also the modern job flight that now again, as I said with the Internet and cheap shipping costs or these jobs can stay in India or somewhere. And we shipped the jobs out the accounting. So accounting is done in the daytime banks to all the kinds of transactions. They ship all that data overnight to India. And during our night, which is India's day, the Indian accounts work on it. And by the morning you have all your accounts settled. Engineering has worked on in Chicago, uh, during the day. And then however far the plans of God a shipped off to you can usually India and the, the, uh, the architects, their work on it and shipped back to Chicago.

Speaker 1:          00:54:32       And that's increasing. And so one of the important factors in this is basically the cheapness of education, that education, labor intensive operation. And so developing countries can do it quite well, but within the developing countries, they can rather rapidly produce a lot of, say, college educated people. And these people expect good jobs. You know, they've risen up by maybe by great amount of effort risen up from, from the utter poverty in their villages. And now they have a college education and they're ready for a job at the country, usually doesn't have jobs for them. The economies is not yet developed. So what is, there's a tremendous demand for BlueCat for white color jobs and who and in, and if they don't get these white collar jobs, they're tremendous unrest among the young educated people. They're very verbal, they know each other, they know how to communicate. They're mobile. You can have a very unstable political situation up right away. So the governments and all the things almost always respond with government jobs. Since there isn't a private sector is not yet capable of producing John, there's government jobs and you'd get these enormously bloated bureaucracies and almost every, uh, underdeveloped country where to do the tiniest little thing, you need 16 different people to, to stamp it and sign it and improving. It takes three days for each of these people to make a decision.

Speaker 1:          00:55:58       And so that's sort of things get out of whack when, because it's cheap. You can produce a lot of education, but then you can't get them jobs. And then once you establish these big bureaucracies, then further economic development become difficult because to do the slightest thing, build a factory or do something new or import something, you have to go through all this bureaucracy. And because the government doesn't have money pay these people, you know, they get paid very poorly. So corruption, they can, you know, if you give us very small bribe, this is, this is a wonderful thing for the bureaucrats. So he'll pay attention to your thing and only take two days instead of three days to approve whatever it is you've given him. So again, this is the problems of the relationship with demography and international and economic development in poor countries. It's all these interlocking things. The demography always interlocks with every other aspect of your economic development.

Speaker 1:          00:57:01       Okay. So in terms of, uh, the whole picture of, of the change in the world, probably this is the kind of sequence does that, we've talked a lot of different factors that, that happened to bring people into, into modernity. And so I want to sort of summarize a lot of that. Um, the first thing that apparently happens, it starts in the renaissance in the west and then continues on into, and the enlightenment and then the industrial evolution is that the first thing that happens is people start thinking supernaturally about things and start thinking about the real world and trying to think rationally about it. So technological progress and sewers and allows them better shipping, better navigation. They get all the way to America, discover American foods, bring them back and start a population increase. Uh, in Europe, uh, good ways to prevent disease are discovered.

Speaker 1:          00:58:01       Uh, industrial revolution increases productivity. You start thinking rational about things and everything can get better, more food and it means less staff. And so population increases and the starts in the 17 hundreds in Europe and really starts saying 19 hundreds in the currently developing countries. And we saw before that sometimes you know, that the relationship between mortality drop and fertility drop was, was not a given. And, but in almost all cases, whether they went in parallel, that mortality was below fertility. So since early time population has been increasing and even in a still agrarian society, that means is population increase, the pressure on the land is going to go up and uh, you're, you're going to get tinier and Tinier plots until you reach a crisis. Now, some places it remember what a surprise we had that England, which was an industrially advanced as urbanization was advanced.

Speaker 1:          00:59:01       It's educational then everything was advanced, but it had one of the latest fertility transitions. Why? Maybe because of primogeniture that they didn't have that kind of pressure on the land because only the oldest son inherited and the land plots did not get smaller and smaller. And the political structure was such that the landed gentry gentry were the ones that controlled parliament. And the city's really didn't count that much where the excess people were. So England of France did not experience the same kind of tiny, entire pots and the vast amounts of rural poverty that other places had. So anyway, uh, with the scarcity of land, the plots get smaller and huge number in most places. Huge numbers of people fall into this abject kind of rural poverty. And then two things that I'm talking about today, one or one of the things that I've talked about today happens next for as individual families have to figure out a new strategy, they realize that education for kids is the only way out of of their their situation and that means that they have to have fewer children at the same time with the spectrum, they're currently developing countries, the western governments, either out of the goodness of their heart or because they're scared about revolution and communism and anti-americanism, they have to help the third world.

Speaker 1:          01:00:22       So they start supporting family planning programs and what they do is two things. One, they buy advertising and just setting up Clements, the the social, the cultural acceptability of controlling fertility by some sort of contraception becomes acceptable. It's not any more a totally taboo topic and then they actually provide the goods themselves, so allows people to work there. Their economic interest is in having fewer children. But if their culture, if there's not the contraceptives available as say in China, there was for a long time or it's not cultural acceptable, they can't act on that desire for family planning programs committee, the government ones are foreign supported ones and you know, their own government supported ones or foreign ones towards once. And that allows people to act on their desires to have fewer children, then fertility falls because they're now using some sort of contraception. Uh, and then as we saw, I guess, La last lecture that when fertility falls, then you get this bulge of workers and then the economy takes off. So that's kind of a way of putting the whole thing together.

Speaker 1:          01:01:40       Now, this is all very nice theory that I proposed to you. Uh, and, uh, you noticed, or not too many data slides that I put up for this. It sounds great. I'm sure you're all convinced yet that's, that's a good answer. When you started looking at this, um, uh, in, in more detail, uh, things don't turn out to be so convincing. Um, one about the cost of children, uh, going up, which is the first part with the children as a consumption. Good. Well, what the children actually need. They need some clothing, they need some food, and it's basically what they need to stay alive. And that's all that they got in the old days. Well, what's happened to the price of clothing in the last several decades? No price or coding or wrong was fallen tremendously. Clothing with a new fabric, you can't wear it out. First of all, I have that problem.

Speaker 1:          01:02:36       I can't throw things away. So my clothes is just wrong. It's very cheap. It's made in China, Bangladesh, all around the world. The price of clothing who has dropped tremendously as a fraction of income, uh, you always have to do it as a fraction of income. The price of food has dropped around the world as a fraction of income. So the basic necessities of children have really dropped in price and drop quite drastically. When you see a graph of that, it, it's, it's quite drastic. So if you consider the cost of providing the same goods that pretends people provided for the kids, if two cost of providing that now has gone way down as a fraction of income. And as I said, often it, usually education is provided free by the government and uh, sometimes, uh, healthcare is provided free by the government. So, uh, it doesn't look like an economic issue that if you want to just have kids the way you're used to have them, uh, the cost has not risen, but the cost has gone down.

Speaker 1:          01:03:39       But what has changed is in the minds of people, uh, they now perceive that they must provide for their children to completely expand different than expanded set of goods than, than previously. Uh, children have to have the kind of education that they, that they never had before. They have to have enrichment activities, uh, all kinds of stuff. And if you read about China, I mean, it's amazing what Chinese, they have only one child and that child is so over programmed. It makes you look lazy. I mean they go to dancing lessons and music lessons in English last at all afterschool. The kid is just working like crazy. You may have noticed near the beginning but not at the beginning of the previous, like a whole bunch of Chinese came in and sat over there. They were the presidents of the student nurse. I didn't know who they were.

Speaker 1:          01:04:28       They turned out to be the presidents of the student associations and some of the really big universities in China. So these are, you know, to get to be top dog and huge university is a big, big deal. And what were they interested in this issue of modernization? That they're spoiled. They realize that they were telling me, I spoke to them later that they didn't want to have siblings. They were really enjoying getting everything as an only child. They did not want a sibling. She's laughing cause you know that story. But also the other side of the coin is as the only child they have to succeed, they have to get top grades in their education. So the amount of pressure on them to work like crazy all the time to study, study, study, uh, is severe. And they were interested in largely in the pressures on them, which they were, they were feeling guest as presidents of the student bodies that are probably be overachievers like crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:05:21       And so they would feel this pressure enormously. And then your other stories where kids learn to play this game. So if a parent wants them, oh, why don't you wash the dishes tonight or help around the house? Oh, if I do, if I take time away from my studying, I'll fail my course. So, uh, it's this change in mentality, uh, that has raised the cost of childbearing. It's not the actual that, that the, the actual cost of child raising if you raise them the old way, that went way down. But there's been a culture change that's required, an enormous increase in the expenditures on children. And of course nowadays for you parents don't expect probably anything from you in return as, as an investment. And you know, just to pay one year of Yale is probably more than some Chinese might make in their whole life.

Speaker 1:          01:06:15       Okay. Um, now opportunity cost is another interesting thing. We talked about, uh, uh, mother's time. So it was his, remember the cost of children is not just what you spend in cash, uh, but it's the opportunity cost of childcare time. And if you're out doing childcare, you don't have the option to also work at that. And studies have shown that it's actually the time cost of children that way outweighs the, the, the, the direct cost of buying things for them. And 70% of the cost of a child is in the value of the time spent on it. So as people get richer, yes, they buy more for their children and they buy more expensive things, but their earning power also rises. So, uh, and it's this rise in earning power that makes the 70%, uh, that, so the 70% of the cost of children is at the time they're not spending working.

Speaker 1:          01:07:14       But, um, when, when the people go out and do these times study things. Uh, I don't know how well you can see this, but this is the amount of time that a mother spends in child care for her children. And there's one children, it's 2.2 hours a day and even up to six when they have five to six children, the wife is not employed as a stay at home mom. It's 1.9 there's, there's really no, no significant difference depending on the number of children that you have. This is upstate New York and then I think the 1950s this is fairly recent. This is not even a developing country. The amount of time spent is actually quite small. Now compare this to the mother getting a job. She's a, so people were 40 hours a week. Say if it's a nine to five and if they don't get paid for the half hour of lunch they can, it's like, I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          01:08:08       They work eight hours a day and depending on how you do lunch, it can be eight and a half or nine hours and then they have to commute and maybe half an hour to work and half an hour back was getting properly dressed for the, for the job and commuting and getting there. So we're talking nine, 10 hours a day that are working mother in this case. But it could be a father is away from home. So that's the cost of having a job is like 10 hours. The cost of having any number of children, I mean it's seven to nine, something different is going on and you know, it's only about two hours a day. So the cost in time of children is not really all that great. And the only time it gets bigger as if the child is less than one year old, which it takes three or four hours a day to take care of the child.

Speaker 1:          01:08:51       Uh, now this is for all the members of the family. This is just the mother. This is all members of the family. So again, now this is 2.7. Compare that to two. They have one child, it's a half an hour. The other members of the family together put a half an hour into the child is 2.3 this is a little bigger, but it's never more than an hour a day put into the child for all of the other, uh, uh, uh, things. And again, it doesn't change an awful lot with a lot of children later. Children are cheap because there's basic little incremental cost to that. Here's more recent data and this, the, the, the red line here is mother's child care, and this is per week, not per day. So it's something starts out in the sixties and seventies, which is comparable to the data you just saw. It was nine, 10 hours a week, which is just a little bit over an hour, a day.

Speaker 1:          01:09:50       And time goes on and I'll talk about that later. It didn't, it increases, but it's very small. And here's the father's house work. It's like two, two and a half hours a day. So it's not, so the amount of of time it takes to deal with children, although our myth is that it's very, very time consuming. And actual fact when you, when you take the data, it doesn't really work out that way. And now you have be careful this is x, this is extra time. So this, uh, if you do house or this, these numbers are extra time. So even if you have no children, take certain amount of time to, to take care of a house. So that's, that's, that's a fixed thing. And then all of these numbers ask how much extra time are you spending if you have children. So compared to people without children to people, children, and of course that's the proper number.

Speaker 1:          01:10:41       Uh, without that we want, um, and okay, so here is, um, interesting thing. So as this data gets more sophisticated, you say, well, what does childcare mean when you can take no children and compare it to people with children. But if you look at differently what the mother is actually doing. Sometimes it's her primary activity. She's actually doing the child, not really doing, if anything else she's doing. It's secondary like watching TV or Washington or something. No, that's primary and that's an an hour and a half a day. If it's primary or secondary. So she may be what? Washing the dishes or vacuuming and the kid is right there and she's talking to the kid and playing with a little bit. It goes up a little bit and, but it's still this, this is pretty much the same number. You seen the two previous slides, so there's a couple of hours a day.

Speaker 1:          01:11:44       This is again per day and the other slide was per week. If you just count the time there with the children at all, you know they're linking both be watching television together or they're not really doing childcare that just with the children it's still, it gets to be more significant. But this is not time taken away from anything else that just a child happens to be there now and this is that this is moderately stable. It doesn't change between 65 and 98 about the same, a little bit different about about the same. Now there's something interesting that you might have missed in the slides. I know we're going to stop in a minute. Uh, what's happens between 1965 and 1998 or in the previous graph between 1965 and 2003 women go to work. There's a huge difference in the number of women, the fraction either the num, both the number and the fraction of women working between any of these ages and yet what, what do you see the amount of time that the mother spends in Charlotte care goes up from, you know, the old during this period, nine to 10 hours up to like 14 hours.

Speaker 1:          01:12:54       That as women go to work, they spend more time with their children. Part of the answer to that is this is in the rest of house care non child. How scared and with modern gadgets and throw away stuff, that amount has allowed women to spend more time with children. So again, all this goes to contradict that part of the economic theory that says that childcare competes with working and the evidence is very, very skinny. Uh, uh, on that hypothesis. In fact, if you ask your mothers were any woman that has children, what goes away when they go to work, not childcare, leisure time, leisure time, and sleep survey after survey says that what women do differently when they work as they get less sleep and less leisure time. So, uh, I guess that's all we can do today. So see you Thursday. We may not continue on this topic. I think you get, get the idea.
