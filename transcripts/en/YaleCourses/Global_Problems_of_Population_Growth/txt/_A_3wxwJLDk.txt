Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So let me start. Um, I'm going to read you something and you have to guess what kind of a scene I'm describing. A ghostly stillness descended over the country, this country today with every restaurant, bar and tea house in the country, close every store, shuttered and police patrolling the streets to make sure no citizen day or to step outside avenues normally clogged with traffic were so empty that picnics could have been held on them except that nobody would have been allowed to attend plazas that are perpetual nightmares of congestion and exhaust. Exhaust fumes were abandoned to wandering dogs and cats was also a good day for the fish because the thousands of fishermen who lined the shorelines on Sunday, we're all at home. The waterway itself, one of the world's busiest waterways was this flat and silent as a woodland pond. The government to create a six month term jet, a jail term for any citizen who did not spend the day at home. All in all the country today looked like a land on which a neutron bomb had been dropped, devastating the population while leaving the buildings on damaged. What do you think it is? It's drastic. Yeah. Like nope. Good, reasonable gas, but no governments weren't as strong. Then

Speaker 1:          00:01:34       it's a census day in Turkey. Some places take their sentences very seriously and require that people really be in the place of their residents so that they can be counted and that they get a very good set of numbers and the waterway that they're talking about

Speaker 1:          00:01:56       between Turd Europe and Asia running through the boss spruce. Right, okay. Now compare this to another country and educated and motivated guy got one of the temporary jobs as a census taker. He was Chi class enough to get an article published in the Atlantic monthly. This is New York City, I'll tell you, cause you'll get from, he was six foot four and Caucasian. They sent him to Chinatown. People took one look at him and slammed the door. Others offered him money to go away. Even most of those who tried to cooperate did not have time to fill out the long form. He asked to be assigned to another area. He got Wall Street. Same Story. No one would cooperate with him. He couldn't even get into one building. But this was a motivated guy. I was like a yellowy. So we climbed onto the roof of the next building, the building next door.

Speaker 1:          00:02:57       He jumped over the partition, not across the street, but over the partition and uh, to get into the building that he was supposed to take. The sense of self right there on the roof was a dilapidated shack. Okay. Maybe someone's living in the shack. So he knocks on the door. Someone inside flings open the door inside. He could see several apparently naked people lying on hospital. Gurneys the man who opened the door was wearing a white coat, go away. He screamed. I'm giving my wife a cancer treatment New York City, so I'm more, I'm more experienced. Census taker told him that he wasn't doing it right. What you have to do is what they say kerbstone it. Uh, and what that means is you sit on the sidewalk and guess how many apartments are in the building. You look up at the building, you guess how many apartments in the building and fill out that many forms with guesses about how many people live in each apartment.

Speaker 1:          00:04:00       That's the way census that was done in New York City, a comparison to Turkey. Now these are describing the 1990 census. So get to the 2000 census and a moment that census was the most expensive ever. It missed more than 2 million children, of course, mostly minority children. And imagine what this does for school planning and it's and et Cetera, et cetera. It missed altogether, not counting just children, 10 million people and a double counted or counted in the wrong place. Another 6 million people. So between censuses, the census peer uses the counter, the last senses to make its projections. They know the population is increasing every year. How much do we have now? Now, now and so. By the time they came from the 1992 the 2000 census, there were 7 million more people in America than the Census Bureau thought there was. Population had been increasing something like one and a half times with what they had thought it was. So there's this slop matter, the poor, the poor quality of the United States census. Well nowadays these numbers might seem small but more than $185 billion a year in federal aid to states are apportioned according to the census results. So every state's state really wants its people counted. And on top of that, what else is apportioned? Depending on the Census Congress, the House of Representatives is apportioned. So people want their estate to have as many representatives as possible. So given the importance of this, why is it so bad? Why is the US census so bad?

Speaker 1:          00:05:45       The answers primarily politics, it is well known, big are the kinds of problems that this census taker had in New York is very well known and it's well known that these, you know, people that are considered somewhat marginal minorities, immigrants, poor people, they are heavily under counted. This is, this is well known. The problem is that these people don't vote Republican. And when this story can aren't telling you what takes place, the Republicans control the House of Representatives, which controls the budget. And so the census has been missing this eight, 10 million for the 90 census, 8 million for before roughly eight to 10 million people. And again, it's these minority groups, minorities, renters, urban dwellers, and so democrats and they generally vote Democrat and the Democrats have been pushing, uh, to get them counted to make an accurate account. But a Republican redistricting as expert wrote a memorandum in 1997 protecting that adjustment could cross the Republican Party 24 house seats, which is a huge amount.

Speaker 1:          00:06:57       So since then, the Republicans have blocked any modernization of the census. So for the year 2000 census, uh, President Clinton appointed a new director of the Census Bureau and a woman named Martha Reesh, who we've had here at Yale and she came out of a scientific and research environment and was really very competent scholar. I knew how to do it right. And she announced when she came into office, all industrial democracies will be holding a census in the year 2000. We want the United States to win a gold medal for accuracy. She thought she was smart. In fact, of course she missed the boat because she thought she was supposed to make an accurate census and no, that wasn't what she was hired for. So what she proposed was a statistical way of dealing with this. You know, the groups that you've missed, you know where they live. So after you've countered everyone as well as you can on the whole country, you go back to the inner city neighborhoods, the various places where you know that you're going to miss people and you really blanket that and do that.

Speaker 1:          00:08:05       Those areas very carefully, a sample across the country. And then you find out what your errors are in that large sample and then you can adjust the whole population, assuming you made the same mistakes everywhere. And she was very open. That's what she planned to do. And uh, at the time though, a Newt Gingrich, I don't know if you know that name with, uh, the, uh, what is it? The new deal for America or something I was in was the speaker of the house controlled the budget and he said, um, Yep, you have the authority to do that. You're the director of the budget, but if you do that, I will cut your budget to zero. Basically. Uh, she wasn't allowed to do that. And so she had to resign. She just would not do a census. That was, that was less than what, what we are capable of doing.

Speaker 1:          00:08:57       Uh, so the census was done the old fashioned way. It costs one point $7 billion more than it would have with sampling and was not anywhere near as accurate. Now these same considerations apply almost everywhere. So in China for instance, uh, you know about the one child policy and the government is strongly trying to push the birth rate down. We'll talk about this later in, in much more detail. And so a provincial official gets the word. This is, we want your population growth rate to be no more than whatever percentage. And then he sends it down to the prefecture and down. Do you think any of these officials after the census are going to send up information that they have not been doing their job? That the birth rate is higher? No. So there's problems with that. Who collects this data? Well, luckily several or many organizations collect the data, but primarily the UN who owns the UN member countries. And if you, uh, if you are, say a conservative religious country and if, uh, the UN demographer says that contrary to government statistics that there actually is a high rate of illegitimacy or abortion in the country. All of which comes out of the, of, of the statistics, they're not going to allow that, that to be published. So the UN has to sort of cut some corners so that the countries from who is dependent on to get the data, we'll continue to send them the data.

Speaker 1:          00:10:32       In addition, even when a country tries, there are something like 50 million birth registration is not done everywhere in the world. And there's something like 50 million babies worldwide who were never registered. They don't exist on the official, uh, registers. So when you try to do what demographers do, you have account, you have a count of a census in one year, you have account of a census in a later year in between you have a list of births and deaths, supposedly both births, the registered and deaths are registered and you see, is this reasonable, you know, is the difference accounted for by births, deaths and migration if you have reasonable amounts of migration, uh, but if millions of the babies are just not registered, you can't check things that way. So there's a lot of, lot of problems. Um, another thing is that in many, many countries, uh, there's conflict between different groups.

Speaker 1:          00:11:27       We've talked about democratic Republican, uh, in the United States, in Nigeria, in Sudan, there's a huge conflict between the Muslim populations in the north and the Christian, uh, or animus populations in the south. You may or may not recall the, they'd be off for a war in Nigeria, a huge war between basically over oil, but between the Muslim north and the Christian south, uh, millions of deaths and millions of deaths now currently in Sudan over something of a similar issue. And so in census, in ethnically or religiously split countries are taken. The key event is the ratio. The key outcome that everybody wants to know is the ratio between how many Christians, how many Muslims, how many this, how many, how many of that. And so, uh, the censuses get totally distorted by people trying to raise their numbers and lower everyone else's numbers. So, uh, before the br for war, there was apparently a reasonably accurate census in 1952 to 1953 then the BF war intervened and the next several sentences were very controversial.

Speaker 1:          00:12:40       So the accepted official figures in Nigeria, we're 88 and a half million people, but the World Bank said, no, that's wrong. Hundred and 2 million people. Uh, the United Nations, 120 million people. So basically for a country as big and as important as Nigeria for their, their, their last census, we have figures range between 88 and a half million and 120 million, a 50% uncertainty for Nigeria. So big. Uh, the point of this initial part, 0.1 is that even the simplest numbers like headcounts, we're not doing anything fancy. We're just trying to count how many people there are. One, two, three, four, five. There are systematic errors and very often those errors are intentional.

Speaker 2:          00:13:35       Okay. Now

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       all of these numbers, well I say when I described these numbers, and I probably won't do it enough when I put up a demographic number, it should almost always being qualified by, and there are large and unknown error bars here, but we don't have aerobars for it. So various organizations collect all this data and this is called the population reference bureau, which is a source of statistics and news. Everything about population. And it's a very big sheet here. I'll show it to you, blown up. And it has every region, the world, every country of the world, and a large number of demographic statistics for each of these countries. So let's look at one of these.

Speaker 2:          00:14:31       So yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:14:34       here is one page of this sheet. Can you see that? Well enough, I don't need to pick away. And what you see is this is the various numbers that they count. Population birth rate, death rate, rate of increase migration rate in or out, um, plus for coming in out for going out what their projected population is for 2025 or 2050 and so forth. Down there. A number that we'll try to get to describe later called the total fertility rate, which is more or less the number of children and women are expecting are we'll have as they go through their lifetime. And then on this side, it's broken down first into the world, broken down by level of development than by geographic region. So a lot of really a very good data, very clearly put on here. And you can look first at the world's population here.

Speaker 1:          00:15:37       So that's the first number in the whole thing. This is the middle of 2008 so there was 6.7 billion people on earth and still rising. The expectation for mid 2025 is 8 billion, and for 20, 59.3 or 4 billion. Those are guesses about the future. And I'll tell you maybe a little bit about how, how those are done. Um, okay, look now at the birth rate here. So this is births per thousand population and the birth rate of the world, uh, is, is 21 and we're going to go crazy going back and forth there. Um, so how accurate is that? Uh, again, we don't know large and uncertain aerobars it's something like a third of the children in the world that don't have proper birth certificates. So you can't know whether they've, they've encountered at all. So another thing you should notice about the way it gets, what he's not only the world when it breaks it down into development categories, uh, there's less developed countries that includes China and less developed countries excluding China. It's important to get those two things different because China is considered very exceptional. One because of it's one child policy and they think that the birth rate is abnormally depressed. And two, it's tremendous rate of economic development. So if you want a real characterization of the less developed countries, uh, even though China is average income is very low, it's changing very rapidly, then you do it without China and you get a different numbers there. Um, look next at the birth rate for whoops.

Speaker 1:          00:17:38       Okay. That was keeping the birth rate. The birth way for the whole world is 21 per thousand per year and the birth rate for the less developed is 23. Not a big difference. Why is that? How come so close? Whereas for the developed countries, it's 12. Why is the birth rate for the world so close to the less developed? Right. The overwhelming majority of the population is in the less developed countries. So whatever we understand about that, that is, uh, what we have to, uh, that is characteristic of, of the world.

Speaker 2:          00:18:23       Um, so

Speaker 1:          00:18:30       this chain, this difference in birth rate between say 12, in the more developed countries and uh, say 23, 26, even 36 for the least developed countries, that is a huge difference. It's a factor of three between the most developed and the least developed. And in fact you have something like two and a half over two in between, which means that now most of the world is in the underdeveloped countries, most of the population. And that will continue and we'll get more extreme. So here is an example of that. This is, we're now talking about here and the more developed regions like the US or are still growing very slightly, but basically going to be flat as far as one can project out here. But the less developed countries are undergoing this population explosion. So if the ratio between the less developed countries and the develop regions is this now, that will only increase after, I'm sorry, 2050 out here. So this, that the world is demographically characterized by the poor countries is a fact now in a much better fact as time goes on, more a more complete fact. So that's the first point is about the accuracies of statistics. The second one here is that it's not the develop countries. When you think of what's happening in world population, don't think of the developed countries. What's happened, what's happening is what's happening in the underdeveloped countries of the developing countries.

Speaker 1:          00:20:15       Now let's shift and look at the death rate. We've looked a little at the birth rate and you notice something, furnishing. Here's the birth rate. And we've just been saying for the whole world, uh, 21, uh, per thousand per year. Look at the death rate eight. That means there's more than two and a half times in the world. Now there's more than two and a half times as many births as there are deaths and enormous difference. And you can compare in the less developed regions, there's something like three times as many births as there are deaths, nine deaths, 26 births. So there's a huge right now, there's a huge imbalance between the births and the deaths and as you know, population stability, which many people think would be a good thing for the world. Uh, it depends on uh, the deaths and the births being equal, which means that the world is out of kilter.

Speaker 1:          00:21:17       The ratio between births and deaths is now out of kilter by a factor of something like two and a half to three, two and a half of the whole world, three for the developing countries. And what that means is either the death rate has to come up to that level or the birth rate has to come down or some combination. Part of this is where we'll see three, what's going to happen with part of it, uh, in a bit later. So the, the, the major point of this is that the world is very far from population stabilization. You've probably heard lots in the news about declining birth rates in Europe and Japan and so forth. And our next lecture will be about that will be just about that. But it's not characteristic of the world. The world is way out, way out of balance. And even in the United States, which is one of the few developing countries, uh, that still, uh, having a population increase, we have 14 births for every eight deaths, and that's one in three quarters times, uh, the number of births as death. So the United States is way out of whack and that's births versus that that doesn't include immigration includes the children of immigrants that are born in this country but doesn't include immigration. So hour, hour bursts plus immigration is going to be at least double our birth rate. So our population is, uh, also, uh, not anywhere near balanced.

Speaker 1:          00:22:55       Okay. Now, unlike the birth rate, which is very different in different parts of the world, the death rate is not extraordinarily different. So here it's, I see you squinting, is it, can you see it well enough? Well, the death rate in the developed country is 10 per thousand. And in the less developed countries, again, without Trynna, it's nine per thousand. A very small difference. And the reason for that is, is that mortality has formed because of vaccination programs, especially vaccination programs. Oral Rehydration for diarrhea and a lot of very basic public health matters. Not Open heart surgery or anything like that, but the most basic public health measures has, has dropped, uh, the death rate in the world tremendously. Again, especially the infant death rate sub Saharan Africa is somewhat of an exception to that. So, uh, did you met anybody? Remember maybe you studied it. I think what I said was sort of a, a premodern death rate. Somebody said it, I think they said it right,

Speaker 1:          00:24:12       40, about 40 per thousand. And now it's down to one quarter of that, which is a modern rate and it's not going to decrease, uh, in a, in an enormous amount more. And so, uh, fertility. So the changes in the death, when you look about the future of population, further changes in the death rate will have some effect, but not an enormous, uh, effect. It's, it's changing the fertility rate, the whole future world population depends essentially on the fertility rate. Little bit from a change in the death rate, somewhat from people aging, but primarily fertility rate is what you watched to find out what's going to happen in the future of rural population. Unless of course you can. We have atom bombs or something like that and everybody dies. Now, as an example of this, uh, uh, um, deaf flatness of the death rate, this is from Egypt.

Speaker 1:          00:25:11       Uh, this, this is a lovely graph. Notice the little baby in swaddling clothes. I pulled that. This is from the Egyptian statistical abstract though the Egyptian published this themselves and it's, it's, it's, it's, it's not the most reason that goes up to about 1990 and maybe now they've gotten more computerized. Don't dress the things that, but I just liked that. And the color in that color is the original color in the original statistical report. So notice the number of births increasing continuously with, with some small dip here, but basically it goes from a thousand to this up here would be 2000 in this period of time, the birth rate nearly doubles. And this is absolute number of people, not a percentage, but look what happens to the death rate. Very little change in the death rate starting way back in 1952 so way before, a lot of very modern kind of medical stuff. So it's basic medical, uh, basic public health, basic sanitation that that's responsible for this. So now, so the number of deaths and staying more or less constant. And of course the natural increase, the increase in population is the difference between births and deaths. So you have an increasing every year you get more and more population increase. This is the population explosion. You've seen numbers like that. Now, uh, is the death rate staying constant?

Speaker 1:          00:26:41       No, the death rate, not saying because the population is increasing and yet you're having the same number of deaths. So the percentage of, uh, of the population that's dying each year is going down slowly, not at a, at a, as a percentage of it is a slow decrease over this time period and continuing the death rate is decreasing but not in a significant enough to make a big difference in the total population growth statistics. So, uh, the basic thing in the world is that the fertility rate is what a chain going to what can change a lot, can make the difference between a moral truth population keeps growing or stabilizes or starts at decreasing. Now, uh, anybody notice anything funny so far? The one number that should have known one pair of numbers that should have what? Let's go back to that. Anything funny about these numbers?

Speaker 1:          00:27:51       Yeah, so the less developed countries have a lower birth rate, then the more developed countries, Ooh, not surprising that their health systems or their health is better than ours. Let's just check that number and let's look at, for instance, in compare the United States with our neighbor Mexico. We know Mexico is much poorer and probably doesn't have as good of kind of system. Well, here's our deaths per thousand in United States is eight Mexico five. It's good. It's a good bit less than we have. And further, here's Central America. There's not a single country that's as high as we are. Every single one. The Central Mountain Curry, I'm putting some pretty poor countries. El Salvador has a lower death rate than the United States, and Mexico is kind of in the middle between the four and the six striking. You go further afield. Here's the Caribbean and these are more in the range of a Vus, oops. Of, of, of the U s level. But there, the u s is not better than almost any of them except for Haiti. Haiti is the only place that has a nose bleed. Worse death rate than us.

Speaker 2:          00:29:16       What?

Speaker 1:          00:29:19       Yes. Yes. These are total death rates. Once you're born. If you die after you're born, your accounting don't, don't include a spontaneous or induced abortions. Okay. So, uh, we got a problem here. What do you think is the reason for this loud, loud state some more over there. People, exactly. The United States has more older people, and it's a funny thing about older people. They're the ones who tend to die. Once you've got rid of your infant mortality issue, people tend to die at the older ages. That's exactly correct. And it's an extreme in an, in a developed country. It's an extreme difference. Here's what's left. So this the United States, this is the deaths per thousand, the age of the people. And here's what's left of the infant mortality. It's still more dangerous to be an infant than, than later, but there's virtually, you can't even see the death rate through the middle years.

Speaker 1:          00:30:21       But then boom, it goes up as you get on into the older ages. So indeed the death rate is completely sensitive to your age distribution that a country that has more young people will have a lower death rate. A country that has a high birth rate, we'll have more young people will have a lower death rate. So what you're seeing in that anomaly there, what looked like an anomaly is basically that Mexico has a higher birth rate of people. And this funny thing that you happened to be born young and you die old. And so that is the explanation for that. So any time, any, almost any demographic number that you want to interpret, marriage rates, birth rates, death rates of fertility rates, almost everything of interest is affected by the age distribution and understanding demographics, statistics, the most important thing is always the age distribution. And so you always have to pay attention to that.

Speaker 1:          00:31:27       And later on I'll show you one of the mechanisms for paying attention for getting statistics, uh, adjusting statistics for the age distribution. Okay? But how first let's just look at it. So here is the easiest way of looking at an age distribution. What you have here, this is for Germany and the pink is the old, this is 1989 when eastern west Germany are still split. So this is the German Democratic Republic, East Germany. The pink is East Germans and the dark is the, is the federal public, the western money. And on the left is a man and on the right is his female, male and female. Whoops. And what this graphs is that every year. So this is age zero and you're just born to age a hundred. What is this age? A hundred that every year they ask how many people are, how many kids are there between age zero and one where there's so many males and so many females. This number in eastern Germany, this number in western. And so you can go through every age and just count from your census, the number of people at that age and draw it out like this. And it's a wonderful, huge amount of information. In a single graph. You can see all kinds of things. Look, this is world war one. The people born during World War One, they're almost all all go on. But here's the ones from World War Two and look at the big difference. Here's your females, here's your mails. What's the difference?

Speaker 1:          00:33:10       War deaths, right? The men are in the army and they get chewed up on the Russian front. So you have many more females than males. It's partially that women live older also. But this case in Germany is almost exclusive, is, is overwhelmingly the deaths from World War One hears. There's still some females, there's no males. Uh, and then the deaths from World War Two, you can see the birth deficit. These are people who would have been born during World War One. These were adults fighting age adults during World War One. These would have been born, well, the men were away. Uh, so they didn't have any babies. They had very few babies during World War One. And the same thing you see for World War World War Two. And you'll see again the deficits of uh, you know, while where we talked about that. So you can see that.

Speaker 1:          00:34:00       Then you can see there's a postwar baby boom that after the deficit in World War II, people make up for it. And more than make up the, for the deficit. So you have this huge bulge in population, uh, both males and females, but now balanced more or less equal numbers of males and females. And then you get the baby bust and you get a little echo effect. So that there's very, a fluctuations in a puppet. Almost every country has a western country has these kind of data plus the Asian countries that were involved in world war two. So you can see that. See it's a, it's a, it's a wonderful way of, of understanding a country. Now this is India and the census of India. That's a weird one. What the heck is going on there?

Speaker 2:          00:34:57       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:35:04       that's weird. So what it is is people don't know their ages. There are numerous and so it gets counted every five or 10 years. So he has a five year or 10 year period. They know their ages approximately two proximately a certain year. They don't know what exactly. It's not important in a, in a, in a pre industrial country, the exact age is not all that terribly important. So, uh, you get this, what that's called, age heaping that when you get a large excess in five or 10 year, my own father who was an immigrant, I did not know his age. There was, he was born either 1904 and 1907 cause he even had a birth certificate, but it was in the Russian cyrillic character and the four looks like a seven. So he, he and my mother argued constantly over how old he actually was.

Speaker 1:          00:35:55       And even countries that have had a long, you know, European have the same thing here as the Soviet Union from there, 1937 census just, and here again, you get this same age, cheap and effect, not quite as extreme as India, but very clearly here and to a degree worse with women than with men because women are less educated. See the big bars here, the small bars here and in principle it should be getting less. With younger people it should be a clearer, and you certainly have to get rid of these extreme, uh, uncertainties. But it's not, it's persisting into the 1930s. This I don't know how old I am, uh, except within a five or 10 year bracket. Okay. And here's another Weirdo.

Speaker 2:          00:36:44       What's that?

Speaker 1:          00:36:47       Just to show you that you can immediately, once you get used to this, immediately tell an awful lot about country from age pyramid.

Speaker 2:          00:37:01       Anybody from Arizona? Nobody.

Speaker 1:          00:37:09       It's Sun City, Arizona, which is a retirement community and they don't allow anybody, I think most of these have a, an age limit of 50 if you have to be at least 55. So this is the retirement age and where my mother lives in, in certain village, in West Palm Beach, looks like the Florida, looks like that. Uh, various retired and California has retirement villages. They look like that. So these population pyramids are wonderful with lots of information packed into this and from seeing these pyramids, uh, you can tell a lot, uh, about, um,

Speaker 2:          00:37:47       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:37:48       all right. You can tell a lot about the socioeconomic character of the countries because we know that the poor countries have less literacy and et Cetera, et Cetera, and they have higher birth rates. And so we look at, uh, what that looks like right now. So here is uh, two of these population pyramids and here is you saw on those, the splitting of the world to more developed regions and less developed regions. And what do you notice right away, the total area under this, so this is now five year age. He travels and single year, so between zero and four is this amount or this amount? So it's the area under this is how many total people there are. So one, you see this a lot less area here is a lot less people that the less developed regions where the or the bulk of the world, but also the shape is very different here in the developed regions you have more or less similar, uh, a number of people in all ages.

Speaker 1:          00:38:52       It's not exactly that way. Of course at the old ages of people are dying and that starts about here and there in the 50s and then accelerates and this very few less so it narrows here. And also it's narrowing down here because the, the birth rate in the developed countries is now below replacement level. Uh, and so the pyramid are getting to be fewer people in the younger ages than there are older people. Contrast that with less developed parts of the world. And you see that there's more and more younger people, each age cohort has more and more people. You can look at an individual country, and this is a clearer example. This isn't Nigeria as far as we can tell from their sentences, but they, you can tell an age distribution and this is now present rather than total from from sub samples. You don't need to count aptly everybody to understand what the age distribution is and here is a 50 year change.

Speaker 1:          00:39:58       There's not one, it's not changing very much. This is what it was in 1975 they know more or less what it is now and they're projecting it out to 2000 I'm sorry, 2005 this is a pretty current and it looks about the same and vastly as you go in this case as you go to younger and younger people, vastly more children than older folks. So what's happening here can see what the ages are here. 15 especially in Nigeria, 15 to 45 these are the ages in which women are giving birth and this number of women is giving birth to more than two children. They're more than replacing themselves. So each bar is bigger than the less, and some of this in swing, especially since this is in sub Saharan Africa, some of this reduction is infant mortality and child mortality. Some of the different specialties in this bar and this bar that's in there, but it's a small effect. The major effect is that every generation is bigger and they produce more and more children here. Um, now, uh, let's see.

Speaker 1:          00:41:18       So when you look at how, what's going to evolve in the future, so here is your women who are 40 to 45, that's this, this punch of when women and women on this. So that's the number of women they're producing part of these children in another five years. If you look at this, five years later, these women who were 40 to 45 are now 45 to 50. No more fertility, pretty much there Nigeria, and not using a lot of IVF and everything. So they have stopped reproducing. But that cohort of that size is being replaced by the ones of this size coming into fertile ages. So women that were 10 to 15 are becoming 15 and 20 and starting their child bearing when women that are 40 to 45 which have not so much childbearing left are going out of existence stopping childbearing. Absolutely. So the number of women, the number of child bearers is increasing drastically.

Speaker 1:          00:42:16       In this case it looks, you know, Ballpark, like there are twice as many women coming into reproductive age as are leaving reproductive age each each year, each five years, however you want to count it. So the number of childbearing women is increasing tremendously. And the result of that is uh, here's another comparison. Whereas in the West, in, in developed countries, you know the number of 40 to 45 year olds and not enormously different than the number to 15 to 19. So the women that are leaving reproductive ages are more or less replaced by the women that are coming into reproductive ages. Of course with population decline, eventually you get fewer women coming into reproductive age in developed countries that are leaving it so that you have fewer child bearers. So this phenomenon can, if you're, if you're popular, is increasing, the problem gets more and more severe.

Speaker 1:          00:43:16       If it's decreasing, the problem gets more and more severe. There's a positive feedback on this with your number of child bearers, either growing or decreasing. Now, so here is, uh, in Billy and the number of, of women of childbearing age in the world and it just keeps increasing. Right? What, uh, you may be aware of, I haven't really talked about this much. Yes, it's in my next lecture here is the birth rate in the world, children per women. So the birth rate has been coming down. So two opposite things are happening in the world. The number of childbearing women is going up, but the number of children that each of them has is going down and they predict optimistically that by 2050, it will reach about replacement level, about two children per women. But it's not there. We're not there yet. We're almost double. Uh, I'm sorry.

Speaker 1:          00:44:19       We're, uh, we're, we're, we're way above that now. So the result of this number of women rising, their rate of child bearing decreasing is that the number of births, you sort of multiplied those two out. The number of births is expected to continue increasing for the, for for the predictable future. So that's an absolute number of births will increase as a result of these two crossing factors. So now the birth rate is coming down and it eventually, let's presume in the future, gets to be too children. What then happens, you still have a pyramid like this, but now it starts flattening out, but it flattens out. Let's see, I should do this by hand. In fact, I want to go to this graph shows this. This is what's actually predicted to happen. So this is again, developing countries and this is the kind of pyramid that we've seen.

Speaker 1:          00:45:27       This one goes back to 1985 with this broadly increasing thing. It's basically a triangle, right? You can think of it as a triangle. Now, if immediately now god sticks his finger out of heaven. It says two children and even more surprising people obey him. What happens, this is the number of children, people that there are there that the population pyramid will grow up, but with this as a base so that it will become square, but there'd be this many people, so you go from a triangle to a rectangle with the same base. Can you see that thing? The number of people is the area inside that and you had the same base. You go from a triangle to rectangle. Remember from high school geometry what the area is, it doubles because if you have a triangle and you go square, you just slipped the tea that half the triangle over and you've got that many people again.

Speaker 1:          00:46:25       So if a miracle happens and fertility stops dead right now and we go immediately to two to children per women, the population doubles before it stabilizes, right? What this shows you is that of course it's that miracle is not going to happen. This is quite optimistic and is already not not the case that the base will also increase. Since population is still increasing, the base will increase and yes it will get more rectangular but even by 2025 it won't yet be rectangular so that you will on this kind of production more than double the population from 1985 because the base is growing as well as your, you're rising up and so there's an expectation of quite a lot of population increase who left this whole phenomenon where because you, once you start having an increasing population, uh, you're going to, the population is going to keep increasing because there's more and more childbearers unless something drastic happens to the fertility rate is called population momentum cause you sort of moving in a certain direction of increasing population, it just continues in.

Speaker 1:          00:47:42       The same thing happens as you'll hear next lecture with population decreasing. Then when population decreases you have fewer and fewer child bearers in, each generation has to say Japan now or Singapore. And so unless the birth rate increases tremendously, you'll have fewer and fewer children. And what this shows you is that if there was immediate replacement, this kind of miracle, that everything, everything, everybody comes to just two children immediately, then uh, the population would be this. So this effect is all momentum. All of this increase from where we are now to up here is just a momentum effect. Just the fact that there's more and more and more children coming into age and that takes a very long time to work out. And then the fact that there's in fact a, they're not going immediately to two children, not immediate immediate replacement. This is the United Nations guests as to what's going to happen. The actual population is projected to go like this. So to chill, if everybody immediately goes to two children, you get this population rise. What is actually expected is somewhat more so huge amount of what's happening with population. Future is already determined. It's already momentum is in there. And even if birth rates really come down very rapidly, the world's population is going to continue increasing.

Speaker 1:          00:49:16       Okay. So that's, that's sort of the, an important thing to remember in the world of fertility is decreasing. The population is increasing.

Speaker 2:          00:49:24       Uh, and those are not canceling out. Um, so

Speaker 1:          00:49:32       from 1985, the prediction was at the world population with someone double, we've made some progress between there, but still we have 6.7 billion now and the expectation is something like 50% more people on Earth in 2050 and perhaps continuing to increase, uh, beyond that, almost a huge amount of momentum effects here is,

Speaker 2:          00:50:00       uh, well let me go back.

Speaker 1:          00:50:05       This is Maureen [inaudible] and islands in the, in the Indian Ocean and it's one of the examples of a small underdeveloped country that had a very surprising fertility decline. So this, uh, this is, this is probably the influenza epidemic here, but starting in around right after war two in the, in the late 1940s, it's death rate fell down. Modern public health comes in to Mauritius. So the death rate falls dramatically. Then this fits the standard, uh, characteristic of the demographic transition. About 20 years later, about one generation later, people learn what, we don't have to have so many children because they're not dying and the birth rate comes down thereafter. So, uh, and population growth is in here. So this is a country that did well, that starting fairly early for a, uh, for a developing country in 1951 say their birth rate is falling down. They, they really, uh, sort of got it under control and, but you look at this, so, uh, this is the, uh, uh, the birth, the total fertility rate, which is a birth rate here in the stays stable and then it starts falling down quite, quite significantly.

Speaker 1:          00:51:36       But look at, here's the total population size. You don't even see a change. Well, momentum. So here, the, the birth rate has started dropping in 1965, and now we're 25 years later and you don't see hardly any change in the population growth rate. That's what we talked about by the momentum effect that because at this time, before they dropped their fertility at, at this time, there were so many more children than older people that the number of women childbearers just keeps, it kept increasing and increasing, increasing. So even though fertility drops, uh, the number of children's stays high, even gets higher and the population just keeps increasing. It's a very, very strong effect and the number of, and it's not, not flattened out there yet, 25 years later. This is a projection of how long does it take before it flattens out. So this is, uh, the first one.

Speaker 1:          00:52:38       The first box is the year that this is our current size as of whatever year. This was by 23rd. This in the United States, us, this is the number of, of people. So, uh, this graph was made in, uh, it doesn't say the date, but our pop in, we'll increase somewhat by 20, 30. And this really is ignoring the changes that have happened to this with immigration and so forth that we will, we reach two child. Uh, if our fertility comes down, we reached to child in 2030 and we stabilized because we have not had a rapidly expanding puppies. So we stabilized right away. Nigeria, which you, you saw our current population, it's supposed to been some optimistic assumptions reach two children per women in the year 2035, but then it doesn't stabilize until 115 years later at again, a much increased population. So in the case of Nigeria, after it reaches to child per woman, after it reaches replacement level, it takes another hundred and 15 years before population actually stabilizes. This is Bangladesh, 125 years. This is Iran. Uh, uh, 110 years, Ron has had a big crash. We'll talk about that. And it's populated with Brazil 145 years. It takes an enormous amount of time, uh, for momentum to work itself out after the fertility rate comes down. So it's, it's, it's quite striking and that's the reason why we expect so much more population to happen. Again, you can look at an individual country. This is Algeria.

Speaker 1:          00:54:28       And look at, look at what Algeria has done between now and 20 years. That's an enormous rate. Here's its crude birthrate. It's crude means not corrected for age or anything. Just to take a thousand people. How many babies were there for that thousand people and in 1965 it was 50 and it dropped to 38 a very large drop and it's a drop of 24% they cut their birth rate and a quarter. That's 25% in 20 years. That's more than 1% a year. There's a very, very rapid change, but because of momentum, the population growth rate was 2.4% in 1965 even though the birth rate is going down, the population growth rate is going up, all momentum and the percentage change that the growth rate and increased by 19% in all of this because at this age they had been having a population explosion, so many more younger children than older.

Speaker 1:          00:55:29       The population almost doubled from 12 million to 22 million population went up 83% and the annual population growth rate increased from a quarter million to 600000.6 million change 217%. So here's the dilemma for developing countries that basically all the developing countries understand that they need that, that economically there, there'll be destroyed if there population growth rate increases. Virtually every developing country has now an official national policy of trying to get its birth rate down. We'll see later that, that that's okay with the people they're generally in, in accord with this, and they can do wonder. They can do miracles. These country, you'll see some of the drops next time I'll talk about Nixon, my lecture, I'll talk about some of the fabulous drops. I mean, this is not exceptional. This is a very, uh, very, uh, significant drop, but it's not exceptional, uh, around the world. And yet even in the face of that, that population goes up into massive amounts.

Speaker 1:          00:56:38       83% up 100% of more than somewhat. So as the government is pushing modernization and as the government is pushing, uh, reducing the birth rate and as grassroots organizations to push the try to get the birth rate down, the population keeps increasing. And Industrial Development, if it's not extremely rapid, can't keep up with the birth rate. So while these countries are modernizing, they can see conditions deteriorate, poverty can grow, crowding can grow, homelessness can grow again because population, even though you get your birth rate down, your population keeps increasing. So extremely. And so some, some theory believe that there's kind of a window of opportunity for, for developing countries that uh, for instance, you take Egypt, uh, which I'm sure it's also had one of these drops, not unlike this, they were the kings of the world, top of the world in the Pharaoh's time know, you'll know that kind of history.

Speaker 1:          00:57:42       Then iron was invented but not in Egypt. And Egypt was in the bronze age. During the pharaohs time. Iron is invented maybe in Turkey who I didn't know exactly where. And the other people's, the world picked up iron and made iron swords. And the, the Egyptians for some reason never really got on to iron. Maybe they don't have any iron anywhere there. And so from a, from a hundred to 1000 BC or something till 1950, they were always subject to somebody else. They're always ruled by someone else until Nasser, uh, gotten rid of the British. In 1950, they were ruled by the British and then before that by the Turks and buy all kinds of peoples. The Greeks before, you know, at, uh, Alexander the Great's time and so forth in the Romans, they're ruled by someone else. So here comes, here's 1952, I think NASA is revolution, gets rid of the British, sets up an independent republic.

Speaker 1:          00:58:37       The people are very enthusiastic about this. They're very excited. They're now throw off the shackles of imperialism and colonialism and they can now be their own country. But the birth rate is still very high. The population growth rate is very high. They have to industrialize real fast. They can't and they don't industrialize that fast. They don't modernize their economy. Why? Whole lot of reasons. One of which is they waste huge amounts of money on the conflict with Israel that they have war after war and have to spend huge amounts of money on the military that would be better spent, uh, under economic development. So time passes and the people have tried to modernize. That's been the ideology. They tried socialists modernization, they've tried capitalist modernization. And what they see is more and more crowding. Poverty is not going away. Conditions are not getting very much better.

Speaker 1:          00:59:31       I mean, they do get a little bit better, but not terribly much better. And so they give up on modernization when they give up on modernization, they glorify the past. They say it was better in the past and they go to a romantic attitude for what it was like in and can try to reverse modernization by resisting further drops in birth rate. For instance, going back to religion, and when I was in Egypt some some years back, went into sort of a restaurant. They seat you sometimes at long tables. So you know, people you don't know you sit next to and uh, if they happen to speak English, which I could talk to them, I don't speak Arabic. And so the ones that I could talk to her upper class educated people and therefore upperclass people that spoke fairly good English and you meet this a nice young woman and she was, uh, at the University of Cairo, which is my lead school, uh, and choose an engineering students.

Speaker 1:          01:00:29       So perfectly intelligent, perfectly modern in that way, wearing a headscarf, you know, which her mother did not wear, which was not in the previous generation that she doesn't believe in modernization. Basically for her own self benefit, she'll become an engineer because she wants a decent job. She doesn't want to have herself go back and digging the digging the desert dirt there to try to get some food. She wants to be a modern person with a good job. At least she wants a good job, but she doesn't believe in modernization. The rest of her ideology, aside from her personal desires is backward looking that things were better in the past. Modernization has not worked. So this is, uh, exam, sort of this, this window of opportunity when a country's first tried to get modernized and one of the things that goes along with modernization as the reduced fertility rate, if it doesn't work, people will reject that.

Speaker 1:          01:01:20       And a lot of what's going on in the world today, uh, with respect to the developed and undeveloped countries in the Arab countries in the western countries has to do with this rejection of modernization because it did not work for them. And with that, if the birth rate stays high as it has not in the Muslim countries, many Muslim countries have had fabulous progress. It's been a lot of the Arab countries, the birth rate has stayed very high and there's these huge numbers of unemployed young men, the economy cannot absorb them. They're hanging around, they're idealistic as, as well as young men are. And what ideas do they pick up? But going back to some imagined past that was glorious and the world may hinge on this window of opportunity, how many countries can take advantage of a China clearly took advantage of it. Japan took advantage of a lot of the East Asian countries took advantage of their window of opportunity. A lot of other countries did not take advantage of their window of opportunity.
