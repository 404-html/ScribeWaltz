Speaker 1:          00:00:01       So we're coming to the end of the course and, and uh, the last couple of lectures, last few social issues, and then we'll have a very short time for environment unfortunately. Um, so today we're going to talk about abortion and it's kind of a unique topic in the sense that in the United States it's, it's uh, it's, it's, if you have a global perspective in most of the world, abortion is not a big controversial issue in the United States. It's just going sky high as kind of the central issue in the American debate on values has tremendous political significance. Large numbers of people vote for a candidate for say president based solely on whether they, they approached choice or pro life.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       So one of the things you got to figure out or try to is, is why has this become so important an issue. And I think one of the reasons is that it encapsulates a diametrically opposed views of our roles in everyday life. If people perceive it as an everyday kind of issue. And what are the roles that I'm talking about? Sex Roles, work roles, husband and wife roles, motherhood and fatherhood roles. All of those, how you perceive yourself in those roles will very much determine how you, how you feel about the abortion debate. So for instance, both sides in the debate agreed that the issue is about murder. Uh, a pro lifer sees images of the three month old fetus, which even though only about the size of your finger and they see they're having visuals of blown up photographs and every year I'm sure you've all seen those things and it already looks quite baby like and thinks of it, of being dismembered and murdered approach. Choicer also sees it about murder, but she in her mind is a young woman, maybe herself, uh, in a back alley abortion being butchered and possibly murdered. And almost every one of the older generation of, of pro choice women has either themselves had an abortion or have ha or has had a friend who's had an abortion and they perceived it as life saving or if it was a back alley unsuccessful one as life depriving situation.

Speaker 1:          00:02:37       Both sides agree that the issue is about babies and motherhood. Prolife mother thinks that babies are so precious that whenever they come they will be loved and wanted. There is no such thing as an unloved or unwanted baby. A pro choice mother thinks the babies are so precious that they should only be had when the woman really wants the baby and it's a situation in life where they have the resources to kick, take care of the baby. Both sides agree that the issues about sex, uh, prolife woman thinks that sexist, so special that it should be guarded by strong religious and social controls so that it always has an almost sacred character. The pro choice woman thinks sex is so special that it should be freed of worry about pregnancy and disease so that it can be enjoyed as a unique sharing of intimacy. Both sides agree that the issues about the status of women prolife women think that women are so important that they're special life role of motherhood must be protected.

Speaker 1:          00:03:42       Pro Choice. Women think that women are so important that they should have every bit as much control over their lives. Over their life roles as men have. So just viewed in that way. The, the, one of the interesting things about this abortion debate is that the two sides, and if you really get down to what the fundamental values of the two sides are, they don't, they're not different. They apply them differently. They were thinking of different instances of different real situations in which to apply these rather same kind of fundamental human values. All right, well obviously this is not a philosophy course and not in the slightest set up to debate the pros and cons of abortion. And that's also a kind of sterile debate. Uh, anybody, has anybody changed their mind about abortion since they were the hydro grasshopper in the class and when know which direction you were, one has changed her mind.

Speaker 1:          00:04:39       Okay. Two has changed in a, that's a, that's high ratio. Does anybody know anybody who's changed their minds except for yourself? Of course. One or two more people, two or three, another one. So, depending, I mean, there's so much about abortion out there and yet people's attitude toward it is said very early in life by again, these very fundamental images of what we're talking about when we talk about abortion. And no matter how it's argued, people basically don't change their opinions. So, uh, so I'm not going to debate pros and cons, uh, at all. I'm going to give you as many facts about abortion as, as I can explain to you the demography in the biology, in the statistics and, and all of that kind of stuff. So there's a number of important things that you should know about abortion. And the first of it that it induced abortion is common.

Speaker 1:          00:05:39       It's a very frequent situation in the world. There's one abortion for every 3.2 live births. So a very odd, that's, that's one, two, three, uh, each year, about 3% of women in childbearing ages, uh, have an abortion. And if you consider a 30 year reproductive lifespan with each woman having a 3% chance each year, that's 90%. That means that in the world, uh, the average woman has a 0.9 chance very close to one. Basically for every woman in the world, uh, there's one abortion, uh, in, in, in the her reproductive lifetime. Of course, this is an average. Some women have many more and some women have none.

Speaker 1:          00:06:31       There are three, actually three or four standard ways of measuring and expressing the frequency of abortion. Uh, one is simply the number of abortions in the world or in the country or whatever you want. And the latest estimate, all of, of the latest these lay Desmond come from 2003 about every five years, uh, people trying to tally up, uh, abortion statistics from around the world. And it's a very difficult job because, uh, wherever it's illegal, you're very great. Difficulty getting statistics. In many places they were, especially with this religious opposition to abortion, they, uh, the statistics included as menstrual regulation. That means a woman has missed her MNCs. And of course everyone knows that's not a good thing. So you have to restore the MNCs and you do exactly what's in the abortion. And everybody in the country will understand what's going on. But the statistic is menstrual regulation.

Speaker 1:          00:07:35       So depending on what's happening in the country, usually have to add, one part of the government says is about minster regulation to another part which says abortion. Anyway, there's lots of problems in in collecting these numbers, but uh, they're probably fairly decent cause they very sophistic demographically very of sophisticated people are the ones that try to make these best estimates. So the number of abortions in the world is now considered to be 42 million per year and the number has stayed in that range. The 40 to 50 million range for at least the last two decades when there's fairly good collection of this statistics. So that's the number. The abortion rate is defined as the abortion spur a thousand women in reproductive ages, which is usually taken us 15 to 44 or 15 to 49 for the world. It's 29 per thousand. So every year per thousand women, 29 have had an abortion.

Speaker 1:          00:08:36       That's the 3% that I mentioned earlier. If it was 30 it will be exactly 3% both the highest rate and the lowest rates are found in Europe. Western Europe has 12 abortions per thousand women per year. Eastern Europe has four times as many 44 per thousand women per year, so it's interesting that the whole world within Europe, which we sometimes consider a cultural entity, it isn't with respect to abortion, the highest and lowest numbers are found in Europe. Another way of expressing it as the abortion ratio, which is the abortions per hundred live births, and that's what I told you before, one abortion for every 3.2 live births in the world, that comes out to 31 per 100 and this ranges from a 12 and middle Africa. It's, it's a, it's a low rate to 105 in eastern Europe. Again, Eastern Europe has the highest in the world, no debt, 105 we're talking about abortions per Leiper's. When you have 105 abortions per hundred live births, there are more abortions than live births, so a at a hundred a hundred half of pregnancies are terminated with an abortion.

Speaker 1:          00:09:58       Interestingly, the abortion rate is the same, is very, very closely the same independent of whether you're in a developing country or a developed country. The rate and developed countries is 26 per thousand and in developing countries is 29 per thousand. Not A, not a huge difference. Uh, China, which everyone worries about the forced abortions there has about 20% of the world's population and has about 20% of the world's abortions. Another, the last number that I'll tell you about the people calculate is what's called the total abortion rate, which is calculated exactly in the same way as the total fertility rate, but you take the age specific abortion rate and add it up, and it's the number of abortions that the average woman would have in her lifetime if she continues with the rates that are present at the time you collect the statistics. And again, I mentioned this in the world, it's 0.9, very close to one. The average woman will have one abortion in her lifetime. It ranges from a low of 0.21 abortion per every five women, uh, in several countries to a high of 1.7 in Cuba, almost two abortions per woman in Cuba. Well, I'll talk later about the very interesting situation in Cuba.

Speaker 1:          00:11:23       So over time, uh, as I said, the number of abortions is really on the big scale of a couple of decades staying pretty constant. But from the last compilation in 1995, the estimate was 46 million abortions and now it's down to 42 million abortions. So there's been a very small drop in the number of abortions. And where do you think all that drop has occurred? Eastern Europe and again, they had an extremely high uh, abortion rate. It was the meth mechanism, the mechanism of contraception there and they're gradually becoming accustomed to contraception. So their abortion rate is going down. Three quarters of the change in the whole world are all due to Eastern Europe. The United States looks pretty much like the rest of the world. Uh, there, there's one abortion for every 3.2 live births here, which is exactly the number that is the average for the world. The United States or 1.3 million abortions. And again, 2003 the last time this statistics collected,

Speaker 2:          00:12:34       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:12:36       there's, and the, the rate is 21.3 abortions per thousand woman.

Speaker 1:          00:12:43       If you look per woman, the u s looks a little better than a pro birth that the total abortion rate in the United States is 0.64 per women. That means two thirds of the average is two thirds of women will have an abortion during their lifetime, whereas the world is closer to one. So we have a somewhat lower rate. And again, the, the, the, the differences, the use of contraception, and I'll talk about that later. Uh, the United States, although somewhat better than the world average in this is not nearly as good as the point to remember. I said ours is 0.64, uh, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland all are down at 0.2. So less than a third of the number of abortions per woman that we have,

Speaker 2:          00:13:33       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:13:34       so cohort of a thousand women going through the reproductive life, they'll have 639, uh, abortions. And that's assuming we currently have been having a reducing rate of abortion here at presumes that that rate will stay down. So expanding out to the world again, uh, abortion can be a major method of fertility control, especially when a country first goes through its fertility transition. And one of the fastest fertility of transitions in the world was in Japan. Of all places where they have the birthrate, the birthrate in Japan was had between 1947 in 1957 in 10 years, went down to half from 34 per thousand women to 17 and it's remained at that level more or less until 1979 and now it's getting even lower. And here is,

Speaker 1:          00:14:31       this is an interesting case of Japan, so this is the years 49 member MacArthur, the u s administration of Japan was still sort of tailing down at that time and we're looking at it at a 10 year span. This is the number of pregnancies which is births plus abortions. And you'll notice that during this time, during this tenure has been, the number of pregnancies really does not change an awful lot. No, it's 20007002000 700900600 800800600 so the number of pregnancies does not change, but look what happens to abortion. It gets legalized here and very rapidly, it goes from a hundred to up to 10 times as much. Correspondingly, the births go down. So abortion goes from an insignificant fraction of births to vary so much, much closer to the number of births. So in this case it was legalization of abortion that sort of boom cause the, the, the Japanese birth rate to fall, there was no coercion involved.

Speaker 1:          00:15:41       It was purely a legalization step in many places, places abortion is the method of birth control. So in the Soviet Union, the official statistics before it fell apart where that there were five to eight, uh, abortions, lifetime per woman, uh, in the Ukraine it was 10 to 12 abortions per woman. The immigrants that come to America say that's nonsense that uh, it was 20 to 30 that everybody they know have 20 to 30 abortions lifetime. Japan also because of though they legalized abortion very early. They didn't legalize the pill until just a couple of few years ago and they legalize it when Viagra came out and the men demanded to get Viagara. They are very good national health plan. It's all free. And very careful and very good. And men wanted free Viagara and then it became politically impossible to keep women from having the, but pay for, for men's Viagara. So Japan legalized it, uh, very recently. The pill and via their abortion rate has always been extremely high.

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       Um, in some special circumstances, uh, the abortion rates are sky high. So in 1966 in Romania, there were 408 abortions for every hundred live births for abortions for every one live birth. And the history of that is very, very interesting. Uh, in the whole Soviet block, cause it was a complex of issues. Uh, contraception was legal, it was kind of available, but the manufacturing was terrible. So they had condoms in the various Soviet bloc countries, but there are so poorly made that the people called them galoshes. They just, they just didn't fit. Plus, uh, the doctors were, were, uh, working for the government and not paid very well, but they could privately outside the government statistics, they could privately do abortions and make money on it. So the doctors role pushing abortion and a variety of other reasons. We'll, we'll talk more about countries in which abortion is by far the dominant means of birth control.

Speaker 2:          00:18:04       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:18:05       Legally legal and medically performed abortion by a trained doctor is one of the safest methods of birth control. No. And here is the statistics on this. This is from the, you know, the physician's desk reference for for many years all of the birth control pills have to have this graph in it. And what do you see here? This is the annual deaths, uh, of for women per 100,000 non sterile women who are either using or not using birth control. What you noticed the really high category was the only super duper high is women over 40 who smoke. Then I did, oh and use the pill smoking use depot, that's pill. The pill is their method of contraception and they smoke. If you're over 40 and you smoke, don't use the pill. That's not a healthy thing to do for every other category of woman. The white bars are larger than any of the other bars. And the white bar is not using contraception at all. And what this tells you is if they're not using contraception, they're going to get pregnant. And that the mortality dangerous, this is death. So this is mortality. But the mortality dangers from pregnancy are a good bit higher than any of the other methods of birth control.

Speaker 2:          00:19:31       What, what year was this one?

Speaker 1:          00:19:33       This is, um, I think about 1990 and hasn't, well, what has changed is that, let me finish and I'll tell you what's changed since then. So the safest is these little black bars, which can hardly see, which is traditional contraception, which is condoms, what they're talking about, backed up by abortion. That is the safest of all of all methods. And then the other methods like a diaphragm and condom, uh, Rud, uh, pills and pills for nonsmokers abortion only, uh, are all sort of low but intermediate. So the story is, with the exception of older women who smoke, the worst thing you can do is not use any method that that's, that's dangerous. The best thing you can do is use a condom backed up by abortion. That's surprising cause there's so much popular myth out there, uh, that, that misconstrues these facts. Now what has changed is that this data was taken in the earlier days of birth control pills, which were high dose.

Speaker 1:          00:20:47       You've probably heard about this. They used to have very high dose because they were, it was new, they didn't know about it and they wanted to be sure the main thing was to prevent pregnancy. Then they realize they could get away with lower and lower doses and the pills nowadays have much lower doses. So they're much less side effects. So all of these columns will probably be way, way down from what they were. So and, and yeah, that's, that's what's, that's what's changed. Um, when you go to the developing world, uh, this is, this is United States data. When you go to the developing world, of course, pregnancy itself is much more dangerous. Childbirth is much more dangerous. So what you see is these white bars go awful lot higher depending on the country. If you're in the middle of Africa, they're very high. If you're in other places, they're pretty much like the United States level.

Speaker 1:          00:21:53       Both, both, both, all of the above. Um, okay. Not only, so this just shows you immediate mortality and it's clear what's going on. Um, abortion apparently has no longterm clinical effects whatsoever. There's no physical effects. It, again, we're talking about proper medically done abortion, sterile abortions, uh, properly done. They're no long term clinical effects, neither physical nor psychiatric there. It doesn't make a women sterile. It doesn't increase the chance of sterility and it doesn't cause you to go crazy later. None of that stuff is statistically true. Of course, there are women who either having an abortion, not having an abortion, go through all these bad events, but statistically they're the same. The number of women have had an abortion and eventually go sterile will be the same as those who have not had an abortion and eventually go sterile. Now that's a medical sequelae. What the emotional content of having an abortion?

Speaker 1:          00:22:59       That varies tremendously depending. It varies tremendously by country. We'll talk about some countries where it's an absolutely like a nonevent having an abortion and other, other places. And other individuals where if their own ethics, their own morality, their own desire for a child, their religion, if it really is opposed to abortion, then there can be a lot of emotional difficulty with it. But that's not, uh, a thing to do with the abortion itself. It's to do with the, so we say the moral context in which that woman perceives the abortion to have been done long with this. Um, the, so you have these generally quite high rates of abortion around the world. And the question is what are the determinants of that? Right? What makes the rate higher? What makes the rate lower? Uh, many people believe that religious prescription that the religions, religion of the country is what is the determining factor.

Speaker 1:          00:23:58       But it's not, uh, it's for instance, in Europe, among Catholic countries, Belgium has one of the lowest rates in the world. A 6.8 per thousand and Hungary and other Catholic country has one of the highest 34.7 per thousand. So your, your span, the whole range among Muslim countries, Bangladesh is one of the lowest rates. A 3.8 wild Turkey has six or seven times that rate. And again, the Bangladesh rate is a little confused because of the, they use a lot of menstrual regulation there. The U s largely been, certainly not exclusively Protestant country, has about the same rate as Turkey. So which is a strick is essentially all Muslim. Of course, uh, people believe that, uh, the Catholic Church of course teaches that abortion is a mortal sin. It's murder. But in the u s the abortion rate for protestants, which has 17 per thousand is lower than for Catholics, 24 per thousand. And as far as one can tell, Catholics because of church becomes slightly under use birth control. So as a compensation they slightly, uh, overuse abortion. Uh, the, the error bars and all these basically mean that there's barely detectable difference between say Protestants and Catholics within America, within one, any one country. Uh, so there's two, two issues of why the Catholic rate is higher. Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:25:30       this is per thousand. Those are numbers per thousand per thousand women of reproductive age, not per thousand babies. So, uh, the kind of a thing is most is, most of the difference in that statistic is that there's a large Hispanic population in America, which happens to be Catholic and as a higher abortion rate than native born women. So that is the most of the reason why the Catholic rate is higher.

Speaker 1:          00:25:57       It's also, you can't tie it down to a legal prescription whether abortion is legal or not legal. You can't tie that down as a determining factor in abortion either. About half of the abortions in the world are illegal and the old, it's the old statistics use the word illegal. But now there is such a variety of, of legal rules and that was such a variety of situations in each country where, where it's legal or not. And now different states and different cards, like in Mexico, Mexico City has one law in each state can have a very different laws. So it gets to be very difficult to describe legality. And that's all tied in with with safety, which we'll come back to. And you'll see to six about safe abortion sometimes says about legal abortion and they're usually, they fit right on top of each other. So about half of the abortions in the world are illegal, the other half are illegal.

Speaker 1:          00:26:56       Um, so for instance, in Europe, abortionist is generally legal everywhere under a very wide range of conditions. It's abortion rate is 28, uh, per thousand in Africa where it's illegal almost everywhere. Uh, it's 29. So again, uh, no, no difference. The lowest rates in the world or in western and northern Europe were abortionists accessible with few restrictions. So the total, basically the total legality of abortion is in a place where the rates are very low. Up to 2007, abortion was banned in Mexico, so it was totally illegal everywhere in Mexico. Nevertheless, uh, the number of abortions rose by 50% between 1,990 and 2006 with a constant legal situation of illegality. And in 2006, Mexico's abortion rate was 40% higher than the u s rate, uh, next door. And so here you have three countries that are on the line. Canada, the US and Mexico. Canada has a much lower in the United States is in the middle and Mexico and those two are legal in Mexico.

Speaker 1:          00:28:08       It's illegal and it has the highest rate of all. So, but of course, I should warn you and probably realize that that saying that, that uh, abortion doesn't, he can't use that. The legal thing is not the determining factor. These, these intercontinent comparisons from your country comparisons are not terribly informative because so many between say Mexico and the United States in between Africa and Europe, there are so many variables, so many socioeconomic variables, education, medical care, standard of living. All of this varies tremendously. And the difference in abortion rates is not to be found in the legal or illegal nature of it, but in some of those other characteristics.

Speaker 1:          00:28:53       Okay. Uh, in most countries, abortion is legal. And as of a few years ago, 61% of the world's people lived in countries where abortion is permitted, uh, uh, basically without restriction or in a wide range of, of reasons. Only 25% live in places where abortion is largely illegal. These are largely Latin America, some of the Muslim countries in sub Saharan African countries, abortion is becoming a legal in more places. Uh, from 1985 to 98, 19 nations significantly liberalized their abortion laws and only Poland Dee Dee legalized abortion, which had to do with its independence basically from the Soviet Union. At the time there was 85 to 98. From 98 to 2007. Again, the latest data, 16 nations liberalized their abortion laws and two territories in one state in Australia liberalized its abortion laws. And, uh, in Mexico I mentioned Mexico or Mexico City has now made abortion in the first 12 weeks, uh, legal and that was in 19. In 2007, I believe. And then a few states and Mexico has followed that. So Mexico is now split, uh, place, uh, in this, uh, 98 to 2007 timeframe, uh, El Salvador and Nicaragua, which already had a very restrictive abortion laws when to absolute under no circumstances abortions, totally no, no rape, no death, health of the mother and no exceptions in Nicaragua and El Salvador.

Speaker 1:          00:30:40       In contrast to the safety of legal abortion where abortions are when it's legal, it's almost always done. Proper medical situation. Uh, when it's illegal, it's an extremely dangerous procedure. Uh, there's, I'm like 67,000 abortion related deaths a year and that leaves 220,000, a quarter million children, uh, without their mothers. As you may know, when it's illegal, the main procedure is inserting something up the uterus and scraping around to try to dislodge the, the, the endometrium and, and, and the, um, and the fetus. Well, if you're scraping around in there with a pointed stick or a hanger or something, you're liable to puncture of the uterine wall and make a hole between the inside of the uterus, which is open through the vaginal canal to the outside and the peritoneal cavity, the inside of your body. And so infection gets through that. And so the main route isn't the main reason why abortion, illegal abortion is so dangerous, is that non sterility of whatever it is that's inserted a plus, it's pointed usually, and the break right through the uterine wall.

Speaker 1:          00:31:58       In addition, you may know that the flow Pian tube is open into the peritoneal cavity because the, uh, the ovary, which releases the egg is, is it sits right on top of the Fallopian Tube and the egg is released into the peritoneal space just to the body fluid here. And it's supposed to drop down into the Fallopian tube and Cilia push it down. But that's an opening. So if you get something unsterile in, into the womb and then the bacteria can swim upstream and you're into the body and then you to antisepsis and you very likely die. Um, so, uh, it's, uh, it's a very dangerous procedure when done, uh, not, not properly. Um, the, the very good statistics, uh, showing that the main determinant of the maternal death rate from abortion is legal status. So I think I have this. So here again, no, I don't think I showed this slide.

Speaker 1:          00:33:03       So here is, uh, places where abortion is legal. Here's the abortion rate. This goes, it goes back to saying that the legal situation doesn't determine the rate of abortion here. Various, uh, uh, abortion legal places and the rate is about six to 26 and here it's illegal. Uh, and he had the range of 23 to 52, so, you know, ballpark double or triple this, right, so it's illegal. These are all South America. This is all Europe, Japan, Australia, United States, very developed countries, countries that are partially developed, shall we say. So the legality correlates with the, the, the abortion rate, but it's almost certainly not the cause. Certainly being illegal is not causing these high abortion rates. But now when you go over and look at the maternal deaths, you see that there are there 10, the developed regions have an average of 10, whereas in Latin America you have up in 102 hundred and even up to 300 range.

Speaker 1:          00:34:11       You go to Africa, 650. So they are, the illegality really does make a difference in the maternal death rate. That's, that's the dominant effect of, of, of making something illegal is, doesn't change the abortion rate. We have a number of examples, but it changes the maternal death rate very, very clearly. The most extreme example of this, and the clearest example of this is us from Romania. Romania had, uh, uh, during, after World War Two when it was a Soviet puppet state, uh, as I told you, the abortion rate was extraordinarily high, like four abortions for every one live birth. And because the, the, the, the, well, they had a dictator then Nick Nicolae Ceausescu who you undoubtedly have heard of, and he decided that for the glory of Greater Romania, there should be more Romanians. He wanted a big, strong state. So he went on a pro natalist campaign.

Speaker 1:          00:35:14       Uh, abortion was immediately criminalized. Um, uh, contraceptives became very hard to get. They wouldn't import them, they didn't manufacture them. Uh, so what he did is that all women between 18 and 45 were rounded up at their workplace. Remember this? A socialist state, so almost all the women worked. They're rounded up at their workplace and subjected to a gynecological examination. And if they were not pregnant, they had to explain to the, to the, to the government why they were not pregnant. So it was about as intrusive a pro natalist campaign. As you can imagine, it's, it's somewhat the mirror image of China's Eh, anti birth campaign. Romania had the blessed campaign anyway. Uh, what happened immediately? Uh, so previously 80% of pregnancies had been ending. It had been terminated with abortion, abortion disappears and it was legal. Abortion had been legal and boom, the birth rate does indeed go up.

Speaker 1:          00:36:16       Nothing like by a factor of five, but something like a factor of two as our, as I remember. But I want you to check that. Um, and, but then very rapidly women's set up networks of illegal abortion providers and the birth rate goes up and the, and the birth rate comes back down and an ends up somewhat higher than it had been beforehand, but not enormously higher. But the maternal death rate is, is what changed. It rose a to 200 per 100,000 live birth from, from a, a number in a developed country. You know, something in the tens or twenties, it range to 10 times that amount. The infant mortality rate because there's mothers didn't want these children. Presumably the infant mortality rate, uh, rose to 83 deaths per thousand from uh, like uh, Chapin's rate is 4.8. The U S is 8.9 so it rose to 83. So and again something like a 10 times increase in infant mortality.

Speaker 1:          00:37:24       So the main effect of d legalizing abortion was a temporary rise in the number of births, but a long term increase in maternal mortality and infant. We're talking massive, massive increase when by the time abortion abortion of course when they got a free of the dictator it was legalized again. And then by that time things have come back a little normal but still the maternal death rate, as soon as they legalized abortion, the maternal death rate dropped by a factor of three. So that's Romania is one example. In South Africa, you route more recently, this was in the late sixties, the remaining his story. And in South Africa the abortion law was liberalized and the incidents of maternal infection boot abortion dropped dropped in half. So in all cases, uh, the major effect of making abortion illegal is an increase in complications of abort. You don't change the abortion rate, but complicated medical complications, death of the mother, death of the infants, the fundamental cause I would have been going through things that are not the cause of the high abortion rates.

Speaker 1:          00:38:38       It's not the religion that's not the legality. The fundamental causes. A kind of obvious is unintended pregnancy. And you may remember that these, they're very high rates of unintended pregnancy. Oh, here is a comparison of two regions, uh, almost all legal in the developed countries and in almost all of Africa it's illegal. And the death rates an enormous, enormous difference there. So you may remember these statistics just just to refresh your memory about unwanted, uh, fertility. So this is 71% of living. Women want to stop having children. Yet as I showed you before, they, they have more, they, they continue to have children because they're not using contraception. They don't have enough contraception. And here are around, that's Bolivia. And this is from previous lecture around the world. Remember, this is the line where people, this is how many children people are having. This is how many they want.

Speaker 1:          00:39:38       This is the line where they're equal. All countries, all developing countries are having more children that they want. So there's a large amount of unmet unmet need in the world and the estimate for the world's 108 million, uh, women. Uh, and these, since there's an unmet need, these women who don't want to have more children, he had do that results in some 51 million unintended pregnancies. And of those using contraceptive, another 25 million happened as a result of incorrect or inconsistent use of contraception or method failure. So you have something like 80 million unwanted pregnancies in the, the world is 210 million pregnancies annually. And about 40% of them are unplanned. And about a quarter of an, we know from a lot of places that when there's an unplanned pregnancy, about a quarter of them end in abortion. So the main, uh, sequence is unwanted pregnancy and then hi abortion rate. And uh, most most unintended pregnancies in the world, uh, well most unintend print in the developed countries.

Speaker 1:          00:40:58       So there's difference here between developed and undeveloped countries. Contraception is, is very available and in highly used in the developed world. So in the developed world, most unintended pregnancies are of people who are using contraception and using it fairly accurately. But there's a method, a failure that the contraception just just fails. And you have to remember that a woman is fertile for say 30 years of her life and she has 12 sites, 12 monthly cycles in a year, a little bit more actually because the cycle is 20 days and principle. But that's close enough. And so in order to, to not have an unintended pregnancy, her contraception must be law be perfect for 30 years, 12 cycles a year. That's an awful lot to expect of the contraceptive. And just contraceptives, you know, or just not, not that good. So in developed countries also, uh, the main reason for unintended pregnancy, it's very heavily, it's married women who are using contraception.

Speaker 1:          00:42:04       They usually have several children already and the contraception fails. That's, that's the main reason in developed countries, in developing countries where contraception uses is less prevalent. The main reason is not non use of contraception, the very strong relationship between contraception and abortion. So, so we have a country, most country in the world with this unmet need, women before you start collecting statistics, want fewer children than they're having. Uh, but it's not a big deal. Then something changes could be an economic, we've discussed the reasons of cultural change and economic change, whatever. And people really start wanting to have fewer children. So this happened around 1964 in Korea. And you read, you know, I gave you one of the stories about an example of how this happens in Korea. And what happens is, as women, as the whole culture changes from wanting the sort of a maximum rate of fertility to wanting a lower rate of fertility, the contraception, the abortion rate picks up first. Because in all these countries, abortion is a traditional method. The women know it and are moderately comfortable with it. So you see first the abortion rate starts going up. Then with a short lag, the contraception rate goes up. It goes all the countries establish a national family planning programs.

Speaker 1:          00:43:33       And what happens as people use more abortion news, Morgan's contraception, so they're reducing their fertility, but the rate of drop of desired fertility can be so fast that that even the psalm of contraception, abortion can't keep up with it. So both rates keep rising. Eventually you peak where abortion peaks and starts falling down. Contraception continues onward. So this is the time when the demand to have less fertility is more than either method alone can cope with, but eventually women and abortion is easier cause the post, it's a, it's an after the fact, uh, method. But eventually women learn to use contraception views, learn to use it and use you learned to use it properly. And so then the abortion rate declines as the contraception rate continues on up to very high levels. Most of the difference here is women who want to get get pregnant, something.

Speaker 1:          00:44:35       So you have this trade off, you have an early stage, both of them rise together and her later stage they do very divergent things and you'll see, uh, when you've got a Prelim polemicizing discussion of this, what you hear is that right to life people say, oh, contraception is no good abortion rises with contraception. And they use statistics from this half and half. People who are pro choice say no, no, no or pro contraception. No, no, no. It goes this way and they use this half of the graph. But you get both of these things. And Korea is one example. Here is another example of the relationship between contraception and abortion in Bangladesh. So here is member Mont Lob where you read about my lab, where they chose some villages and got a very strong family planning program. And then other villages where they left alone as a control region. They had family panic because it had the government program.

Speaker 1:          00:45:32       The government program wasn't any near as good as the intervention program. So here's the control region and a lot, a lot to see here. So first of all, this is desired fertility and that starts, uh, at this level and drops down to somewhat more than half desired fertility in the Matlab region that was started about the same level and falls about the same amount. So the difference in the terrain is not desired fertility. The actual fertility rate drops here, starts higher and drops a little faster here. So that ends up not very different. So again, the difference is not the actual amount of fertility, which the number of births is an enormously difference between the two regions. But in the MOD law, in the, uh, the experimental region, the region where they had the good program, the contraceptive prevalence goes very high. It goes rapidly, very high from something like 30% more than doubles to 70%.

Speaker 1:          00:46:34       Whereas in the other read the non girl region, you have it starts much lower it, it's, this rises very rapidly. This doesn't change at all for a number of years. Then the government actually the government improves its programming, jumps up a little bit, it jumps up a little bit. So it's the contraceptive. This is a really big difference. The contraceptive prevalence is much lower in the control region then in the experimental region. And the result is here's the abortion ratio, uh, in the region where the contraceptive prevalence is very high. And here the abortion ratio goes crazy where they don't have, they're not using contraception, uh, efficiently. And again, here you can see in those two regions, the same country, same time neighboring villages, neighboring districts, uh, that the, the, there's this trade off. They either use contraception or they was abortion in both places. They're wanting fewer children as time goes on. But in one case they use contraception, you know, the case, the use abortion. Um, I think too, I have another guy from that. Here's another example of this rather different in Shanghai, and this is a more complicated, somewhat interesting case. This is the one child policy comes in. They're only allowed one child. So they have that child and then they try to do something to avoid the second child. And what they use is a contraceptive methods and they don't work. They start with very high. Uh, let me get this straight here.

Speaker 2:          00:48:12       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:48:14       they start with a low use of Iud, which is a really secure method of contraception and the abortion rate is very high and they rather rapidly learn that IUD only really secure way of not getting pregnant and then the abortion rate falls down. So it's another rather different situation in which again, the abortion rate in the contrast and the effect of constants, contraceptive rate are mirror images of each other. When you have a high high rate of effective contraception, you have a low rate of abortion. So, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:48:59       so Latin America shows the same pattern, uh, in Latin America, abortion has been practiced for centuries. It a certainly practice by, by the Incas and the Aztecs in 1551, the bishop of Venezuela reported to the King of Spain that the natives did not want their children to become slaves. So they boarded them. 1551, Chile has very good medical statistics at the beginning of chilies, uh, fertility transition in the 1960s, uh, 23% of Chilean women voluntarily admitted to having an, uh, an induced abortion. Again, remember, Chile is very heavily Catholic country and this is not really delving into medical records and making any cracking. Just asking them whenever you had an abortion. And a quarter of them say, yes, I've had had an abortion. And not only did they have an abortion, but most of them had more than one abortion. Up to three, 8.4% of the women had more than seven abortions. This is, this is early on,

Speaker 2:          00:50:03       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:50:05       10 years later in the 70s. Now it's, we're women, uh, are really into their fertility decline. They don't want the children. Uh, the average woman has almost three abortions, uh, lifetime. So that that goes up. And again, those are the openly admitted numbers and the real numbers must have been much higher. And again, in elsewhere, uh, in, in Chile, almost all the women were married, almost all middle class women and they already had had four to six pregnancies and they already had children and good an experience with pregnancy in terms of socioeconomic levels. Middle class women had more abortions than working class women married women had a greater abortion rate than those living in temporary unions, just casual unions. And in all through all of this time, uh, abortion was completely illegal and Chilean and it's still, uh, it's still is going next door to lean to Peru, uh, in Lima in the 1970s, again, the time when the fertility rate was going down, when people were wanting fewer children in Peru, the yearly increase in the abortion rate was 24% every year. And there's 24% increase in abortion. And in any given year, a quarter to a third of the reproductive age women would have abortions. It's one out of four. One out of three women every year would have an an abortion.

Speaker 2:          00:51:32       Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:51:33       again, it's in this, the, the, the really high abortion rates or when women are sort of, families are starting to want fewer children and haven't yet really figured out how to use contraception. Uh, in Contemporary Latin America, uh, abortion, although it's illegal almost everywhere and it's almost universally a catholic place. Uh, abortion is very widespread. Uh, Latin Americans as a whole has one abortion for every two live births. Remember worldwide and the U S it's one per 3.2. Latin America has one for every two live births and eventually there's a generational change and the younger women start using contraception and then the abortion rate starts to fall. Oh, okay. Oh, the Philippines and other example.

Speaker 2:          00:52:34       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:52:42       Maybe. So in the Philippines, uh, have a very interesting situation of the politics. There's a, there's a strong interrelationship between the politics of the country, uh, the Catholic Church and the citizens use of, of contraception. And when Ferdinand Fidel Ramos was president, one of the early very populous presidents, he supported family planning and a quarter of the Filipino women were using a modern method. And since then, the desired fertility has gone down in, in, in the Philippines. And now more than half of Filipino women want some form of birth control. But the presidency has changed. And a woman of Gloria or royal mockup, a girl came in and since, uh, Ferdinand Marcos was a strong dictator and they had strong presidencies, but then when he was kicked out for massive corruption, uh, uh, and, and dictatorial means they now have democratic elections and the governments have been quite weak. They don't have much popular support.

Speaker 1:          00:53:50       And so the government needs to get legitimacy from somewhere. And this Cape, they get legitimacy from the Catholic Church because they're the Philippines, very Catholic country. And so I'm fairly open deal was made between mockup a gall and, um, and the, the Archbishop of, of the Philippines that the church will support you if you make abortion illegal and, and get rid of the family planning programs. And so now the government and that was taken and she got elected. And now the government, uh, uh, only supports traditional family planning methods, which is withdrawal basically. Uh, and so, and this had an effect. So from like 93 to 98 and a five, six year period, the use of traditional methods went up by 50%. Well, the use of modern methods, uh, didn't actually didn't change much, but when the government pushes something, it often goes up. And all of those women, the traditional methods just plain don't work.

Speaker 1:          00:54:51       So there, so the result was that the number of abortions in Philippines in the easiest increased, uh, by 19% from 400,000 was already high, from 400,000 went up to basically a half a million abortions, and they're all illegal. Of course. Okay. As I said in the beginning, in America, abortion is a great source of controversy. This is not, uh, not always the case. So in a lot of places, so, uh, there's, there's a lot of literature now on with called the culture of abortion. Those countries for whom abortion has the noncontroversial, uh, uh, noncontroversial place as a mechanism of fertility crow, just as contraception has a more or less noncontroversial place as a form of fertility control and say, Europe and America. So, uh, I got invited to a few years back to talk to the women's health class about abortion. And uh, it was one of the things we've talked about.

Speaker 1:          00:55:59       And uh, afterwards I was talking with some students and a professor with the next class walks in and he turned out to be from Russia and he asked us, you know, what are you're talking about? And the students had, they started asking me questions about something about abortion and he was really puzzled. He said, abortion, why is anybody interested in math? Because in Russia, just an ordinary, absolute ordinary kind of thing in like Romania. And I'm sure this is to some degree true and probably the whole East Eastern Europe, you remember I mentioned to you the old theory that the health of the body, it depends on the humors of that. You've got the four humors and bio and collar and all this and stuff. And it's the balance that's important and you have to reestablish and what the menstrual period does. Everyone knows the worst fluid is fee, menstrual fluid.

Speaker 1:          00:56:46       And so you've got to get rid of that. And if you don't, if you're not periodically getting rid of menstrual fluid, the bad spirits, humors, fluids build up in you and you get unhealthy. So in places like Romania, many people older, less educated people believe that it's good to have an abortion every so often having nothing to do with pregnancy even, which is good to do that, to, to get rid of this evil humor. And that has persisted as well as a lot of other really unbelievable, almost unbelievable to us medical myths. And as part of the reason for that very, very high abortion rate in Romania and the Ukraine, when the Soviet Union fell apart, uh, the family planning programs that they had also fell apart. And so the whole area was left without effective family planning and the International Planned Parenthood Federation, the nearest office was in Bangkok. And so they couldn't, they couldn't help very much.

Speaker 1:          00:57:48       And what they did is they said, okay, we'll take just the city of Moscow cause it's most cost effective to, to work in a city with a lot of people. You don't have geographic issues. And we'll try to provide some contraception in Moscow, but that left all the other Soviet bloc countries with nothing. And the Planned Parenthood Federation of Connecticut here, I was associated with them at the time. Uh, con contact with the Ukraine. The only crane was like lefty raft of kind of separate and gut [inaudible] got in touch with the, the main, uh, the head in the university, uh, in Kev, the, the head of the Ob Gyn Department of very nice woman and uh, started to help her provide, uh, you know, just by contraceptives here in ship, my broad, actually we buy them internationally very cheap. A cycle of pills is 80 cents. In the world market.

Speaker 1:          00:58:37       A condom is like a penny and a half. A diaphragm has to dollar dollar and a quarter. So if you buying them United States, they're expensive, you buy them in India, wherever they're made, things are a lot cheaper. So we can really help Ukraine a lot. What they wanted first was cause you can't use any of these things if this pelvic infections. So they wanted a monistat and other treatments for pell, for a vaginal infections as a, as a first line, and then they could start dealing with contraception. So Anyway, um, this program went on but it wasn't very successful. And the reason was the women were using abortion and quite happy with it. They didn't see anything wrong with it. They were used to it and no problems. So why should we change? And so one of the things that, that they did and we helped them was we got, uh, some of these rights to life films, which show in the glorious way, the way you know, the foot the fetus looks like and what an abortion is like.

Speaker 1:          00:59:32       And you really are way, way off the deep end and ship them to them so they could show their patients that you see in is not just this sort of nothing, uh, kind of event. The most interesting case might be Cuba, which has, uh, one of the highest abortion rates in the world, 78 per thousand women per year compared to Canada, which is 15 and a half, for instance. Again, that's the two sides of the United States and almost 60% of what they call known pregnancies are terminated by abortion. So they have a long history. Before 1938, they were very much tied culturally to Spain. And Spain was very, uh, conservative. That was Franco, uh, era of very, very right wing fascist, a catholic dictatorship. And so all in, in the Spanish law, all forms of abortion, uh, induced abortion were illegal. And Cuba just use that, that same law, uh, in 30 and it was up til 1938 and 38 they liberalized a little bit for a rape, uh, likelihood of death of the mother or severe fetal malformation, uh, issues.

Speaker 1:          01:00:45       But despite these restrictions that it was the mechanism of birth control in Cuba, and it was used widely by all the social classes. Well, I'll tell you an exception to that, uh, by poor people. And it was used in the cities and in the countryside. So, so abortion was, it. Contraception starts coming in, but it's a foreign product and it's expensive and you need some medical knowledge to use it. So only the upperclass uses, uh, contraception at this time, used contraception in, in Cuba. And at that time, very, very, you know, a few people owned all the sugar plantations in everyone else's, basically a slave on the sugar plantations. So the social gulf between the rich people are using contraception and the poor people using abortion was enormous and they didn't talk to each other. So there was no social diffusion of the ideas of contraception so that people just continued using contraception.

Speaker 1:          01:01:42       1959, Fidel Castro has this revolution and he takes over. And in the beginning he's antiabortion and he still is. Uh, and, and a lot of events happen that I'm simplifying a complicated history, but in 1962, the United States places in the Margo on Cuba, including medical supplies. And guess what? The Cubans can't get contraception because the United States was there. Their sources supply. So abortion gets, gets more entrenched. The embargo might have done the biggest thing to raise Cuban abortion rates. No one has good statistics on that. So, uh, well, abortion is legal in Cuba. The government really wants to, uh, reduce it. Castro, ninth, 1998, the pope visited Cuba as you probably nay remember from all the headlines. And he talked against abortion. And shortly after that, Castro gave a seven hour lecture worse than me, a seven hour lecture condemning abortion as a method of birth control.

Speaker 1:          01:02:44       And he said it was his duty as a public figure and the revolutionary leader to oppose widespread abortion but didn't have any effect on the people. And it's very interesting. They've, they've, there's now a wonderful article in which actually should have assigned to you, um, about what's going on in Cuba, but you have too much reading already. And so, uh, the medical is the government in the medical establishment want to get people wean people off abortion. And so in these interviews, one of the things they ask the respondents were women of all ages and men of all ages. Uh, well, what have you heard from doctors and healthcare professionals? Well, that it's dangerous that you can die from it, but just a man that's, that's what she's heard from the festival. But just imagine if you had to give birth every time you got pregnant.

Speaker 1:          01:03:35       I got pregnant, had an abortion when I was 15, even though I was on the pill. I also got pregnant earlier when I was using an Iud. This is a woman who at the time of the injury was age 30 and she had, this was after her fourth abortion. And so the people's perception is very different than what they're hearing from the medical establishment and the government establishment. It's an absolutely an unremarkable subject for discussion. One male who is now age 49 said I was about 10 years. You know, they ask you what have you have you do hear about abortion as it is? It discussed it and he says, uh, sure. I was about 10 years old. I heard about abortion from people on the street also in my house. My mom talked about it with their friends in front of me. Uh, another respondent around the streets.

Speaker 1:          01:04:27       Abortion is a common thing people talk about. It's an everyday thing. A male age 23. Um, do you know the, the tumor, do you know anyone in your family? Among your friends who's had an abortion? Yes. And the antique mine. What did she tell you that you don't feel anything that they give you the anesthetic and stuff. Everything goes fine. That was a woman of 18 who's just had her first abortion. Another responded, yes. Friends of mine. They told me that they had it done and then you don't feel anything. That was uh, a 15 when you're a 15 year old girl. Her first abortion, another respondent. My cousin had an abortion. She told me that nothing out of the ordinary happened, that everything went well. This is a female age 21 on her second abortion? No, the responded when I was in school, a friend of mine had an abortion. She was fairly young, around 13 old because we in the eighth grade. What did she tell you? How did it go? She told me it went well and set the anesthetic was fine. Girls talk about that kind of stuff. This was a 31 year old woman on her fourth abortion.

Speaker 1:          01:05:33       Another respondent. Have you heard to the question, have you heard much talk about abortion? Oh yes. Among girls at school, they don't use anything. Meaning they don't use any contraceptive. So when they get pregnant, they go to get an abortion. They talk about it like it's nothing. It's like drinking a glass of water. Some people have problems when they get an abortion, but most people don't. Almost always the procedure goes fine. That's a 17 year old girl after her first abortion. It's a very interesting case because while their, their experience, they're hearing one thing from the government, the same thing for the medical community. But they know lots and lots of people have had abortion as a common subject and they're not hearing about any difficulties from an, or, very rarely are they. So the government pushing comes to them and they use contraception. What's really at 92% of the Cuban women have used contraception at some time or another.

Speaker 1:          01:06:27       And even among adolescent girls who obviously having a very rich sex life, cause they're getting pregnant all the time, um, uh, 84% have used some form of contraception, but it doesn't mean anything to them because they're just as happy with abortion. So they're not, they're not worried about getting pregnant. So they sometimes use contraception. They sometimes don't. And there their reports of when they use it, or almost totally haphazard, they'll use it for a while, they'll stop using it, they'll start again and they change methods and it doesn't even have anything. So of course women go through periods and men to know when their interrelationship having sex or just having a lot of casual sex. And the woman will tell you this. And the use of contraception did not correlate at all with periods when the women were having sex. So just a total disconnect.

Speaker 1:          01:07:15       And undoubtedly the reason is that they're perfectly happy with abortion and it's a fine backup. So they don't have to be terribly careful about using contraception. And in fact, as much as they're hearing, uh, that abortion is no big deal, uh, they're hearing that, that the other forms of contraception are really not very pleasant. So here's more answers to survey questions. I don't like the pill because extra hormones in a woman's body, a male age 19 says that woman, and this is a woman. No, I don't use any IUD because my body can't support it. It falls out of place. So you have used an Iud in the past? Yes. I had an Iud two different times and both times it fell out of place. I have problems with our yards. That's a 37 year old woman on her second abortion. Iud causes pain to women.

Speaker 1:          01:08:12       After my first pregnancy I had an IUD inserted, but I had to have it removed because it was causing pain. I started having problems with my period and a lot of inflammation. And when I had sex it was painful. So I had the IUD removed. Female Age 35. Her first abortion. I had an IUD before I had her for two years. Uh, but I had it removed because I had abnormal menstrual bleeding, a 42 year old woman, fourth abortion, no other woman. Sometimes we'll use protection, but the condom broke. You explained these things to the doctors and they say that, that this doesn't happen, but I'm telling you it's not a lie. Sometimes condoms are bad and they break some 19 year old girl on, on, on her third abortion, 88%. Uh, so at the time of the survey, 88% were practicing contraception at the time of the survey. And again, among adolescents, 68% were using kind of at the time of the survey yet the contraception, they didn't like it, it wasn't effective and they were apparently just as happy, uh, with, with the abortion. Um, so, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:09:27       so it's, it's, it's a very interesting thing and this is repeated in basically all of the East European countries where again, they have long experience with abortion and they don't particularly see any benefit to contraception. Now the standard thing that you'll hear in America from everybody, you know, again, independent of, of their, you know, they can be right to life or pro choice. And the thing is that the idea is, and I've been sort of saying that here the idea is to replace abortion with contra contraception. That contraception is a better method of birth control and abortion. Uh, it's a controversial, but now it's converse. Actually, what started me really looking into this, it was a number of years ago, I was giving a lecture and I was saying very overtly that, well, it's progress when one country and when contraception replaces abortion. And, uh, no, it's, it's not so obvious because I showed you this one that the safest method is, uh, is uh, uh, uh, uh, condoms backed by abortion.

Speaker 1:          01:10:33       And it's very, it was very hard to, and so one student asked me this question about why, why is, why do you, why you think that contraception is better than abortion is a very, very hard question to answer. And I, I won't, uh, won't even try to do this today. It's, it's a very, it's a very difficult kind of issue. So the final thing that I should tell you is that, uh, one of the things we worry about is population growth rate. That abortion, uh, makes a huge difference in the global rate of population growth. As I've told you, this is, you know, ballpark 75 million increase in the world. Now, uh, if the abortion rate is about somewhere between 40 and 50 million, that means that the rate of world population increase goes up by three cut by 75% or something because abortion is such a large fraction of the birth rate, that if that if abortion disappears and is not replaced by contraception, the population growth rate goes crazy. And so, uh, in the world as it is now, there's probably not any chance of stabilizing world population, uh, without abortion. So, okay. Just on time, uh, we will continue with the biology of abortion and, and some of the history and, and philosophical considerations in the next lecture.
