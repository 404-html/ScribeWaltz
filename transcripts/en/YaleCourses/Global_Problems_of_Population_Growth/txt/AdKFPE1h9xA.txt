Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay. Um, we are now at the part of the course. We're coming up to fairly modern times. The, uh, it's been very breathless run from 6 million years of chimpanzee evolution through many, few million years of human evolution. And we're coming up to more or less than 1960s, which is the period of the, the, the greatest percentage increase in human population on earth ever. Uh, so this is the peak of what's called the population explosion and we're gonna be talking about that till almost the end of the term now. So I have to tell you, uh, a little bit, uh, truth in truth in a teaching or something. How I got interested in this topic when I was a just a little bit older than you are now. I did the fairly usual thing of going, putting on my short pants and going around the world and around Asia anyway, uh, with almost no money in my pocket.

Speaker 1:          00:01:15       And uh, you all, if you haven't ever done that, you should do it. Definitely an after you graduate college. It was a great time to do it. And one of the places I went to was Hong Kong. Now Hong Kong. At that time there were huge numbers of people coming out of China. China was still extraordinarily poor at the time and anytime anybody could leave, they left. And so Hong Kong was incredibly crowded, uh, with very poor people. And it's still incredibly crowded place of course. And migrants are still coming out, uh, if they can. So one of the, uh, what, where would these people going to live? They were hillsides with shanty towns, lots and lots of shanty towns, but also the low, the, it's right on the ocean. It's an island, a part of, it's an island. So the water is free. So many people were living in little sampans little boats called sand pans in just in the harbor dock to sort of almost anywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:02:13       And I thought, well, that's interesting. And one of my friends, I had number of Chinese friends took me to look at the boats and it was interesting. I, you know, I wasn't yet really interested in demography, but I couldn't help notice that. Basically every boat had a little girl on it, 11, 12, 13 or something, uh, maybe younger. And then, uh, we got invited on the boat one of the first, but one of the boats and uh, you know, people extremely polite even though very poor, very polite and you know, a lot of bowing and shaking hands from my part. And they wanted to offer me something, a little bit of tea, a little bit of rice cake, you know, they're just as wonderful as they could be. And I noticed that when something had to be done, like the tea, how to be gotten or this side of the other thing, it was that little girl that was doing all the work then.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       Okay, so what, that's the one of the kids that's, you know, it's good for kids to have some chores and then since you know, they didn't have television nerd, a lot of entertainment and here was this Westerner and they weren't so used to seeing a lot of westerners on their boats. I sorta got passed from boat to boat. When you go walking around the world, that's a very good thing. If you go to places where they don't see Westerners, you can get passed on very easily. So in boat after boat and this phenomenon repeated itself that there was this little girl in every boat and she seemed to be doing all the work. And so finally I asked my friends, you know, what's what's going on here? And a little hard to get the information out of them, but actual factors, the form of a, shall we say, family population control that uh, the, there, this was a non contracepting population.

Speaker 1:          00:03:58       So children just kept coming and they couldn't support the number of children that they had and they did not value girls very much. So what they did is basically they sold the girls from one boat to the next boat and then the little girls were basically servants. Again, you can use the word slave if you want, but servants in whatever boat they had been sold to. And some money changed hands. Of course, all illegal because Hong Kong was in a hundred British rules. I mean, it's legal almost everywhere anyway. Um, and, uh, they were just working, doing as much work as could be, gotten out of them. Well that was very sad. Um, but wasn't a disaster because you know, everybody was living very poorly. Then later, same trip, uh, with my medical connections, I got to tour one of the big British build Queen Elizabeth Hospital, one of these big, there's big city hospitals have ward after ward.

Speaker 1:          00:05:01       And one of the things I was taken to see tuberculosis was a very big problem back then. Leprosy was a problem with tuberculosis was a problem too. I did something stupid with leprosy. I visited, there was a leper colony on an island of Hong Kong and they were constructing stuff. And uh, and I cannot stand around what people are working in me not. So I grabbed a pitch for um, uh, a pick ax and started working with them. And of course the pick ax is rough. It's made of not terribly well polished wood. And there I was banging away with it and it rubs whatever. So, uh, uh, leprosy is a bacteria that gets into your skin and the only way to get her to get that leprosy into your skin. So, so the lepers had been working with it and rubbing it into their skin and they were rubbing it into the wood of the accident on to me, I did not, I was really stupid in retrospect, but you know, you do a lot of stupid things.

Speaker 1:          00:05:59       Um, and I did not catch leprosy in it. And in fact, by that time, uh, most they had a drug, an antibiotic against leprosy, and most of the leper leprosy, bacillus in these people were dead. So it probably wasn't quite as dangerous as, as, as, as it might have been. Anyway. I did not catch leprosy. Sorry, I'm throwing. You can shake my hand and so forth. But the people there, and you don't have the old, this is an aside, but it's about poverty and in Philadelphia. So leprosy affects the nerve cells and it doesn't make directly make your fingers or nose full off, but you don't feel wounds. So, you know, he goes, you don't have the nerve cells. So you don't take care of wounds, adventure, the fingers gets infested and infected and damaged. Damage is kind of constant and parts of you fall off actually.

Speaker 1:          00:06:47       But it's not the leprosy bacteria itself, which only attacks nerves. It's the damage that you're not paying, you're not noticing, you're not aware of. So, okay, sorry. That was an excursion. So leprosy was a big thing in Hong Kong at the time as was tuberculosis. And then the big British hospital, I went in and, and one of the things I saw was huge wards, you know, big places with again, so a ward full of these just pubescent or prepubescent girls and they all had TB. And then there was two or three of these wards actually. So very large number of girls there. And I said, what's going on? You know, and then the story, the full story came out that yes, indeed, there's a lot of selling, uh, of the, of the children between boats and, and yes, they work and because they're underfed and overworked and TB is rampant, these girls get tuberculosis. And then what happens is they take them to the health station and, and the, the doctor say, you got to build up this girl and they give them milk powder milk is taking them. What do you think they do at the milk powder

Speaker 1:          00:07:59       given to the boy child, right? So the girl gets sicker and then she's getting quite sick and she's brought back and now she's given medicine a antibiotic. And guess what happens with the medicine taking to the market? Sold money is used boy rice or millet for the boy children eventually. So TB is probably where it gets the lungs. It can also get in the long bones of the body and the venture and infects the long bones and the long bone start. There are huge amounts of pus builds up and eventually it breaks through the skin. So what someone who has a child with this kind of long bone, uh, uh, tuberculosis sees basically pus the skin, eventually breaks in the Puss, starts pouring out and uh, the parents are terribly afraid and they're afraid for their biological kids. They're biological sons especially. So as soon as this happens to the girl, they just dumped dumper at the British at, at whatever the public hospital is.

Speaker 1:          00:09:01       And um, I, and, and they just just abandoned them there. And what the doctors told me was that the girls are now 13 and 14 and the lip, the tuberculosis is so far gone that there's nothing they can do in the girls die. So this was, you know, my first introduction to that nexus of extreme poverty, extreme over crowded conditions, overpopulation. And I'm not saying the causal relationship between those two. It's a complicated story, which we will, we will get to. But that nexus of you always see whenever you see incredibly dense populations, you always see this kind of poverty and the kinds of things that people undergo, you know? Yeah. I was trying to put myself in the mind of a parent. You know, what kind of a situation of the end that they sell their, their daughters to fairly certain death. And the situation is, as I've described to you now, even though I saw this as a huge, as a very large phenomenon, a surprise, I've never seen this in the, in any literature.

Speaker 1:          00:10:10       I've never seen an academic paper about it. I've never seen a newspaper story about it. Uh, it's not discussed in demographic circles and some public health circles, which I'm aware of. I, it, it just isn't, isn't brought up. And so I'm thinking to myself, you know, I was not a, a scholar of this thing. And I said, have I miss remembered this? You very frequently you miss remember things. Have I blown up? Did I see one or two cases and have somehow aggrandizement? I eventually, after telling the story quite a bit, even in their early runnings of this class, I started doubting that this, you know, that somehow I why such a big thing, why wasn't it shown in one year I decided, okay, this is the last year. I'm not going to tell this story again because you know, I don't have any references for it and everything.

Speaker 1:          00:10:54       I, I say I try to, you know, student comes to me, I can give you a reference and you can see in the notes a lot of things have little references which you probably can't read, but if you call me or email me, I'll tell you what that little scribble means. Anyway, at the end of that lecture, actually it was about two lectures later, uh, cause it was an exam coming up right after that. After more than this class in previous years, students used to come up and we used to spend half an hour, an hour discussing whatever they want to discuss and one girl stayed by the side and then when everybody is gone, she came up to me a little bit shy and said, thank you for telling that story. My mother was one of those girls and she would, she knew from her mother was basically what I had said.

Speaker 1:          00:11:43       But the difference was that this was her bio biological mother and this wasn't an abandoned girl. She said she remembered being in the hospital with all girls, basically the mother, I'm sorry, I text him. So I said, oh my gosh, you know, would your mother come to class and describe what this situation was like? And the, and yes, the mother was in fact a professor at a college in New Jersey, not Princeton. And she came up here and, and described it and again described it in great detail, you know, more or less as, as, as I've described it. And she said that when she was in the hospital and she's all the other little girls who more or less the same age, same medical problem. And she said as a little girl, she was wondering why their parents, their mother didn't come to visit them. Why their parents didn't come to visit her.

Speaker 1:          00:12:32       She was one of the few whose, whose mother I guess the father. I don't really remember that detail. Did come to visit. Well, the doctors kind of noticed that this girl had a bio parent and so they took her out of the big ward and put a lot of incredibly special effort into this one girl. And eventually she got the bacteria out of her and survived. She was, uh, uh, you know, walk like this, missing a hip and had a fair number of, of sequella from the bone, uh, TB. Uh, but she might, she got cured, grew up, managed to get educated, migrate to America, and became a professor at, at, as I say, a college in New Jersey and had a daughter at Yale taking this course. So it's one of the miracle stories. Uh, but I'm convinced now that, and I didn't dream this stuff up.

Speaker 1:          00:13:33       Okay. So that's really my personal motivation, that star, my personal motivation for being, doing all this uh, course stuff. Now, uh, what's the word we described for this era of the sixties? The population explosion. Why do we use the word explosion? It's a rather, uh, you know, emotive kind of word and it's for this reason that here is a somewhat fanciful recreation of history, but we know it's can't be very much different than this. Cause we know what the, we start knowing what the populations were here. So we put in some sort of a reasonable growth rate in the population going to look like that. The only thing you can really see is the black death. Then as we've talked about in this class, starting roughly in the 17 hundreds population just takes off and you've heard of exponential population growth, and you may or may not know what that means, but what precisely means is there's a certain rate of growth, a certain percent per year in each year, the population grows by that same percent, 1% a year or 2% a year, 3% a year.

Speaker 1:          00:14:49       But the percentage growth is the numbers of people added every year grows because the base grows. But the percentage edit every year is constant. That's exponential growth. In fact, during this period, in fact, during most of this period, the percentage rate of growth has been increasing and an increased from somewhere out here of you know, 0.001% to then 0.0 1.1 and in this period it went up to, uh, two, even 3% global, the whole world population growth rate in this incredible, uh, ex expansion. As you can sort of see, again in this somewhat scheme, Matteis used a graph that the incredible rate of growth has slowed down a little bit and we'll, we'll talk about what that means, but it's still growing, uh, outrage or they project that, that it should slow down. This is, we are now at about 6.7 billion. So some of that graph is, is, is a projection.

Speaker 1:          00:15:56       So you can call this kind of population of hyper exponential where the, the rate, not only does the growth get faster in an exponential way way, but the rate of growth itself grows. So it's hyper exponential growth. Now there's a, the whole issue of population growth is very politicized. Uh, uh, some people don't think that we should pay. It is no problem. Some people think we shouldn't go into anything about it. Some people think it's too politically sensitive, uh, to, to, to say anything about it. And in this discussion, one of the things you hear is, oh, the world's population has been growing for a long time. We've been able to cope with it. And Arik economics is, is wonderful. We can, we've industrialized. The population has been growing and people have been getting richer. And that is certainly true since Malthus wrote, the population has multiplied many times, and yet these mass mass starvations have not happened.

Speaker 1:          00:16:57       In fact, not only as the population has grown, people have gotten richer. So they say we've coped with this in the past. We can cope with it in the future. The problem is that this is unprecedented, that we don't really have any significant length of history for something like this. So anybody who's had tells you that they have, they know what's going to happen in the future is just, he's just ignorant. This is absolutely in unknown territory, unknown territory. It doesn't mean I'm not saying they was going to absolutely be a disaster or it's absolutely going to be fine. It's just that we have no way of predicting basically anything with the population growing like that. Um, up to a few years ago, basically nobody predicted all the environmental, for instance, nobody predicted all the environmental problems that we're having now that came, uh, essentially out of the blue.

Speaker 1:          00:17:49       Now this is a scheme Matteis thing. Here's kind of a more cartoonish kind of, uh, even workout change, but it doesn't go quite so far back. So it's a little bit better data here. And again, showing the same thing. This was a, you are here, this was drawn in 2004. We're now in 2008 and we're about 6.7. So in, in the, just the four years since this was made, we're still on this trajectory. No, nothing very unexpected has happened. Here is the, uh, the US census bureau a projection, uh, uh, update December, 2008. So it's as recent as you can find for what's happened. They, they do a hundred years and you may know it as 3 billion, 4 billion, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Just keeps going and out at the end they're protecting a little bit of fall off. But when doesn't know that by 2040, they're expecting 9 billion people and still growing.

Speaker 1:          00:18:56       So there's no, well you've heard a lot about, you know, uh, Europe and, and Michael titled, Mom gave you a lecture on the low population growth rates in Europe and Japan in, in, in quite a number of countries in the world. And that's correct that the population growth is extremely unbalanced in the world. The developed countries are having zero two at most, 5% of the increase they're growing at you know, 0.1% whereas some of the poorer countries are still growing at two, 3%. So I'll show you in a minute that basically all of this growth is in the poorer countries where they're least least have the least resources to cope with this amount of growth. Now here is, uh, the, the population change in millions and we will see that that has basically been growing. This is where we are now basically grew up to 1990.

Speaker 1:          00:19:56       It's a fallen off a little bit here and then it's predicted to keep growing for another, a few years and then it's predicted to go down here. I emphasize guesswork. I, this was not on the original. This is data and we have fairly decent reason. But again, this error bars on here and we don't know what those error bars, how big they should be and this is really guesswork. The guesswork is not too bad for the near future because the, the, the, the women who are going to have these children are ready, born the ready, close to maturity. Uh, we know that fertility rates generally don't change all that fast, although I will show you plenty of exceptions to that in the next lecture. So you can maybe more or less believe the next dozen years here or something that, and then, uh, you'll make various projections and I'll show you those projections can be almost anything because we don't have a very good basis for that.

Speaker 1:          00:20:56       But the rear near term projection that the number of people at it every year is going to go up. It's probably a pretty accurate because it's very near term. And now again, what are the, the optimist take that data that here's the number of people added and you'll see it's has been going up. It's kind of jiggling around. It may or may not decline in the future, but because the base has been growing because the population keep scrolling, if the same number of people are added every year, then the percentage increase goes down. So when you hear a lot of optimism about the population situation, what they're talking about is that the, that the peak

Speaker 1:          00:21:46       rate of growth here in the 1960s has come down as a percentage of the base. But as you just saw, since the base is growing, the number of Apps, Lou actual number of people added is not changed all that much. And again, we're growing the world's going something like one and a one and a quarter percent when one to one and a half percent a year currently. And the guesswork is, and the hope is that we'll continue down. In fact, the, this, this, uh, continued decreases based on some pretty optimistic assumptions and they'll just, we may get time to talk about them later, but fertility has been falling. If you presume that fertility is fallen as far as it going to a four and now it's going to stay constant. So the most conservative projection is constant fertility. Whatever we are at now, that's the way it's going to be.

Speaker 1:          00:22:39       Then you don't get anything like this. You get an a huge takeoff. This presumes that fertility will keep falling until people have two children per family and fairly rapidly. And uh, that's a nice guess, a nice prediction. But we really have essentially no theory, no decent theoretical basis to presume that. Now here is the one number you should really keep in your mind. This is right up to date. This is the Census Bureau 2009 this gives you the world events and it just Britt for being kind of cute. It breaks it down to how much is the increase each year, month, day. You can do it down to the second and notice, and I, and I gave you these numbers last time in as ratios as per thousand. This is the number of births.

Speaker 2:          00:23:31       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:23:33       this is the number of births per year. 135 million. And the number of deaths, 55 million. So that's the difference. That's the population growth rate, 80 million people. So that's, I think one of the key numbers to just keep in mind rounded off 80 million that the increase every year on earth now is 80 million. And it's been a roughly that for quite some time. The, uh, the maximum here was something like 90 million, knocked, not quite 90 million, and now we're just about 80 million. So when people say though the birth, everything's coming down, things are getting better, we're going to come to a soft landing. Well, what we actually know is the difference between 87 million and 80 million with large and unknown error bars. So might not be a decrease at all. I mean, we just don't know. But nothing drastic has happened to engender such optimism about the future of human population. Although you will hear that over and over and over again. Now, um,

Speaker 2:          00:24:44       as,

Speaker 1:          00:24:46       as I showed you this, this graph that, uh, we are here

Speaker 2:          00:24:52       at, at the, uh, at the

Speaker 1:          00:24:57       sure here to 6.7 billion and all of the projections show it to continue to increase. Again, the rate of increase gets fuzzier and fuzzier as you go further out in time, but it will increase. And uh, the projections are that by 2040 will be 9 billion and still growing. So we're adding a billion at 80 million a year. We're adding a billion every 12 and a half years. If it falls a little bit, we'll add a billion every 13 years or 14 years. And what's to keep in mind and when you think of those numbers, so that's a billion people every 12, 13, 14 years, pick whatever number you like and think of everybody's green. Anybody Green in this class? Anybody not green or you environmentalist. Yes. Who's an anti environmentalist? Hello? One, two. Well, I'm going to return to this theme, but uh, they can't be repeated enough times that think of the environmental footprint of a billion extra people.

Speaker 1:          00:26:06       Every dozen or so years, a billion extra people. Now add up all the environmentalist, moldy, the achievements of this wonderful environmental movement there. There it's a wonderful thing and it pales in comparison that, that, you know, it's just we're playing a losing battle with the environment. As long as we're growing at a billion people in so many years, we're not going to solve the environmental problems no matter what we we do. It's just too, too great an increase of people. And yet, environmentalist generally never talk about a human population. It's too politically dangerous to talk about that. Hence this course, one of the very in the country or anywhere in the world that that really hits, talks about population a straight on. Okay, so why do we, why are we, why are we, why is everybody projecting that the population is going to keep increasing their, and it's simply, you look at the age structure and something like, half of the world's population, uh, is under 15 years old.

Speaker 1:          00:27:09       He just coming in, uh, I'm sorry, a third of the world's population is under 15 years old. And so just coming into reproductive ages and we know that for the next they will come into reproductive ages and then B of reproductive potential for the following 30 years. And we know that this increasing number of now 10 to 15 year olds who will become into reproductive ages, we'll keep the population increasing. So that's certain that it will increase a low, the rate of increase and, and, and how it changes is certainly a less certain. So, but it's under almost any kind of reasonable assumption. Uh, the population is going to grow, uh, another several billion people. And so again, you know, we're in unprecedented territory. Most people think the earth right now is incredibly stressed and it is environmental things, uh, situation. And now add another couple of billion people to that, uh, in the near future and see what's going on.

Speaker 1:          00:28:19       So since we don't have crystal balls, the students usually ask me question, what's going to happen? And I always have to say, oh, I left my crystal ball and my closet. You know, I didn't, didn't bring it today. I do not have have a way into the future, but anybody who tells you they know what's going to happen in the future and especially if they're going to be optimistic about it, is very blind kind of person. Okay. So you've all heard discussions of the population problem and it's really two different problems. The first problem, which in the West we're very cognizant of is over consumption by rich people. If they're a good fraction of the world is now what you should definitely call rich.

Speaker 1:          00:29:07       And they consume like crazy and a lot of what we consume is frivolous, like hummers great big, you know, some, some little person on driving this great big SUV that they never carry anything heavy and they certainly don't have to drive over logs or something which an SUV is actually good for. So the over consumption, uh, depletes the world's resources, increases pollution, destruction of habitat, et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. So environmental misery is largely caused by rich people consuming profligate Lee unnecessarily. And profligately. The other side of the coin is a poverty. You have the world is definitely split and the split is getting wider between poverty and and over people to over consume. And their problem of course is under consumption and they lead to all of the problems of poverty, which I've discussed. Hong Kong and you, I don't have to tell you very much about what the problems in the world poor people are.

Speaker 1:          00:30:12       So we have these two opposite problems, what I call environmental misery and human misery. And they're both very largely result of two rapid population growth that that we might add some utopian scenario eventually be able to cope with say the population levels that we have now maybe. Uh, but at the rate of growth, it's obvious just looking around you that our technology, our economy, our governments have not been able to cope with this so far. So it's very interesting as, as a, as a political note that there are these two faces of the pop. They run the environmental problem and the, and the, the people misery problem. And it's amazing how people focus on one or the other. There's people like in work, in planned parenthood and various feminist and women's organizations, they're instant in people misery. There is talking about poverty and the attendant problems.

Speaker 1:          00:31:06       Then there's environmentalist. They worried about trees and the survival of animals and forests and nature and both have of course very important and very, uh, good causes to work on. But it is absolutely mind boggling how rarely you find anybody that sort of is really in any way concerned about both problems or in any way realizes how population is the centerpiece, uh, of both of these problems. Okay. So let me talk just a little bit about over consumption and, uh, who's the number one bad guy and over consumption? We are, right. So here's the story for, uh, some of the story for the United States. This is, um, uh, the, the, the, the growth in the United States population from 1900 to 2000. We in 1900 had about 75 million. And in 2006, uh, this, yeah, that's 2000, 2007, 2006, we passed 300 million people. And that's a quadrupling that our population has quadrupled in, uh, that one century.

Speaker 1:          00:32:22       We were almost like an underdeveloped country in our population growth rate. And that is up to the almost current. And here is again the latest census bureau thing from a, again, this was a, just got it out of the computer last night actually the latest numbers that here's the, the, and one of the standard things is give you a hundred year of timeframe. Currently they're using 1950 to 2050 and we are, as you know, sort of right about here and here's the u s population growth rate and just almost a perfectly straight line. There is no prediction that the u s is going to slow down and it's a population growth rate. We're growing at about 3 million a year. It's currently, that's 1% of the year, a year. And because of of natural increase that's births over deaths of people already in America plus immigration, we're just going up here and um, in our population growth rate, it's about two thirds, uh, birth silver deaths of citizens already here and about one third immigration. And of immigration of the guesses are that it's about two thirds legal and one third illegal. They obviously be illegal is an enormous guests that the absolute number of the percentage of anything that it is. If you look at how they come up with these numbers, it's really seat of the pants. We don't know very much about the magnitude of illegal immigration, but it's an enormous political issue.

Speaker 1:          00:34:08       Now on the consumption side, uh, of course we consume so much and again numbers very kind of wildly, but the range of numbers are that an an American consumes something between 20 and 40 times what a person in a developing country will consume. So if you multiply the r 3 million population growth the year by a consumption factor of 20, that's equivalent to the growth population. Growth is 60 million poor people. And so you do it that way. It looks like that our population growth, uh, is as damaging to the resource and environmental situation, the world as the whole rest of the world, uh, put together. And that's just considering our population increased, not the population base which has also consuming at this great rate. So we are indeed, it is certainly correct that we are a tremendous strain on on the environment and resources of the earth and as I shared it's not getting better or our population is just increasing.

Speaker 1:          00:35:20       Now you have to balance against that that a lot of our population growth is a course people coming in from other countries so that it's not in some sense Americans who are getting richer but it's poor people coming in and getting richer. But you can play these numbers in all different ways and we'll talk about the politics in a moment. But the US Census Bureau used to say that we will reach that the US population will reach 300 million by the year 2050 we reached that number 44 years earlier than the Census Bureau thought and we are still growing and now the census bureau says there was no sign of stabilization at all. They cannot give you a number at which they think the u s population will stabilize. Because as far out as anybody can kind of project, there's no reason to believe that stabilization in view. Now some of the argumentation is that you again, people, there's very political issue and a half the people say it's all those poor people that are over reproducing can't they learn some self control and then handpieces all those Americans and Japanese that consume like crazy can't they use some self control and it's an extremely sterile argument that goes on and on.

Speaker 1:          00:36:41       People don't think beyond, you know, two or three sentences in into that argument. And uh, as I tell you, if you do it out numerically, the, the increasing damage is, is it's more or less equal. And it depends more critically, as, as Americans usually blame, blame ourselves that where the problem, there's a very kind of, um, do you want to call it, use the word racist, but, but a very euro Miraco centric argument that, because the presumption is when it says, well, we are the consumers and poor of the poor people we don't have to worry about is that they will stay poor. It's a western assumption that poor people are going to stay poor and they're not, not only did they not consumers now, but they're never going to be consumers. And that is just nonsense. And we've seen now the Chinese have come up enormously.

Speaker 1:          00:37:35       The Indians would come up enormously. The Indonesians have come up enormously, uh, everywhere in the world. These vast numbers of poor people are now our star now starting to be serious consumers. And I think the, the CO2, uh, production in China, I think has just in outpaced the United States. But I didn't, I didn't look that up. Uh, uh, recently. And so they are an equal problem. So if one gets out of one's head, the idea that poor people are gonna stay poor forever. Uh, which is an a pre globalization idea. Now a worker in China can compete with a worker in America and eventually there's going to be some leveling. So I think the proper thing is if you think there are too many people on earth for either human misery issues or environmental misery issues or both, any birth, you should consider more or less equal, uh, preventing birth in America, in Japan and Indonesia. Everywhere that in the not too distant future, these people are going to be more or less equal. And we'll see. We'll, we'll see next lecture what the people themselves want respect to this thing. But I hope after this course that none of you get involved in a sterile argument of US versus them. You know, it's, it's, it, it doesn't get you anywhere.

Speaker 1:          00:38:57       Okay. What in the world as it is today? Uh, most of the popular, almost all of the population growth is in the poorest countries against ethics are pretty bad to something like 95% of population growth in the world are in the poorest countries. And as you know, new people need schools, they need healthcare, they need a place to live, they need jobs. And all of this takes money. It takes capital. And that's what the poor countries are missing. They don't have, uh, the capital, they usually don't have the technological expertise, they don't have the often the quality of government that can cope with these enormous problems. So it's, it's the places that are least capable of coping with the population increase that are in fact salad with it. And the magnitude of this growth is, is incredible. Um, as far as that as we can project, uh, the poor countries are going to have to build a city equivalent of 1 million people, 1 million city, to cope with a million people every week for the next 45 years, which is far as we projected.

Speaker 1:          00:40:11       And if you look at, you know, you know the big cities, Shanghai, Beijing, and China, just pick almost any name and got her an Almanac and you'll see the, there's, there's so many mega million cities in China that, you know, cities even that I've never heard of and you look up their population, they're in, in the millions and place like New York with 7 million people is nothing. So Sweden where I lived in Sweden for a while, uh, has like seven to 8 million people. New York City has seven to 8 million people, cities in China. That's, that's, that's a small town. Uh, almost. And India is not, not far behind. So people in the United States generally don't have much of an idea of what poverty really looks like. And one of the best descriptions of this comes from a bill Ryerson who is going to be a guest lecturer later.

Speaker 1:          00:41:08       And he describes flying into Bombay again a few years back. But in this period of extreme population explosion that we're talking about, go to the airport and the airport is way outside the city as, as all our parts have to be. And by the international flight schedules, they come in early in the morning. So he starts driving in and almost immediately at the airport you start seeing, uh, poor people begging on the street. You see a Shanti's, uh, that, that people are living in. And when it comes into the denser places, people start begging and you'll see very common. Your mother holding an infant and you can look, the infants is clearly nearly dead. And the mother, you know, please give me something, anything so I can keep this child alive till tomorrow. And there's one after the other, after the other and it gets denser and then the sun comes up and it gets warm and is generally a rather warm country.

Speaker 1:          00:42:03       And there's all these jitneys and motorbikes trucks, small trucks putting around and they don't have good catalytic converters. Those are expensive. A lot of them have platinum in them. So they produce a lot of pollution and the air gets very thick with this black smoke, very early and black, some sort, whatever you want to call it in, in, in the early morning. So you're not breathing fresh air. And then of course, they have no toilets, uh, around, and you're going to read some articles about what that means. And so very soon, the stench of human waste, you're on a main streets going into the main city. The stench of human waste, uh, comes up at you and the smells terribly and the more and more beggars, and it's just, you know, an heart absolutely heart wrenching, uh, a description of what's going on. And then you think that here are millions and millions of people that, uh, have, you know, we'll never have a real house. They live in some cardboard shack somewhere. Uh, they'll never have a real job. They'll never probably go to the bathroom in a toilet and they may never even breathe a breath of fresh air. Um, so it, poverty is really a very, very serious kind of situation. And, uh, you go to lots and lots of cities in the world and see similar kinds of descriptions.

Speaker 1:          00:43:32       And I do the numbers on this poverty. So we compare it to the United States. So General Motors before its recent demise, these numbers are three or four years old. They tell it. So they pay wages to the workers. Then they have health benefits, which you've read about is very high because they pay them for the rest of the life and they pay pensions. So when you add all that up, how much lifetime they're going to pay for worker and divided by the number of hours the worker works, it comes out for, for General Motors was $80 an hour at the wages, general motor worker, $80 an hour. And uh, that was somewhere near a maximum for union wages, not counting like airline pilots. So we get an awful lot more than that. The upper middle class, uh, that's blue collar workers at GM, the upper middle class people mostly in this room are going to be earning an awful lot, uh, more than that.

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       On the other hand is the poverty level. Uh, which for a family of a mother, father, and three children is defined as, uh, um, $24,000 a year. That's the 2006 number. Now, the official US number, which is $13 and 35 cents a day per person, that's the poverty level as officially defined in the United States. [inaudible], Walmart, uh, a worker, a sales associate earn $6 and 10 cents an hour or $12,000 a year, 6,000, uh, an hour, uh, uh, I'm sorry, is 12,000 a year. They are below poverty level. So the next step up for a Walmart worker is po is official poverty level. When you go to developing countries, you have to cut to get any idea of a scale, you'd have to cut the Walmart, Walmart wages in at least a factor of four. So Walmart, uh, makes, uh, pants in El Salvador and the pants sell for this particular article on the $16 and 95 cents in their United States stores. And how much you think the women, uh, in El Salvador get who make the pants per pant? 15 cents is the wage level that they, they get for it.

Speaker 1:          00:46:04       The UN reported that about half of the world's workers, which is about 1.4 billion people, uh, earn less than $2 a day. So the average wage, the median wage in the world is something like $2 a day. That's per wage earner, not per family, not per person, but per wage earner. And that then has to be divided among however many dependence that person has. You, I've told you that what the u s sets, uh, it's official level for poverty. Every country in the world of course, gets to decide its own level of what poverty is. And the official poverty level in the poorest 10, 10 to 20 poorest 20 countries is a dollar 25. You're only poor if you earn less than a dollar 25 per capita per day in both China and India, the official poverty level is closer to $1 a day. And this is at 2005 prices.

Speaker 1:          00:47:05       Again, statistics are always a couple of years behind things in rich places like Latin America and Eastern Europe. Uh, $2 a day is the more appropriate, uh, poverty level. And that is for all the developing countries. $2 a day is the median and their own self defined poverty level. But within each country, in each region, uh, there's great inequality of course in income. So about a third of the people in Latin America are living on less than $2 a day. Two thirds of the people in Pakistan live on less than two thirds, $2 a day, uh, more than 58% of the population. Kenya lives on less than $1 a day. Brazil, 25% of the people on less than $1 a day. The whole of sub Saharan Africa, 44% of the people in less than $1 a day. And so then it's not only these, you know, traditionally poor countries, but in Romania, uh, after the Soviet block fell apart, 40% of the people live on less than $1 a day.

Speaker 1:          00:48:11       Indonesia had a, had a government work programs that people could get some kind of work, and Labor has got 75 cents a day for five hours of work a day. That's 15 cents an hour. And I don't know how much it, how much time it takes to, so Walmart pants, but maybe an hour, probably less. So. 15 cents an hour is a wage that for many people in places like Indonesia, which is a lot of oil, it's not an overall necessarily a poor place. 15 cents an hour for an hour's work, 75 cents a day. And that's much more than they can get working, you know, getting agricultural jobs around where they live. Uh, so here's a description from Zambia. A nine year old boy alone, a Banda, his job is to beat rock fragments into powder. He doesn't have a hammer. He found a large steel bolt from some construction site.

Speaker 1:          00:49:15       He found a boat. He grips in his bare hand and pounds the rock with it. He takes raw rock, takes a bolt that he found and, and pounds with it and he can fill it. Takes him about, uh, uh, in a week he can fill about a half a bag with this powder, which is used for construction. And he gets about a dollar 50 for the half bag. And it's used for making concrete in Kenya, for instance, uh, children and start working at five or six. We saw, we talked about Charles Dickens was so much of his writing was about children going to work at age seven. Well seven is old. They go to five or six and they work as prostitutes. Even at that age, miners, construction workers, pesticide Strayer's and all the kinds of dangerous and miserable job. Uh, in sub Saharan Africa there's something like 48 million children, 14 and younger, who, who were working. And four years later, these are says 2000. By 2004, it had increased by 1.3 million. So the number of children working in these poverty level jobs is increasing because the whole population is increasing and, and so forth. And this is the poverty rates around the world. Just to compare, uh, this confirms the numbers that I'm telling you

Speaker 2:          00:50:45       that uh,

Speaker 1:          00:50:48       these are the, the head count, the number of millions, a percent below poverty line at dollar 25 a day, less than $2 a day. And if you take out China a China is still one of the poorest places. When you add in all the peasants, it doesn't get it. Get some, actually China makes it worse than you add in China, you have a higher percentage at, at these poverty levels. Same for whatever poverty level you want to work these, the appropriate poverty levels for developing countries. Um, now again, you have the same two ways of describing this. The absolute number of people in this kind of poverty is growing up. That's the whole population grows. The number of people in these levels are growing up. Yet there has been economic progress in the sense that as a percentage of people, the poverty low numbers are going down.

Speaker 1:          00:51:47       So there's more people in poverty, but there's a lesser percentage of the total population in poverty. So again, you can, depending on your political orientation, you can describe this as an increasingly bad situation where more and more people are in this kind of poverty or a situation that is getting better because the percentage of people in poverty is going down. Now the miracle. So you've all heard of the economic miracle, uh, in East Asia especially and anybody come fairly recently from China? No, none of the students come from time. Well, the average income, and again upon how you define of course the Chinese donor dollars. So when you express it in dollars, there's a translation and the best way of doing is what's called P P P purchasing power parody. One way is to use the official exchange rate. How many of you know they are in so many won and how many dollars can they buy with that one?

Speaker 1:          00:52:49       But that exchange rate, as you know, especially in China, is manipulated by the government and is not a real number. So number that makes the Chinese income look more favorable and is close to a real number is what they called purchasing power parity. You say, how much does a sack of rice costs in China? How much does it cost in the United States? And you try to use a basket of commodities appropriate to what the people in that country actually use and say, how much would that cost in dollars? So you can have a parody and, and that kind of a level, uh, Chinese peasant on average, earns a dollar a day, lives the person ever a dollar a day is the average income in a Chinese peasant family. The jobs in the modern sector, which means one of these manufacturing jobs, and they migrate to some city, they live in these dorm rooms where they're just stacked like cordwood and they have basically no free time in there.

Speaker 1:          00:53:45       It's a miserable life, but they doubled their income. The economic miracle in Asia is when people go from $1 a day to $2 a day. And there's hundreds of millions of people. You had up China and India, hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to earn $2 a day. It's a doubling of their income. And when you read these horrible stories, horrible to Aureus of how, especially women moving into the big cities, uh, gone. Joe Can we old can't Tom or any of the big cities, how they're living in the conditions they're working under. Remember it's a represents a doubling of their income and it's so much that they send, they can send most of that back to their home village and the home villages are all living on this kind of income. And so when we talk about Po, we will later talking about population in China, you're now must realize that basically all of those workers who now have access to moderately decent education can compete with us.

Speaker 1:          00:54:47       There's very few jobs that we can do and they can't do. And so we add up to $80 an hour for blue collar worker are basically in competition with, with someone who's very happy and they grumble, people working for GM grumble and some of their conditions, the grumbling could be quite fair. Uh, but they're in competition with people earning $2 a day that wish they would earn $2 a day. And in places, and this is not only our competition, but jewelry making, very labor intensive course, uh, countries with low wage rates, attract very labor intensive jobs and handmaking of jewelry is a very labor intensive job. And turned out that Bangkok was one of the centers of jewelry making. And because it was a center and requires a fair amount of skill, the wages actually rose in Bangkok for these jewelry makers. And they got up to $8 a day for a jewelry worker in Bangkok.

Speaker 1:          00:55:46       And guess what happened? All the factories moved to China to back down to $2 a day, a saving of 75% on your labor costs. Of course they're going to do it. And not only China, but Mexico, all the Makia Dora's the, uh, the border between Texas and California and, and Mexico has a lot of factories. And because of various trade laws, they can assemble things and just ship them across the border with, with low, uh, low trade tariffs and everything. And they have the nearly wiped out with jobs moving to China. And now, of course, for a while anyway, the conditions that we're getting little bit better to China. So the jobs moved to, I've been reading in newspapers, who's now competing with China, one India at a high level, but Vietnam, Cambodia, you know, places that are even poor than China or now even taking jobs away from China in Romania, which is one of the poorest countries in Europe.

Speaker 1:          00:56:46       The, the wages average about $83 a week in your, or so 10, 10, $12 a day. When they got into the European Union, what the Romanian workers do, they moved out to France, Germany, England, to get the higher wages that are, that are available there, which left a lot of jobs unfilled in Romania where they get $12 a day, as I've just said. So what did the Romanians do? Imported Chinese who worked for lesson and fill the jobs as an unlimited number of peasants in China. They would love to work in Romania under almost any kind of of conditions. And they leave their husbands, their children. Everybody has left home, usually under the care of grandparents who were too old. Uh, themselves to work. So keep that in mind. Abject poverty is a dollar a day. The economic miracle is $2

Speaker 2:          00:57:47       a day. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:57:53       What does living look like? And these places that we've been talking about, Bombay and Shanghai, these are big places that everybody knows about. You'll never guess where this is and you've probably never heard of it. This is the Capitol of Mauritania. How many know we're Mauritania is, Oh, good. It's on the Atlantic coast of Africa. I should remember to always make sly grab geographies. You map slides, but I didn't, it's on the Atlantic coast. It is the, the capital is a place called Norwalk shot. You walk. Shot is over there somewhere. And this is the suburbs of new shot. And what it is is desert. It's an, uh, all of Mauritania is basically a desert until it rolls into the ocean, which case it becomes an ocean. And so in the desert, all these people live in a Shanti's of any, any kind of construction material of they can, they can find, uh, the national government.

Speaker 1:          00:58:50       The city government does not have the resources to deal with these people. At all. So they get no sanitation. They get no policing, they get no water. Uh, there, there's just, these are called unplanned communities and they sort of basic don't exist. But what are they to the government? They're a source of problem because it's very poor people who have nothing to lose revolt. Every so often they say, you know, you've got something. We don't have it. We want it. Why is the government not doing for anything? So this is a source of social discontent and the, and the shanty towns around every big city in the world are great sources of social discontent. So what you see here is a road. And I've just said they basically don't have roads. What happens is that the military in each of these countries wants to be sure to be able to control the people.

Speaker 1:          00:59:41       So every so often they send an bulldozer, you can sort of see another road here off to the right. You get a better one of these. Uh, they, they, uh, they just come in one morning and the people are asleep in there. Their Shanti's cause they don't have any jobs. Uh, and very early in the morning, they just hear this rumble and they walk outside to find out what it is. And the bulldozer is two minutes away from their house and they just go down, knock out anything that's, that's in the way. If you happen to be in the path that the bulldog, the military bulldozer and knocks down now, sorry, sorry, that's gone. And then the soldiers can, can, uh, go into these situations. So the point being that these enormous dense populations, which we associate with Calcutta or Bombay or Shanghai, Canton, you know, are in fact almost everywhere in the world now, including this, oh, sorry.

Speaker 1:          01:00:40       This is, this is where no shot meets the Atlantic Ocean. This is the Atlantic Ocean right here. This is terrible. And what do they live on? Well, they live on fishing in each of these little things here that you can see as a fishing boat, a little boat that they roll out and fish and look at how many boats there are all trying to get the occasional fish. And that's not a terribly rich fishing ground of the world. It's very close to the equator and there's no big upwelling of nutrients. So it's not a great big ah, fishing ground there. But this is how, uh, the, the people who have competing with each other for the few fish that are out there now. So that's the desert. And here's the jungle. So this is Brazil in a place that you may have heard of Sarah Palava peeled mountain or naked mountain and anybody has heard of it or seen pictures of this before.

Speaker 1:          01:01:36       One couple of people. It's very well known. So if you travel in Brazil, all the big cities, again have shanty towns where people are desperate for some kind of a job. So every softened a truck rolls through and says, I have some jobs and people just pile in and I've watched it and they sort of don't ask how much, where am I going? What's the kind of work? A job is like a magic words like Manna from heaven. They jump in the truck. Well, one of the places they're taken to is this place. And this place is way in the, in the middle of the jungle. Like a thousand miles from Rio or South San Paolo and what it is, it's a mountain that they found gold in. And normally if you've seen like mining in the west of the United States and you know, they have these steam shovels which have a bucket as big as this whole room probably, and they each, each drag of the bucket, uh, pulls up, you know, hundreds of tons.

Speaker 1:          01:02:30       I don't know the actual numbers in Sarah Palava. Uh, human labor is cheaper than, uh, than to buy a steam shovel. So at each of the little dots are, is the person and what it is, this is a pit and they're digging in the mud there. They carried the mock up. The sluicing is up here on the top where they have, you know, sluicing gold is heavier than, than soil. So they take basically mud, dump it into a place, water runs over, it, washes away the mud. Anything that sticks down falls heavy. His little flakes, a little tiny nuggets of gold. That's the primitive way of doing golden morning. It just flow water over mud and there's very, very low concentration. You'd get a gold flake there. So what are these people? How do they work? This is, they go down and then climb. These are uh, wouldn't ladders and another part, they climbed down the ladders and they have a burlap sacks on their back, the cheapest kind of sack and they go down and with very primitive implements or maybe the hands, they take the earth from the bottom of the pit, they put it in these packs, they put the pack on their back and they climb up the stairs and dump it into the sluice apparatus and then go back down.

Speaker 1:          01:03:49       That's there their whole life. They're miserable wages. They can't leave cause in the middle of the jungle they have no way of getting back to any kind of civilization. The companies do indeed provide prostitutes for them. This whole villages full of prostitutes, which are the women that come out of the same surgery and send a truck around and they have jobs for women. They jump on with with little or no questions asked. And how is the whole thing kept under control by soldiers with guns or power militaries with guns. And here is uh, you know, moderately typical. One of the workers has, have not even the clothes on his back and there's, you know, huge numbers of them. They are kept control. In this particular instance, the things were looking like they were going to go out of control.

Speaker 1:          01:04:37       And again, uh, this, this is, this is all around the world. You find situations like this. Uh, sometimes I talk about, you know, it's everywhere in the world. Uh, if you go up to Mount Everest, so we've got, what are the ends of the earth? There's the deserts, there's the jungles and this Mount Everest and that just copy down some statistic of Mt. Everest. Just this is how much population there isn't in the world. Uh, there's a up high and I used to mountain climb. Lot of single footstep can require eight breaths. You take a step, you pan eight times and people like me would be a lot more than eight times on one particular day and standard in the couple of months that you can climb with his 500 climbers waiting to, to climb up Everest. Uh, they, the, the places are littered with dead bodies. It's littered with oxygen bottles. I mean, Mt. Everest is kind of a congestion zone.

Speaker 1:          01:05:42       It, it looks like grand central station that had been sort of cleared out of people are on many days. There's 120 dead bodies littering the top of Mount Everest. So population has gotten so extreme that it's not only the big cities, it's basically everywhere that you look, uh, uh, uh, people are. So let's just, uh, conclude, uh, tell you what a little bit of future, uh, guessing. So we know that fertility, so now we have most of the world, very high fertility rate population going gangbusters. Now, can we dream up a scenario where this gets better? May get better, it may not get better. You know, things may get to worse until there's some incredible crisis or things may stay as they are now, where things may cost to a, to a soft landing. We don't know. But let's draw ourselves as scenario for the soft landing situation.

Speaker 1:          01:06:39       So one of the things that we know is that there's very, very poor be these dollar a day. People don't limit their births. And the exact reason for it we will discuss later. A lot has to do with education, that they don't, a lot of things about how their bodies work. They don't understand. So they're, they're afraid of modern contraception, a lot of issues, which, which we will, uh, we will discuss. But we observe around the world that some increase in standard of living has to take place for populate for before people start, uh, being willing and want to limit their fertility. So let's take the minimum situation. Let's say someone gets one of these $2 a day jobs and that's then they start thinking differently about themselves in the world. There may be in a city where they get some education, some awareness of what's going on in the world.

Speaker 1:          01:07:29       They want to limit their population. So let's say that we go from a dollar a day to $2 a day. That's incredibly optimistic. That $2 a day is sufficient, but you'll see what, where I'm going. That's a doubling of income of the poor people. Again, something like a third of the people on Earth or in this one to $2 a day range. So you doubled their income and all of a sudden miracles happen. Population stops growing, not real. Oh Way. Overly optimistic. Well, another thing that we know is that when incomes around the world rise to poor, people have the smallest rise and the rich people have the biggest fries. So if the small people are doubling their income, what is the whole, the average of the whole world doing? It's going to be much more than doubling. And again, you can pick a, I'm sure economists have these numbers, I don't have them.

Speaker 1:          01:08:19       You can pick whatever number you want. If in order to raise most of the world from $1 a day to $2 a day, I need to double their income, then does the whole world rises by more than two, maybe three. But we can pick any number that we want. So I've kind of your two facts that the population of the world is for sure going to increase by something like 50% before if and when it stabilizes. We can sort of see ballpark of 50% increase coming and now, but this AV average standard of living has to at least double and probably triple or quadruple or you know, again, pick almost whatever number you want. So at the minimum of doubling the world's, uh, per capita income, uh, 50% more people are doubling and the income, it means a three that, that the gross, uh, economy or it has to triple because you have one and a half times as many people each earning twice as much.

Speaker 1:          01:09:15       That's a tripling of the world economy. If you want to say that, uh, the world that to double the, the income or poor people, you have to triple the whole world world economy, then that's three times one and a half or four and a half times as much. So basically we're looking at an, at an optimistic scenario for the future where we come to a soft landing. And then in order to come to a soft landing, we have to have the economy of the world increased by a factor of three by a factor of four, four, and half, five, six, somewhere in that range of numbers. Now, technology, the improvement of technology allows us to grow our income without not somewhat less than proportionate increase in resources. And again, you can make a wall to guests about how much technology will improve in the future so that we can double our income without quite doubling, uh, the, the drain on the world's resources and the amount of pollution we put into it at amount of carbon dioxide we put into it.

Speaker 1:          01:10:13       So we're looking at this enormous increase in order to come to a soft landing. We're looking at this, at least a tripling of the world economy and something like a tripling of the pollution in the world to come knock. So in the world, the, the, uh, uh, the, the, the use of resources in the world. And most people believe that we're at the limit of what the earth can cope with in terms of the economy, which is basically how much we're taking out of the earth. We're at the limit right now, but with population, we're not going to have a soft landing unless we triple that at least minimum of triple that. So that's, that's the significance of this population issue that, you know, can the earth cope with a tripling of the economic activity on it. I left my crystal ball home, so you're going to, you are definitely going to find out the answer to that question. Okay. Next time we will continue.
