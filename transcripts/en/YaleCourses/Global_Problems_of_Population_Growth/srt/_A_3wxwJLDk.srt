1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,120
So let me start.
Um,

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm going to read you something and you
have to guess what kind of a scene I'm

3
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:07,834
describing.

4
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,970
A ghostly stillness
descended over the country,

5
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:16,030
this country today with every restaurant,

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,430
bar and tea house in the country,

7
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:21,280
close every store,

8
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:26,260
shuttered and police patrolling the
streets to make sure no citizen day or to

9
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:27,280
step outside

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,780
avenues normally clogged with traffic
were so empty that picnics could have been

11
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:38,821
held on them except that nobody would
have been allowed to attend plazas that

12
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:42,460
are perpetual nightmares
of congestion and exhaust.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,520
Exhaust fumes were abandoned to wandering
dogs and cats was also a good day for

14
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:53,620
the fish because the thousands
of fishermen who lined
the shorelines on Sunday,

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,860
we're all at home.
The waterway itself,

16
00:00:56,861 --> 00:01:01,540
one of the world's busiest waterways
was this flat and silent as a woodland

17
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:05,850
pond. The government to
create a six month term jet,

18
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,790
a jail term for any citizen who
did not spend the day at home.

19
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,740
All in all the country today looked like
a land on which a neutron bomb had been

20
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:19,210
dropped, devastating the population
while leaving the buildings on damaged.

21
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,700
What do you think it
is? It's drastic. Yeah.

22
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,830
Like nope. Good, reasonable gas,

23
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:31,800
but no governments weren't as strong.
Then

24
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,940
it's a census day in Turkey.

25
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:43,410
Some places take their sentences very
seriously and require that people really

26
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:48,490
be in the place of their residents so
that they can be counted and that they get

27
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:53,491
a very good set of numbers and the
waterway that they're talking about

28
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,490
between Turd Europe and Asia
running through the boss spruce.

29
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,140
Right,
okay.

30
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:08,141
Now compare this to another country and
educated and motivated guy got one of

31
00:02:08,991 --> 00:02:11,270
the temporary jobs as a census taker.

32
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,710
He was Chi class enough to get an article
published in the Atlantic monthly.

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,400
This is New York City, I'll
tell you, cause you'll get from,

34
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,100
he was six foot four and Caucasian.
They sent him to Chinatown.

35
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,850
People took one look at
him and slammed the door.

36
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,300
Others offered him money to go away.

37
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,660
Even most of those who tried to cooperate
did not have time to fill out the long

38
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:41,930
form.
He asked to be assigned to another area.

39
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,060
He got Wall Street. Same Story.
No one would cooperate with him.

40
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,530
He couldn't even get into one building.
But this was a motivated guy.

41
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:56,330
I was like a yellowy. So we climbed
onto the roof of the next building,

42
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:00,010
the building next door. He jumped over
the partition, not across the street,

43
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:04,010
but over the partition and uh,

44
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,150
to get into the building
that he was supposed to take.

45
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:12,151
The sense of self right there on
the roof was a dilapidated shack.

46
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,060
Okay. Maybe someone's living in the
shack. So he knocks on the door.

47
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,560
Someone inside flings
open the door inside.

48
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:24,790
He could see several apparently
naked people lying on hospital.

49
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:28,810
Gurneys the man who opened the
door was wearing a white coat,

50
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,820
go away.
He screamed.

51
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,810
I'm giving my wife a cancer
treatment New York City,

52
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,800
so I'm more,
I'm more experienced.

53
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,680
Census taker told him that
he wasn't doing it right.

54
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,500
What you have to do is what
they say kerbstone it. Uh,

55
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,160
and what that means is you sit on the
sidewalk and guess how many apartments are

56
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:52,720
in the building.
You look up at the building,

57
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,070
you guess how many apartments in the
building and fill out that many forms with

58
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,470
guesses about how many people
live in each apartment.

59
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,990
That's the way census that was done in
New York City, a comparison to Turkey.

60
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,950
Now these are describing the 1990 census.

61
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:14,951
So get to the 2000 census and a moment
that census was the most expensive ever.

62
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,650
It missed more than 2 million children,
of course, mostly minority children.

63
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:25,690
And imagine what this does
for school planning and it's
and et Cetera, et cetera.

64
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:28,690
It missed altogether,
not counting just children,

65
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:33,691
10 million people and a double
counted or counted in the wrong place.

66
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:36,070
Another 6 million people.

67
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:42,090
So between censuses,
the census peer uses the counter,

68
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,140
the last senses to make its projections.

69
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,250
They know the population is increasing
every year. How much do we have now? Now,

70
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:52,930
now and so. By the time they came
from the 1992 the 2000 census,

71
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,760
there were 7 million more
people in America than the
Census Bureau thought there

72
00:04:57,761 --> 00:05:02,410
was. Population had been
increasing something like one
and a half times with what

73
00:05:02,411 --> 00:05:07,120
they had thought it was.
So there's this slop matter,

74
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,840
the poor, the poor quality
of the United States census.

75
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:16,380
Well nowadays these numbers might seem
small but more than $185 billion a year

76
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:22,300
in federal aid to states are apportioned
according to the census results.

77
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,070
So every state's state really wants
its people counted. And on top of that,

78
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:30,610
what else is apportioned?
Depending on the Census Congress,

79
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:32,620
the House of Representatives
is apportioned.

80
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,970
So people want their estate to have
as many representatives as possible.

81
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:42,730
So given the importance of this, why is
it so bad? Why is the US census so bad?

82
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,210
The answers primarily politics,
it is well known,

83
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,080
big are the kinds of problems that this
census taker had in New York is very

84
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:56,540
well known and it's well known that these,
you know,

85
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,220
people that are considered
somewhat marginal minorities,
immigrants, poor people,

86
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,000
they are heavily under counted.
This is, this is well known.

87
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,150
The problem is that these
people don't vote Republican.

88
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,110
And when this story can aren't
telling you what takes place,

89
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,060
the Republicans control the
House of Representatives,
which controls the budget.

90
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,800
And so the census has
been missing this eight,

91
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,110
10 million for the 90 census,

92
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:31,550
8 million for before roughly eight
to 10 million people. And again,

93
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,570
it's these minority groups,
minorities, renters, urban dwellers,

94
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,800
and so democrats and they generally vote
Democrat and the Democrats have been

95
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:44,660
pushing, uh, to get them counted
to make an accurate account.

96
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,740
But a Republican redistricting as expert
wrote a memorandum in 1997 protecting

97
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,460
that adjustment could cross the
Republican Party 24 house seats,

98
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,580
which is a huge amount.
So since then,

99
00:06:58,581 --> 00:07:02,660
the Republicans have blocked
any modernization of the census.

100
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,720
So for the year 2000 census,
uh,

101
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,060
President Clinton appointed a new
director of the Census Bureau and a woman

102
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:12,020
named Martha Reesh,

103
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,730
who we've had here at Yale and she
came out of a scientific and research

104
00:07:16,731 --> 00:07:21,530
environment and was really very competent
scholar. I knew how to do it right.

105
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,620
And she announced when
she came into office,

106
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:29,060
all industrial democracies will be
holding a census in the year 2000.

107
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,050
We want the United States to
win a gold medal for accuracy.

108
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,380
She thought she was smart.
In fact,

109
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:40,280
of course she missed the boat because
she thought she was supposed to make an

110
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:43,760
accurate census and no,
that wasn't what she was hired for.

111
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,870
So what she proposed was a
statistical way of dealing with this.

112
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:54,320
You know, the groups that you've
missed, you know where they live.

113
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,680
So after you've countered everyone as
well as you can on the whole country,

114
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,720
you go back to the inner
city neighborhoods,

115
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:03,290
the various places where you know that
you're going to miss people and you

116
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,590
really blanket that and do that.
Those areas very carefully,

117
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:08,840
a sample across the country.

118
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,220
And then you find out what your errors
are in that large sample and then you can

119
00:08:13,221 --> 00:08:17,810
adjust the whole population, assuming
you made the same mistakes everywhere.

120
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:23,700
And she was very open. That's
what she planned to do. And uh,

121
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,200
at the time though, a Newt Gingrich, I
don't know if you know that name with, uh,

122
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,570
the, uh, what is it?

123
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:32,720
The new deal for America or something
I was in was the speaker of the house

124
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:37,040
controlled the budget
and he said, um, Yep,

125
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,160
you have the authority to do that.
You're the director of the budget,

126
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:45,240
but if you do that, I will cut
your budget to zero. Basically. Uh,

127
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,160
she wasn't allowed to do that.
And so she had to resign.

128
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,410
She just would not do a census.
That was, that was less than what,

129
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,750
what we are capable of doing.
Uh,

130
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,780
so the census was done
the old fashioned way.

131
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,080
It costs one point $7 billion more than
it would have with sampling and was not

132
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,670
anywhere near as accurate.

133
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,040
Now these same considerations
apply almost everywhere.

134
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,520
So in China for instance,
uh,

135
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,120
you know about the one child policy and
the government is strongly trying to

136
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:25,180
push the birth rate down.
We'll talk about this later in,

137
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,730
in much more detail.

138
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,170
And so a provincial official
gets the word. This is,

139
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,160
we want your population growth rate to
be no more than whatever percentage.

140
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,530
And then he sends it down
to the prefecture and down.

141
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,010
Do you think any of these officials
after the census are going to send up

142
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:43,170
information that they have
not been doing their job?

143
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:47,310
That the birth rate is higher?
No. So there's problems with that.

144
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,790
Who collects this data?
Well,

145
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,700
luckily several or many
organizations collect the data,

146
00:09:53,701 --> 00:09:56,580
but primarily the UN who owns the UN

147
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,980
member countries. And if you, uh,

148
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,210
if you are, say a conservative
religious country and if,

149
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:12,780
uh, the UN demographer says that contrary
to government statistics that there

150
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:15,570
actually is a high rate of illegitimacy
or abortion in the country.

151
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,480
All of which comes out of
the, of, of the statistics,

152
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,180
they're not going to allow that,
that to be published.

153
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,230
So the UN has to sort of cut some
corners so that the countries from who is

154
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,660
dependent on to get the data,
we'll continue to send them the data.

155
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,400
In addition,
even when a country tries,

156
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,470
there are something like 50 million birth
registration is not done everywhere in

157
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:44,700
the world. And there's something like 50
million babies worldwide who were never

158
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:48,960
registered. They don't exist
on the official, uh, registers.

159
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,930
So when you try to do what
demographers do, you have account,

160
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,720
you have a count of a census in one year,

161
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,320
you have account of a census in a later
year in between you have a list of

162
00:10:58,321 --> 00:11:00,370
births and deaths,
supposedly both births,

163
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:03,330
the registered and deaths are registered
and you see, is this reasonable,

164
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,280
you know,
is the difference accounted for by births,

165
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:09,220
deaths and migration if you have
reasonable amounts of migration, uh,

166
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,660
but if millions of the babies
are just not registered,

167
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,860
you can't check things that way.
So there's a lot of,

168
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,560
lot of problems.
Um,

169
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,030
another thing is that in
many, many countries, uh,

170
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,090
there's conflict between different groups.

171
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:30,480
We've talked about democratic
Republican, uh, in the United States,

172
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,150
in Nigeria,
in Sudan,

173
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,140
there's a huge conflict between the
Muslim populations in the north and the

174
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:41,130
Christian, uh, or animus
populations in the south.

175
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,660
You may or may not recall the,
they'd be off for a war in Nigeria,

176
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,690
a huge war between basically over oil,

177
00:11:48,691 --> 00:11:52,190
but between the Muslim north
and the Christian south, uh,

178
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,890
millions of deaths and millions of deaths
now currently in Sudan over something

179
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,340
of a similar issue.
And so in census,

180
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:04,150
in ethnically or religiously
split countries are taken.

181
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,700
The key event is the ratio.

182
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:10,060
The key outcome that everybody wants
to know is the ratio between how many

183
00:12:10,061 --> 00:12:13,720
Christians, how many Muslims, how
many this, how many, how many of that.

184
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,150
And so,
uh,

185
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,990
the censuses get totally distorted by
people trying to raise their numbers and

186
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:27,700
lower everyone else's numbers. So, uh,

187
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,740
before the br for war,

188
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:34,741
there was apparently a reasonably accurate
census in 1952 to 1953 then the BF

189
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,330
war intervened and the next several
sentences were very controversial.

190
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,020
So the accepted official
figures in Nigeria,

191
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,360
we're 88 and a half million people,
but the World Bank said,

192
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:53,710
no, that's wrong. Hundred
and 2 million people. Uh,

193
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:56,830
the United Nations,
120 million people.

194
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:02,530
So basically for a country as big and as
important as Nigeria for their, their,

195
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,030
their last census,

196
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,740
we have figures range between 88
and a half million and 120 million,

197
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,950
a 50% uncertainty for Nigeria.

198
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,010
So big.
Uh,

199
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,250
the point of this initial part,

200
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:22,030
0.1 is that even the simplest
numbers like headcounts,

201
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,320
we're not doing anything fancy.

202
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:26,890
We're just trying to count how many people
there are. One, two, three, four, five.

203
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,930
There are systematic errors and very
often those errors are intentional.

204
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,460
Okay.
Now

205
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:41,100
all of these numbers,
well I say when I described these numbers,

206
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,880
and I probably won't do it enough
when I put up a demographic number,

207
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,870
it should almost always
being qualified by,

208
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:52,260
and there are large and
unknown error bars here,

209
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,680
but we don't have aerobars for it.

210
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,060
So various organizations collect all this
data and this is called the population

211
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:03,270
reference bureau,
which is a source of statistics and news.

212
00:14:03,271 --> 00:14:05,400
Everything about population.

213
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,160
And it's a very big sheet here.
I'll show it to you,

214
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:15,330
blown up. And it has every region,
the world, every country of the world,

215
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,660
and a large number of demographic
statistics for each of these countries.

216
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,630
So let's
look at one of these.

217
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,770
So yeah,

218
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,240
here is

219
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:42,230
one page of this sheet. Can
you see that? Well enough,

220
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,110
I don't need to pick away.

221
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,500
And what you see is this is the
various numbers that they count.

222
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,540
Population birth rate,
death rate,

223
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:57,630
rate of increase migration rate in or out,
um,

224
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:03,130
plus for coming in out for going out what
their projected population is for 2025

225
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:07,520
or 2050 and so forth.
Down there.

226
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:11,450
A number that we'll try to get to describe
later called the total fertility rate,

227
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,380
which is more or less the number of
children and women are expecting are we'll

228
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:19,130
have as they go through their lifetime.
And then on this side,

229
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:21,110
it's broken down first into the world,

230
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:25,670
broken down by level of development
than by geographic region.

231
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,580
So a lot of really a very good data,

232
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:31,010
very clearly put on here.

233
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:36,430
And you can look first at
the world's population here.

234
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,740
So that's the first
number in the whole thing.

235
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,980
This is the middle of 2008 so there was
6.7 billion people on earth and still

236
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,890
rising.
The expectation for mid 2025 is 8 billion,

237
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,790
and for 20,
59.3 or 4 billion.

238
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,830
Those are guesses about the future.

239
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,600
And I'll tell you maybe
a little bit about how,

240
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,290
how those are done.
Um,

241
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,110
okay,
look now

242
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,890
at the birth rate here.

243
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,020
So this is births per thousand population
and the birth rate of the world, uh,

244
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,960
is, is 21 and we're going to go
crazy going back and forth there. Um,

245
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,290
so how accurate is that? Uh, again,

246
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,710
we don't know large and uncertain aerobars
it's something like a third of the

247
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:33,380
children in the world that don't
have proper birth certificates.

248
00:16:33,381 --> 00:16:36,320
So you can't know whether they've,
they've encountered at all.

249
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,980
So another thing you should
notice about the way it gets,

250
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:44,420
what he's not only the world
when it breaks it down into
development categories,

251
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,410
uh,

252
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:50,060
there's less developed countries that
includes China and less developed

253
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:51,590
countries excluding China.

254
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,040
It's important to get those two things
different because China is considered

255
00:16:57,561 --> 00:16:58,670
very exceptional.

256
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,880
One because of it's one child policy
and they think that the birth rate is

257
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:10,100
abnormally depressed. And two, it's
tremendous rate of economic development.

258
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,670
So if you want a real characterization
of the less developed countries, uh,

259
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,100
even though China is average income is
very low, it's changing very rapidly,

260
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:24,340
then you do it without China and
you get a different numbers there.

261
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,520
Um,
look next

262
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,350
at the birth rate for whoops.

263
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,450
Okay.
That was keeping the birth rate.

264
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:46,690
The birth way for the whole world is 21
per thousand per year and the birth rate

265
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:51,990
for the less developed is 23.
Not a big difference.

266
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,420
Why is that? How come so close?
Whereas for the developed countries,

267
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:58,254
it's 12.

268
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,480
Why is the birth rate for the world
so close to the less developed?

269
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:06,931
Right.

270
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:11,790
The overwhelming majority
of the population is in the
less developed countries.

271
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:16,160
So whatever we understand
about that, that is, uh,

272
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:22,440
what we have to, uh, that is
characteristic of, of the world.

273
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,200
Um,
so

274
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,780
this chain, this difference
in birth rate between say 12,

275
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:38,550
in the more developed countries and uh,
say 23,

276
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:43,200
26, even 36 for the least developed
countries, that is a huge difference.

277
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,440
It's a factor of three between the
most developed and the least developed.

278
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:53,220
And in fact you have something like
two and a half over two in between,

279
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,520
which means that now most of the world
is in the underdeveloped countries,

280
00:18:58,591 --> 00:19:03,540
most of the population. And that will
continue and we'll get more extreme.

281
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:07,830
So here is an example of that.
This is,

282
00:19:07,831 --> 00:19:12,831
we're now talking about here and the
more developed regions like the US or are

283
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:16,560
still growing very slightly,

284
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:21,561
but basically going to be flat as
far as one can project out here.

285
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,620
But the less developed countries are
undergoing this population explosion.

286
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,670
So if the ratio between the less developed
countries and the develop regions is

287
00:19:32,011 --> 00:19:36,570
this now, that will only
increase after, I'm sorry,

288
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:39,990
2050 out here.
So this,

289
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:45,000
that the world is demographically
characterized by the
poor countries is a fact

290
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:48,630
now in a much better fact as time goes on,

291
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:51,390
more a more complete fact.

292
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,100
So that's the first point is about
the accuracies of statistics.

293
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:59,610
The second one here is that
it's not the develop countries.

294
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:01,620
When you think of what's
happening in world population,

295
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,900
don't think of the developed countries.
What's happened,

296
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:08,370
what's happening is what's happening
in the underdeveloped countries of the

297
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:09,570
developing countries.

298
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,620
Now let's shift and
look at the death rate.

299
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:22,390
We've looked a little at the birth
rate and you notice something,

300
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,100
furnishing. Here's the birth
rate. And we've just been
saying for the whole world,

301
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,460
uh, 21, uh, per thousand per year.

302
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:33,070
Look at the death rate eight.

303
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,750
That means there's more than two
and a half times in the world.

304
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:42,751
Now there's more than two and a half
times as many births as there are deaths

305
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,490
and enormous difference.

306
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:51,120
And you can compare in the
less developed regions,

307
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,600
there's something like three times
as many births as there are deaths,

308
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,050
nine deaths,
26 births.

309
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,180
So there's a huge right now,

310
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,680
there's a huge imbalance between the
births and the deaths and as you know,

311
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,150
population stability,

312
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:12,190
which many people think would be a good
thing for the world. Uh, it depends on uh,

313
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,830
the deaths and the births being equal,

314
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,710
which means that the
world is out of kilter.

315
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,700
The ratio between births and deaths
is now out of kilter by a factor of

316
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:25,000
something like two and a half to three,
two and a half of the whole world,

317
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:28,030
three for the developing countries.

318
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,690
And what that means is either the death
rate has to come up to that level or the

319
00:21:34,121 --> 00:21:37,360
birth rate has to come
down or some combination.

320
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:43,170
Part of this is where we'll
see three, what's going to
happen with part of it, uh,

321
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,070
in a bit later. So the, the,

322
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:52,071
the major point of this is that the
world is very far from population

323
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:52,930
stabilization.

324
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,650
You've probably heard lots in the news
about declining birth rates in Europe and

325
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:57,520
Japan and so forth.

326
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,150
And our next lecture will be about
that will be just about that.

327
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,890
But it's not characteristic of the world.
The world is way out,

328
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,980
way out of balance.
And even in the United States,

329
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,910
which is one of the few developing
countries, uh, that still, uh,

330
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,660
having a population increase,

331
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,650
we have 14 births for every eight deaths,

332
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,990
and that's one in three quarters times,
uh, the number of births as death.

333
00:22:25,991 --> 00:22:30,460
So the United States is way out of
whack and that's births versus that that

334
00:22:30,461 --> 00:22:34,270
doesn't include immigration includes the
children of immigrants that are born in

335
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:38,680
this country but doesn't
include immigration. So hour,

336
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,570
hour bursts plus immigration is going
to be at least double our birth rate.

337
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,590
So our population is, uh, also, uh,

338
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,660
not anywhere near balanced.

339
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,440
Okay. Now, unlike the birth rate,

340
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,550
which is very different in
different parts of the world,

341
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:08,740
the death rate is not extraordinarily
different. So here it's,

342
00:23:08,741 --> 00:23:12,400
I see you squinting, is it, can
you see it well enough? Well,

343
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,810
the death rate in the developed
country is 10 per thousand.

344
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,580
And in the less developed
countries, again, without
Trynna, it's nine per thousand.

345
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:26,200
A very small difference.
And the reason for that is,

346
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:31,450
is that mortality has formed
because of vaccination programs,

347
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,130
especially vaccination programs.

348
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,580
Oral Rehydration for diarrhea and a lot
of very basic public health matters.

349
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:40,960
Not Open heart surgery
or anything like that,

350
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,610
but the most basic public health
measures has, has dropped, uh,

351
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,820
the death rate in the world tremendously.
Again,

352
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:53,830
especially the infant death rate sub
Saharan Africa is somewhat of an exception

353
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:59,810
to that. So, uh, did you met anybody?

354
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,960
Remember maybe you studied it.
I think what I said was sort of a,

355
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:04,850
a premodern death rate.

356
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,670
Somebody said it, I think
they said it right, 40,

357
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,530
about 40 per thousand.
And now it's down to one quarter of that,

358
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:23,050
which is a modern rate and
it's not going to decrease, uh,

359
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:27,910
in a, in an enormous amount more. And so,

360
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,630
uh, fertility. So the
changes in the death,

361
00:24:31,631 --> 00:24:33,730
when you look about the
future of population,

362
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,530
further changes in the death rate will
have some effect, but not an enormous, uh,

363
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,380
effect. It's, it's changing
the fertility rate,

364
00:24:41,381 --> 00:24:45,820
the whole future world population depends
essentially on the fertility rate.

365
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:50,080
Little bit from a change in the death
rate, somewhat from people aging,

366
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,340
but primarily fertility rate is what
you watched to find out what's going to

367
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:58,900
happen in the future of rural population.
Unless of course you can.

368
00:24:58,901 --> 00:25:02,650
We have atom bombs or something
like that and everybody dies. Now,

369
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:07,560
as an example of this, uh, uh, um,

370
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,310
deaf flatness of the death
rate, this is from Egypt. Uh,

371
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,300
this, this is a lovely graph. Notice
the little baby in swaddling clothes.

372
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,560
I pulled that.

373
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,000
This is from the Egyptian statistical
abstract though the Egyptian published

374
00:25:21,001 --> 00:25:23,860
this themselves and
it's, it's, it's, it's,

375
00:25:23,861 --> 00:25:27,430
it's not the most reason that goes up to
about 1990 and maybe now they've gotten

376
00:25:27,431 --> 00:25:31,030
more computerized. Don't dress the
things that, but I just liked that.

377
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:34,880
And the color in that color is the
original color in the original statistical

378
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,733
report.

379
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:40,570
So notice the number of births
increasing continuously with,

380
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:42,760
with some small dip here,

381
00:25:42,761 --> 00:25:47,761
but basically it goes from a thousand
to this up here would be 2000 in this

382
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:50,860
period of time,
the birth rate nearly doubles.

383
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,310
And this is absolute number of people,
not a percentage,

384
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,990
but look what happens to the death rate.

385
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:01,770
Very little change in the death rate
starting way back in 1952 so way before,

386
00:26:03,491 --> 00:26:07,600
a lot of very modern kind of medical
stuff. So it's basic medical, uh,

387
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,310
basic public health, basic sanitation
that that's responsible for this. So now,

388
00:26:12,311 --> 00:26:14,440
so the number of deaths and
staying more or less constant.

389
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,480
And of course the natural increase,

390
00:26:16,481 --> 00:26:20,470
the increase in population is the
difference between births and deaths.

391
00:26:20,471 --> 00:26:25,450
So you have an increasing every year you
get more and more population increase.

392
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,930
This is the population explosion.
You've seen numbers like that.

393
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,540
Now, uh, is the death
rate staying constant?

394
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:42,990
No,
the death rate,

395
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:47,010
not saying because the population is
increasing and yet you're having the same

396
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:51,390
number of deaths. So
the percentage of, uh,

397
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,430
of the population that's dying each
year is going down slowly, not at a,

398
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:56,940
at a,

399
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,920
as a percentage of it is a slow decrease
over this time period and continuing

400
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:07,190
the death rate is decreasing but not
in a significant enough to make a big

401
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:12,930
difference in the total
population growth statistics.

402
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,200
So,
uh,

403
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:22,640
the basic thing in the world is that the
fertility rate is what a chain going to

404
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,090
what can change a lot,

405
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,240
can make the difference between a
moral truth population keeps growing or

406
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:31,890
stabilizes or starts
at decreasing. Now, uh,

407
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,650
anybody notice anything funny so far?

408
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:39,390
The one number that should have known one
pair of numbers that should have what?

409
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,030
Let's go back to that.

410
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:45,600
Anything funny about these numbers?

411
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,310
Yeah, so the less developed
countries have a lower birth rate,

412
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,850
then the more developed countries,
Ooh,

413
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,360
not surprising that their health systems
or their health is better than ours.

414
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,440
Let's just check that number
and let's look at, for instance,

415
00:28:09,441 --> 00:28:12,320
in compare the United States
with our neighbor Mexico.

416
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:16,680
We know Mexico is much poorer and
probably doesn't have as good of kind of

417
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,810
system.
Well,

418
00:28:17,811 --> 00:28:22,811
here's our deaths per thousand in
United States is eight Mexico five.

419
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,530
It's good. It's a good bit
less than we have. And further,

420
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,450
here's Central America.

421
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:36,410
There's not a single country
that's as high as we are.

422
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,890
Every single one.
The Central Mountain Curry,

423
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:40,460
I'm putting some pretty poor countries.

424
00:28:40,461 --> 00:28:45,140
El Salvador has a lower death
rate than the United States,

425
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,560
and Mexico is kind of in the middle
between the four and the six striking.

426
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:51,500
You go further afield.

427
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:56,530
Here's the Caribbean and these
are more in the range of a Vus,

428
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:04,220
oops. Of, of, of the U s level. But there,

429
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:08,170
the u s is not better than almost
any of them except for Haiti.

430
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,520
Haiti is the only place that has a
nose bleed. Worse death rate than us.

431
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,553
What?

432
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,650
Yes. Yes. These are total
death rates. Once you're born.

433
00:29:22,651 --> 00:29:25,140
If you die after you're born,
your accounting don't,

434
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:29,340
don't include a spontaneous
or induced abortions.

435
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,500
Okay. So, uh, we got a problem here.

436
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,460
What do you think is the reason for this

437
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,920
loud, loud state some
more over there. People,

438
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:47,950
exactly.
The United States has more older people,

439
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:51,580
and it's a funny thing about older people.
They're the ones who tend to die.

440
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:54,580
Once you've got rid of your
infant mortality issue,

441
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,140
people tend to die at the older ages.
That's exactly correct.

442
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:04,270
And it's an extreme in an, in a developed
country. It's an extreme difference.

443
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,830
Here's what's left. So this the United
States, this is the deaths per thousand,

444
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:13,270
the age of the people. And here's
what's left of the infant mortality.

445
00:30:13,271 --> 00:30:16,990
It's still more dangerous to be an infant
than, than later, but there's virtually,

446
00:30:16,991 --> 00:30:21,100
you can't even see the death
rate through the middle years.

447
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:25,990
But then boom, it goes up as
you get on into the older ages.

448
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,200
So indeed the death rate is completely
sensitive to your age distribution that a

449
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:36,280
country that has more young people
will have a lower death rate.

450
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,740
A country that has a high birth rate,

451
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,520
we'll have more young people
will have a lower death rate.

452
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,130
So what you're seeing
in that anomaly there,

453
00:30:45,131 --> 00:30:50,131
what looked like an anomaly is basically
that Mexico has a higher birth rate of

454
00:30:51,011 --> 00:30:55,030
people. And this funny thing that you
happened to be born young and you die old.

455
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,480
And so that is the explanation for that.

456
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,920
So any time,
any,

457
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:07,330
almost any demographic number that
you want to interpret, marriage rates,

458
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:11,470
birth rates,
death rates of fertility rates,

459
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:17,100
almost everything of interest is
affected by the age distribution and

460
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:20,020
understanding demographics,
statistics,

461
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,440
the most important thing is
always the age distribution.

462
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:27,130
And so you always have
to pay attention to that.

463
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:32,130
And later on I'll show you one of the
mechanisms for paying attention for

464
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:39,040
getting statistics, uh, adjusting
statistics for the age distribution.

465
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,920
Okay?
But how first let's just look at it.

466
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,900
So here is the easiest way of
looking at an age distribution.

467
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:51,160
What you have here, this is for
Germany and the pink is the old,

468
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:54,880
this is 1989 when eastern
west Germany are still split.

469
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,570
So this is the German Democratic Republic,
East Germany.

470
00:31:58,571 --> 00:32:03,560
The pink is East Germans and the
dark is the, is the federal public,

471
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,900
the western money.

472
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,890
And on the left is a man and
on the right is his female,

473
00:32:11,261 --> 00:32:14,290
male and female.
Whoops.

474
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,070
And what this graphs is that every year.

475
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:21,880
So this is age zero and you're
just born to age a hundred.

476
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:25,700
What is this
age?

477
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,480
A hundred that every year
they ask how many people are,

478
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:33,430
how many kids are there between age zero
and one where there's so many males and

479
00:32:33,431 --> 00:32:36,880
so many females. This number in eastern
Germany, this number in western.

480
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:40,790
And so you can go through every age
and just count from your census,

481
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:45,920
the number of people at that age and draw
it out like this. And it's a wonderful,

482
00:32:45,921 --> 00:32:50,510
huge amount of information. In a single
graph. You can see all kinds of things.

483
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,610
Look, this is world war one. The
people born during World War One,

484
00:32:55,611 --> 00:32:57,490
they're almost all all go on.

485
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:01,910
But here's the ones from World War
Two and look at the big difference.

486
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:06,590
Here's your females, here's your
mails. What's the difference?

487
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,630
War deaths,
right?

488
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:15,330
The men are in the army and they
get chewed up on the Russian front.

489
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,660
So you have many more females than males.

490
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,120
It's partially that women live older also.

491
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:24,460
But this case in Germany
is almost exclusive, is,

492
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,560
is overwhelmingly the deaths
from World War One hears.

493
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:30,360
There's still some females,
there's no males. Uh,

494
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,820
and then the deaths from World War Two,

495
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,790
you can see the birth deficit.

496
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,520
These are people who would have
been born during World War One.

497
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:41,610
These were adults fighting age
adults during World War One.

498
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,190
These would have been born,
well, the men were away. Uh,

499
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,410
so they didn't have any babies. They had
very few babies during World War One.

500
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:53,310
And the same thing you see
for World War World War Two.

501
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:57,610
And you'll see again the deficits of uh,
you know,

502
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,750
while where we talked about that.
So you can see that.

503
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,960
Then you can see there's a postwar baby
boom that after the deficit in World War

504
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,860
II, people make up for it. And more
than make up the, for the deficit.

505
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,130
So you have this huge bulge in population,
uh,

506
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,530
both males and females,

507
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:20,280
but now balanced more or less
equal numbers of males and females.

508
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,140
And then you get the baby bust
and you get a little echo effect.

509
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:28,350
So that there's very,
a fluctuations in a puppet.

510
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:33,380
Almost every country has a western country
has these kind of data plus the Asian

511
00:34:34,651 --> 00:34:39,540
countries that were involved in world
war two. So you can see that. See it's a,

512
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:44,130
it's a, it's a wonderful way
of, of understanding a country.

513
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:48,690
Now
this is India

514
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,060
and the census of India.
That's a weird one.

515
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,910
What the heck is going on there?

516
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,253
Yeah,

517
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,230
that's weird. So what it is is
people don't know their ages.

518
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:13,450
There are numerous and so it gets
counted every five or 10 years.

519
00:35:13,451 --> 00:35:15,790
So he has a five year or 10 year period.

520
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:21,120
They know their ages approximately
two proximately a certain year.

521
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,610
They don't know what exactly.
It's not important in a, in a,

522
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:29,170
in a pre industrial country, the exact
age is not all that terribly important.

523
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,990
So, uh, you get this, what that's called,

524
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:36,970
age heaping that when you get a
large excess in five or 10 year,

525
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,220
my own father who was an immigrant,
I did not know his age. There was,

526
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:45,600
he was born either 1904 and 1907
cause he even had a birth certificate,

527
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:49,590
but it was in the Russian cyrillic
character and the four looks like a seven.

528
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,150
So he, he and my mother argued
constantly over how old he actually was.

529
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:59,350
And even countries that have had a long,
you know,

530
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,000
European have the same thing here
as the Soviet Union from there,

531
00:36:03,001 --> 00:36:07,660
1937 census just, and here
again, you get this same age,

532
00:36:07,661 --> 00:36:10,260
cheap and effect,
not quite as extreme as India,

533
00:36:10,261 --> 00:36:15,180
but very clearly here and to a degree
worse with women than with men because

534
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:17,880
women are less educated.
See the big bars here,

535
00:36:17,881 --> 00:36:21,660
the small bars here and in
principle it should be getting less.

536
00:36:21,661 --> 00:36:24,960
With younger people it
should be a clearer,

537
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:28,770
and you certainly have to get rid
of these extreme, uh, uncertainties.

538
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:32,790
But it's not,
it's persisting into the 1930s.

539
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:35,640
This I don't know how old I am,
uh,

540
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:39,150
except within a five or 10 year bracket.

541
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,900
Okay.
And here's another Weirdo.

542
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,623
What's that?

543
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,160
Just to show you that you can immediately,
once you get used to this,

544
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:54,510
immediately tell an awful lot
about country from age pyramid.

545
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,550
Anybody from Arizona?
Nobody.

546
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,590
It's Sun City,
Arizona,

547
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:16,090
which is a retirement community
and they don't allow anybody,

548
00:37:16,091 --> 00:37:20,230
I think most of these have a, an age
limit of 50 if you have to be at least 55.

549
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:24,790
So this is the retirement age and where
my mother lives in, in certain village,

550
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:28,150
in West Palm Beach, looks like
the Florida, looks like that. Uh,

551
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:32,320
various retired and California has
retirement villages. They look like that.

552
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,860
So these population pyramids are wonderful
with lots of information packed into

553
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:42,160
this and from seeing these pyramids,
uh,

554
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:46,270
you can tell a lot, uh, about, um,

555
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,040
yeah,

556
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,560
all right.

557
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,160
You can tell a lot about the socioeconomic
character of the countries because we

558
00:37:52,161 --> 00:37:56,060
know that the poor countries have less
literacy and et Cetera, et Cetera,

559
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,040
and they have higher birth
rates. And so we look at, uh,

560
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,980
what that looks like right now.

561
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,710
So here is uh,

562
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:09,710
two of these population pyramids
and here is you saw on those,

563
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:15,150
the splitting of the world
to more developed regions
and less developed regions.

564
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:20,540
And what do you notice right away,
the total area under this,

565
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:24,370
so this is now five year age.
He travels and single year,

566
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:27,440
so between zero and four is
this amount or this amount?

567
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,910
So it's the area under this is how
many total people there are. So one,

568
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:36,550
you see this a lot less area here is a
lot less people that the less developed

569
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:39,310
regions where the or
the bulk of the world,

570
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:44,550
but also the shape is very different here
in the developed regions you have more

571
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:49,180
or less similar,
uh,

572
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,680
a number of people in all ages.
It's not exactly that way.

573
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,320
Of course at the old ages of people are
dying and that starts about here and

574
00:38:58,321 --> 00:39:03,040
there in the 50s and then accelerates and
this very few less so it narrows here.

575
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:08,340
And also it's narrowing
down here because the,

576
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:13,270
the birth rate in the developed
countries is now below replacement level.

577
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:14,410
Uh,

578
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:18,910
and so the pyramid are getting to be fewer
people in the younger ages than there

579
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:20,740
are older people.

580
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:25,150
Contrast that with less
developed parts of the world.

581
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,870
And you see that there's
more and more younger people,

582
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:32,800
each age cohort has more and more people.

583
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:36,070
You can look at an individual country,

584
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:40,870
and this is a clearer example.

585
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,430
This isn't Nigeria as far as we can
tell from their sentences, but they,

586
00:39:45,431 --> 00:39:50,050
you can tell an age distribution and this
is now present rather than total from

587
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:50,921
from sub samples.

588
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:54,400
You don't need to count aptly everybody
to understand what the age distribution

589
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:58,460
is and here is a 50 year change.

590
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:01,480
There's not one,
it's not changing very much.

591
00:40:01,481 --> 00:40:05,650
This is what it was in 1975 they know
more or less what it is now and they're

592
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:08,020
projecting it out to 2000 I'm sorry,

593
00:40:08,021 --> 00:40:13,021
2005 this is a pretty current and it
looks about the same and vastly as you go

594
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,900
in this case as you go to
younger and younger people,

595
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:22,050
vastly more children than older folks.

596
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,110
So what's happening here can
see what the ages are here.

597
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,270
15 especially in Nigeria,

598
00:40:28,271 --> 00:40:33,271
15 to 45 these are the ages in which
women are giving birth and this number of

599
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:37,990
women is giving birth to
more than two children.

600
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,570
They're more than replacing themselves.

601
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,720
So each bar is bigger than the less,

602
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,250
and some of this in swing, especially
since this is in sub Saharan Africa,

603
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:51,730
some of this reduction is infant
mortality and child mortality.

604
00:40:51,731 --> 00:40:55,390
Some of the different specialties in
this bar and this bar that's in there,

605
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:56,620
but it's a small effect.

606
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:01,810
The major effect is that every generation
is bigger and they produce more and

607
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:06,310
more children here.

608
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:11,470
Um, now, uh,

609
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,353
let's see.

610
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,850
So when you look at how,

611
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:26,930
what's going to evolve in the future,
so here is your women who are

612
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:32,890
40 to 45, that's this, this punch
of when women and women on this.

613
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:38,260
So that's the number of women they're
producing part of these children in

614
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:41,060
another five years. If you
look at this, five years later,

615
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:45,380
these women who were 40 to 45 are
now 45 to 50. No more fertility,

616
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:48,920
pretty much there Nigeria,
and not using a lot of IVF and everything.

617
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,840
So they have stopped reproducing.

618
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:56,050
But that cohort of that size is being
replaced by the ones of this size coming

619
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,970
into fertile ages.

620
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,660
So women that were 10 to 15 are becoming
15 and 20 and starting their child

621
00:42:03,661 --> 00:42:08,420
bearing when women that are 40 to 45
which have not so much childbearing left

622
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:11,780
are going out of existence
stopping childbearing. Absolutely.

623
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:16,610
So the number of women, the number of
child bearers is increasing drastically.

624
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,160
In this case it looks, you know, Ballpark,

625
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:24,430
like there are twice as many women coming
into reproductive age as are leaving

626
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:28,980
reproductive age each each year, each
five years, however you want to count it.

627
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:34,130
So the number of childbearing
women is increasing tremendously.

628
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,890
And the result of that is uh,
here's another comparison.

629
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,730
Whereas in the West, in,
in developed countries,

630
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:49,180
you know the number of 40 to 45 year olds
and not enormously different than the

631
00:42:50,031 --> 00:42:51,450
number to 15 to 19.

632
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,540
So the women that are leaving reproductive
ages are more or less replaced by the

633
00:42:56,541 --> 00:43:01,160
women that are coming into reproductive
ages. Of course with population decline,

634
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:06,161
eventually you get fewer women coming
into reproductive age in developed

635
00:43:06,531 --> 00:43:09,710
countries that are leaving it so
that you have fewer child bearers.

636
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:14,390
So this phenomenon can, if you're,
if you're popular, is increasing,

637
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:17,090
the problem gets more and more severe.
If it's decreasing,

638
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:18,560
the problem gets more and more severe.

639
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,760
There's a positive feedback on this
with your number of child bearers,

640
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:27,350
either growing or decreasing.
Now,

641
00:43:27,351 --> 00:43:30,800
so here is, uh, in
Billy and the number of,

642
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,880
of women of childbearing age in the
world and it just keeps increasing.

643
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:41,060
Right? What, uh, you may be aware of,

644
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:44,030
I haven't really talked about this much.
Yes,

645
00:43:44,031 --> 00:43:48,560
it's in my next lecture here
is the birth rate in the world,

646
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,460
children per women.
So the birth rate has been coming down.

647
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:56,330
So two opposite things are
happening in the world.

648
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,740
The number of childbearing
women is going up,

649
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,520
but the number of children that each of
them has is going down and they predict

650
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,960
optimistically that by 2050,
it will reach about replacement level,

651
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:16,070
about two children per women. But
it's not there. We're not there yet.

652
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:20,580
We're almost double. Uh,
I'm sorry. We're, uh,

653
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:25,100
we're, we're, we're way above that now.

654
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:29,570
So the result of this
number of women rising,

655
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:34,690
their rate of child bearing decreasing
is that the number of births,

656
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:36,420
you sort of multiplied those two out.

657
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:40,380
The number of births is expected
to continue increasing for the,

658
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:43,110
for for the predictable future.

659
00:44:44,010 --> 00:44:48,240
So that's an absolute number of births
will increase as a result of these two

660
00:44:48,870 --> 00:44:50,400
crossing factors.

661
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:56,670
So now the birth rate is
coming down and it eventually,

662
00:44:56,671 --> 00:45:01,650
let's presume in the future, gets to
be too children. What then happens,

663
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:06,690
you still have a pyramid like this,
but now it starts flattening out,

664
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:11,220
but it flattens out. Let's
see, I should do this by hand.

665
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,910
In fact,
I want to go to this graph shows this.

666
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,800
This is what's actually predicted
to happen. So this is again,

667
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:26,970
developing countries and this is
the kind of pyramid that we've seen.

668
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:32,150
This one goes back to 1985 with
this broadly increasing thing.

669
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:37,290
It's basically a triangle, right? You
can think of it as a triangle. Now,

670
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,670
if immediately now god sticks
his finger out of heaven.

671
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:45,420
It says two children and even more
surprising people obey him. What happens,

672
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,070
this is the number of children,

673
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:52,310
people that there are there that
the population pyramid will grow up,

674
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:56,940
but with this as a base so
that it will become square,

675
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:58,800
but there'd be this many people,

676
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,780
so you go from a triangle to a
rectangle with the same base.

677
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,153
Can you see that thing?

678
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:10,310
The number of people is the area
inside that and you had the same base.

679
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:12,000
You go from a triangle to rectangle.

680
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,960
Remember from high school
geometry what the area is,

681
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:21,210
it doubles because if you have
a triangle and you go square,

682
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,420
you just slipped the tea that half the
triangle over and you've got that many

683
00:46:24,421 --> 00:46:25,254
people again.

684
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:30,470
So if a miracle happens and fertility
stops dead right now and we go immediately

685
00:46:32,071 --> 00:46:33,780
to two to children per women,

686
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,100
the population doubles
before it stabilizes, right?

687
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:42,570
What this shows you is that of course
it's that miracle is not going to happen.

688
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:47,900
This is quite optimistic and is already
not not the case that the base will also

689
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:51,450
increase.
Since population is still increasing,

690
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:56,780
the base will increase and yes it will
get more rectangular but even by 2025 it

691
00:46:57,901 --> 00:47:02,901
won't yet be rectangular so that you
will on this kind of production more than

692
00:47:03,391 --> 00:47:08,391
double the population from 1985 because
the base is growing as well as your,

693
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:15,980
you're rising up and so there's an
expectation of quite a lot of population

694
00:47:18,511 --> 00:47:23,511
increase who left this whole
phenomenon where because you,

695
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:29,980
once you start having an increasing
population, uh, you're going to,

696
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,260
the population is going to keep
increasing because there's more and more

697
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:35,950
childbearers unless something drastic
happens to the fertility rate is called

698
00:47:35,951 --> 00:47:40,120
population momentum cause you sort
of moving in a certain direction of

699
00:47:40,121 --> 00:47:42,640
increasing population,
it just continues in.

700
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:47,140
The same thing happens as you'll hear
next lecture with population decreasing.

701
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,500
Then when population decreases you
have fewer and fewer child bearers in,

702
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:53,290
each generation has to say
Japan now or Singapore.

703
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:58,210
And so unless the birth
rate increases tremendously,

704
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:00,790
you'll have fewer and fewer children.

705
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:06,270
And what this shows you is that if
there was immediate replacement,

706
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:09,160
this kind of miracle, that
everything, everything,

707
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:13,210
everybody comes to just two
children immediately, then uh,

708
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,230
the population would be this.
So this effect is all momentum.

709
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:22,470
All of this increase from where we are
now to up here is just a momentum effect.

710
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,750
Just the fact that there's more and more
and more children coming into age and

711
00:48:28,751 --> 00:48:30,580
that takes a very long time to work out.

712
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:33,770
And then the fact that there's in fact a,

713
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:36,490
they're not going
immediately to two children,

714
00:48:36,491 --> 00:48:38,160
not immediate immediate replacement.

715
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:41,590
This is the United Nations guests
as to what's going to happen.

716
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:45,130
The actual population is
projected to go like this.

717
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:49,930
So to chill, if everybody
immediately goes to two children,

718
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,760
you get this population rise.

719
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:57,480
What is actually expected is somewhat
more so huge amount of what's happening

720
00:48:58,661 --> 00:49:03,550
with population. Future is
already determined. It's
already momentum is in there.

721
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:06,460
And even if birth rates
really come down very rapidly,

722
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:10,750
the world's population is
going to continue increasing.

723
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:18,710
Okay. So that's, that's sort of the,

724
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:22,340
an important thing to remember in
the world of fertility is decreasing.

725
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,260
The population is increasing.

726
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:29,910
Uh, and those are not canceling out. Um,

727
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:32,563
so

728
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:37,320
from 1985, the prediction was at the
world population with someone double,

729
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,540
we've made some progress between there,

730
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:44,541
but still we have 6.7 billion now and the
expectation is something like 50% more

731
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:52,220
people on Earth in 2050 and
perhaps continuing to increase,

732
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:53,430
uh,
beyond that,

733
00:49:55,110 --> 00:49:59,250
almost a huge amount of
momentum effects here is,

734
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:03,130
uh,
well let me go back.

735
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:07,950
This is Maureen [inaudible]
and islands in the,

736
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:13,610
in the Indian Ocean and it's one of
the examples of a small underdeveloped

737
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:17,430
country that had a very
surprising fertility decline.

738
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:21,450
So this, uh, this is,

739
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:24,180
this is probably the
influenza epidemic here,

740
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:29,330
but starting in around right after
war two in the, in the late 1940s,

741
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,450
it's death rate fell down.

742
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:35,240
Modern public health
comes in to Mauritius.

743
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:40,160
So the death rate falls dramatically.
Then this fits the standard,

744
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:43,850
uh, characteristic of the
demographic transition.

745
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:48,440
About 20 years later, about one
generation later, people learn what,

746
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:52,670
we don't have to have so many children
because they're not dying and the birth

747
00:50:52,671 --> 00:50:56,600
rate comes down thereafter.

748
00:50:57,770 --> 00:50:59,600
So,
uh,

749
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,550
and population growth is in here.
So this is a country that did well,

750
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:07,130
that starting fairly early for a,
uh,

751
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:12,131
for a developing country in 1951 say
their birth rate is falling down.

752
00:51:12,981 --> 00:51:14,540
They, they really, uh,

753
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:18,080
sort of got it under control and,

754
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,660
but you look at this, so, uh,

755
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:27,980
this is the, uh, uh, the birth,

756
00:51:27,981 --> 00:51:29,240
the total fertility rate,

757
00:51:29,241 --> 00:51:33,680
which is a birth rate here in the stays
stable and then it starts falling down

758
00:51:33,681 --> 00:51:38,390
quite, quite significantly. But look
at, here's the total population size.

759
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:43,510
You don't even see a change.
Well, momentum. So here, the,

760
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:47,960
the birth rate has
started dropping in 1965,

761
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:53,320
and now we're 25 years later and you
don't see hardly any change in the

762
00:51:53,811 --> 00:51:55,010
population growth rate.

763
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:59,570
That's what we talked about by the
momentum effect that because at this time,

764
00:51:59,571 --> 00:52:03,350
before they dropped their fertility at,
at this time,

765
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,610
there were so many more children than
older people that the number of women

766
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,910
childbearers just keeps, it kept
increasing and increasing, increasing.

767
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:15,560
So even though fertility drops, uh,
the number of children's stays high,

768
00:52:15,561 --> 00:52:20,120
even gets higher and the
population just keeps increasing.

769
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:23,660
It's a very, very strong effect
and the number of, and it's not,

770
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:26,810
not flattened out there yet,
25 years later.

771
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:31,100
This is a projection of how long
does it take before it flattens out.

772
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:35,000
So this is,
uh,

773
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:38,000
the first one.

774
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:43,400
The first box is the year that this is
our current size as of whatever year.

775
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:48,290
This was by 23rd. This
in the United States, us,

776
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:52,290
this is the number of, of people. So, uh,

777
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:57,830
this graph was made in, uh, it
doesn't say the date, but our pop in,

778
00:52:57,831 --> 00:53:00,020
we'll increase somewhat by 20,
30.

779
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:03,890
And this really is ignoring the
changes that have happened to this with

780
00:53:03,891 --> 00:53:08,480
immigration and so forth that we will,
we reach two child.

781
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:10,730
Uh,
if our fertility comes down,

782
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:15,731
we reached to child in 2030
and we stabilized because
we have not had a rapidly

783
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:19,360
expanding puppies. So we stabilized
right away. Nigeria, which you,

784
00:53:19,630 --> 00:53:21,920
you saw our current population,

785
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,180
it's supposed to been some optimistic
assumptions reach two children per women

786
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,340
in the year 2035,

787
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:34,910
but then it doesn't stabilize
until 115 years later at again,

788
00:53:36,241 --> 00:53:39,960
a much increased population.
So in the case of Nigeria,

789
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:44,550
after it reaches to child per woman,
after it reaches replacement level,

790
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:48,930
it takes another hundred and 15 years
before population actually stabilizes.

791
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:54,120
This is Bangladesh, 125
years. This is Iran. Uh,

792
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,770
uh, 110 years, Ron has had a big
crash. We'll talk about that.

793
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:02,430
And it's populated with Brazil 145 years.

794
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:05,390
It takes an enormous amount of time,
uh,

795
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:10,430
for momentum to work itself out
after the fertility rate comes down.

796
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:12,810
So it's,
it's,

797
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:17,810
it's quite striking and that's the reason
why we expect so much more population

798
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:24,510
to happen. Again, you can
look at an individual country.

799
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:26,430
This is Algeria.

800
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:33,270
And look at, look at what Algeria
has done between now and 20 years.

801
00:54:33,330 --> 00:54:35,580
That's an enormous rate.
Here's its crude birthrate.

802
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:39,090
It's crude means not
corrected for age or anything.

803
00:54:39,091 --> 00:54:40,470
Just to take a thousand people.

804
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:45,740
How many babies were there
for that thousand people
and in 1965 it was 50 and it

805
00:54:47,131 --> 00:54:52,131
dropped to 38 a very large drop and it's
a drop of 24% they cut their birth rate

806
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:57,780
and a quarter. That's 25% in 20
years. That's more than 1% a year.

807
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:02,550
There's a very, very rapid
change, but because of momentum,

808
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:07,820
the population growth rate was 2.4% in
1965 even though the birth rate is going

809
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:14,820
down,
the population growth rate is going up,

810
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:20,300
all momentum and the percentage change
that the growth rate and increased by 19%

811
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,940
in all of this because at this age they
had been having a population explosion,

812
00:55:26,941 --> 00:55:28,890
so many more younger children than older.

813
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:34,310
The population almost doubled from 12
million to 22 million population went up

814
00:55:34,891 --> 00:55:39,891
83% and the annual population growth
rate increased from a quarter million to

815
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,790
600000.6 million

816
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:48,030
change 217%.

817
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:53,310
So here's the dilemma for
developing countries that
basically all the developing

818
00:55:53,311 --> 00:55:58,260
countries understand that they need that,
that economically there,

819
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:02,190
there'll be destroyed if there
population growth rate increases.

820
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,260
Virtually every developing country has
now an official national policy of trying

821
00:56:07,261 --> 00:56:10,740
to get its birth rate down.
We'll see later that,

822
00:56:10,741 --> 00:56:14,850
that that's okay with the people they're
generally in, in accord with this,

823
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,580
and they can do wonder. They
can do miracles. These country,

824
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:20,850
you'll see some of the drops next time
I'll talk about Nixon, my lecture,

825
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:24,640
I'll talk about some of the fabulous
drops. I mean, this is not exceptional.

826
00:56:24,641 --> 00:56:29,530
This is a very, uh, very, uh, significant
drop, but it's not exceptional,

827
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,860
uh, around the world. And
yet even in the face of that,

828
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:38,130
that population goes up
into massive amounts.

829
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:41,500
83% up 100% of more than somewhat.

830
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:46,420
So as the government is
pushing modernization and as
the government is pushing,

831
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,470
uh,

832
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:52,470
reducing the birth rate and as grassroots
organizations to push the try to get

833
00:56:53,321 --> 00:56:57,730
the birth rate down, the population keeps
increasing. And Industrial Development,

834
00:56:57,731 --> 00:57:00,910
if it's not extremely rapid,
can't keep up with the birth rate.

835
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:05,860
So while these countries are modernizing,
they can see conditions deteriorate,

836
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:08,770
poverty can grow,
crowding can grow,

837
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:12,580
homelessness can grow
again because population,

838
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,500
even though you get your birth rate down,
your population keeps increasing.

839
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:21,280
So extremely.
And so some,

840
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:25,750
some theory believe that there's
kind of a window of opportunity for,

841
00:57:25,751 --> 00:57:30,370
for developing countries that
uh, for instance, you take Egypt,

842
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:35,800
uh, which I'm sure it's also had
one of these drops, not unlike this,

843
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,490
they were the kings of the world, top
of the world in the Pharaoh's time know,

844
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:45,460
you'll know that kind of history.
Then iron was invented but not in Egypt.

845
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:48,850
And Egypt was in the bronze age.
During the pharaohs time.

846
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,870
Iron is invented maybe in Turkey
who I didn't know exactly where.

847
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,710
And the other people's, the world picked
up iron and made iron swords. And the,

848
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:00,400
the Egyptians for some reason
never really got on to iron.

849
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:03,710
Maybe they don't have any iron
anywhere there. And so from a,

850
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,380
from a hundred to 1000 BC
or something till 1950,

851
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:10,390
they were always subject to somebody else.

852
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:15,090
They're always ruled by
someone else until Nasser, uh,

853
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,680
gotten rid of the British.
In 1950,

854
00:58:17,681 --> 00:58:21,670
they were ruled by the British and then
before that by the Turks and buy all

855
00:58:21,671 --> 00:58:25,430
kinds of peoples. The Greeks
before, you know, at, uh,

856
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:28,510
Alexander the Great's time
and so forth in the Romans,

857
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:31,630
they're ruled by someone else.
So here comes, here's 1952,

858
00:58:31,631 --> 00:58:35,170
I think NASA is revolution,
gets rid of the British,

859
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:37,090
sets up an independent republic.

860
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:41,350
The people are very enthusiastic
about this. They're very excited.

861
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:46,210
They're now throw off the shackles of
imperialism and colonialism and they can

862
00:58:46,211 --> 00:58:51,100
now be their own country.
But the birth rate is still very high.

863
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:56,080
The population growth rate is very high.
They have to industrialize real fast.

864
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:59,230
They can't and they don't
industrialize that fast.

865
00:58:59,231 --> 00:59:02,530
They don't modernize their
economy. Why? Whole lot of reasons.

866
00:59:02,531 --> 00:59:06,160
One of which is they waste huge amounts
of money on the conflict with Israel

867
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:09,580
that they have war after war and have
to spend huge amounts of money on the

868
00:59:09,581 --> 00:59:14,530
military that would be better spent,
uh, under economic development.

869
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:19,150
So time passes and the people
have tried to modernize.

870
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:22,100
That's been the ideology.
They tried socialists modernization,

871
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:23,990
they've tried capitalist modernization.

872
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,500
And what they see is
more and more crowding.

873
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:31,790
Poverty is not going away. Conditions
are not getting very much better. I mean,

874
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:34,880
they do get a little bit better,
but not terribly much better.

875
00:59:35,630 --> 00:59:40,160
And so they give up on modernization
when they give up on modernization,

876
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,750
they glorify the past.

877
00:59:41,751 --> 00:59:46,751
They say it was better in the past and
they go to a romantic attitude for what

878
00:59:47,301 --> 00:59:52,301
it was like in and can try to reverse
modernization by resisting further drops

879
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:57,500
in birth rate. For instance,
going back to religion,

880
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:01,880
and when I was in Egypt some some years
back, went into sort of a restaurant.

881
01:00:01,881 --> 01:00:04,550
They seat you sometimes at long tables.
So you know,

882
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,290
people you don't know you sit next to
and uh, if they happen to speak English,

883
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:11,900
which I could talk to them,
I don't speak Arabic.

884
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:17,560
And so the ones that I could talk to
her upper class educated people and

885
01:00:17,751 --> 01:00:22,220
therefore upperclass people that spoke
fairly good English and you meet this a

886
01:00:22,221 --> 01:00:25,850
nice young woman and she was,
uh, at the University of Cairo,

887
01:00:25,851 --> 01:00:29,740
which is my lead school, uh, and
choose an engineering students.

888
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:33,920
So perfectly intelligent, perfectly
modern in that way, wearing a headscarf,

889
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:36,140
you know,
which her mother did not wear,

890
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:40,340
which was not in the previous
generation that she doesn't believe in

891
01:00:40,341 --> 01:00:42,800
modernization.
Basically for her own self benefit,

892
01:00:42,801 --> 01:00:44,900
she'll become an engineer
because she wants a decent job.

893
01:00:44,901 --> 01:00:49,901
She doesn't want to have herself go back
and digging the digging the desert dirt

894
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:54,320
there to try to get some food. She wants
to be a modern person with a good job.

895
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:57,350
At least she wants a good job,
but she doesn't believe in modernization.

896
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,850
The rest of her ideology,

897
01:00:58,851 --> 01:01:03,851
aside from her personal
desires is backward looking
that things were better in

898
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:08,670
the past. Modernization has not worked.
So this is, uh, exam, sort of this,

899
01:01:08,671 --> 01:01:13,671
this window of opportunity
when a country's first
tried to get modernized and

900
01:01:14,391 --> 01:01:17,150
one of the things that goes along with
modernization as the reduced fertility

901
01:01:17,151 --> 01:01:20,060
rate, if it doesn't work,
people will reject that.

902
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:24,620
And a lot of what's going
on in the world today, uh,

903
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,610
with respect to the developed
and undeveloped countries
in the Arab countries in

904
01:01:28,611 --> 01:01:33,260
the western countries has to do with this
rejection of modernization because it

905
01:01:33,261 --> 01:01:37,010
did not work for them.
And with that,

906
01:01:37,011 --> 01:01:39,950
if the birth rate stays high as it
has not in the Muslim countries,

907
01:01:39,951 --> 01:01:42,680
many Muslim countries have
had fabulous progress.

908
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,540
It's been a lot of the Arab countries,

909
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:49,130
the birth rate has stayed very high and
there's these huge numbers of unemployed

910
01:01:49,131 --> 01:01:53,210
young men, the economy cannot
absorb them. They're hanging around,

911
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:58,520
they're idealistic as, as well as young
men are. And what ideas do they pick up?

912
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:03,580
But going back to some imagined past
that was glorious and the world may hinge

913
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:07,520
on this window of opportunity,

914
01:02:07,521 --> 01:02:11,030
how many countries can take advantage
of a China clearly took advantage of it.

915
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:14,210
Japan took advantage of a lot of the
East Asian countries took advantage of

916
01:02:14,211 --> 01:02:15,380
their window of opportunity.

917
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:20,360
A lot of other countries did not take
advantage of their window of opportunity.
