1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,530
Join the first,
a beautiful day and in quite some time.

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,130
Uh, today, uh,

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,270
we're very pleased to have William
Ryerson as our guest speaker and he is

4
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:17,370
president of the population media center,

5
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:21,570
which by the end of the of the lecture
period, you'll know what that is.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:22,913
Uh,

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,150
he graduated from Amherst college
and then he became one of us.

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,480
He was a graduate student
at Yale studying Mars, Mars,

9
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:35,910
the entomology and the ecology
of, of insects. And that field,

10
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,350
people seem to realize that humans are
pushing even the insects out of existence.

11
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,040
So he then became interested in,
in the human aspects of

12
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,970
ecological and population kind of things.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,840
33 years ago he started working in the
field of reproductive health and then if

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,700
I get 15 years and that he started,
uh,

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,140
being involved with a group that was
making TV programs and radio dramas in

16
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:09,081
developing countries and that are on
social issues of things that are troubling

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,640
the societies in which they're shown to.

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,160
And eventually he founded this group,

19
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:21,600
the population media center and is
both the founder and the president of,

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,500
of PMC.

21
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,910
And the soap operas are different than
the kind of soap operas that were used to

22
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,983
in America.

23
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,440
And their purpose is to explore the social
change and deal with the issues that

24
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:41,181
are of great currency for developing
countries where the culture is changing

25
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,170
rapidly in one direction or another,

26
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:47,340
or not changing rapidly
as as the case may be.

27
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,570
And one of the big four is
women's reproductive issues,

28
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:56,520
population issues, HIV
issues, child bride issues,

29
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,590
all of the kinds of issues.

30
00:01:57,591 --> 00:02:00,420
A lot of the ones that we've
been talking about in the class.

31
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,640
What's nice about him and do
do is SEL training of course,

32
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,140
is that both in the design
of of of these programs,

33
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:12,060
he uses really good academic research.

34
00:02:12,061 --> 00:02:16,650
What's really known about social change
and the induction of social change.

35
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,480
They just don't go off and be artsy
fartsy about it. Really study what,

36
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:23,460
what is the successful way of doing this?

37
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,740
And then not only that,

38
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,360
then there's really three stages of
professionals and one understanding the

39
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:32,280
academic stuff so you
know what you're doing.

40
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,130
Then getting the very best people in
whatever country you're working in.

41
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:38,820
The real good actors,
they're the major producers and you know,

42
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,330
groups that really know what they're
doing in terms of entertainment and that

43
00:02:42,331 --> 00:02:46,200
leads to great success, which
you'll describe. And then further,

44
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:50,170
the third step is once you've done it,
did it work. And that's the real, real,

45
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,790
real serious research finding out
you've had, you've done something,

46
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:57,360
you're hoping to inculcate some sort
of social change. Well did it work?

47
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,440
And that's not easy,
but again,

48
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,420
Bill's group has used the most careful
and stringent academic research to try to

49
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,220
get at that issue.
And so these,

50
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,230
these programs have turned out to be
very popular successes and you will,

51
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,410
you'll hear about that.

52
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,060
And they have indeed been successful
in fostering social change.

53
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,490
And so I put bill into the category of
people who have made a difference and

54
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,690
this is not a huge category.
Uh, and so I'm very proud to,

55
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,580
to have to introduce him to you.

56
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,480
Bob. Thank you very much.
Pleasure to be with you. Um,

57
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,800
as Bob said, I started my career, uh,

58
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,420
here at Yale as a graduate
student in ecology and evolution.

59
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,260
And it was just 40 years ago,

60
00:03:48,261 --> 00:03:53,000
last October that I sat in the audience
at the forestry school and heard Paul

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,080
Erlick talk about his then recently
published book, the population bomb.

62
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,780
Uh, he had been invited to give
that lecture by Charles Remington,

63
00:04:02,781 --> 00:04:06,960
who founded this course and who was,
uh,

64
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,050
along with Paul and an attorney
from a Connecticut named,

65
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,913
uh,

66
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,650
uh,
uh,

67
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,440
whatever his name was, an
attorney from Connecticut. Uh,

68
00:04:21,441 --> 00:04:26,270
along with Paul and Charlie Remington
founded zero population growth. Uh,

69
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,330
immediately after the lecture that
Paul gave and I had dinner with Paul at

70
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:33,560
Remington's house that night,

71
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:37,280
got very interested in Dick
Bowers was the attorney's name.

72
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:41,510
I know it would come to me sooner or
later when those synapses connected. Um,

73
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,520
I had dinner with a Erlick at
Remington's house that night,

74
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,760
uh,
took a huge interest in this issue,

75
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:53,510
which of course continues to this day.

76
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:57,590
We're growing by the equivalent
of a new Egypt every year,

77
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,420
uh, on a global level,
about 82 million net growth.

78
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,830
And the environmental impact
of that growth is immense.

79
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:12,430
So I began at that point to think
about how to address population issues,

80
00:05:13,851 --> 00:05:18,851
how to try to bring about a slowing
of of population growth rates and um,

81
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,890
how to also ameliorate the
impact of humans on the planet.

82
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,553
MMM.

83
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,300
The conventional wisdom at the time
was set up family planning clinics,

84
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:33,100
which indeed was a good idea.

85
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:38,620
A lot of that happened particularly in
the 70s with strong financial support and

86
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:40,810
leadership from the u s government.

87
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,050
Something that changed
over the last few decades,

88
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:47,930
but ha is coming back into popularity,
uh,

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,470
with the new administration.
Um,

90
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:55,890
but indeed what became evident even in
the 70s was that the solution was not

91
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:04,310
just the medical model of setting
up family planning clinics.

92
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:06,670
Uh, indeed, um,

93
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:11,660
there was a need to get
people to use them. Uh,

94
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,090
there was great progress made,

95
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:17,930
particularly in the 70s in meeting
the already existing demand.

96
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,560
So we went from 10% of the world's couples
using modern methods of contraception

97
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,420
in 1962,

98
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,710
somewhere in the 40% percentile,
um,

99
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,920
in the late 1970s.

100
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:38,900
And then since then it has crept up
to 55% of adult couples using modern

101
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:43,340
methods. The 45% non users, however,

102
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,850
outnumber the 90% non users of
1960 because of population growth.

103
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,490
So,
uh,

104
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:57,610
we have as big a problem ahead of us as
we did in 1960 but we also have another

105
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:01,850
problem which is the reasons
that they give for non use.

106
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,850
Back in the early 1960s,

107
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,050
the primary reason was lack of
access to contraceptive methods.

108
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,530
Now in country after country has less
than 2% who give that as their reason.

109
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:19,850
And the number one reason
is wanting more children.

110
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,510
That is the bulk of the
nonusers of contraception.

111
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,640
When you take them out,
maybe 200 million, uh,

112
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,840
uh, couples, there is um,

113
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,630
another hundred million that are uh,

114
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:41,390
not using contraception but don't
want an additional pregnancy,

115
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,000
at least not in the next two years,

116
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:47,810
which is the standard question that's
asked in demographic and health surveys.

117
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,650
The top four reasons they
give for their non use,

118
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,850
our fear of side effects.
They've heard it's dangerous, uh,

119
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,630
male opposition,
religious opposition and fatalism.

120
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,440
Now a couple of stories about these
fear of side effects is something that

121
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:11,740
indeed has been intentionally planted
by some religious zealots who are

122
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:12,860
spreading rumors,

123
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:16,550
particularly around east Africa
that condoms contain the AIDS virus.

124
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,780
So people are actually dying
because of this misinformation.

125
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:22,070
They're afraid of using condoms.

126
00:08:22,071 --> 00:08:25,850
They heard that they
contained the HIV virus,

127
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,080
and so they're having unprotected
sex and getting aids and dying.

128
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:34,700
It's really a criminal misinformation
campaign motivated by people who just

129
00:08:34,701 --> 00:08:39,701
think artificial methods of contraception
or not a good idea for theological

130
00:08:39,921 --> 00:08:44,510
reasons that most of their
victims don't understand. Um,

131
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,850
and for that matter, that I don't
understand, but I've tried. Uh,

132
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,440
male opposition is in part male
opposition and it's in part lack of

133
00:08:54,441 --> 00:08:56,460
communication between husbands and wives.

134
00:08:56,461 --> 00:08:59,490
So sometimes in traditional societies,

135
00:08:59,491 --> 00:09:01,860
women think they're husbands are opposed,

136
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,080
but they've never had a conversation
about it and their married life because

137
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,180
this is something that they're
embarrassed to bring up. Fatalism,

138
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,040
uh, is the subject of a very
interesting paper by Etienne Vanderwall.

139
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,950
I'll you've read it.
Okay.

140
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:24,630
So you know about fatalism and belief
that whatever God has decided for you must

141
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:29,631
be fine without any idea that you have
the right in the ability to determine

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,960
the, your own outcomes of your family
life. And then religious opposition. I,

143
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,790
when I say this in the mass media,
I, all of a straw, a lot of fire,

144
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:42,270
but there is no religion that
as opposed to family planning,

145
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,570
uh,
you may have heard otherwise.

146
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,790
There are religions like the Catholic
Church and some conservative, uh,

147
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:53,790
mullahs in Islam who are opposed to
certain methods of family planning.

148
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,500
But there is no religion
that is preaching.

149
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:58,910
Everybody should have as many
children as possible. And indeed the,

150
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:04,190
the Catholic church is in favor of people
limiting their childbearing to those

151
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:06,990
they can afford to care for and love.

152
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,190
So the issue is what
methods are appropriate. Uh,

153
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,390
and certainly we know from Catholic
teachings that methods that are considered

154
00:10:17,851 --> 00:10:20,430
artificial are not approved.

155
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:24,330
But indeed the church goes to great
lengths to teach what we used to call the

156
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:25,051
rhythm method,

157
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:29,520
periodic abstinence as a way of avoiding
unwanted or unplanned pregnancy.

158
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,060
Um,
in the world of Islam,

159
00:10:33,061 --> 00:10:36,870
there are liberal thinkers
who are Islamic scholars,

160
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:41,871
like could to Booton Aziz of Pakistan
who have written that the Qur'an by

161
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:47,910
calling on women to breastfeed their
infants for at least two years is

162
00:10:47,911 --> 00:10:52,230
inherently endorsing family planning. The
Korean doesn't mention family planning,

163
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:53,640
but,
uh,

164
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,890
by asking that women breastfeed their
infants for two years in low nutrition

165
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,340
societies,
this means woman must avoid pregnancy.

166
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,850
So there are in fact official findings
at all rom university to that,

167
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,293
to that effect.

168
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,660
And some Muslim countries are making huge
strides and adopting family planning,

169
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,740
leading one being Iran, which is now
down at replacement level fertility,

170
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,810
uh, in part driven by the ayatollah was
in that country who are promoting family

171
00:11:24,811 --> 00:11:27,960
planning use. And in Pakistan now, uh,

172
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,240
the mosques are handing out contraception.

173
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,900
So there's a dramatic change
going on in the world of Islam.

174
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,020
Uh, having been in the population
field for a long time, uh,

175
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,190
I happened to,
uh,

176
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,130
go to the first world population
conference by the way,

177
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:52,131
I got involved with Erlick and Remington
and starting a Yale chapter of zero

178
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:56,020
population growth that no
longer exists. And, uh,

179
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,800
ended up on the National Executive
Committee of that organization,

180
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:04,420
but went to work with the population
institute in Washington and organization,

181
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:09,100
which I now also am president
of as of six months ago. Uh,

182
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,750
just to keep me from running
out of things to do. And um,

183
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:19,890
at this first world conference on
population held in Bucharest in 1974,

184
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,860
I took 65 students in 20 faculty members
from around the u s to cover this event

185
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:32,971
for newspapers across the u s each
of the students was accredited with a

186
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:37,930
particular newspaper and they all went
as reporters and they filed daily reports

187
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:42,010
and it literally generated hundreds of
news articles about this conference.

188
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,990
Um, Margaret mead happened
to be at this conference,

189
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:50,560
as did a colleague of mine from
the Institute, David Poindexter,

190
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:54,220
who now is the honorary chair
of population media center.

191
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,470
And the two of them looked at the
proposed plan of action at the UN had put

192
00:12:59,471 --> 00:13:04,471
together and found that there was
no reference to the status of women.

193
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:10,090
So they sat down and wrote a paragraph
about the status of women and took it to

194
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:14,250
fill Claxton, who was the head of
the US delegation, uh, staff members,

195
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,750
the State Department under
secretary of General, I mean,

196
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:21,751
under secretary of state of the State
Department on Population Affairs and said,

197
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:27,670
Phil, the plan of actions has
nothing about the status of women.

198
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:28,990
So we've written a paragraph,

199
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:33,580
could you please introduce this in the
plenary session of the intergovernmental

200
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,530
meeting? And he said, well, this
is a meeting about family planning.

201
00:13:38,531 --> 00:13:40,510
What's the status of
women got to do with it?

202
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,600
So by 1994,
the most recent UN conference,

203
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:51,601
which I also attended the world had come
to recognize that the status of women

204
00:13:52,061 --> 00:13:55,540
is central to everything having
to do not only with population,

205
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:59,230
but with economic development
view educate daughters.

206
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:03,730
You Educate Flint families of the future.
Whereas if you educate a man,

207
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:07,200
you educate a man. So, uh,

208
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:12,210
there is a huge need to change the bias
among many people around the world that

209
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:17,920
their daughter's places in the kitchen
or for sale to some man in a polygamous

210
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:20,530
marriage and their sons places in school.

211
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,720
And so indeed promoting behavior
change in that area and,

212
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:30,520
and the human rights of women to play
an equal role with their husbands and

213
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:35,140
making decisions about family
life is critically important. Now.

214
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,463
Uh,

215
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,340
the first real interest I took in the
population field after hearing Eric's talk

216
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:46,960
about the ecological impact
of human encroachment on,

217
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:47,983
uh,

218
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:53,610
the wild lands of the planet and the
threat to biodiversity was the impact of

219
00:14:54,951 --> 00:14:59,951
different age structures of human
populations on a economic welfare.

220
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,120
There's a Princeton
now deceased Princeton,

221
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:10,240
a demographer and the economist
named Ainslie Cole who has done,

222
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:12,170
did a lot of work in this area.

223
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:16,370
And I wrote a paper for my
paper at the forestry school,

224
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,563
um,

225
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:22,810
about his studies of the dependency
ratios that grow from different age

226
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:25,521
structures.

227
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:30,521
That is to say the number of nonworking
children per working adult and in very

228
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:36,840
large families, societies, I. E.
Rapid population growth countries.

229
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,190
Uh,
which are mostly low income.

230
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:45,191
People spend a very high percentage of
their income on immediate survival needs

231
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:47,210
of their children, food,
housing and clothing.

232
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,710
When they,
uh,

233
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,760
reduce family's eyes,
even without any change in family income,

234
00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:01,010
there's money leftover and that money
can be spent on elective goods which

235
00:16:01,011 --> 00:16:03,020
stimulate the manufacturing sector.

236
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,530
It can be invested in education,

237
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,710
it can be invested through the
government and infrastructure,

238
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,040
both of those build economic productivity
and most important it can be saved and

239
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,640
put into investments or just savings
accounts that builds capital,

240
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:27,610
that allows businesses to borrow
money and grow building employment.

241
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,330
And indeed it's the lack
of capital in many poor,

242
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:36,830
rapid population growth countries that
is keeping business from expanding.

243
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:38,930
And that as a result,

244
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,840
is leading to economic stagnation.

245
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:47,380
So when you look at the history of the
countries that have gone from developing

246
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:53,330
status to develop status
since World War Two,

247
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,220
South Korea, Japan, Hong
Kong, Singapore, Taiwan,

248
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,560
The Bahamas and Barbados,

249
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,920
each of those countries first instituted
strong voluntary family planning

250
00:17:06,801 --> 00:17:07,634
programs.

251
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,120
And then their economies took off because
once the fertility rate got down below

252
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:18,050
about 2.3,
money was leftover capital was formed,

253
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:22,610
businesses expanded,
and some of the Asian tigers,

254
00:17:22,611 --> 00:17:25,460
China being the lead among them now,
uh,

255
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,990
are undergoing rapid economic
growth for the same reason. Uh,

256
00:17:29,991 --> 00:17:34,700
obviously economic policies and
various other factors affect this.

257
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,900
But demographics are a key
aspect of economic welfare.

258
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,210
Uh, infrastructure is
also, as I mentioned,

259
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,790
a key issue for economic productivity.

260
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,950
If you don't have roads to get
your crops or to market, uh,

261
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,140
you don't have airports.
Uh,

262
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:58,250
you don't have clean water and a lot of
other things that public infrastructure,

263
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,580
uh,

264
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,140
consists of number one
being education schools,

265
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,260
uh,
for the upcoming generations.

266
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,770
Then your economy's going to falter.

267
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,820
The average developing country spends
$13,000 for public infrastructure,

268
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:22,410
schools, roads, municipal
offices, water, sewer, Cetera,

269
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:26,490
electricity over the
lifetime of each person.

270
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,210
So per capita expenditure of $13,000,

271
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,150
but when you multiply $13,000,

272
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:37,200
times the net growth of the world's
population every year of 82 million,

273
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,720
what do you get?
Have you done that in your head already?

274
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,290
It's $1 trillion a year.

275
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,780
So the price tag just to keep
per capita infrastructure,

276
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:54,110
even in countries around the developing
world is that trillion dollars a year.

277
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,070
They are coming nowhere near making
this expenditure. They can't,

278
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:02,580
they don't have that kind of money in
part because of economic stagnation.

279
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:07,950
So that is being aggravated
by rural to urban migration.

280
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,303
Um,

281
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,750
and so you see urban centers in
developing countries where the urban

282
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:20,700
infrastructure is totally overwhelmed.
I was in Kinshasa year and a half ago and,

283
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,190
uh,
Democratic Republic of the Congo,

284
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:29,630
and that's a city that has infrastructure
designed to handle 600,000 people with

285
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:36,420
10 million people living
there. So in fact, thousands,

286
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,860
hundreds of thousands of people
who are sleeping on open ground,

287
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:42,660
they just have no place to sleep. Um,
the city floods every time it rains,

288
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:47,280
there's inadequate sewage
protection or sewage treatment and

289
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,460
the nuclear power plants that the Belgians
in their wisdom put in before they

290
00:19:53,461 --> 00:19:56,910
left is sitting at the
edge of an erosion zone.

291
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,500
They don't have the money to stop it.

292
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:03,501
So the plant is in danger of falling
over and the environmental advisor to the

293
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:09,750
governor of Kinshasa
state who met my plane,

294
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,240
said he's been trying to,
uh,

295
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,570
he and the governor have been trying to
get the president of the country to shut

296
00:20:15,571 --> 00:20:19,500
the nuclear power plant down
because if it falls over,

297
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:21,540
it's going to make the whole area,

298
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:25,320
including Brazzaville across the river
uninhabitable for thousands of years.

299
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,120
But the president won't shut it down
because he wants to get enough nuclear

300
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:34,680
biproduct to build a bomb so he can bond
and Rwanda because Rwanda has troops

301
00:20:34,681 --> 00:20:37,710
operating in eastern Congo,
which I visited.

302
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,920
I was in Goma about a
little less than a year ago,

303
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,390
and I thought congested was bad until I
got to Goma Gomez where the fighting has

304
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:50,080
been going on recently in
North Kivu province. So,

305
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,150
um,
no,

306
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:55,720
when you see these extreme
examples of lack of infrastructure,

307
00:20:55,721 --> 00:21:00,520
you realize this analysis by
Ainslie call was really prophetic.

308
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:04,910
So, um, now, uh,

309
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,930
the environmental impacts that Paul
Erlick talked about have gone way beyond

310
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:15,990
loss of,
of wild lands and threat to biodiversity.

311
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,260
In fact,

312
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,240
one of the biggest environmental threats
right now is pumping out water from

313
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:27,190
underground aquifers. Uh, 80%
of which is used for irrigation.

314
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:32,140
So, um, in China, in India,

315
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,760
in the American southwest
in every continent. Yeah,

316
00:21:36,761 --> 00:21:41,380
that'd be great in every continent
on the planet.

317
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,970
Uh, because of our growing
population and the demand for food,

318
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,480
which you may have noticed
went up in price recently. Uh,

319
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:54,400
the farmers of the world are pumping
out the underground aquifers that rates

320
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:56,580
higher than the rate of
replacement by rainwater.

321
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,190
This is a classic example of
something that's not sustainable.

322
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:05,191
It's like taking money out of the bank
to pay for your daily living expenses.

323
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,150
You can only do that so long.

324
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,470
The water table in India is
dropping by 10 feet a year.

325
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,380
1,000 farmers of India a couple of
weeks ago, committed mass suicide.

326
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,760
They are having crop failures as they
can no longer drill deep enough to reach

327
00:22:21,761 --> 00:22:26,200
the water. Um, and India
is green revolution,

328
00:22:26,201 --> 00:22:30,550
which bought India maybe 30 years of
time according to Norman Borlaug who won

329
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:34,510
the Nobel prize for his
research on high yield,

330
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:39,700
wheat and rice. And by the way, who's
a member of our program advisory board.

331
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,600
Um, you know, the,

332
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:47,770
the green revolution crops are dependent
on high volumes of water for irrigation

333
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:53,980
and cheap oil, uh, not only to
run the tractors, but to make, uh,

334
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:59,500
pesticides and fertilizer, uh,
to keep these crops growing.

335
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,430
And in fact,

336
00:23:00,431 --> 00:23:05,431
there's an article in the New York Times
within the last week about the coming

337
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:10,600
failure of the green revolution
crops of India, but every country,

338
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,160
or at least every continent is facing
this problem. Thank you very much.

339
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,373
Um,

340
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,630
the,
um,

341
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Yellow River in China does not reach
the ocean two thirds of the year because

342
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,800
it's all being used for irrigation.
Uh,

343
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,900
and what is keeping the rivers of India
and China flowing periodically as the

344
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:41,110
melting of the Himalayan glaciers,
uh,

345
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:45,650
that has occurred seasonally
and waters those lands. However,

346
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,880
with climate change, we're losing
the glaciers and when they disappear,

347
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,080
which will be in the century at the rate
things are going and probably in the

348
00:23:54,081 --> 00:23:56,330
next three decades,
uh,

349
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,360
that combined with inability to find
any more underground water will lead to

350
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,560
dramatic crises with regard to food in,

351
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,780
in Asia and for that matter,
uh,

352
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,150
the same thing is happening in Africa
and we're losing farmland in the American

353
00:24:14,151 --> 00:24:17,060
southwest with the same process going on.

354
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,600
So this is a crisis in the making of
global proportions combined with climate

355
00:24:24,231 --> 00:24:24,651
change,

356
00:24:24,651 --> 00:24:29,600
which is causing the
rainfall patterns to change.

357
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,480
And in some cases rainfall to decrease.

358
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,080
So climate change is indeed the very
visible example of why our current pattern

359
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:44,720
is unsustainable.

360
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:50,170
We are already above 350 parts per million
in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide.

361
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,380
That means even if we stop driving cars
and stop heating with oil tomorrow and

362
00:24:57,111 --> 00:25:00,620
we burn no more fossil fuels of any kind,

363
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:04,070
we are already going to have
devastating climate change.

364
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:08,420
But the arguments going on
in the halls of Congress are,

365
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,310
can we reduce the rate of
increase or can we maybe be,

366
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:18,311
can become so efficient that we level
off or slightly decrease our rates of

367
00:25:20,661 --> 00:25:22,040
greenhouse gas output.

368
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,760
But this is like arguing over which
deck chairs to sit in on the titanic.

369
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:34,060
And unless we actually stop producing
greenhouse gases and find technology to

370
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:40,790
withdraw carbon dioxide and
methane from the atmosphere,

371
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:46,340
the climate is going over a cliff.
The century now don't slit your wrists.

372
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,190
Uh,
there are things we can do.

373
00:25:49,191 --> 00:25:53,150
We have the technology to solve
a lot of these problems. Uh,

374
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:57,080
and indeed the population
issue is a clear cut example.

375
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,690
Population by the way,
is the climate issue.

376
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,550
How many children you have is
a climate related decision.

377
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,060
Because if as an American,

378
00:26:08,061 --> 00:26:11,750
which Americans have the highest
per capita output of greenhouse gas,

379
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,090
you have two children,

380
00:26:14,091 --> 00:26:17,330
each of whom consume 10% less than you do,

381
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:22,520
you're still creating,
uh,

382
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,660
an impact on the environment.
If you have three children,

383
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:30,200
you and your partner spouse,
uh,

384
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,260
are more than replacing yourselves and
you're having a potentially devastating

385
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:39,020
impact. On the environment. If a lot
of people make the same decisions.

386
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:44,021
So decisions on reducing family size in
developed countries in particular are

387
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,090
the least expensive intervention we can
make to reduce impact on the climate.

388
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,940
Even in the developing world
where population growth
is occurring the fastest,

389
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:02,960
the rather optimistic median projection
of the United Nations between now and

390
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:07,110
2050 is the addition
of 2.5 billion people.

391
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,870
That's eight times the U s population.

392
00:27:09,871 --> 00:27:13,710
But at the rates of greenhouse
gas output on a per capital level,

393
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:17,880
it's the carbon equivalent of adding
to United States to the planet.

394
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:23,130
So if we don't solve
the population problem,

395
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:25,320
we're not going to solve
the climate crisis either.

396
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:28,140
So there are a whole bunch
of things facing us now.

397
00:27:28,141 --> 00:27:30,390
How do we address all of
these behavioral things,

398
00:27:30,391 --> 00:27:35,160
including the behavior of Americans will
clearly the mass media is influential.

399
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:40,050
Is there anybody here who
has never watched television?
No. Now when I grew up,

400
00:27:40,051 --> 00:27:43,560
we did not have a television.
They existed,

401
00:27:43,561 --> 00:27:47,730
but my parents thought they were a bad
idea. Uh, and they may have been right.

402
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:51,120
I don't know. But, uh, we went over
to our friends house and watch TV.

403
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:56,130
But indeed we listened to radio programs.
And in many of the developing worlds,

404
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,960
uh, uh, countries,

405
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,190
people still spend their evenings
listening to the radio because they can't

406
00:28:02,191 --> 00:28:04,470
afford TVs in Ethiopia.

407
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:07,590
Only 4% of the population
can afford a television.

408
00:28:07,591 --> 00:28:11,550
But radio is listened to by a
vast majority of the population.

409
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,730
So in our programs,
we use primarily radio,

410
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:22,200
although this methodology that I'm going
to tell you about came out of the world

411
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,860
of television.
Uh,

412
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,980
these are the countries in which we've
been working. We do long running,

413
00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:30,660
serialized dramas,

414
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:35,990
sometimes referred to as soap operas in
which characters evolve into role models

415
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:40,140
for the audience, for elevation of
women's status, daughter education,

416
00:28:40,141 --> 00:28:43,410
use of family planning,
small family norms.

417
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:48,090
We're looking at the idea of applying
this strategy in the United States to

418
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:53,010
address climate issues, uh, and
teenage pregnancy issues. Uh,

419
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,950
we also do talk shows,
we produce print materials,

420
00:28:55,951 --> 00:29:00,951
but it is the entertainment serialized
dramas that are on prime time in these

421
00:29:03,061 --> 00:29:07,410
countries where we have the largest
audiences and therefore have the biggest

422
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:09,630
potential for impact.
Uh,

423
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:14,670
the creator of this methodology is a
Mexican producer named Miguel Sabido who,

424
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:21,570
uh, was vice president of the
biggest commercial network in Mexico,

425
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:26,900
Televisa until his retirement in 1998
in 1975 after looking at the social

426
00:29:32,221 --> 00:29:35,790
learning theory of Stanford
psychologist Albert Bandura,

427
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:41,060
who's still is looking at how role models
influenced behavior psychologically,

428
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,430
uh, still teaching at Stanford, uh,

429
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:49,830
and is probably the world's best known
psychologist and mode is the most

430
00:29:50,411 --> 00:29:55,030
frequently cited psychologists and
professional journal articles of those who

431
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:56,620
are living.
Um,

432
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:02,610
he went up to actually interview Bandura
and went back to Mexico to create a

433
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:06,700
program to promote adult education.

434
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:12,630
And he realized from his
work in overseeing the
audience research division of

435
00:30:13,871 --> 00:30:17,140
the network that his programs,

436
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:21,130
we're having a huge impact on audience
members, so why not use them for good.

437
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,300
And He created a soap
opera with three subplots,

438
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,930
one of which had illiterate
characters in it,

439
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,980
and the other two just were pure
entertainment with changes of fortune and

440
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:39,100
cliffhangers at the end of each episode
and all the stuff that goes along with a

441
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:43,960
soap opera. And they were on at prime
time, or this program was on a primetime,

442
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,370
it was called Venkat Amigo.

443
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:51,040
And it pulled in 33% of
the nation's viewers. The,

444
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:54,520
you know, melodramas defined as
the battle of good versus evil.

445
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:58,360
So the evil characters were telling the
illiterate characters that they were too

446
00:30:58,361 --> 00:31:02,410
old or too stupid to learn and they should
forget about that and stick with what

447
00:31:02,411 --> 00:31:03,244
they have.

448
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:08,050
The positive characters are saying
there's a whole infrastructure for adult

449
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:11,470
education. You ought to give it a try
and you can master it. You're not stupid.

450
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,570
And one by one,

451
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:19,050
these illiterate characters decided to
go to classes and sign up and take the

452
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:23,080
courses and get their diplomas.
And when they did,

453
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:27,520
so their lives improved.
And this huge audience witnessed this.

454
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,940
And Sabido then became
intentional in promoting this.

455
00:31:30,941 --> 00:31:35,860
And he ran an epilogue in which he gave
addresses of registration sites for

456
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:36,850
adult education.

457
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:42,810
And this epilogue followed the episode
in which is most popular character,

458
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:45,280
God,
his diploma and it,

459
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:50,140
I don't speak Spanish and I broke down
in tears what I watched this episode

460
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:53,500
because it's so emotional.
This man crying,

461
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,280
holding his diploma because finally he
can read all the letters he's gotten over

462
00:31:59,711 --> 00:32:01,330
the years from his granddaughter.

463
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,250
And then there's this epilogue perhaps
you two would like to do with this man

464
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:10,570
has done. And Sabido warned the
Ministry of Public Education. He said,

465
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:14,260
you may be aware of the show I'm
doing on Televisa. And they said, yes,

466
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:17,680
we like it very much. It's reinforcing
our public service announcements.

467
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,320
And he said, well, uh,

468
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:24,040
I may generate a crowd because I'm
going to run an advertisement after an

469
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:28,480
upcoming episode in which I give
addresses of your registration sites.

470
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,010
Can you handle a crowd? And they
said, oh, no problem. You know,

471
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:37,870
last year before your program started,
we signed up 99,000 people.

472
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,550
So we're set up to handle large numbers.

473
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:46,010
So he ran that episode and the
following day, in a single day,

474
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:51,460
250,000 people came in to try to register
and he continued to run epilogues,

475
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:57,560
uh, for the remaining weeks
of that 260 episode program.

476
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,270
And by the time it was done,

477
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,230
840,000 people had signed
up for adult education.

478
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,400
Then he did a program called our companyi
may come with me that promoted family

479
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:15,050
planning as a solution to a
problem of family harmony,

480
00:33:15,051 --> 00:33:18,290
which is a perfect subject
for a melodrama. Um,

481
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:22,640
a couple arguing over how many children
to have and how to stay out of poverty

482
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:23,474
and so on.

483
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,620
And they ultimately adopt a method of
family planning and the live happily ever

484
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:30,770
after.
Similar impact on family planning use.

485
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:34,310
And it was during that
program that David Poindexter,

486
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:38,960
my colleague at Population Institute
discovered Sabido doing this program,

487
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,130
1976.

488
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,470
Okay.

489
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,520
And he did two things.

490
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:48,521
He convinced Emilio scargo who owned
Televisa to have Sabido do four more

491
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:54,890
telenovelas dealing with teenage
pregnancy prevention and family planning

492
00:33:54,891 --> 00:33:55,724
promotion.

493
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:01,010
And he took Sabido to meet
Indira Gandhi in India. Uh,

494
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:06,230
I had been in India in 1975 when she
imposed involuntary sterilization,

495
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,623
um,

496
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:12,500
around the country and it caused the
family planning efforts in India to

497
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:17,030
collapse. And she lost the next
election that as she should have a,

498
00:34:17,031 --> 00:34:21,950
it was a total mess and she
was very concerned about
India's population problem,

499
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:24,860
but she didn't try the right strategy.

500
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,940
And ultimately she got reelected
and before her assassination,

501
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,390
Sabido was sitting in front of her saying,
you don't need to use coercion.

502
00:34:32,391 --> 00:34:33,650
You can role model this,

503
00:34:33,651 --> 00:34:36,950
show people the benefits and they'll
decide for themselves whether to do it.

504
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,960
And so they ended up

505
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,260
okay

506
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:45,060
being sent to the head of the
Indian television authority
and Sabido trained the

507
00:34:45,061 --> 00:34:45,990
writer minority.

508
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:50,670
I am Joshi who did India's
first homegrown soap opera,

509
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,500
which had a huge impact.

510
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,190
It's a subject of a book called
India Information Revolution.

511
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,970
It pulled in between 65 and 90%.

512
00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:01,830
I'm anybody who had access to TV.

513
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:07,340
It generated 400,000 letters from viewers
to the Indian television authority.

514
00:35:07,831 --> 00:35:11,250
Half of them address the
characters by name, uh,

515
00:35:11,251 --> 00:35:13,800
with advice on who they
should marry and so on.

516
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:18,390
But a lot of testimonials on how the
program was impacted in the audience

517
00:35:18,391 --> 00:35:19,224
members.

518
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:20,550
Okay.

519
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:25,550
So I got very interested in this
strategy and got involved in studying the

520
00:35:26,281 --> 00:35:28,080
second Indian soap opera,

521
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:33,110
which had huge effects on it's 230
million viewers with regard to attitudes

522
00:35:33,691 --> 00:35:38,340
about age of marriage, women
and acceptability of women
in the outside the home.

523
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,280
So one of the reasons this strategy has
been so effective where it's been tried

524
00:35:44,281 --> 00:35:48,480
around the world is the long
running nature of the program. Um,

525
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,960
because you can't get somebody from say
the status of women of a woman in Sudan

526
00:35:56,401 --> 00:36:01,401
to Gloria Steinem was a 62nd public
service announcement or with a one hour

527
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:02,490
drama.

528
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,810
You really need time to
bring about meaningful change
without creating backlash.

529
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:12,470
And by having gradual evolution of the
transitional characters and only in

530
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:17,370
response to situations that the
audience understands and themselves are

531
00:36:17,371 --> 00:36:20,430
experiencing.
Can you bring about meaningful change?

532
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,990
And the emotional content of melodrama
is also very important for helping people

533
00:36:24,991 --> 00:36:29,670
remember what they learned
from the programs as well
as remembering the program

534
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:30,504
itself.

535
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:32,490
Okay.

536
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:36,840
Do you remember what you were doing
on the morning of September 11th, 2001

537
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:42,830
and do you remember as clearly what you
were doing on the morning of September

538
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:43,663
10th?

539
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:49,110
Now what psychologists tell us is that
emotional involvement enhances memory.

540
00:36:49,111 --> 00:36:54,111
So if you're a highly involved emotionally
in an emotionally based melodrama and

541
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:57,540
you learn lessons from it,
you remember those the rest of your life.

542
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,410
But if it's intellectual,
blah, blah, blah,

543
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,160
it may last not much
longer than the final exam.

544
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:10,040
And I'm probably guilty of that myself.
Ah,

545
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:17,390
there are several other theories that
Sabido incorporated into a theoretical

546
00:37:18,241 --> 00:37:21,710
framework, both psychological
and communication theories, uh,

547
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,730
for the creation of this methodology.

548
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:26,670
And I'm not going to take the
time now to talk about them,

549
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:31,440
but they're very interesting and I
recommend you download this free book from

550
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:36,390
our website that has those theories
spelled out as well as examples of the

551
00:37:36,391 --> 00:37:39,630
strategy as it's been
applied around the world.

552
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,180
She came to class last time,

553
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,040
she did red savvy, who is now
working for population media center.

554
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,753
And

555
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,180
so he's flying to Nairobi today,
um,

556
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,520
in Tanzania in 1993. Um, I took,

557
00:37:58,521 --> 00:38:02,930
Everett Rogers was then associate dean
of the Annenberg School of communications

558
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,850
at University of Southern California
and a research design scientists for

559
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:12,530
Minneapolis named Peter Vaughan
to help design an experimental

560
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:18,710
evaluation to measure the effects
of a Sabido style radio. Surreal.

561
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,050
It was the second one done in Africa.
Um,

562
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:25,110
and it was broadcast with this pattern.

563
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,120
You can see the transmitting towers,

564
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:32,180
the dots and the shaded areas around
them or where you could hear the signal.

565
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:39,650
But we intentionally chose early prime
time when the tower in the Doma was

566
00:38:40,271 --> 00:38:44,080
broadcasting locally produced music
with no social or health content.

567
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,710
So twice a week for two years,
a 208 episode program, uh,

568
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,720
people in the shaded areas heard 20,
not Wakati,

569
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:57,780
let's go with the times or let's
be modern qual in the control area.

570
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,960
They heard music among the characters
in this program was a negative character

571
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:07,330
named [inaudible].

572
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:13,020
He was an alcoholic truck driver with
a girlfriend that every truck stop in a

573
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:17,160
subservient wife named two
new waiting at home. Uh,

574
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:21,310
and he was in Tanzania in society,
every man's ideal.

575
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:25,730
This guy was a sexual athlete. He
was having a wonderful time. Uh,

576
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,620
he had girlfriends everywhere, you know,
draping over him at every truck stop.

577
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:31,563
Uh,

578
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:36,190
and so it attracted a huge mail following
more men than women in this audience,

579
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:39,430
but overall 58% of the
adult population listening

580
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,210
much to him,
Quad Jews surprised.

581
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:47,350
He found he was married to a
transitional character and to new,

582
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,970
uh, perhaps having read some
of the thousands of letters
addressed to her coming

583
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:56,200
into radio Tanzania advising her
that her husband was cheating on her,

584
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,600
stood up to him when he was home on
one of his visits and told them she had

585
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:05,200
heard about the aids epidemic and she
knew what he was up to on the road and he

586
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:08,650
was going to have to use condoms.
And she made that happen.

587
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:14,020
She eventually took a job and ultimately
she founded her own business and became

588
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:16,690
a role model for female
entrepreneurship in Tanzania.

589
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,230
Now if you're a script writer,

590
00:40:20,231 --> 00:40:25,231
you probably figured out am quad to
become sick and for some time the audience

591
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,020
doesn't know what has affected him,

592
00:40:29,021 --> 00:40:34,021
but they find out he now has
aids and two new throws them out,

593
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:39,160
but have ultimately takes him back and
cares for him in a separate bedroom until

594
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:39,994
he dies.

595
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,490
And the audience learned a
few lessons out of this. Uh,

596
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,720
we did nationwide random sample
surveys of 2,750 people annually,

597
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:57,430
starting with a baseline just before going
on the air and then repeated annually

598
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:01,720
for four years. [inaudible] 93 94, 95, 96,

599
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:05,860
97 and from 93 to 95,

600
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,930
this was the pattern of broadcasting.

601
00:41:07,931 --> 00:41:11,490
From 95 to 97 we broadcast
the program and the Doma,

602
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,420
so we were able to measure and
broadcast areas and non-broadcast areas.

603
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:19,270
What was going on with regard
to self reported knowledge,

604
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:20,470
attitudes and behavior.

605
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:26,190
I also got the Ministry of Health to ask
new family planning adopters why they'd

606
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:28,270
come to the clinics.

607
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:34,590
Now in the survey at the end of year to
58% of the adult population listening,

608
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:43,910
82% of the listeners said the program
had caused them to change their behavior

609
00:41:43,911 --> 00:41:45,410
to avoid HIV infection.

610
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,880
We were astounded by how
high an impact it was.

611
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,550
The most common change people said they
had made was reduction in the number of

612
00:41:55,551 --> 00:41:56,540
sexual partners.

613
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:02,150
We didn't have the budget to hire enough
private detectives to verify those

614
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:02,984
claims,

615
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,630
but we got the condom distribution data
from the national aids control program

616
00:42:08,631 --> 00:42:13,631
broken down by district and then the
districts that made up the control area

617
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:18,140
where they got all the national programs
about aids except for the soap opera.

618
00:42:18,141 --> 00:42:21,860
There was a 16% increase
in condom distribution.

619
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:27,340
While in the broadcast areas there was
a 153% increase in condom distribution.

620
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:33,100
Now when we took all of the reported
behavior changes across the country and

621
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,980
extrapolated it to wherever
you could hear this program,

622
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:42,370
the cost per person who changed behavior
to avoid HIV infection was 8 cents us

623
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,600
on family planning,

624
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:49,601
we saw a 10 percentage point increase in
the number of family planning adopters

625
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:55,721
in the initial broadcast areas and zero
change in the control area around the

626
00:42:55,731 --> 00:42:56,930
dome a transmitter.

627
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,880
When we broadcast the program in
Dodoma the following two years,

628
00:43:01,881 --> 00:43:06,881
we had a 16 percentage point increase
in family planning adoption and in both

629
00:43:08,391 --> 00:43:12,410
areas at the time of the broadcasts
were on the air and those areas,

630
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:17,360
41% of the new adopters named the
program as their reason for coming in.

631
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:22,630
The next most impactful intervention
was named by 11% so four to one ratio of

632
00:43:22,761 --> 00:43:27,530
effects between this soap opera and
the next most impactful intervention.

633
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,391
Now.

634
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:33,290
It was right after seeing this data that
I started population media center and I

635
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:38,000
took rose Haji who produced the
Tanzanian program, Tom Kazoo,

636
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:42,800
who was the first African
trained by Sabido and the
first radio person to use it

637
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,320
and Sabido himself to Ethiopia.

638
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:49,370
And we trained a team of
writers to produce two programs.

639
00:43:49,371 --> 00:43:51,320
One in I'm heart,
the national language,

640
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:56,321
which was 257 episodes long and the
second 140 episodes in Oromiffa.

641
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,990
The second most common language,

642
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:02,870
and those were on the air
for two and a half years,

643
00:44:02,871 --> 00:44:07,871
starting in June of o to the [inaudible]
program was listened to by 47% of men,

644
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:09,650
45% of women.

645
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,420
The OROMIFFA program pulled in
another 25% of the population.

646
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:19,220
So we had well over 40 million
people listening to this program and

647
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:26,170
it became the subject of
daily conversations as well
as thousands of letters,

648
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:30,110
15,000 poured into our
office and Adis Abba.

649
00:44:30,111 --> 00:44:32,370
But during the time these
programs were on the air,

650
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,670
most of them in response to
the arm Hark language program,

651
00:44:35,671 --> 00:44:36,990
which had a better time slot.

652
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:42,450
One of those letters from was
from a woman who said, uh,

653
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:48,350
she was so happy we had addressed the
issue of marriage by abduction because you

654
00:44:48,871 --> 00:44:51,960
may not know this,
but in rural Ethiopia,

655
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:57,230
the status of women is so low that it's
considered socially acceptable for a man

656
00:44:57,631 --> 00:44:59,130
to grab a girl off the street.

657
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,850
And I mean a school girl take her home
and rape her and then she's considered to

658
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:07,050
be his wife and she stuck with her
abductor for the rest of her life.

659
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,633
So,

660
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:12,600
and parents won't take the daughter's
back because they're damaged goods and it

661
00:45:12,601 --> 00:45:16,410
would bring shame on the family. So they
leave the girls with these abductors.

662
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,850
Now this is starting to change in courts
are starting to allow these women to

663
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,230
escape.
Uh,

664
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:26,400
we dealt with this in this very popular
program in this letter said thank you so

665
00:45:26,401 --> 00:45:30,870
much for dealing with the
issue of marriage by abduction
through your character.

666
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,713
Wu Baalam,

667
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,840
our own daughter was abducted on our
way to school at age 14 and ended up

668
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:38,070
married as a result.

669
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,360
And we've been afraid to send our 12
year old girls to school for fear of the

670
00:45:42,361 --> 00:45:42,751
same thing.

671
00:45:42,751 --> 00:45:47,640
What happened to them when your program
played and dealt with this issue?

672
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:49,470
The entire village which had listened to,

673
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:54,360
it came together and we agreed to enforce
the law against bearish by abduction

674
00:45:54,361 --> 00:45:57,360
and it's now safe to send our
12 year old girls to school.

675
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:02,070
So this is the kind of qualitative
information we got from those letters.

676
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:07,980
We also had listening groups that filled
out diaries after each episode and

677
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:13,050
periodic focus group discussions for
feedback to the writers and monitoring

678
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:18,080
through 14,400 exit interviews
at reproductive health
clinics to ask people why

679
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:23,901
they had come and baseline and post
broadcast quantitative survey across the

680
00:46:23,911 --> 00:46:24,744
country

681
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:30,980
at the 48 clinics where those 14,000 exit
interviews were carried out at 63% of

682
00:46:32,761 --> 00:46:36,780
the new reproductive health clients were
listening to the program or one of the

683
00:46:36,781 --> 00:46:37,614
programs.

684
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:42,060
And over a fourth of the new clients
cited one of the programs as the primary

685
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:43,830
motivator for seeking services.

686
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:46,693
Okay.

687
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:51,370
Radio Ethiopia is 100% public
service broadcasting. Uh,

688
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:56,030
and a lot of programs dealing with AIDS
and family planning of all the people

689
00:46:56,031 --> 00:46:59,450
who named Radio Ethiopia
or other radio programs,

690
00:46:59,451 --> 00:47:01,850
96% named one of our programs,

691
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:07,090
4% named any of the other programs on
the radio as their source of motivation.

692
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:12,850
This shows increase in use of family
planning from baseline to non listeners to

693
00:47:15,051 --> 00:47:15,884
listeners.

694
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:20,060
The increase among the listeners was
more than double the increase among non

695
00:47:20,061 --> 00:47:25,061
listeners and highly statistically
significant and some of the non listeners

696
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:29,980
were clearly motivated through
conversations with listeners. Oh,

697
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:34,930
this is a decrease in not knowing
how to determine one's HIV status

698
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:41,020
and this is actual reporting of going
for HIV testing. Male listeners,

699
00:47:41,021 --> 00:47:45,010
sod HIV tests at four times
the rate of non listeners,

700
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:48,760
female listeners sought tests at
three times the rate of non listeners.

701
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,730
Now we've done similar work
in these countries, uh,

702
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,450
in Vietnam.

703
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:59,080
We're currently on the air with a program
dealing with HIV AIDS on the voice of

704
00:47:59,081 --> 00:48:03,730
Vietnam in west Africa. We did a
program dealing with child slavery.

705
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:04,720
The,

706
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,070
it was actually something that was
brought about through a request by Ben and

707
00:48:09,071 --> 00:48:11,410
Jerry's.
And funding from them to get started.

708
00:48:11,411 --> 00:48:13,240
And then funding from the u s government.

709
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:19,020
And we measured a quintupling of awareness
among listeners of the problem of

710
00:48:19,871 --> 00:48:24,871
child trafficking and child slavery and
a doubling of interventions by listeners

711
00:48:25,121 --> 00:48:27,540
to stop the practice.
Uh,

712
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:31,810
we've just gone on the air and Molly
with a program promoting family planning.

713
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:35,940
Uh, we've done two
programs in Nigeria. Uh,

714
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:40,950
first one was at the request of the
Rotarian Action Group on Population and

715
00:48:41,591 --> 00:48:46,591
development that was setting up a surgery
to offer repair for women who have

716
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:51,940
upstack obstetric fistula.

717
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:56,890
Something that results from the daughter's
in northern Nigeria being married off

718
00:48:56,891 --> 00:49:00,940
at age nine and getting pregnant at
age 12 and trying to deliver with an

719
00:49:00,941 --> 00:49:05,941
immature pelvis and having obstructed
labor and ending up somewhat torn to

720
00:49:06,761 --> 00:49:09,310
shreds and incontinent.
Uh,

721
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,600
these girls married the older men in
polygamous marriages generally then get

722
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:15,640
thrown out on the street
and live as beggars.

723
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:21,420
And the rotary clubs of northern Nigeria
set up a surgical center to repair them

724
00:49:21,521 --> 00:49:26,080
because for $300, he's women can
be returned to a normal life,

725
00:49:26,081 --> 00:49:28,810
but they know if they are unrepaired,

726
00:49:28,811 --> 00:49:33,670
they're incontinent and they live on
the streets and they smell bad and their

727
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:37,840
social pariahs. So, uh, and in fact,

728
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:41,380
there are 800,000 women in
Nigeria with unrepaired fistulas.

729
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:46,890
So we were able to measure by promoting
family planning and delaying marriage

730
00:49:48,641 --> 00:49:50,080
and childbearing to adulthood.

731
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:54,280
A third of the women coming to family
planning clinics named our program as

732
00:49:54,281 --> 00:49:55,930
their reason for coming in.

733
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:00,820
54% of the women coming for
surgical repair named the
program as the reason they

734
00:50:00,821 --> 00:50:03,130
were at the Ho at the clinic.
Uh,

735
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:08,250
the second program that on the air
currently as being named by 67% of family

736
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:14,371
planning adopters as their motivation
for seeking services in Rwanda,

737
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:19,411
currently 57% of family planning clients
and 59% of HIV testing clients name our

738
00:50:21,581 --> 00:50:25,090
program as their motivation
for coming to the clinic.

739
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:29,870
We're also using the program to promote
preservation of mountain gorilla habitat

740
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:32,420
and more generally,
uh,

741
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:37,340
wilderness areas in Rwanda.
In Sudan,

742
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:42,500
the program addressed the issue of,
uh, of uh, female genital mutilation,

743
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,700
uh,
opposition to FGM and Sudan.

744
00:50:46,701 --> 00:50:48,470
At the time that program was on the air,

745
00:50:48,471 --> 00:50:51,740
went from 28% to 65%.

746
00:50:51,741 --> 00:50:54,560
By the end of the program in Asia,

747
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:59,561
we dealt with a child trafficking also
and in Senegal we've just gone on the air

748
00:51:00,411 --> 00:51:02,870
with the two programs in
two different languages.

749
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:08,590
In the U S we're working
with the Hollywood community
and partnership was the

750
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,590
Academy of Television, arts and sciences
and the screenwriter's guild of America.

751
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:18,080
We've done two briefings for
members of the screenwriter's guild,

752
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:22,730
the most recent one on climate,
population health and security issues.

753
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,760
We held in Hollywood and November.
And the one before that,

754
00:51:25,761 --> 00:51:29,990
a bout a year and a half ago at
Emory school of Public Health,

755
00:51:30,550 --> 00:51:33,290
uh,
looking at the role of entertainment,

756
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:36,170
television and addressing
public health issues.

757
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:41,840
And these are countries in which
we are developing projects.

758
00:51:41,841 --> 00:51:46,841
I was in Papa New Guinea and Uganda in
the development of new projects in the

759
00:51:47,391 --> 00:51:48,350
last two months.

760
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:53,300
But we have projects in various stages of
development in each of these countries.

761
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,470
Now how are we on time?

762
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:04,390
So why don't I take just a few minutes
and show you if I can make this work.

763
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:09,420
A clip from a documentary done by a
CNN vice president for environment,

764
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,450
no longer with CNN,

765
00:52:16,451 --> 00:52:21,040
but she was head of environment for
CNN and Turner Broadcasting Woman named

766
00:52:21,041 --> 00:52:23,480
Barbara Pile.
Um,

767
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:29,340
who did a documentary on this idea
of social content soap operas,

768
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:34,780
uh, in the Philippines
where it's a seal. Alvarez,

769
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,470
uh,
produced a program.

770
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,610
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to
put this on full screen, but let's see.

771
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,250
Well,
I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

772
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:21,770
Let me do this.
I'll reject it.

773
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:23,053
Hmm.

774
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,573
Yup.

775
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:41,110
You sure can.
It's right in here.

776
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:43,923
Okay.

777
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,300
So this is a dock,

778
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:02,190
a documentary about this Philippine
program introduced by Jane Fonda and then

779
00:54:02,191 --> 00:54:06,620
the documentaries by Barbara pile
of the storyline is about, uh,

780
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:10,220
two sisters, one of whom we
lopes, I think the age of 16.

781
00:54:10,221 --> 00:54:14,700
And has a baby every year trying to
please their husband who wants a son and

782
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:15,690
it's a tragedy.

783
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:19,283
Okay.

784
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:20,470
So what do I do?

785
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:21,623
Okay.

786
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:26,880
Uh,
I think you've done it.

787
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:38,723
Numbers,

788
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,333
people,

789
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:50,660
personal journey around the world.

790
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:27,303
Yep.

791
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:26,280
[inaudible] [inaudible]

792
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:51,880
well let's fix that.
Are there lights?

793
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:56,753
Oh thank you.

794
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:02,110
That's a half hour documentary but you
saw the part about it that is on that

795
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:05,180
a soap opera.
Um,

796
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:09,360
and I guess with that I thank you for
your attention and I'd be happy to take

797
01:02:09,361 --> 01:02:10,194
questions.

798
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:13,270
Okay.

799
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:16,360
Are there any questions or comments?

800
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:23,660
Get cell phone once a week
and, well, some are daily,

801
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:28,400
some daytime.
How is it,

802
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:29,803
is that standard

803
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:36,400
at various all over the place and Latin
America its daily day time man primetime

804
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:41,770
in many countries it's twice a week.
Some are once a week,

805
01:02:41,771 --> 01:02:45,880
but once a week is really not adequate
because you have to hold the audience's

806
01:02:45,881 --> 01:02:49,420
interest for a whole week waiting for
the resolution of the latest cliffhanger.

807
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:53,530
So we like to do a minimum of twice a
week and some of them are three times a

808
01:02:53,531 --> 01:02:54,364
week.

809
01:02:56,820 --> 01:03:00,750
Yes.
Having a program

810
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:07,880
like, but halfway through
the show. How do you

811
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:14,690
well, yeah, look, okay, thanks.

812
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:19,720
The question was how do we deal with
people who are drawn into the program

813
01:03:19,911 --> 01:03:24,430
halfway through a two year
or soap opera? Um, and the,

814
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:28,970
the answer is one of the beauties about
having several hundred episodes is you

815
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:33,170
can have a lot of discussion of what's
going on in the past by the characters.

816
01:03:33,171 --> 01:03:37,950
So people who join the
audience partway through, uh,

817
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,640
the two or three years that are,
might be on the air,

818
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
learn a lot about it and they also may
learn about it from other members of the

819
01:03:46,761 --> 01:03:51,290
community. Um, particularly in countries
where we have very high listenership,

820
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:52,820
like northern Nigeria,

821
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:58,270
our most recent measure was 82% of the
adult population are listening every

822
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,970
week. So, uh, they're, you know,

823
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:05,030
it's become a cultural event.
Uh,

824
01:04:05,031 --> 01:04:07,010
so people who are joining it here,

825
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:11,810
both about the program from their
neighbors as well as hearing characters

826
01:04:11,811 --> 01:04:16,790
talking about the past and getting
caught up that way. One of the,

827
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:18,620
one of the questions I'm often asked,

828
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:21,110
and maybe I should wait until
somebody asks me this question,

829
01:04:21,111 --> 01:04:25,610
is how do we decide what it
is we're promoting? And, and,

830
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:26,271
and in a sense,

831
01:04:26,271 --> 01:04:30,410
what gives us as an American organization
the right to go into some country and

832
01:04:30,411 --> 01:04:33,470
tell them how to live. Uh, and indeed,

833
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:38,390
one of the things that we've adopted as
a strategy is looking at the policies of

834
01:04:38,391 --> 01:04:39,290
each country.

835
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:44,930
Most countries are signatories with the
Cairo program of Action on Population

836
01:04:44,931 --> 01:04:49,550
and development and of the Beijing
Platform of action on women's rights.

837
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:53,870
So if there are a signatory
of those documents,

838
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:59,050
then part of their national policy
is incorporated in those documents,

839
01:04:59,091 --> 01:05:02,510
which are really global agreements
on the rights and status of women and

840
01:05:02,511 --> 01:05:03,560
reproductive health.

841
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:09,130
So we use that as a starting point as
the basis for the values will be promoted

842
01:05:09,261 --> 01:05:10,130
by the program.

843
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,660
And then the policies of the
country may add nuances to that.

844
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,370
So when we go into a country,
explained to them,

845
01:05:18,371 --> 01:05:21,250
we are there to help them
promote their policies.

846
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,590
We're not trying to impose
something from the outside.

847
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:24,913
Yes.

848
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:29,770
How do you find that position from
governments or other institutions?

849
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:32,340
Uh, hardly any. Uh,

850
01:05:32,370 --> 01:05:36,220
the question was do we have
opposition from governments? Uh,

851
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:41,240
one of the things about this strategy
is because we're working to support the

852
01:05:42,211 --> 01:05:46,890
government's policies,
they are very enthusiastic about it.

853
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:48,060
And second,

854
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:52,740
we get very little opposition from
the public because of the very gradual

855
01:05:53,100 --> 01:05:54,540
evolution of the characters.

856
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:59,810
And because by doing our homework and
really understanding the culture before we

857
01:06:00,901 --> 01:06:04,020
ever get started and having
writers from that culture,

858
01:06:04,021 --> 01:06:08,130
all of our programs are written,
produced and managed by country nationals.

859
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:12,270
We know what the taboos are
and we steer clear of those.

860
01:06:12,271 --> 01:06:15,420
So we're not there to
give people shock therapy.

861
01:06:15,421 --> 01:06:20,421
We're there to start where they are
and move in the direction of a better

862
01:06:22,141 --> 01:06:24,060
reproductive health and women's rights.

863
01:06:24,630 --> 01:06:28,350
But we don't do it in a way that
creates backlash or opposition.

864
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,233
Yes,

865
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:39,890
they were
made.

866
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:50,480
Um,
and the,

867
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:55,260
the question is with American
shows like seventh heaven, are we,

868
01:06:55,980 --> 01:07:00,480
what's the comparison between
narrow strategy for promoting, uh,

869
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:05,540
not drinking and driving or abstinence
with the kinds of programs we're doing?

870
01:07:06,211 --> 01:07:11,211
And the answer is there is some comparison
that is producers and writers of

871
01:07:12,151 --> 01:07:16,650
American Hollywood shows are members of
society and their parents and they're

872
01:07:16,651 --> 01:07:21,651
very aware of some of the problems and
sometimes they attempt to address issues

873
01:07:23,491 --> 01:07:26,460
in the context of their program.
Um,

874
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:31,590
we had Neil bear as a speaker at an
event we did at Hofstra University, uh,

875
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:35,070
about a month ago, uh, who produces, um,

876
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:37,290
law and order and,
uh,

877
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,260
w also was a producer of er,

878
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:45,960
and they're very intentional efforts to
use some of these programs to promote

879
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:47,400
positive goals.

880
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:52,910
They tend to do so in one or a few
episodes as opposed to having a program

881
01:07:53,641 --> 01:07:57,000
that's designed around a set of issues.

882
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:01,730
So it tends to be briefer
mentions of these issues. Uh,

883
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:04,850
and sometimes they're done well
and sometimes they're not. Uh,

884
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:08,460
but indeed there are lots of examples of,

885
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:13,160
of entertainment chosen
Hollywood, like, um,

886
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:18,590
the bold and the beautiful addressing
aids through a character named Tony who

887
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:21,890
finds out he's HIV positive.
Uh,

888
01:08:21,970 --> 01:08:26,970
and they got a 800 number from Donna
Shalala when she was secretary of Health

889
01:08:27,531 --> 01:08:32,240
and human services that they could run
after those key episodes for people to

890
01:08:32,241 --> 01:08:37,241
call for information that show
generated more calls to that 800 number,

891
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:43,690
then 60 minutes treatment of HIV AIDS and
60 minutes has a much bigger audience,

892
01:08:44,811 --> 01:08:49,580
but it was the emotional impact of
days of our lives that generated a huge

893
01:08:49,581 --> 01:08:54,510
response by the audience. So some
of these have been very useful, um,

894
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:58,250
interventions, but they're quite
different in terms of methodology. Yes.

895
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:00,960
Followup studies

896
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:06,660
like accepted of contraception.

897
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,850
There is some evidence,
um,

898
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:17,070
of course you're asking a
fundraising question. Uh,

899
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:21,770
it is hard to get grants for
say, a 10 year study. Um,

900
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:24,060
but there are,
there is some evidence,

901
01:09:24,061 --> 01:09:28,380
for example with Sabido is family
planning programs. They stopped,

902
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:29,360
uh,

903
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:34,360
addressing family planning issues that
Televisa unrelated to the controversy or

904
01:09:35,221 --> 01:09:36,990
not of the content.

905
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:42,500
They stopped doing social
content broadcasting at
Televisa in 1985 and the birth

906
01:09:47,101 --> 01:09:48,720
rate had come down dramatically.

907
01:09:48,721 --> 01:09:52,200
It was the most dramatic decline in birth
rates of any developing country in the

908
01:09:52,201 --> 01:09:56,220
20th century. During the 10 years.
Sabido is five family planning,

909
01:09:56,221 --> 01:10:01,221
soap operas were on the air when they
stopped the birth rate plateaued,

910
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:05,580
but it did not go back up.
However,

911
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:11,030
our view is because there are new
generations coming along every year and

912
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:16,080
because people continue to need
information on a whole range of health and

913
01:10:16,081 --> 01:10:18,510
social issues,
uh,

914
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,810
these programs should be seen
as a long term intervention.

915
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:26,850
We shouldn't say do a program for three
years and then walk away in the same way

916
01:10:26,851 --> 01:10:30,250
that we wouldn't open a clinic for three
years and then close it down and hope

917
01:10:30,251 --> 01:10:31,710
that the birth rate wouldn't go back up.

918
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:36,030
So we really see this as
a long term intervention.

919
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:40,080
But the evidence that we have,
probably not conclusive,

920
01:10:40,081 --> 01:10:44,760
but it appears that these programs
lead to permanent change in norms.

921
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:47,780
Yes.
Yup.

922
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:54,393
Uh,

923
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:59,590
certainly in countries that have
a mature media market like India,

924
01:10:59,591 --> 01:11:01,630
like Brazil,
uh,

925
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:06,190
we are adopting more a strategy of
working with the producers of existing

926
01:11:06,191 --> 01:11:10,960
programs than trying to produce
our own and compete. So in Brazil,

927
01:11:10,961 --> 01:11:13,060
for example,
we're working in partnership,

928
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:17,550
the Social Merchandising
Department of Tele of TV global,

929
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:20,790
which controls 65% of
the Brazilian audience.

930
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,830
And that strategy, actually
the, their department,

931
01:11:24,831 --> 01:11:29,440
he emerged because of the partnership we
formed originally through a meeting, uh,

932
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:34,550
David Poindexter and I had with Roberto
Marino who own the network and it was

933
01:11:36,001 --> 01:11:38,130
being done through the
product placement division,

934
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:42,360
but ultimately they set up a whole
division to promote social causes through

935
01:11:42,361 --> 01:11:47,160
their telenovelas. And so we helped them
do that and we measured the effects.

936
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:48,211
For example,

937
01:11:48,211 --> 01:11:53,211
36% of the women that planned parenthood
clinics in Brazil were there because of

938
01:11:57,151 --> 01:12:00,080
one soap opera. We evaluated called, uh,

939
01:12:00,090 --> 01:12:04,800
[inaudible] Davita pages of life. Um, and,

940
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,640
um, it's similar to what we're doing
in Hollywood. We're not, you know,

941
01:12:08,641 --> 01:12:10,320
we may do a youtube soap opera,

942
01:12:10,321 --> 01:12:13,890
but we're not likely to get
ourselves on the air on CBS.

943
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:18,690
So we're instead focusing on working
with writers of existing programs.

944
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:22,313
Yes.

945
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:26,780
I mean if they're,

946
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:31,250
if they're writing into the
characters and even suggesting

947
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,910
if that helps or hinders,

948
01:12:39,260 --> 01:12:43,950
uh, it's, it's a question that, uh,

949
01:12:44,270 --> 01:12:47,360
we try to understand before
we ever go on the air.

950
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:49,940
What are their attitudes,

951
01:12:49,941 --> 01:12:54,020
perceptions of and consumption
of entertainment media.

952
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:55,453
Um,

953
01:12:55,700 --> 01:13:00,320
and indeed the audiences in
terms of their sophistication,

954
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,340
their media savvy,

955
01:13:01,341 --> 01:13:05,270
varied dramatically from a place
like Ethiopia to a place like India.

956
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:10,310
So there is no one generalization,
um,

957
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:16,610
but you know, there are many stories
about our experiences in Ethiopia.

958
01:13:16,611 --> 01:13:17,444
For example,

959
01:13:17,930 --> 01:13:21,830
the actress who played the positive
female role model for Corto in that first

960
01:13:21,831 --> 01:13:24,260
program I was talking about,
um,

961
01:13:24,290 --> 01:13:29,290
went into a vegetable market and women
recognized her voice from the radio show

962
01:13:30,171 --> 01:13:34,100
and one of them said, you're for
Kirta. And she said, well, not really.

963
01:13:34,101 --> 01:13:37,140
And they said, no, no, no. We
know you're for Kurt to, um,

964
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:40,550
well we recognize you from Yak
and cabinet. And one of them said,

965
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:44,810
I named my baby daughter after you and
hopes that she would be as wonderful as

966
01:13:44,811 --> 01:13:47,420
you are. So clearly they're, you know,

967
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:51,290
they're not seeing the distinction
between fantasy and reality.

968
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:52,340
But on the other hand,

969
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:57,020
how many times have you heard this
about American audiences? So it's,

970
01:13:57,200 --> 01:14:02,060
it's hard to know really.
Uh, but clearly, uh,

971
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:07,270
probably the lack of sophistication leads
to greater influence of the programs,

972
01:14:07,371 --> 01:14:08,600
but it's hard to know.

973
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,290
Yeah.

974
01:14:11,290 --> 01:14:12,220
One more question.

975
01:14:13,010 --> 01:14:13,290
Yeah.

976
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:17,760
Applying this model to other social
issues such as environmental degradation,

977
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:23,220
because I mean really based on family
relationships and people's relate to each

978
01:14:23,731 --> 01:14:27,460
other. And how do you
see, what's your nozzles,

979
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:30,940
what leaves the success rate of these

980
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,900
environment issues,
what other types of stuff?

981
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:40,150
The question is how do we
feel about applying this
strategy to other issues like

982
01:14:40,151 --> 01:14:43,810
environment as opposed to family
life and family planning issues?

983
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:48,040
And the answer is we feel great about it.
However you point out,

984
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:52,960
it might not be the most exciting soap
opera to do a soap opera on recycling.

985
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:58,390
So it doesn't have the same sex appeal
or audience appeal as a program about

986
01:14:58,391 --> 01:14:59,320
people's lives.

987
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:03,520
So we mix issues and we like to do
programs about life in the country,

988
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:08,800
in the eastern Caribbean.
The nine countries where
we're broadcasting a program.

989
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:13,680
That program is addressing both family
planning and preservation of the rain

990
01:15:13,681 --> 01:15:17,680
forest of the eastern Caribbean in Rwanda.
Similarly,

991
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:19,373
um,

992
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:22,900
we're planning a program in Papa New
Guinea that we'll address conservation of

993
01:15:22,901 --> 01:15:25,600
marine resources and family planning.

994
01:15:25,930 --> 01:15:30,930
And clearly family life issues
are perfect subject for melodrama.

995
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:31,960
Uh,

996
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:36,960
you have to be very careful
how much conservation kind
of content you put into a

997
01:15:38,171 --> 01:15:38,680
program.

998
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:43,680
But indeed you can have the life
of a village in a soap opera.

999
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:47,440
And for example,
in Papa New Guinea,

1000
01:15:47,441 --> 01:15:52,441
one of the fishing practices that there's
clearly a short term strategy is to

1001
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:57,310
use dynamite to blow up the reef and it
stuns all the fish and they can scoop up

1002
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:01,900
out of the ocean, but that's not
a sustainable livelihoods. So,

1003
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:02,591
you know,

1004
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:06,760
we can demonstrate that through a two
year or soap opera in a way that might

1005
01:16:06,761 --> 01:16:11,690
take many more years and be devastating
to the marine environment. Uh,

1006
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:16,720
if it, if people just wait
until they're starving. So, but,

1007
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,270
but the point is well taken.
It's,

1008
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:23,340
it's something where we have to be careful
not to overload it with messages and

1009
01:16:25,121 --> 01:16:26,340
boring information.

1010
01:16:26,341 --> 01:16:29,920
It really has to remain an exciting
program or we'll lose our audience.

1011
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:36,040
Well, I think we better call it quits
because we're past a adjournment time,

1012
01:16:36,041 --> 01:16:37,600
but I thank you all very much.

1013
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:41,070
Okay.
