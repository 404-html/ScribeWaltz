1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:06,490
So you remember when I was
talking about Europe, uh,

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,310
we discussed the fact
that during marriage, uh,

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,230
Europeans just had babies
in a sense willy nilly,

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,010
but we all said it was nowhere near
the maximum that humans are capable of,

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,910
but we thought it was no
sort of cultural constraints,

6
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:26,130
late marriage and stuff like that.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,680
Now we come to China in which the birth
rate within marriage was quite a bit

8
00:00:31,681 --> 00:00:32,514
lower.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,670
And I introduced the question of whether
this was voluntary in the sense of

10
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:42,420
individually decided individual decides
what they want and act on it or was this

11
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:47,190
low birth rate, uh, due to
a cultural constraints, uh,

12
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,850
in a crowded household would maybe
the grandmother sleeping beneath you,

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:54,840
there's no opportunity if the cultural
rules say you can't be friends with your

14
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:59,130
wife, there may be a reduction in
passion. And the conclusion that I,

15
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:04,131
that I gave you was that this didn't
seem to be an individual decision kind of

16
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:07,400
thing, but a cultural kind of
thing. Let me one of the eye,

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,410
it's a little bit out of, out of
place, but I just can't, I can't,

18
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:12,300
I have to love this data so much.
It's so,

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,680
it's so very striking as an example
of people that are not individually,

20
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:20,940
voluntarily controlling their fertility.
So how would you tell if someone is,

21
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,420
you know, you have a big huge
population, uh, you don't,

22
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:28,830
you can't interview all of them. Maybe
it's a dead population, know the old,

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,420
uh, how do you tell a, whether
they're making individual decisions?

24
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,340
Well you have,

25
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,020
one of the ways of doing is to consider
individual events in their lives that

26
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:44,580
you think under any reasonable idea of
what it is to be a human would affect

27
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,510
their fertility.

28
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,310
And one of those events
is a death of a child.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,350
There's many, there's a, I mean,

30
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:55,200
I think you all would naturally say if
you want a certain number of children are

31
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:58,230
going to control consciously.
If your children die,

32
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,230
you're going to try harder to have more,
you're going to try longer.

33
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,890
So here is a Chinese population from 1982.

34
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,010
So we're talking about just at the time
when the one child policy is starting

35
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:16,460
and these are women who have finished
their childbearing by 1980 82 so it's the

36
00:02:16,711 --> 00:02:21,711
generation exactly prior to the one child
policy and it gives you a lot of data.

37
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,450
But look over here it says what happened
to the first four children and it gives

38
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:31,260
you two cases.
All all the children died or all survive.

39
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,310
There's a lot of intermediate cases which
which are not shown in this particular

40
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,900
graph and it's spread out by age to
seeing if there's some sort of age effect.

41
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,130
And here is the mother's
age at laughed last birth.

42
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,510
So if all of them survived,
if all of them died,

43
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,850
you think the mother would
really want to have more.

44
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,180
She stops giving birth at 30 at age 38.7
if they all survived one 10th of the

45
00:02:58,581 --> 00:03:02,590
year, she stopped giving birth
one 10th of a year earlier,

46
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:07,060
one month earlier,
same if the a little bit older group,

47
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,050
you have a point for a year,

48
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:15,730
maybe four months later and
here's 0.1 months. Again,

49
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:20,620
for women who are 20, uh, a their age
at first birth, I'm sorry. They, it,

50
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,270
it,

51
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,480
the age of which they stopped depends on
the age at which they start to a large

52
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:26,020
degree.

53
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,340
So the numbers are this way different
because they started at different ages,

54
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,640
but there's no difference within an age
group on whether all four children died

55
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,210
or all four children survived. That's
just to me, that's a, an amazing, uh,

56
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,210
set of statistics that apparently the,
the continuation,

57
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:50,350
the attempt to have as many children
as possible, just as not depend on,

58
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:54,700
on that event.
Here's another example of this.

59
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,510
This is, uh, as well as custom.
Most of Asia, a lot of the world,

60
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,210
and especially China,
they need males.

61
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:05,770
Sons are much preferred over daughters.
So here's a crazy,

62
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,500
very nicely displayed, a set of data, uh,

63
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,080
saying how many sons have you
had? How many daughters, here's,

64
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:18,970
uh, that have had no sun or no
daughter? And the question is,

65
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:23,971
how many of them proceed these numbers
or the fraction that proceed to have the

66
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:27,820
first birth? So when they get
married and they have no children,

67
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:32,530
neither sun nor daughter point, uh, 0.95,

68
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:36,610
eight, I'm sorry. They
have, they have a son first.

69
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:40,660
They have one son or one daughter.
Those that have a son,

70
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,050
95.8% of them proceed to have a second
child and then that can be the a boy or a

71
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:50,440
girl.
If their first child is a daughter,

72
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,500
96.8% proceed.

73
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,700
So you don't have to look up here and the
details aren't important. But look at,

74
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,480
for instance,
those that have seven sons in a row,

75
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:07,230
this is people that have seven and 72%
72 and a half percent of them proceed to

76
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:11,860
get pregnant. Again, here's
seven daughters in a row.

77
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,200
They want the sons,
they want daughters,

78
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,740
76% a three and a half percent difference.

79
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,650
Almost no difference in their life.
Again,

80
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,940
how many of them after having seven sons,
you're presumed that it's enough.

81
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,660
I have a sense, whereas seven daughters,
they would be desperate to have more,

82
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:30,820
but there's a very small different,

83
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:35,740
a a 3% difference between the
fraction of them that proceed.

84
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:37,750
And you can also see the
numbers are very high.

85
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:43,110
Those that have had seven children are
already 76% proceeded to have another

86
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,910
birth.
They just keep going.

87
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,800
And whether they have all daughters in
a row or all sons in a row makes very

88
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:53,290
little difference.
Finally at eight there is,

89
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,590
it is a 10% different,

90
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:59,840
less less than 10% difference,
but whether that,

91
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,530
that doesn't fit with the
rest of the bath, but it's
still very small difference.

92
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,180
And here's the last graph of this,
of this nature.

93
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,890
And this is again the me, the age of
the mother's last birth. And again,

94
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:14,790
it's the same kind of graph,
uh,

95
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,040
those that have had eight daughters in
a row versus those that have eight sons

96
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:22,070
in a row.
And you think in a sun desire in culture,

97
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,570
if they were controlling their fertility
in any individualistic way that the

98
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:29,810
ones with a lot of sons I would
say, okay enough. You know,

99
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:33,140
and the ones with a lot of daughters
would be desperate to finally have a son.

100
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,070
But look at the difference.
41, the age of 41.4.

101
00:06:37,071 --> 00:06:41,450
If they have eight sons in a
row and the age 41.7, again,

102
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:45,940
three tenths of a year, the
they try just a little bit, uh,

103
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,150
longer, uh, three months
longer. So basically,

104
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,360
I think what this data is telling you is
that people are for sure not responding

105
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:58,160
to their most important
fertility events in their life,

106
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,820
either the sex composition of their
children or the death of the children.

107
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,290
They're just, uh, having, having
children at not an enormous rate

108
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,160
because of the cultural things that
everybody is, is, is behaving under,

109
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,720
not with respect to their
individual experiences and desires.

110
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:24,290
Okay. So this is the context
into which the one child,

111
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,790
the first,
the one she shouted,

112
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:30,791
the later longer fewer policy drops in
and then 10 years later the one child

113
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,710
policy.
So it gives you an amazing,

114
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:38,090
here's a population that just finished
childbearing when the policy starts and

115
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:43,040
there's apparently no thought whatsoever
of individually controlling, uh,

116
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,960
fertility. And all of a sudden the
government tells you, you know, hey,

117
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,870
you gotta you gotta you
got to have fewer children.

118
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,880
And I showed you the rate of fall.

119
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:57,320
The rate of fall during the
70s was just a fantastic.

120
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,210
And then after that fall, again, as I
told you last time to control momentum,

121
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,230
uh,

122
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,230
they institute the one child policy
and the number of births levels off.

123
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,860
And why does the number
of births level off? Uh,

124
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,520
this is again the fertility drop.
Uh,

125
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:21,260
this is the longer later
fuehler a policy in the 1970s.

126
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:24,620
That's where you get the big
drop. 1980, the one child policy,

127
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,270
you don't get any further drops.

128
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,410
And that was a sign of,

129
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,040
well,
uh,

130
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:38,830
an incompetent government incompetently
carried out fertility policy that turns

131
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:43,460
out the one arm of the government was
doing something the opposite to the

132
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:47,360
opposite fact, have another arm
of the government. So here the,

133
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,140
the Chinese were,
uh,

134
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,180
for women's rights issues and uh,
to,

135
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,500
to control somewhat
control the population.

136
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:59,460
They are encouraging later marriage that
didn't want girls married at 13, 14,

137
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:03,750
15 and so forth. So we've
been very successful. The
revolution is, is out here.

138
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,501
Uh,

139
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:09,501
and the age of marriage is already
up to 19 and a half or so by 1965.

140
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,060
And they're being very successful.

141
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,390
And the age of marriage keeps going up
until it reaches a quite respectable 23

142
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,690
that's older than basically all you are.
So most of you,

143
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,590
not at all who it reaches a peak there.
Then what does the government do?

144
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:28,080
It says, well, we're doing
great. We're now very worried.

145
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:32,940
This is the year where they introduced
the one child policy. Uh, we want to,

146
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:38,460
uh, this to continue on up so
they don't have good demographics,

147
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,350
statistics,
and they don't know this data.

148
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,980
They don't actually know what age
people are actually marrying at.

149
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:49,340
So they have an official age which
was actually above this and they,

150
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,270
they they,
I'm sorry it was both.

151
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:57,690
They raised that age to
prevent more marriages.

152
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:01,530
But since people were below
that, uh, what happened was,

153
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:05,640
let's say I'm getting this backwards.
They anyway, the result of a, of a policy,

154
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:09,510
they had the opposite result that result
of instituting new policy and tended to

155
00:10:09,511 --> 00:10:13,350
raise marriage age,
reduced marriage age said.

156
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:15,870
And then you see when they
introduced the one child policy,

157
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,850
the mean age of marriage goes down,
it goes down quite significantly.

158
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,710
So the one child policy saying you have,

159
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:27,711
should have fewer children is working
oppositely two new policy that actually

160
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:32,580
reduces the age at marriage
and increases the span.

161
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:38,210
And the result is this is the number
of new marriages of first marriages and

162
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,440
there's a rise here.
Then it's kind of dipsy doodles.

163
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,410
And then just in time
for the one child policy,

164
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:51,411
the number of new marriages goes crazy
and this big rise in the number of

165
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:53,010
marriages.

166
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:56,850
And remember 98% of Chinese wind when
they get married get pregnant right away.

167
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:58,350
So the next year they have babies.

168
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:04,430
This counteracts basically all of the
effect of the one child policy and that's

169
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,910
one branch of government
making one set of laws, not,

170
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,750
not having the data and not know and not
being in accord with what another set

171
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,710
of government is doing. And
in fact, the one child policy,

172
00:11:16,711 --> 00:11:19,500
I don't want to leave you
with the impression that
the one child policy had no

173
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:23,850
effect. Uh, but you have
to do different statistics.

174
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,180
Remember the total fertility rate takes
all the women that are in an age group,

175
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:33,870
whether they're married or not, and asked
how many children they're having. Well,

176
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:36,930
when you have a big change in
the fraction of women married,

177
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,870
then you have to do use a different
statistic. And when you change, uh,

178
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,000
when the age of marriage changes
as it didn't in China at that time,

179
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,930
you have to now look at a new statistic
called the parity progression ratio,

180
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,200
which is very much like those
triangle graphs that I showed you.

181
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,280
This says this black line, uh, is,

182
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,600
uh,

183
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,010
how many that proceed from having
no children to having one child,

184
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,080
the fracture of the fraction of women.
And this is in the 95% range or something.

185
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:11,800
Basically all the Chinese women at
this time when they get married,

186
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,990
give birth to their first child.

187
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,500
Now the next number is those
that already have one child.

188
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,800
What fraction of them
proceed to have two children?

189
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,870
And the answer is before,
before this policy, uh,

190
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,080
even more than the one that you know,

191
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,530
98% of of women that
already have one child, uh,

192
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,990
proceed to have a second child.

193
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,500
And that may be that in this group
are a fairly, are sterile women,

194
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:41,830
are sterile men. And so that may
be the difference between here,

195
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:46,150
but we don't have that data. So
again, this is very, very high.

196
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,880
And then the other numbers, those
that have two children, what,

197
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:50,860
how many go to three?
Those that have three children,

198
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:54,160
how many go to four or more and so forth.

199
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:55,870
And we don't have data before this,

200
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,860
but you can see that the
first child is uninterrupted.

201
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,960
The one she showered, the later longer,
fewer policy. And the one child policy,

202
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:09,040
uh, does not interrupt the first
birth that goes on as normal,

203
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,170
which is what is expected.

204
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,670
But going to a second child now at the
time of the introduction of the one child

205
00:13:15,671 --> 00:13:17,410
policy,
this,

206
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,150
this crashes as does later births.

207
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,900
And so the one child policy
did have an effect, uh,

208
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:31,720
if you look at those who are already
married, but the two different policies,

209
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:35,950
one lowering the age of
marriage counteracts the
effect. And for number of years,

210
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,460
the fertility rate stays constant.
And we've just had some visitors, oh,

211
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:43,310
let me show you what that was
talking about. This is the,

212
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,630
the birth rate in China that what's
called the total fertility rate.

213
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:50,110
And here's 1970,
when the later longer,

214
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:55,111
fewer policy was introduced and it
was the decade of the 1970s where the

215
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:58,990
fertility rate in China fell in 1979,

216
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:03,991
1980 the one child policy is introduced
and for about a decade or so,

217
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,340
the birth rate does not decrease under
that. So we have some guests apparently.

218
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,540
Okay. So, uh,

219
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,790
what was happening was that in the,
in the cities, as I mentioned, uh,

220
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,840
there was a very significant
birth drop in the 60s,

221
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,310
even before the government was on then
the 70s during lunch Shao the city

222
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,260
populations went down to below fertility
level. Uh, but in the countrysides,

223
00:14:32,261 --> 00:14:35,860
even though there was a big drop in,
in the 70s,

224
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,400
it wasn't anything like
it was in the cities.

225
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,310
And as you heard from a chain who,
who talked about her family's experience,

226
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,550
uh, in the cities, there were many
people that worked for the government.

227
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:50,440
And so we're under tight
government control.

228
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:54,350
Many of them work in government owned
factories or in tight government control.

229
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,780
And in general in cities,
uh,

230
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,980
there is much more ability
to control the people.

231
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,750
However, at that time, 80% of
Chinese people lived in villages.

232
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,800
It was still a very rural a country.
And they're the store.

233
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:13,340
So the story is different among
other things in many villages,

234
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,350
all the people that are related,
they're all relatives. So, uh,

235
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,660
the professor who's got the next lab too,
mine is named John and his village.

236
00:15:20,661 --> 00:15:23,000
Everybody's, you're young.
And they're all related.

237
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,740
So if people don't
believe, uh, in a policy,

238
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:31,220
they don't want to obey the government
and everybody's related, you know, your,

239
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,580
your uncle second removed can't really
enforce a policy on you if your relative,

240
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:40,640
especially in a,
in a culture where kinship means so much.

241
00:15:40,641 --> 00:15:44,600
And the relationship between
relatives, uh, mean so much.

242
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,460
So, uh, the, the, the,

243
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,560
the one child policy was much, much
less successful, uh, in the countryside.

244
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,551
Similarly,

245
00:15:55,551 --> 00:15:59,960
the cities were beginning to have access
jobs and people were screaming out of

246
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:03,450
the country side also because of
population growth, there was no land left.

247
00:16:03,451 --> 00:16:06,290
So they're streaming out of the country,
countryside going into the cities.

248
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,590
They didn't have, uh, uh, legal,
uh, living permits. They have,

249
00:16:10,591 --> 00:16:13,160
they have a system where you have your
document where you live and you have to

250
00:16:13,161 --> 00:16:16,370
stay there. And they were not allowed
officially to come into the cities,

251
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:17,300
but of course they did.

252
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,360
And so the government didn't know where
they were and basically had no control

253
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:23,450
over them. And so they, uh, were,

254
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,020
were very hard to control. So, uh,

255
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,930
yeah,

256
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,500
even though among, uh, so,

257
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:38,501
and then another thing that happens again
just at this time is that previously

258
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,040
everybody, the peasants had been in
communes. I talked about them last time,

259
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:47,420
you know, several thousand families in
one big fan farm, uh, and under again,

260
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:49,580
strict control of the government.

261
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,430
Then that with a great leap forward,

262
00:16:52,431 --> 00:16:56,840
they realize the commune system has failed
and the land goes back to the people.

263
00:16:56,841 --> 00:17:00,800
They break up the communes and
people get their own plot of land.

264
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:02,120
They don't own it now or sense,

265
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:06,140
but they have the rights to
work on that plot of land. Well,

266
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:09,780
they start growing their own food,
private markets for food, uh,

267
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,640
grow up and the people are not getting
everything they need from the government.

268
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,610
So if they really oppose
some government policy,

269
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,060
then they can tell the government by, by,
you know, I don't need anything from you.

270
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,650
I'm now an independent farmer
and I'll do, uh, what I want.

271
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,670
And so the change to a market economy,

272
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:33,290
the change to more economic freedom
for the individuals led to all kinds of

273
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:38,270
personal freedom and led to the
ability to say no to the government.

274
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,010
And so you,
you at at the time in the press,

275
00:17:45,011 --> 00:17:49,530
there are all kinds of examples of what
was going on. And uh, for instance,

276
00:17:49,531 --> 00:17:54,160
here's one article from 1980.
Again, I'm sorry this is too,

277
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:57,870
I'm sorry, the year 2000. So the one child
policy has been in effect for 20 years.

278
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,850
No one can accuse. WHOA sweet. Far,
I'm not knowing what he wanted.

279
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,180
The 47 year old farmer dreamed of
having a son after seven daughters,

280
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:13,340
he finally got a male
heir in 1989 ho named him.

281
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,660
Why Fang or change in the weather?
And then he stopped having children.

282
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,350
So seven daughters and a son.
So this, this person, most,

283
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,560
almost all of that time must have been
under the one child policy, eight,

284
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,390
eight children. And he says it wasn't
easy to have all these children,

285
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,560
but it wasn't hard either.

286
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,640
The farmer said if things
became tough in our village,

287
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,450
if there was a campaign to enforce the
rule in their village and trying to has

288
00:18:40,451 --> 00:18:44,880
these political campaigns to get people
to change their behavior quite routinely

289
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:45,714
at this time,

290
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,930
well my wife just went to another township
to have the child and but what's the

291
00:18:52,051 --> 00:18:56,460
other side of the coin is this one now
has a wife and eight children to support

292
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:57,780
and how much land does he have?

293
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,460
One third of an Acre for eight, nine, 10,

294
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,503
10 people.

295
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:08,640
This is not a good economic system and
exactly why the one child policy was

296
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:09,474
instituted.

297
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,050
So an American misconception fed by our
presses that China's government is very

298
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:20,490
monolithic. The chairman in pay
gang or some bureaucrat, you know,

299
00:19:20,491 --> 00:19:23,340
says this is the rule,
this is the law of spells it out.

300
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,580
Everybody has to obey this
law isn't the case Mo,

301
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,890
there's whole books now on on,
on how China is actually ruled.

302
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,870
And the story is that the
government almost gives a
slogan. So one child policy,

303
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,530
or they sometimes call it the only child
policy is not a set of rules. It's,

304
00:19:41,531 --> 00:19:43,020
it's kind of almost a slogan.

305
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:47,040
Then it goes down to the provinces and
each province has to determine it in

306
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:51,900
accord with local conditions as which is
the official way of stating it in each

307
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:54,540
province, gives it down to the
prefectures and the same thing.

308
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:58,200
It's interpreted by local
under local conditions.

309
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,520
And then it goes down to the villages
where it's completely changed.

310
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,710
And so there's no absolutely no
uniformity from village to village.

311
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,620
And what that result in it, it was the
policy was never able to be, uh, uh,

312
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,720
uh,
consistently put into practice.

313
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:19,530
And the statistics give
you the answer to that.

314
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,430
The total fertility rate
during this initial period of,

315
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,180
of enforcement of the one child
policy never fell below two.

316
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:32,070
So the policy was one child,
but it never fell below two children.

317
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,050
Uh, in the rural areas,
it never fell below 2.5.

318
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,760
There's you saw and a couple of
lectures ago, Ching showed you the, uh,

319
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:45,870
the one child certificate where there
a couple of promises is just a promise.

320
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:46,261
This isn't,

321
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:49,510
say you've done it and just even to
promise that you're only gonna have one

322
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:51,980
child. And uh, uh,

323
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:57,210
less than 20% of married couples ever
signed onto even that promise of having

324
00:20:58,211 --> 00:21:00,370
one child, which was
telling the government, no,

325
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:05,371
we're not going to comply with
this policy throughout the 1980s,

326
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:09,440
which again was when the policy
was most strictly enforce. Uh,

327
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,190
nearly half of all the births were second,

328
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,950
third or higher order births.

329
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,760
80% of China's children had
brothers or sisters or both. Uh,

330
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,350
many had had had both and,

331
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:26,450
and only one fifth of 300.

332
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,460
The 300 million children under age
14 were from single child families.

333
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,300
And in 1986, again, after the first

334
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,390
good question, what do you
say? Inconsistent applications?

335
00:21:42,391 --> 00:21:45,960
The one child policy or a reflection
on the pocket, the one child policy.

336
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,940
Never to my understanding then one child,
if you're not enough

337
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,290
both at this time,

338
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:56,680
initially it was supposed to be one
child for all except minority peoples who

339
00:21:56,681 --> 00:22:00,340
were very small part of the public.
I'll turn minute that they,

340
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,000
because of popular resistance,
they immediately loosened it up.

341
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:09,220
So the main thing which you're probably
referring to a is that rather rather

342
00:22:09,221 --> 00:22:12,810
soon, uh, they said peasants, the p the,

343
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,490
the city people had already
had their fertility drop.

344
00:22:15,491 --> 00:22:18,730
Many of them were not very interested in
having more than one child who was not

345
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:23,950
a huge issue for you. One of your readings
discusses that when the countryside,

346
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:27,340
the peasants still wanted, uh,
certainly a son more children.

347
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:32,080
So the policy was changed rather rapidly.
So that if you,

348
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,870
if your first child is a daughter,
you can have,

349
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,900
you can have another one and try
for a boy. But two is the limit.

350
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,060
And of course two was,
was not even,

351
00:22:40,061 --> 00:22:43,390
that was not always observed.

352
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,870
Um, so, uh, so the,

353
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,400
remember I told you last time that the
goal when the Chinese population crossed

354
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:56,590
a billion or was looked like it was,

355
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,100
it was very close to crossing a billion
and the government sort of desperately

356
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:05,101
wanted to keep the population
below 1.2 billion in the year 2000.

357
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,780
They didn't make it. The population was
1.3 billion, they missed by 100 million.

358
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,550
And now it's a considerably
over over that.

359
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:20,020
And the population is still growing
because of population momentum. Again,

360
00:23:20,021 --> 00:23:21,850
the age structure of China,

361
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:26,290
China's population is expected to grow
by another hundred and 50 million people

362
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,960
by 2025.

363
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:33,250
So even though they've worked so hard
and suffered so much under these various

364
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:35,290
policies to restrict fertility,

365
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:40,590
they're still going to increase from
now from 2008 to 2025 by half the total

366
00:23:40,601 --> 00:23:45,100
population of the United States.
And again,

367
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,720
comparable to a calculation
I gave you earlier, uh,

368
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:52,280
Hu Jintao who was president
of China, uh, recently,

369
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:52,810
uh,

370
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,810
it says the party plans to quadruple
economic output per capita in that time.

371
00:23:59,031 --> 00:24:01,310
This is before the economic
crash that has just happened,

372
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:06,080
but he wanted a quadruple,
uh, the per capita income,

373
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:10,250
which would still bring China up
only to a low European level perhaps.

374
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,210
And so with one,
with a,

375
00:24:12,211 --> 00:24:16,580
a 1.3 billion population
and you're quadrupling it,

376
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,560
that's equal to 5.2 billion.

377
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,340
And the whole population of the
earth is only 6.3. I mean only.

378
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,880
So you're talking about China's
economic and population growth alone,

379
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:33,730
almost doubling the world's economic
activity and therefore something like

380
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:37,040
doubling the economic drain on it.

381
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,750
So, uh, China's TFR now,

382
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:45,170
after this period of stability and
after the marriage thing got settled,

383
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,190
it has drifted down slowly as,
uh,

384
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,870
almost all of the world has.

385
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:56,450
It's now 1.6. It's still nowhere
near one child per family.

386
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:58,640
It's 1.6 now.

387
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:03,820
But that will eventually reduce the
size of the Chinese population if it is

388
00:25:03,891 --> 00:25:04,724
maintained.

389
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,370
But we should keep in mind is
this was the Chinese route,

390
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,270
uh, to, uh, lower population. And I told,

391
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:17,210
I described to you the popular they
started with that was not paying any

392
00:25:17,211 --> 00:25:21,410
attention to,
to individual desires and fertility.

393
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,970
And they brought it down by
a strong government policy,

394
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,220
good amount of coercion and so forth.

395
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:33,020
But the Chinese populations around other
parts of East Asia have lowered their

396
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:35,840
birth rate even more,
or I should say they started Laura,

397
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,070
they reached an even lower level.
So China has 1.6 as I told you,

398
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,860
the Chinese population of Singapore
is 1.4 children per women. Uh,

399
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,640
the Japanese are not Chinese,

400
00:25:46,641 --> 00:25:51,641
obviously 1.3 Taiwan
1.1 South Korea again,

401
00:25:51,741 --> 00:25:56,741
not Chinese 1.3 Hong Kong 1.0 and Macau
1.0 none of these places were under the

402
00:25:58,971 --> 00:26:01,040
one child policy. Actually,
I'm not sure about Macau,

403
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:04,730
but all the others are not under the
one child policy and they have a lower

404
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:08,240
birth rate than the Chinese policy.

405
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:13,250
And we'll have to discuss in a later
lecture why this should be, should be.

406
00:26:13,251 --> 00:26:14,084
So

407
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,890
we wanted to finish up talking
specifically about China, uh,

408
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,140
to mention a little bit
economic globalization, which
you're all aware of. And uh,

409
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:27,770
because of globalization,
the u s in China joined at the hip,

410
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:32,030
I mean for the,
for our both our economies to succeed,

411
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,750
we have to buy a lot of Chinese stuff.
They have to buy our bonds,

412
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:39,530
they keep their people employed by
shipping us stuff stuff and we send them

413
00:26:39,531 --> 00:26:44,020
green paper back. The, the economics
of this is quite crazy, uh,

414
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,080
altogether because they can never use.

415
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,320
What's interesting is they basically can
never use the money that we send them,

416
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:53,610
that if they have trillion
dollars or so in, in us bonds,

417
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,020
and if they ever tried to sell them,

418
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,050
the value of the dollar
goes to zero and there's,

419
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,740
they have to sell them for
nothing. Anyway, that's a
separate story. It's crazy.

420
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,480
A lot of causes or reasons
for globalization, number
one is shipping costs.

421
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,600
The whole idea of the shipping
when it went to containers,

422
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,670
the cost of shipping something from
China to the west coast of America, uh,

423
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,800
dropped drastically.
Ships carry an awful lot.

424
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,870
The water floats in Lacrosse
and they just have to,

425
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,160
the only energy that's used is to, is
to get, get over the friction of the,

426
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:28,050
of the water that they go through. Even
many years ago, I was in Bolivia and,

427
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:31,950
uh, discussing with an aid guy, you know,
Bolivia is very poor. What can they do?

428
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,620
Well, they have the mountains,
but then they have a jug,

429
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:37,560
a sloping down to the Amazon
where they could grow rice. Very,

430
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:40,590
very good agricultural land.
And uh,

431
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,870
and you know,

432
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:47,871
why can't they give that to like Lima
or to La Paz Lima in Peru where the

433
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,770
importing rice.

434
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:54,630
And the problem was that the Chinese can
grow it in the Yangtze valley floated

435
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,160
down the river to Shanghai,

436
00:27:56,161 --> 00:28:01,161
put it on a boat and ship it and deliver
it to Kyle Lima's port cheaper than the

437
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:06,000
Bolivians were right next door to
Peru can truck it over to the Andes,

438
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,330
sorta go up and down and up
again and down again. Sorry.

439
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,370
And they have to ship
it to get to the coast.

440
00:28:11,371 --> 00:28:13,950
They have to ship it over to
peaks of mountains on lousy roads.

441
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,050
And trucking is just very inefficient.

442
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:21,200
So it's cheaper to get the thing from
15,000 miles away up in such one, uh,

443
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:25,140
than to get it next door from
the Amazon slopes of Bolivia.

444
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,800
So shipping costs is very important.
And of course for white collar jobs,

445
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:33,010
telecommunication. Now, you know, we
used to say, oh, well let's let the low,

446
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:37,840
the cheap labor manufacturing jobs go
to China. But now China and India, uh,

447
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:43,050
we're in
immediate contact by telecommunications.

448
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,550
So the white collar jobs are going there,
the engineering is going to India, the,

449
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:51,630
uh, uh, the accounting is going to India,
the call centers have gone to India,

450
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:55,620
other jobs are going,
uh, going to China. So

451
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,420
this,
what happens to population,

452
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:04,560
I think in the longterm view and
longterm means 25 or 50 years,

453
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:05,940
we're not talking a thousand years.

454
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,530
Probably the one most important thing
which will determine the future of the u s

455
00:29:10,531 --> 00:29:13,980
economy is what happens to
population in China and India.

456
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,980
And you could include
Indonesia and the rest of Asia,

457
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:22,550
but as long as they have an incredible
number of people willing to work for

458
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:27,570
incredibly needing to work for incredibly
low wages, we can't compete with them.

459
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,820
There is no economic
reason why an American, uh,

460
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,170
should earn a $40 a day or something.

461
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:38,400
And we got plus benefits and that's a low
wage for an American. Whereas you know,

462
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:43,401
a third of China that per capita income
is about a dollar a day for the lowest

463
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:44,620
third of China.

464
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,720
And that means the worker makes two or
$3 a day and there's no way that we can

465
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:54,630
earn without benefits that we can
earn 40 or $80 depending on what your

466
00:29:54,631 --> 00:29:56,920
calculate and other people
in the world earning three.

467
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,670
So jobs are going to continue to go to
China, not only from the United States,

468
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:04,180
they're leaving Mexico. Uh, I
told you the story in Thailand,

469
00:30:04,181 --> 00:30:07,150
the jewelry business in
Thailand that moved to China,

470
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,410
that there's just this vast,

471
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:13,411
vast sea of people who are desperate
to work for basically $2 a day.

472
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,660
Further thing that happened in the nouns,

473
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,200
a few hundred million people
floating around the cities.

474
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:24,340
Migrant labor is trying to get jobs
and now with the current economic class

475
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:25,840
being thrown out of jobs,

476
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:30,700
but Chinese agriculture is incredibly
inefficient as they told you.

477
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:35,570
The average farm size there
is, is, is one quarter, uh,

478
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:39,430
no 0.1 acre in,
in China.

479
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,130
And that's just
economically unsustainable.

480
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:46,540
The average farm size in the world is
for in Japan, I'm sorry, it's 400 acres,

481
00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:47,620
I think. No, I'm sorry.

482
00:30:47,621 --> 00:30:51,640
In we're at 400 and a u s and economic
us farmers like thousands of acres,

483
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:52,563
a big farm.

484
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,110
So we're talking about that eventually
China is going to have to compete in the

485
00:30:56,111 --> 00:30:59,570
agricultural world on an even
footing with the rest of the,

486
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:03,250
which means their farms are going to
have to combine and that's already

487
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:07,240
happening. People are voluntarily
sort of pooling their land, uh,

488
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,230
having big things,

489
00:31:08,231 --> 00:31:11,650
enough of the land to make it worth
them to buy a tractor and so forth.

490
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,850
So this economic, a rationalization
of agriculture is, is happening.

491
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,010
But think of the numbers there.

492
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:21,720
You have 800 million peasants with uh,

493
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:26,380
with like 1.1 acre each. When you
combine it even to a hundred acre farm,

494
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,660
which is still a small farm worldwide,

495
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,030
that means you combined a thousand
farms into one. In the modern world,

496
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:38,500
a thousand a hundred acres can,
is probably farm by one or two people.

497
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,900
So you go from a thousand
families living on 0.1 acre, each,

498
00:31:43,901 --> 00:31:48,850
two, maybe two families living on a,
on a hundred acres of a combined farm.

499
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:54,090
That means that something like 99% of
the population of the countryside has to

500
00:31:54,281 --> 00:31:59,060
get jobs somewhere else.
So if you have 800 million peasants and I,

501
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,380
you know,

502
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,380
almost 800 million new people are waiting
for these economic changes to come on

503
00:32:04,531 --> 00:32:08,800
to the, the modern job
market. And so there's a,

504
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:13,801
there's a vast number of people waiting
that are now competing with us in every

505
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:20,290
other industrially advanced country
and who will continue to wait with us.

506
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:24,820
Uh, the Chinese government is well
aware of course of all this stuff.

507
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,840
And October last year, uh,
previously I don't, you know,

508
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:31,150
they don't really own their
land and they still don't,

509
00:32:31,151 --> 00:32:35,050
but they did what they call a land reform
and the plan allows farmers for the

510
00:32:35,051 --> 00:32:40,051
first time to lease or transfer
their land use to someone else.

511
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,450
Basically the Chinese are now allowed
to sell their farm, which will ease.

512
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:47,810
Now they have to have very complicated
collective arrangements where everybody

513
00:32:47,811 --> 00:32:48,890
is sort of still there.

514
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,120
But once you can basically sale
or alienate your land in some way,

515
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,830
then you can totally leave the
land and go into the cities.

516
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:02,000
So the government has started
encouraging this kind of push.

517
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,040
What they'll do now with the
economic collapse. I don't know. Uh,

518
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:11,060
but uh,
it's,

519
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,120
we have a long way to go
before the population issue
in China is settled and our

520
00:33:18,201 --> 00:33:22,760
fate and all of the developed
world depends very much
on what happens in China.

521
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:28,130
So just to finish, uh, the
Chinese have, have, you know,

522
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:32,560
the achievement of the Cha of,
of China is just mind boggling that in,

523
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:37,580
in a half a century they took people from
extremely poor country devastated by a

524
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,190
over a hundred years of war.

525
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:44,540
And now it's becoming one of the first
juror rank countries in the world.

526
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:48,350
And before this all started, no one would
have thought this was possible. I mean,

527
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:52,460
if you can read the literature of
that time, China was w was hopeless.

528
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,380
It was tech to fertility,

529
00:33:54,381 --> 00:33:58,580
which you'll see is a very important part
of the whole story of economic success.

530
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,800
Uh, they're, they're, they're declined.

531
00:34:00,801 --> 00:34:04,160
The rapidity of their decline to get a
country like China to drop its fertility

532
00:34:04,161 --> 00:34:08,870
and 10 years is, is just an
amazing, uh, achievement.

533
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,700
Um, the judge, just incredible. Now,

534
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:22,460
now we want to get onto
this, this next question,

535
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:26,770
uh,
of that a student asked last time when I,

536
00:34:26,771 --> 00:34:27,920
when I was saying the Chinese,

537
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:32,690
remember the Chinese started this
population thing for economic reasons.

538
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,880
They said we're are popular,
are our economy is going along.

539
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:41,720
We're increasing, like I
said, agricultural production,
what was it, 2.5% a year,

540
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:45,080
which is very good,
but population is growing 2.3% a year.

541
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:46,340
So we're not helping the people.

542
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:50,250
So it was very overtly stated that the,

543
00:34:50,251 --> 00:34:54,860
the one child policy was
to improve China's economy.

544
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,980
They want to improve the
standard of living of the people.

545
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,310
At the time when they started this policy,

546
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,490
the standard of living
in China was very low as,

547
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:07,940
I don't have to tell you that uh,
health care was, was very, you know,

548
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:12,010
it was certainly better than it had been,
but still a very low level education,

549
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:12,560
uh,

550
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,560
was not widely available below the
very early primary grades in China.

551
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:21,450
So basically as the Chinese perceived
at themselves and as they, they,

552
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,590
they talked about it quite a bit.
Their children are growing up,

553
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,600
unhealthy and uneducated.

554
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,250
And when the Chinese talk
about economic development,

555
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,650
it's not only manufacturing more stuff,

556
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,620
which they basically are not too
interested in. They ship it to America.

557
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,600
They were primarily incident, what
they called the quality of the people.

558
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:43,500
They thought their population was
not of the quality that they wanted.

559
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:46,930
And quality means health and education.
They,

560
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:51,690
they wanted that their children were
growing up, not healthy and not educated.

561
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,190
And they, like everyone in the world
realizes that uneducated, sick children,

562
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:00,420
sick adults don't,
are not very productive.

563
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:05,310
And Western economists for a long time
considered capital as physical capital

564
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,860
and your factories and
machines that you have.

565
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,280
And the idea of human capital is fairly
recent and is now come massively into

566
00:36:13,801 --> 00:36:15,030
vogue in the west.

567
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:18,750
That one of the most
important determinants of the
wealth of a country is one

568
00:36:18,751 --> 00:36:23,040
country rich and one country poor is not
resources is not your physical capital

569
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:25,530
base,
but your human capital base.

570
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,650
So partly we've learned that
from the Chinese, you know,

571
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,180
I mean we learned it ourselves,

572
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:34,200
but also the Chinese example
is a very good example of this.

573
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:40,100
And just to give you an example of what
happens when people don't have education

574
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:45,420
in this particular case, biological
education is a story from again,

575
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:48,720
the year 2000 so from
not that many years back,

576
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:53,910
this is a firm do, who was a
local official in a small village.

577
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,500
He said one day there were hundreds of
people lined up at the entrance of our

578
00:36:58,501 --> 00:36:59,710
village.
Oh,

579
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,600
I thought it must be a vegetable
market or a movie coming in.

580
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,760
It turned out to be blood selling.

581
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,740
I felt so terrified because there was
no sterilization equipment at all.

582
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,860
So this village official
had some education.

583
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:17,940
He understood about sterilization and he
had seen these blood campaigns before.

584
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,180
No sterilization villagers just tell
the traffickers their blood type if they

585
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,830
know it. If not, they make it up.

586
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,820
The village is just tell the traffickers
their blood type and then lie down on

587
00:37:29,821 --> 00:37:31,590
the ground to offer blood.

588
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:37,350
What is the result of this avast aids
epidemic in these rural villages that are

589
00:37:37,351 --> 00:37:41,820
doing this because they used the same
needle to repeatedly take blood from

590
00:37:41,821 --> 00:37:44,730
person after person that he's lying up
on the ground and they stick one needle,

591
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:46,770
take the blood.
Needles are so expensive.

592
00:37:46,771 --> 00:37:48,960
The apparatus for collecting
it as expensive so they,

593
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:53,961
we use the same needle and of course when
you use the same needle from person to

594
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:57,870
person,
the odds are if one person gets it,

595
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:00,900
the next ones are going to get it.

596
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:05,010
But actually the transmission rate by
blood to blood contact by a needle is

597
00:38:05,011 --> 00:38:08,220
something like one in 200
it's not terribly efficient,

598
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,120
but what do they do with the blood?
They collect blood from everybody.

599
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,660
Then instead of keeping it individually,
which is expanded,

600
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:18,780
they dump it in to a big that they
pool it, they take it to the city,

601
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:22,340
they extract the components that they
want, which is the Gamma Globulin,

602
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,540
the clotting factor,
and a few other components.

603
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,150
And then they have a lot of blood left.
And what do they do?

604
00:38:27,151 --> 00:38:29,970
They go back to the village
and reinject the blood,

605
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,380
the remaining blood into the people.
So now you don't just have a needle stick.

606
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:39,010
You've got pint of someone else of a
mixed blood of everyone in the village

607
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,460
going into your, your veins.
And now for sure, if any,

608
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:46,240
anyone in the village has aids,
you're going to be infected with it.

609
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,303
Do Continue.

610
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,780
The villagers become crazy about selling
blood because they are so poor and life

611
00:38:52,781 --> 00:38:57,070
is so hard. Uh, many had built
their houses by selling blood.

612
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:01,750
Someone, even bribe traffickers to
be able to sell more than once a day.

613
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:05,230
The traffickers rooms and giving them
back blood because then they'll make more

614
00:39:05,231 --> 00:39:07,030
blood.
They can sell more blood again.

615
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:11,530
But the people want to sell more
than a pint. Uh, in each day.

616
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:16,380
So they kind of lie and fake
cause their support. Uh,

617
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:23,580
the officials estimate something like
600,000 HIV cases that's probably nowhere

618
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:28,750
near near correct. The Bud
collections, uh, starting in the,

619
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,260
uh, in the 90s, was protected
by corrupt officials.

620
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:34,810
This was of course against public policy,

621
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:38,200
but it may have infected a million people.

622
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:41,710
This blood selling in
Henan province especially,

623
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:46,840
and virtually all of them are poor
peasants who sold the blood to make money.

624
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:51,820
So that gives you an idea
again,

625
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:54,580
of the status of education,

626
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,600
of the population and,
and,

627
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:02,950
and why human capital is so very important
because you're collecting blood cell.

628
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:05,980
The hospitals which will improve the
health was presumably of some people who

629
00:40:05,981 --> 00:40:08,470
receive the blood,
but not if they get aids.

630
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:13,450
And while you're helping a few people who
have transfusions, uh, you're, you're,

631
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:17,650
you're infecting a millions
of people, uh, uh, with eight.

632
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:20,410
So you're making things totally worse.

633
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,800
Okay.
So does cutting your population.

634
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,650
So China had the idea and not alone,

635
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,430
that if they reduced their
population growth rate,

636
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,930
their economy will improve. And, uh,

637
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,240
is this true or not? Is this true? Uh,

638
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:47,140
most economists at the time, uh,
would certainly have said no.

639
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:52,660
Um, the eye that's a mouth through
Z and idea that population,

640
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:57,280
uh, that, that economic
development is limited by, uh, uh,

641
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,750
by population growth.

642
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,230
And people had thought to the industrial
revolution had sort of gotten rid of

643
00:41:02,231 --> 00:41:05,740
them all. First Mothers' was irrelevant
marks as I mentioned last time,

644
00:41:05,741 --> 00:41:08,140
hated morphous Marxism,
totally opposed.

645
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:13,470
And so a lot of the world's opinion
was that no population growth was not

646
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:16,840
detrimental to the economy.
And in fact,

647
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:20,780
they believe that population
growth was good, uh,

648
00:41:20,781 --> 00:41:24,610
for an economy because it increased
market and everybody wants to increase

649
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:26,060
market,
um,

650
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,160
that you can do efficiencies of
scale and all kinds of reasons.

651
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,400
That growing population was considered
to be a wonderful thing. Businessmen,

652
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:39,430
especially in the capitalist economies
love population growth because the

653
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:42,950
population of the United States
runs is now growing at 1% a year,

654
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:46,700
which is less than it had been,
had been one and a half percent or so.

655
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:51,800
And the economic growth rate is about 3%.
So at my, at best and a very good year,

656
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,390
in a good year,
it's 3%.

657
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:58,690
So population growth and population
growth at 1% or one and a half percent,

658
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:02,060
if you're a total economy
is growing at two or 3%,

659
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:06,260
population goes is half the
increase in gross national product.

660
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:10,520
And that means it's half of
company profits. When you
have like General Motors,

661
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:14,450
it was counting every year on population
growing and being able to sell more

662
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:17,300
automobiles.
So that was,

663
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:21,420
that was basically the idea that
the pup, that growth was not, uh,

664
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:25,670
not a bad thing. But in 1958, uh,

665
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,850
to, uh, American, uh,

666
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,980
demographer economist had a different
idea because they looked at the developing

667
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:36,930
countries which had
enormous population, uh, uh,

668
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:40,790
enormous population and very high growth
rates and they weren't doing so well.

669
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,760
So what's with this theory,
they should be doing wonderfully.

670
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:45,770
They should be improving tremendously.

671
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,870
And they came up with a different
understanding of the relationship between

672
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:55,850
population and economics and this
based on some very simple economics,

673
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,990
uh, that economic development
requires investment.

674
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,990
If you want to produce something, you've
got to build a factory that takes money.

675
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:07,190
Where does that money come from? That
comes with someone else? Saving someone,

676
00:43:07,191 --> 00:43:10,940
earns some money, might as Labor
or by whatever earned some money.

677
00:43:10,941 --> 00:43:15,440
He can either spend that right away or
he can put it in a bank and then the bank

678
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:19,190
will invested forum where you can put
it into stocks or something like that.

679
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:24,460
So investment in a country within some
kind of economy investment requires

680
00:43:25,251 --> 00:43:26,084
savings.

681
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:30,890
One person has to save so that
another can spend it as an investment.

682
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:35,090
They borrow that.
And um,

683
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:41,930
so that's the key. That's the key
idea in everything. Uh, that, that,

684
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:46,880
that follows with Coolen Hoover
realized is that if you have,

685
00:43:46,881 --> 00:43:48,560
if a family has a lot of children,

686
00:43:48,561 --> 00:43:51,650
if all the workers are married
and have a lot of children,

687
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:56,930
all of their income goes for food,
clothing, shelter to support the children.

688
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,680
They can't save any money.
If a country has no savings,

689
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:05,600
they don't have any money to invest. They
don't make any, uh, economic progress.

690
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,670
This had a big political effect.
This theory was,

691
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:11,780
and it seems so simple and so obvious,

692
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,890
but it apparently they had good
empirical sport. They studied, uh,

693
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,670
Mexico and then a couple of
other countries and showed
that this really seem to

694
00:44:19,671 --> 00:44:23,690
be, uh, the case. Well, at that time,

695
00:44:23,691 --> 00:44:27,680
the third world was the population
explosion was happening and they were

696
00:44:27,681 --> 00:44:32,520
desperately poor. And so there
were two groups. One, uh,

697
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,430
conservatives were at that time
worried about the cold war.

698
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:40,590
America was locked in the Cold War
with communists. And I know China,

699
00:44:40,591 --> 00:44:44,190
Russia, but especially Russia was,
was our big enemy at the time.

700
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:47,010
And we saw that all these
desperately poor countries,

701
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,890
the governments were not their
current economic and political,

702
00:44:49,891 --> 00:44:51,360
so that we're not giving
them what they want.

703
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:54,810
They were poor and getting poorer as they,
as they perceived it.

704
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,510
And they were trying out all kinds
of different political solutions,

705
00:44:57,511 --> 00:45:00,120
some of which were leftist.
So in America,

706
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:05,360
there was a big push by conservatives
mayther the anticommunist to do something

707
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:10,830
about the third world to save
them from communism. Meanwhile,

708
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:15,720
the liberals were less involved in this
us versus them kind of controversy,

709
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:18,210
but they sold these poor people in the
world and wanting to help all the poor

710
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:21,720
people. So they thought we should do
something about all these poor people.

711
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:23,520
And the answer was economic development,

712
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,170
economic development was universally
approved, uh, in America.

713
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,150
Oh by everyone as either a benevolent
act to by someone who considered

714
00:45:33,151 --> 00:45:37,650
themselves liberal or by a self saving
anticommunist act by someone who

715
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:42,360
considered himself a conservative.
Well, once the cool the,

716
00:45:42,361 --> 00:45:43,194
the,
the,

717
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:48,300
the coal whole Hoover a paper came out
and people started realizing the Abi what

718
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:51,300
was considered to be the
obvious at that time,

719
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:56,480
it was very clear that family planning
programs had to be a part of economic

720
00:45:57,151 --> 00:46:00,540
development. That these countries,
just these booming populations,

721
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:03,870
and there were televisions is full
of stories, especially about India,

722
00:46:03,871 --> 00:46:07,890
how it was starving people in India. China
was kind of close to us at that time,

723
00:46:07,891 --> 00:46:08,724
but India was open.

724
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,750
What a desperate situation that was
in India and India had quite leftist

725
00:46:12,751 --> 00:46:17,470
governments and it was India
going to go communist, et
Cetera, et cetera. So, so, uh,

726
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:21,350
both sides of the American sort of the
whole political spectrum believed in ha

727
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:24,960
economic aid to the developing
world and family planning aid.

728
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,530
And it turns out that George Bush,
the senior,

729
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,430
the first George Bush president when
he was a congressman who was one of the

730
00:46:32,431 --> 00:46:34,860
sponsors of the very first
family planning bill,

731
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:39,170
not only for domestic family planning
but also for international aid, uh,

732
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:42,120
for family planning. There were, there
was, this is not a debatable issue.

733
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:45,750
Everybody agree with it. And it was really
due to this economic thesis by, uh, by,

734
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:48,820
uh,
by colon Hoover and you,

735
00:46:48,821 --> 00:46:53,190
you've read some of Ansley cold
stuff already now, however,

736
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:55,460
the economist keep working
in the scholars keep

737
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:00,140
going and what I'm looking for,

738
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,620
I'm going to get there.
Don't tell me I'm not going to get there.

739
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:12,950
Pardon my Greek.

740
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:27,470
All right, here's what I'm
looking for. Sorry for that. Um,

741
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:33,190
so what they did is they looked across
nationally and tried to figure out,

742
00:47:33,191 --> 00:47:38,050
is it really true that uh,
population growth rate would affect

743
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,720
GDP, the growth of gross
domestic product per capita.

744
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:45,430
It's basically per capita income.

745
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,880
And what did they find when they got
all the countries they could find in the

746
00:47:48,881 --> 00:47:53,410
world? Here's the growth rate and
here's a per capita economic growth.

747
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,400
And what's the pattern?
Zero.

748
00:47:57,430 --> 00:47:59,080
There is no pattern here.

749
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,980
So it looks like that
this was meaningless.

750
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:07,420
That in fact the coal,
the coal Hoover hypothesis was wrong,

751
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,800
however nice the theory seemed,
uh,

752
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,090
you just couldn't get empirical evidence
for it. And that was terribly important.

753
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,310
Uh, again, again, a reversal.

754
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:23,080
Now Reagan administration comes in and
on the basis of information like that

755
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:26,290
says, uh, economic, uh,

756
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:30,850
population control is no benefit to,
to an economy's growth.

757
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,600
And we as conservatives are opposed to
government intervention in the private

758
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:37,540
lives of people.
So we're opposed to,

759
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:40,630
we're not going to give out
the anywhere near the level of,

760
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:44,170
of family planning aid that we
used to in the United States.

761
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:49,171
Went from a big leader in funding family
planning programs in the restaurants

762
00:48:49,421 --> 00:48:51,460
are trying to discourage it.
We didn't drop to zero.

763
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:55,330
There were still some programs that we've
funded and they were very good by aid.

764
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:00,580
Uh, but we were the main discourager in
the world. We didn't like this whole idea.

765
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,340
And what,

766
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:07,270
what came up as an in opposition to this.
Uh,

767
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:11,170
and there was a big world congress about
population and development in Bucharest,

768
00:49:11,171 --> 00:49:13,150
Romania at the time.

769
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:18,600
And the kind of data that came
out in this period is they,

770
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:21,940
um,
sorry,

771
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,410
they came out with the idea that the
way to get that it is good to have

772
00:49:26,411 --> 00:49:30,760
fertility down for a lot of reasons,
but the way to do it that the causality,

773
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:31,390
the cool,

774
00:49:31,390 --> 00:49:35,920
the coal Hoover causality is a reduction
in population growth will lead to

775
00:49:35,921 --> 00:49:39,700
economic development because the
idea of the reverse causality,

776
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:45,010
not an increase in economic development
will lead to a decrease in, uh,

777
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:49,320
in, uh, in fertility. So the, the, the,

778
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:53,020
the slogan that came
out of this, um, this,

779
00:49:53,021 --> 00:49:57,220
this Bucharest meeting of all the world
leaders is that development was the best

780
00:49:57,221 --> 00:50:00,430
contraceptive that if you
wonder lower birth rates,

781
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,220
what you had to focus on was,
uh,

782
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:07,780
was economic development and that
became the map mantra for the world.

783
00:50:07,781 --> 00:50:10,390
And the developing countries
have bought into that.

784
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,350
And it was very in sync as
just at that time, Romania,

785
00:50:14,351 --> 00:50:16,330
the host of this thing was having the big,

786
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:21,070
the most extreme family planning program
ever, but in the opposite direction.

787
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:23,920
They,
at that time there,

788
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:27,220
it was a Soviet bloc country that
was doing poorly economically.

789
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,670
Their birth rate was very low.

790
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,330
Their mechanism of birth
control was abortion.

791
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:37,000
Four out of five pregnancies
were terminated by abortions in,

792
00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:41,960
in Romania. For every one
childbirth there was four abortions,

793
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:45,980
Romania for not, not tracking, I'm
going to put for nationalist reasons.

794
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:50,060
They wanted a bigger, stronger Romania.
So they clamp down tremendously.

795
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:54,170
They abortion, clearly de legalized,
you couldn't get contraceptives anymore.

796
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,810
And the end result was that,
uh,

797
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,680
the birth rate temporarily fell,

798
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:05,950
but then the women establish networks
of illegal abortion and gradually,

799
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:10,460
uh, the birth rate rose, the birthrate
rose because they didn't have any,

800
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,420
any means, but it's, but very
rapidly, within a year or
two, they established, uh,

801
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,230
illegal abortion networks and the birth
rate came down and it never came down to

802
00:51:18,231 --> 00:51:19,130
its original level.

803
00:51:19,131 --> 00:51:22,910
And there's actually a fairly
big total effect of their policy.

804
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,120
But it was just the, the political, uh,

805
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,190
chicanery going on that,
that here Ceausescu who's running,

806
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,450
running Romania as a very strong communist
dictator who is doing a very strong

807
00:51:35,451 --> 00:51:39,590
pro natalist family pop
policy. And but saying, no, uh,

808
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:44,300
the opposite won't work. You have to go
through economic development. Okay. So,

809
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:49,520
uh, but then the con then people went to
work on that theory and here's the data

810
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:52,010
that in this period of time,

811
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:57,250
these are the countries with slow economic
growth and their population growth

812
00:51:57,261 --> 00:51:59,240
rate was about 2.6%.

813
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,240
And here's the ones with fast economic
growth rate and they're popular affect

814
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:08,210
Ferret, fast economic growth. And they're
the same in terms of population growth.

815
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,870
Here's you look some years later
and you have the same story.

816
00:52:11,871 --> 00:52:15,800
Those were slow economic growth. Those
with fast economic growth have the same,

817
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,420
uh,
population growth.

818
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:21,760
So it is not true that
development itself acts as,

819
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:25,100
as a contraceptive.
Uh, but you look at it,

820
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:28,610
you spin the data at the
same data but a differently,

821
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,750
you look at those countries which
have slow population growth,

822
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,860
which are uh,
he's,

823
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:38,870
and while it wasn't an or fast
population growth with an UC,

824
00:52:38,871 --> 00:52:40,610
does that affecting GDP?

825
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,690
And you're not seeing a big
effect here in this time frame,

826
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,190
but you are seeing a big time
effect in this timeframe.

827
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:54,200
Now something different is going on
that here, those countries is slow.

828
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:56,270
Population growth are
increasing economically.

829
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,140
Those countries fast population
growth are decreasing economically.

830
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:03,020
And the funny thing about this graph,
she said, what's the same data?

831
00:53:03,021 --> 00:53:06,440
How can you come to opposite conclusions
but it's not the same day to spun

832
00:53:06,441 --> 00:53:10,970
differently. This is the
population growth rate in 65 to 80.

833
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:16,460
And then the economic
situation, uh, 25 years later,

834
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:21,420
15 to 25 years later.
So something it looks like from this is,

835
00:53:21,421 --> 00:53:21,831
is,

836
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:26,831
is not wildly conclusive data that
something about a population growth much

837
00:53:27,361 --> 00:53:31,320
later has an effect on
your economic growth.

838
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:36,750
And that's what has now been
figured out to be exactly the, the,

839
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:41,280
the really important relationship
between population growth and economic

840
00:53:41,281 --> 00:53:44,550
development. So you've seen
this graph many, many times.

841
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:48,720
This is a standard demographic
transition where the mortality rate,

842
00:53:48,721 --> 00:53:52,050
the death rate falls first,
then after some delay,

843
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:57,260
the birth rate falls and your population
growth rate is this period when the

844
00:53:58,321 --> 00:54:02,790
birth rate is way above the death rate.
Another aspect of that,

845
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:07,791
here's the same graph again appear
is that if you ask what does the,

846
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,160
the share working look like,
how many of these people working?

847
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:14,760
You'd have an idea called
the dependency ratio,

848
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:20,150
which is your number of workers divided
by your number of children and your

849
00:54:20,911 --> 00:54:25,260
number of old folks. Well, in developing
countries the medical care is bad,

850
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:29,700
so you don't have, you can almost
ignore the old folks for, for,

851
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:30,780
for quite a period of time.

852
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:35,600
So basically the workers divided by the
number of children. And what happens, uh,

853
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,820
during this period is that,
uh,

854
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:44,310
as, uh, the, the,

855
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,080
the fertility rate falls,

856
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:50,730
what happens is you have a population,
we,

857
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:54,450
we've seen the population pyramid for
that with a number of workers in the

858
00:54:54,451 --> 00:54:57,150
middle and then many more children
than workers made a, you know,

859
00:54:57,151 --> 00:55:01,530
half again as many children as workers.
So each worker has to support like, uh,

860
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:05,900
each person in working age has to support
one and a half for two children of

861
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:06,873
children's age.

862
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:12,020
But then you get this fantastic fertility
drop as we saw in places like China,

863
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:17,430
where in in 10 years the fertility
comes down. And what happened,

864
00:55:17,431 --> 00:55:18,990
this is your ball,
this is,

865
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:23,490
this is the big population of people sort
of age and there's no children coming

866
00:55:23,491 --> 00:55:27,330
behind them, right? So kids are born,

867
00:55:27,331 --> 00:55:29,850
you have a very high population,
kids are born,

868
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:34,780
then all of a sudden the population stops
having children basically, you know,

869
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:38,880
drops tremendously. But you still have
all the children born. It takes 15,

870
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:41,610
20 years for them to get into working age.

871
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,570
So once you drop your fertility,

872
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:49,020
you see no effect then because you still
have to support all those children for

873
00:55:49,021 --> 00:55:51,240
the next 15,
20 years.

874
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:56,070
It's only after delay of 15 to 20 years
that you have this huge number of people

875
00:55:56,071 --> 00:55:59,040
in working ages,
very few children behind them.

876
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:04,250
And the ratio of workers to
dependence becomes very good.

877
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:07,320
This is the people inside
this and the snake,

878
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:10,050
that's a takeoff on another.

879
00:56:10,051 --> 00:56:13,080
You are here graph that I showed you
the population explosion. Anyway,

880
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:17,130
forget that. So here is,
you've seen this for China,

881
00:56:17,131 --> 00:56:19,560
but here's for all of East Asia,
this be,

882
00:56:19,590 --> 00:56:24,590
this is the death rate and the death rate
is really basically down by 1970 I've

883
00:56:24,911 --> 00:56:28,850
showed you that for Egypt and all around
the world that the mortality rate, uh,

884
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:33,760
comes down fast and then it doesn't make
an awful lot of progress since then.

885
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:37,330
This is people aging.
So this is where we are now about 29.

886
00:56:37,331 --> 00:56:39,850
So this stuff is all
guessing about the future.

887
00:56:39,851 --> 00:56:44,170
But basically since 1970 the death
rate has been pretty constant.

888
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:48,220
But the birth rate comes down.
This big drop in the 70s. Again,

889
00:56:48,221 --> 00:56:49,270
this is all of East Asia,

890
00:56:49,271 --> 00:56:53,020
but primarily what you're seeing is
China's big drop in the death rate.

891
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,670
And so population growth narrows,
narrows, narrows down to almost nothing.

892
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,880
And presumably in the
near future, uh, the,

893
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,820
the death rate will climb
above of the birth rate.

894
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:07,150
So in looking at age structure,

895
00:57:07,151 --> 00:57:09,250
this is a kind of a complicated
graph of they're very cute.

896
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:13,780
So this is sub Saharan Africa
as as a comparison, this
is the opposite situation.

897
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:16,150
So here this is like a piece of a pyramid.

898
00:57:16,151 --> 00:57:20,890
This is your age group here you
have very few old people here.

899
00:57:20,891 --> 00:57:24,340
You have in 1950,
this stripe is for the year 1950,

900
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:28,840
very few oldsters. This is your
working age population in here,

901
00:57:28,841 --> 00:57:32,440
say from 20 to 60 or whatever
numbers you want to put.

902
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,770
And there's more children in
any age group than any of them.

903
00:57:35,771 --> 00:57:37,900
You've seen the population per like that.

904
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:40,960
Now as time goes on in a
place like sub Saharan Africa,

905
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:45,961
that does not go through fertility
transition is that this shape have more

906
00:57:46,991 --> 00:57:50,320
children than also just continues.
1975,

907
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:54,430
2000 2025, he began to
see they, they hope again,

908
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:58,120
this is where we're, we're at now.
This is all guessing about the future.

909
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:02,520
So up to now that shape have
more children. Oh No, no,

910
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:07,570
not doing it to me again. That shape
have more children. Uh, down here,

911
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,930
change stays unchanged. You're just
the whole population. It gets bigger.

912
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:12,153
It seemed that.

913
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:16,540
Now contrast that to
know it's working again,

914
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,430
contrast that to East Asia,

915
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:24,060
which in 1950 had what looks
like sub Saharan Africa has,

916
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,550
you know, many more children than
people in working ages. And again,

917
00:58:27,551 --> 00:58:31,450
very few real old folk.
And then time goes on.

918
00:58:31,451 --> 00:58:35,650
But then you start seeing
funny things happen where, Oh,

919
00:58:35,890 --> 00:58:39,790
come on. Anyway, up
there, follow the, the,

920
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,730
so anywhere between 1975 and 2002,

921
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:47,230
the left and you see now the number of
children's starts dipping and up at the

922
00:58:47,231 --> 00:58:51,280
top it dips a lot. And the bulge of, of,

923
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,970
of children becomes a
bulge in the working ages.

924
00:58:55,450 --> 00:59:00,160
So when they have a lot of
people in working agents,
very few, uh, uh, children,

925
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:02,050
no oldsters yet.

926
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:05,620
So the word you don't have
anybody that you have to support.

927
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:11,890
And what happens is you
calculate this dependency ratio.

928
00:59:11,891 --> 00:59:15,760
This is the number of working
age people to non working age.

929
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:20,610
And look what happens in each
east Asia. Uh, here's, here's the,

930
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,060
the, the, the, the, the,

931
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:27,200
the fertility decline is as soon as 10
years have passed, boom, boom, boom, boom.

932
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:31,250
The ratio gets to be wonderful.
And again, we're at this level,

933
00:59:31,251 --> 00:59:32,810
we're somewhere near the peak.

934
00:59:32,811 --> 00:59:36,110
This rest of this is guesswork
off to the right of that line.

935
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:40,730
So the dependency ratio just gets
better and better for East Asia.

936
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:42,320
And this has tremendous,

937
00:59:42,321 --> 00:59:46,610
this is what has tremendous
economic consequences here is,

938
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:51,640
is the difference in the economic
growth per per year over.

939
00:59:51,711 --> 00:59:55,130
Now this is a 35 year timespan suite.
We're not looking at,

940
00:59:55,131 --> 00:59:58,670
a single year is tremendously
bigger than a place like Africa,

941
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:01,700
which has not reduced its fertility.

942
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:06,560
And we say this is based a lot
on savings and this you'll,

943
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:07,640
you'll have a reading about this,

944
01:00:07,641 --> 01:00:12,230
which you won't like cause it's
somewhat complicated economics. But uh,

945
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:15,050
look at the savings rate in East Asia.

946
01:00:15,051 --> 01:00:18,980
It goes from 1955 before
way before any of this,

947
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,560
14% to 35%.

948
01:00:21,561 --> 01:00:26,060
It goes up like a factor of two and
a half or three tremendous saving and

949
01:00:26,061 --> 01:00:30,510
investment. Then since you're
saving, you can have a,

950
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:34,730
an incredible increase in investment
which builds up your country economically.

951
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:37,760
Now the catch and this,
that savings equals investment,

952
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:40,070
you can also borrow money from abroad.

953
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,950
And so that's what they call
the current account balance.

954
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:47,870
How much money you can attract
from broad to to get developed.

955
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:53,230
And we in the West believe that it was
western capital that went into China,

956
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:57,830
loud them to build up and did wonderful
things. But no, it was never huge.

957
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:59,760
This is a 4.8,
uh,

958
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:04,730
less than 5% was the current.
Again, that's, that's a
minus sign in front of it.

959
01:01:04,731 --> 01:01:08,870
That's what they're importing.
But very rapidly. By 1980,

960
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:09,860
uh,

961
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:14,860
they start to be a net capital exporter
that these poor countries have an excess

962
01:01:14,901 --> 01:01:17,390
of capital and they now export. Uh, so,

963
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:22,540
so the development of China in particular
East Asia in general is not as you

964
01:01:23,211 --> 01:01:26,780
would think, a result of west
infusion of western capital. I mean,

965
01:01:26,781 --> 01:01:30,530
some of the early special cases,
Hong Kong and so forth clearly were,

966
01:01:30,531 --> 01:01:31,850
but the main part of China,

967
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:36,430
they produce their own
capital because they're the,

968
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:41,360
the sequence of causality is fertility
decline. You wait 15, 20 years,

969
01:01:41,361 --> 01:01:44,420
all those kids grow up, there's not
behind them. They all become workers.

970
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,430
You start,
you don't have children to support.

971
01:01:46,431 --> 01:01:50,510
You start saving those savings become
investment and you become one of the

972
01:01:50,511 --> 01:01:53,390
economic miracles are one
of the Tigers of the world

973
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:57,590
now.
Until recently,

974
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:00,020
this theory is about 10 or 15 years.

975
01:02:00,021 --> 01:02:04,850
We've gradually becoming to understand
this idea about the economics and it was

976
01:02:04,851 --> 01:02:08,090
thought to have something special about
Asia that yes, this was important,

977
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:13,280
but also the culture of Asia,
the, their, their propensity
to saving. Oh, let me see.

978
01:02:13,281 --> 01:02:17,770
Go back up here. If I can
find that saving number. Um,

979
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:23,040
well the savings were it when China was
poured the savings, we're not fabulous.

980
01:02:23,460 --> 01:02:27,950
They are fabulous now, but they weren't
then that's a result of being rich. Um,

981
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:32,850
so we thought there's something special
about East Asia and China in particular.

982
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:34,290
It's something cultural,

983
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:39,570
something cultural and that
when you did the econometrics,

984
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,900
you had to say you have to have one set
of prime. You can use the same model.

985
01:02:42,901 --> 01:02:45,390
We have one set of parameters for,
for uh,

986
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:48,990
Asia and a completely different set
for Africa and another set for Europe.

987
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:52,680
When you don't consider the
demographic a situation,

988
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,470
once you put in the demographic situation,

989
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:58,110
we now know that the same
model fits around the world.

990
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:01,710
And it looks like that this
dependency burden is the key thing.

991
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,970
And one of the things that first clued
us into this was Ireland. So Ireland,

992
01:03:05,971 --> 01:03:10,330
which is totally different culture
than in China had this, you know,

993
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:14,310
totally Catholic and they really
believed it. They used Catholicism as,

994
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:18,350
as fighting as a mode of fighting the
British. And so at a very high birth rate,

995
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:23,720
and they didn't have legal contraception
in 1980 the government legalize

996
01:03:23,911 --> 01:03:26,520
contraception,
here's the birth rate,

997
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:31,170
just takes the drive and then after a
little blip continues downward. So again,

998
01:03:31,171 --> 01:03:35,280
it's a government action of legalizing
contraception and the Irish birth rate

999
01:03:35,281 --> 01:03:35,970
drops.

1000
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:39,240
The death rate again is slowly going
down and then sort of not really going

1001
01:03:39,241 --> 01:03:40,710
anywhere in this period.

1002
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:44,340
And so the population
growth rate decreases.

1003
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:48,150
And again, this is the same
thing. You get the same effect.

1004
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,450
The Irelands population looks
like China's smaller scale.

1005
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:53,100
It's not anywhere near as big,
but again,

1006
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,590
you have an underdeveloped
country looking thing.

1007
01:03:55,591 --> 01:03:58,770
It was a lot more children than
middle than workers are old people.

1008
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:03,760
And then this continues going up until
you start getting this declining.

1009
01:04:03,761 --> 01:04:06,750
Now in this modern period,
currently,

1010
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,830
there's a lot more workers in there
are either children or old people.

1011
01:04:10,831 --> 01:04:12,750
So the dependency burden looks real good.

1012
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:16,490
This is the graph of that. The, the,

1013
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:20,790
the purple curve on the bottom is
sub Saharan Africa, which again,

1014
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:24,090
just consider what's up to the line
because everything else is guesswork.

1015
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:29,040
And look here. Uh, the black is
east Asia and the green is Ireland.

1016
01:04:29,270 --> 01:04:34,160
Looks very, very similar. And
guess what the result is? Uh,

1017
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:38,370
here's where they legalized birth control.
Boom,

1018
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:44,010
the economic growth rate just Boone's
write up 10 or so years later.

1019
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:50,070
And now comparing,
starting to compare this to India,

1020
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:53,220
here is uh,
um,

1021
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:57,300
China's growth per capita.
It started in 1960.

1022
01:04:57,301 --> 01:05:01,170
China was poorer than India by a good bit.
This is per capita income.

1023
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:06,150
The red is trying to, blue is India,
1960, they're poor in 1970, they per 1980,

1024
01:05:06,151 --> 01:05:09,040
there poor once she shower, the, the,

1025
01:05:09,041 --> 01:05:12,240
the later longer few of
the fertility drop is in,

1026
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:17,780
is in this period and it starts going
and then China takes off and exceeds,

1027
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:18,910
uh,

1028
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:22,500
India and is not due to the communist
government or a good government and cause

1029
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:27,130
the, the, the, the kindness revolution
is, is way out here. And, and you know,

1030
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,740
for a long time it was not
doing any better than India.

1031
01:05:30,070 --> 01:05:34,240
But the main event that happened
then is the drop in fertility.

1032
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:38,830
And this shows you the difference in
China's fertility and India's fertility

1033
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:44,130
that hears this Chinese drop starting
in 1970s and India slowly catching up,

1034
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:50,720
but it's taking its time
about it. And this is the, uh,

1035
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:55,540
the dependency burden here again,
the ratio of workers,

1036
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:59,680
uh, to, to non-workers very,
really improving in China,

1037
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:03,160
not going anywhere particular in India.

1038
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:07,900
And when you compare it to
sub Saharan Africa again,

1039
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:12,000
so we're comparing different parts of
the world to show you the story just is

1040
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:15,940
the same. This is the birth rate,
the black and the and the death rate.

1041
01:06:15,941 --> 01:06:19,930
So a huge and continuing
population growth rate. Again,

1042
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:24,300
up to the line. This is
guesswork out here. Uh,

1043
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:27,820
and here is again,
you seen this before.

1044
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:30,700
This is China's uh, east, I'm sorry,

1045
01:06:30,701 --> 01:06:35,170
East Asia's a dependency ratio.
Workers to children.

1046
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:40,470
This is Africa's a huge difference
going on and they live in,

1047
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:46,300
this is a situation.
So in sub Saharan Africa,

1048
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:49,870
the working age population
has gone up 2.6%.

1049
01:06:50,050 --> 01:06:52,600
And even if you can keep
all those people employed,

1050
01:06:52,870 --> 01:06:56,830
when the dependent population goes
up 2.7%, you're not making any,

1051
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:01,270
any progress where it's an East Asia,
still a significant dependent population.

1052
01:07:01,271 --> 01:07:03,280
They haven't stopped
having children altogether,

1053
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:08,170
but the working age population is growing
half again as fast as the dependent

1054
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:09,004
population.

1055
01:07:09,070 --> 01:07:13,780
That difference is what one makes you
rich and to makes you be rich enough to

1056
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:17,440
save and invest and develop your country.

1057
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,130
And you've gotten seen,
seen this graph,

1058
01:07:21,131 --> 01:07:25,810
the difference between East
Asia and Africa. All right. Um,

1059
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:30,010
that, uh, is the main

1060
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:36,100
idea that I wanted to get me. I have
to, by the way, on your schedule.

1061
01:07:36,101 --> 01:07:38,830
This lecture was supposed to be given
by David Bloom who's a professor at

1062
01:07:38,831 --> 01:07:41,080
Harvard and one of the guys
who did a lot of this work, uh,

1063
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:44,410
he wasn't able to come.
So I use this.

1064
01:07:44,411 --> 01:07:47,290
He came in the last time I gave this
class and I use a lot of the slides or are

1065
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:50,290
David blooms slides and uh,

1066
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:53,200
he's responsible for a fair chunk of,

1067
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:58,930
of this work. So, um,

1068
01:07:59,530 --> 01:08:04,270
all right.
So the end of this story is that,

1069
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,750
again,
we talked about when I,

1070
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:10,570
long time ago when I described
Algeria has how hard, how,

1071
01:08:10,810 --> 01:08:13,750
how much Algeria has gotten
their fertility down,

1072
01:08:13,751 --> 01:08:17,840
but their population is still and they
haven't been able to take advantage of

1073
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:19,490
reduction in fertility.

1074
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:24,970
The same thing happens with these
dependency burden issues because you first

1075
01:08:25,221 --> 01:08:27,380
have a lot more children than workers.

1076
01:08:27,620 --> 01:08:31,610
Then you stop having children and that
bulge grows and you get a lot more

1077
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:33,920
workers than children.

1078
01:08:34,070 --> 01:08:38,720
But then those workers start to age as
the population decreases labels out.

1079
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:43,730
So now you have the reverse situation
of a small number of workers in a large

1080
01:08:43,731 --> 01:08:46,130
number of old people
always independence burned.

1081
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:51,140
You should add children
and old people. Uh, and as,

1082
01:08:51,141 --> 01:08:54,170
as your, as your fertility goes down,
your number of children goes down,

1083
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:57,620
your number of oldsters goes up.
So it's not as bad.

1084
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:01,520
It's not as extreme a change as possible.
But this would seem to incall call.

1085
01:09:01,521 --> 01:09:03,260
This is called the,
uh,

1086
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:08,780
the demographic dividend
or the demographic bonus.
Uh, this, this phenomenon.

1087
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,130
But it's a terminate.
There's a,

1088
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:15,140
there's a time period when you can make
great economic progress and then your

1089
01:09:15,831 --> 01:09:19,670
people get old. And a lot of people leave.
Japan is in that situation right now.

1090
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:24,320
There they have a very low birth rate
and the number of old people is rising.

1091
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:26,570
And whereas in the past,

1092
01:09:26,571 --> 01:09:29,420
old people cost almost nothing
because just a little bit of food,

1093
01:09:29,421 --> 01:09:32,600
they didn't eat much.
But now with medical costs,

1094
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:37,610
old people require lots of money.
And in the past children were expensive.

1095
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:41,630
Old people were cheap. Now it's
reversed. The things that children use,

1096
01:09:41,631 --> 01:09:45,620
clothing comes from China's very cheap
food is comparatively cheap around the

1097
01:09:45,621 --> 01:09:50,140
world. I mean, forget the last
half year or something. Uh, so, uh,

1098
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:54,380
so children used to be cheap
children. Uh, used to be expensive.

1099
01:09:54,381 --> 01:09:57,830
They're now getting cheaper. Oh,
people are getting very expensive.

1100
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:02,980
So now the worry is that any country that
goes through a slow demographic change

1101
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:09,020
and doesn't arrange its economics and
its politics to employ the people,

1102
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:12,110
cause it doesn't do you any good.
If you have a whole lot of workers,

1103
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:16,100
if they don't have any jobs,
and like Latin America for instance,

1104
01:10:16,101 --> 01:10:20,930
which is kind of an in between situation
was very protectionist or nationalist.

1105
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:24,500
And uh, I, I can tell you
a story, but you know,

1106
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:28,310
Bolivia nextdoor to Peru hadn't had so
much conflict with Peru that they didn't

1107
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:32,270
want to form a carbon market with Peru
and they'd rather buy plastic buckets

1108
01:10:32,271 --> 01:10:37,271
from Brooklyn and rice from China than
they would to trade with their next door

1109
01:10:37,281 --> 01:10:40,380
neighbor.
So the story is that the,

1110
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:45,420
the demographic situation seems to be
one of the major initiators of these

1111
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:48,410
economic miracles that have
been happening around the world,

1112
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:50,180
but they can't do it by themselves.

1113
01:10:50,181 --> 01:10:55,181
There has to be the economic and political
substructure to employ these people

1114
01:10:55,521 --> 01:10:59,330
to get, set them to work. And then a
country gets rich and when it gets,

1115
01:10:59,331 --> 01:11:02,570
once it gets rich, it gets the
capital that it can keep it going,

1116
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:05,300
but you not have enough money
to invest and keep going.

1117
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:07,610
Even though you may have to
spend a lot on your old folks,

1118
01:11:07,611 --> 01:11:11,600
you may be rich enough to generate
the excess wealth to do that.

1119
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:16,680
Okay, so next time we'll talk about, uh,

1120
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,180
economics. Then the family.
This has been macroeconomics,

1121
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:23,450
how economics works on our
whole region wide thing,

1122
01:11:23,451 --> 01:11:25,250
but what its effect is on a family.
