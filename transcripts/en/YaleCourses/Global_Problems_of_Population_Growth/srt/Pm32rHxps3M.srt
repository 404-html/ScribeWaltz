1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,360
So we're coming to the end of the course
and,

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,500
and uh,
the last couple of lectures,

3
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:12,030
last few social issues,

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,440
and then we'll have a very short time
for environment unfortunately. Um,

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,500
so today we're going to
talk about abortion and it's
kind of a unique topic in

6
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:26,830
the sense that in the United
States it's, it's uh, it's, it's,

7
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,600
if you have a global perspective
in most of the world,

8
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:34,410
abortion is not a big controversial
issue in the United States.

9
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:39,411
It's just going sky high as kind of the
central issue in the American debate on

10
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:44,070
values has tremendous
political significance.

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,730
Large numbers of people
vote for a candidate for say
president based solely on

12
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:53,550
whether they,
they approached choice or pro life.

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,950
So one of the things you got
to figure out or try to is,

14
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:02,370
is why has this become
so important an issue.

15
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,820
And I think one of the reasons is that
it encapsulates a diametrically opposed

16
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:10,650
views of our roles in everyday life.

17
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,670
If people perceive it as
an everyday kind of issue.

18
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,430
And what are the roles that I'm
talking about? Sex Roles, work roles,

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,660
husband and wife roles, motherhood
and fatherhood roles. All of those,

20
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:29,850
how you perceive yourself in those
roles will very much determine how you,

21
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,120
how you feel about the abortion debate.

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,390
So for instance, both sides in the debate
agreed that the issue is about murder.

23
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,790
Uh, a pro lifer sees images
of the three month old fetus,

24
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,560
which even though only about the size of
your finger and they see they're having

25
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:54,420
visuals of blown up photographs and
every year I'm sure you've all seen those

26
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:57,810
things and it already looks
quite baby like and thinks of it,

27
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:01,950
of being dismembered and murdered
approach.

28
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:04,560
Choicer also sees it about murder,

29
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:09,150
but she in her mind is a young
woman, maybe herself, uh,

30
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,380
in a back alley abortion being
butchered and possibly murdered.

31
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,930
And almost every one of
the older generation of,

32
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,660
of pro choice women has either themselves
had an abortion or have ha or has had

33
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:29,661
a friend who's had an abortion and they
perceived it as life saving or if it was

34
00:02:29,911 --> 00:02:34,770
a back alley unsuccessful one
as life depriving situation.

35
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,980
Both sides agree that the issue
is about babies and motherhood.

36
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,910
Prolife mother thinks that babies are
so precious that whenever they come they

37
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:52,050
will be loved and wanted. There is no
such thing as an unloved or unwanted baby.

38
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:57,840
A pro choice mother thinks the babies
are so precious that they should only be

39
00:02:57,841 --> 00:03:02,841
had when the woman really wants the baby
and it's a situation in life where they

40
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,740
have the resources to kick,
take care of the baby.

41
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,450
Both sides agree that
the issues about sex, uh,

42
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,610
prolife woman thinks that sexist,

43
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,640
so special that it should be guarded by
strong religious and social controls so

44
00:03:17,651 --> 00:03:20,260
that it always has an
almost sacred character.

45
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,660
The pro choice woman thinks sex is so
special that it should be freed of worry

46
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:29,680
about pregnancy and disease so that it
can be enjoyed as a unique sharing of

47
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:30,514
intimacy.

48
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,080
Both sides agree that the issues about
the status of women prolife women think

49
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:41,170
that women are so important that they're
special life role of motherhood must be

50
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:43,390
protected.
Pro Choice.

51
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:47,200
Women think that women are so important
that they should have every bit as much

52
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:50,680
control over their lives.
Over their life roles as men have.

53
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:55,750
So just viewed in that way.
The,

54
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:56,531
the,

55
00:03:56,531 --> 00:04:00,670
one of the interesting things about this
abortion debate is that the two sides,

56
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:04,330
and if you really get down to what the
fundamental values of the two sides are,

57
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,780
they don't, they're not different.
They apply them differently.

58
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:12,250
They were thinking of different instances
of different real situations in which

59
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:16,510
to apply these rather same kind
of fundamental human values.

60
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,761
All right,

61
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:22,780
well obviously this is not a philosophy
course and not in the slightest set up

62
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:24,760
to debate the pros and cons of abortion.

63
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,230
And that's also a kind of
sterile debate. Uh, anybody,

64
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,110
has anybody changed their mind about
abortion since they were the hydro

65
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,600
grasshopper in the class and when
know which direction you were,

66
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,370
one has changed her mind. Okay.
Two has changed in a, that's a,

67
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,420
that's high ratio.

68
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,860
Does anybody know anybody who's changed
their minds except for yourself?

69
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:52,240
Of course. One or two more
people, two or three, another one.

70
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,730
So, depending, I mean,

71
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:59,731
there's so much about abortion out there
and yet people's attitude toward it is

72
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,670
said very early in life by again,

73
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:07,960
these very fundamental images of what
we're talking about when we talk about

74
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:10,870
abortion.
And no matter how it's argued,

75
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,550
people basically don't
change their opinions. So,

76
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,660
uh, so I'm not going to debate
pros and cons, uh, at all.

77
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,100
I'm going to give you as
many facts about abortion as,

78
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:27,920
as I can explain to you the demography
in the biology, in the statistics and,

79
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,250
and all of that kind of stuff.

80
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,820
So there's a number of important things
that you should know about abortion.

81
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,190
And the first of it that it
induced abortion is common.

82
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:43,300
It's a very frequent
situation in the world.

83
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:48,550
There's one abortion for every
3.2 live births. So a very odd,

84
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,930
that's, that's one, two,
three, uh, each year,

85
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,600
about 3% of women in childbearing ages,
uh,

86
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,160
have an abortion.

87
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,580
And if you consider a 30 year reproductive
lifespan with each woman having a 3%

88
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,440
chance each year,
that's 90%.

89
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,100
That means that in the world,
uh,

90
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,180
the average woman has a 0.9
chance very close to one.

91
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:18,590
Basically for every woman in the
world, uh, there's one abortion,

92
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,910
uh, in, in, in the her
reproductive lifetime.

93
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:29,030
Of course, this is an average. Some women
have many more and some women have none.

94
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,240
There are three,

95
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:37,540
actually three or four standard ways of
measuring and expressing the frequency

96
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:39,820
of abortion.
Uh,

97
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,900
one is simply the number of abortions in
the world or in the country or whatever

98
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,440
you want. And the latest estimate, all of,

99
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,620
of the latest these lay Desmond come
from 2003 about every five years,

100
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,700
uh, people trying to tally up, uh,

101
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,570
abortion statistics from around the world.

102
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,640
And it's a very difficult job
because, uh, wherever it's illegal,

103
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,490
you're very great.
Difficulty getting statistics.

104
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:11,330
In many places they were,

105
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,160
especially with this religious
opposition to abortion, they, uh,

106
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:19,340
the statistics included
as menstrual regulation.

107
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,340
That means a woman has missed her MNCs.

108
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,610
And of course everyone knows
that's not a good thing.

109
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,420
So you have to restore the MNCs and
you do exactly what's in the abortion.

110
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,930
And everybody in the country
will understand what's going on.

111
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,300
But the statistic is menstrual regulation.

112
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,560
So depending on what's happening in
the country, usually have to add,

113
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,820
one part of the government says is
about minster regulation to another part

114
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:45,800
which says abortion.
Anyway,

115
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,360
there's lots of problems in in
collecting these numbers, but uh,

116
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:55,580
they're probably fairly decent cause they
very sophistic demographically very of

117
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,290
sophisticated people are the ones
that try to make these best estimates.

118
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,860
So the number of abortions in the world
is now considered to be 42 million per

119
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:10,010
year and the number has
stayed in that range.

120
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:14,420
The 40 to 50 million range for at least
the last two decades when there's fairly

121
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:17,930
good collection of this statistics.
So that's the number.

122
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,420
The abortion rate is defined as the
abortion spur a thousand women in

123
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:24,410
reproductive ages,

124
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:29,411
which is usually taken us 15 to
44 or 15 to 49 for the world.

125
00:08:29,481 --> 00:08:33,590
It's 29 per thousand.
So every year per thousand women,

126
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,170
29 have had an abortion.

127
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:41,150
That's the 3% that I mentioned earlier.
If it was 30 it will be exactly 3%

128
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,400
both the highest rate and the
lowest rates are found in Europe.

129
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,620
Western Europe has 12 abortions
per thousand women per year.

130
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:57,280
Eastern Europe has four times as
many 44 per thousand women per year,

131
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,850
so it's interesting that the
whole world within Europe,

132
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:07,200
which we sometimes consider a cultural
entity, it isn't with respect to abortion,

133
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,110
the highest and lowest
numbers are found in Europe.

134
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,220
Another way of expressing
it as the abortion ratio,

135
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,010
which is the abortions
per hundred live births,

136
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,370
and that's what I told you before,

137
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:24,300
one abortion for every 3.2
live births in the world,

138
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,540
that comes out to 31 per 100 and this
ranges from a 12 and middle Africa.

139
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,510
It's, it's a, it's a low rate
to 105 in eastern Europe. Again,

140
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,800
Eastern Europe has the
highest in the world, no debt,

141
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,560
105 we're talking about
abortions per Leiper's.

142
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,330
When you have 105 abortions
per hundred live births,

143
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,270
there are more abortions than live births,

144
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,110
so a at a hundred a
hundred half of pregnancies

145
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,620
are terminated with an abortion.

146
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,810
Interestingly, the abortion
rate is the same, is very,

147
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:06,690
very closely the same
independent of whether you're
in a developing country or a

148
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:07,680
developed country.

149
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,140
The rate and developed countries is 26
per thousand and in developing countries

150
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:17,520
is 29 per thousand. Not A,
not a huge difference. Uh,

151
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,181
China,

152
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:23,181
which everyone worries about the forced
abortions there has about 20% of the

153
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:27,780
world's population and has about
20% of the world's abortions.

154
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,151
Another,

155
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:34,350
the last number that I'll tell you about
the people calculate is what's called

156
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:35,520
the total abortion rate,

157
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,330
which is calculated exactly in the
same way as the total fertility rate,

158
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,260
but you take the age specific
abortion rate and add it up,

159
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,850
and it's the number of abortions that
the average woman would have in her

160
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:52,851
lifetime if she continues with the
rates that are present at the time you

161
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:58,290
collect the statistics. And again, I
mentioned this in the world, it's 0.9,

162
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,450
very close to one. The average woman
will have one abortion in her lifetime.

163
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,670
It ranges from a low of 0.21
abortion per every five women,

164
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,600
uh, in several countries
to a high of 1.7 in Cuba,

165
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,870
almost two abortions per woman in Cuba.
Well,

166
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:20,820
I'll talk later about the very
interesting situation in Cuba.

167
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,650
So over time, uh, as I said,

168
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:30,651
the number of abortions is really on
the big scale of a couple of decades

169
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,250
staying pretty constant.
But from the last compilation in 1995,

170
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:40,251
the estimate was 46 million abortions and
now it's down to 42 million abortions.

171
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,220
So there's been a very small
drop in the number of abortions.

172
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,100
And where do you think all
that drop has occurred?

173
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,380
Eastern Europe and again,

174
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:57,030
they had an extremely high uh, abortion
rate. It was the meth mechanism,

175
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,270
the mechanism of contraception there and
they're gradually becoming accustomed

176
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:04,240
to contraception.
So their abortion rate is going down.

177
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:08,920
Three quarters of the change in the whole
world are all due to Eastern Europe.

178
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:16,110
The United States looks pretty much
like the rest of the world. Uh,

179
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,650
there, there's one abortion
for every 3.2 live births here,

180
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:25,180
which is exactly the number that
is the average for the world.

181
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,860
The United States or 1.3
million abortions. And again,

182
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:32,980
2003 the last time this
statistics collected,

183
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,333
uh,

184
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,350
there's, and the, the rate is
21.3 abortions per thousand woman.

185
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,480
If you look per woman,

186
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:50,540
the u s looks a little better than a pro
birth that the total abortion rate in

187
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,660
the United States is 0.64 per women.

188
00:12:54,661 --> 00:12:58,890
That means two thirds of the average
is two thirds of women will have an

189
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:02,760
abortion during their lifetime,
whereas the world is closer to one.

190
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:08,240
So we have a somewhat lower
rate. And again, the, the, the,

191
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:12,720
the differences, the use of contraception,
and I'll talk about that later.

192
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,610
Uh,
the United States,

193
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,840
although somewhat better than the world
average in this is not nearly as good as

194
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:23,070
the point to remember. I said
ours is 0.64, uh, Belgium,

195
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,620
Germany and Switzerland
all are down at 0.2.

196
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,100
So less than a third of the number
of abortions per woman that we have,

197
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,270
uh,

198
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:37,510
so cohort of a thousand women going
through the reproductive life,

199
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:40,450
they'll have 639, uh, abortions.

200
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,710
And that's assuming we currently have
been having a reducing rate of abortion

201
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:47,770
here at presumes that
that rate will stay down.

202
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,570
So expanding out to the world again,
uh,

203
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,930
abortion can be a major
method of fertility control,

204
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,980
especially when a country first goes
through its fertility transition.

205
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And one of the fastest fertility of
transitions in the world was in Japan.

206
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:10,150
Of all places where
they have the birthrate,

207
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,220
the birthrate in Japan was had
between 1947 in 1957 in 10 years,

208
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:20,020
went down to half from 34 per thousand
women to 17 and it's remained at that

209
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:24,610
level more or less until 1979
and now it's getting even lower.

210
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,800
And here is,

211
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,420
this is an interesting case of Japan,

212
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,590
so this is the years 49 member MacArthur,

213
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,800
the u s administration of Japan was still
sort of tailing down at that time and

214
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:45,850
we're looking at it at a 10 year span.

215
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,770
This is the number of pregnancies
which is births plus abortions.

216
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,710
And you'll notice that during this time,
during this tenure has been,

217
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,280
the number of pregnancies really
does not change an awful lot. No,

218
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:03,380
it's 20007002000 700900600 800800600
so the number of pregnancies does not

219
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:09,920
change,
but look what happens to abortion.

220
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:13,430
It gets legalized here and very rapidly,

221
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,750
it goes from a hundred to
up to 10 times as much.

222
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,080
Correspondingly,
the births go down.

223
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,410
So abortion goes from an insignificant
fraction of births to vary so much,

224
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:31,400
much closer to the number of births.

225
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,640
So in this case it was legalization of
abortion that sort of boom cause the,

226
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,630
the, the Japanese birth rate to
fall, there was no coercion involved.

227
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,510
It was purely a legalization step

228
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,180
in many places, places abortion
is the method of birth control.

229
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,420
So in the Soviet Union,

230
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:58,700
the official statistics before it fell
apart where that there were five to eight,

231
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,110
uh, abortions, lifetime per woman, uh,

232
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:07,550
in the Ukraine it was 10
to 12 abortions per woman.

233
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,150
The immigrants that come to America
say that's nonsense that uh,

234
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,990
it was 20 to 30 that everybody they
know have 20 to 30 abortions lifetime.

235
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,730
Japan also because of though they
legalized abortion very early.

236
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,290
They didn't legalize the pill until
just a couple of few years ago and they

237
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:32,060
legalize it when Viagra came out
and the men demanded to get Viagara.

238
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:34,310
They are very good national health plan.
It's all free.

239
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:36,560
And very careful and very good.

240
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,400
And men wanted free Viagara and then it
became politically impossible to keep

241
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:43,850
women from having the, but
pay for, for men's Viagara.

242
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:47,330
So Japan legalized it, uh, very recently.

243
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,830
The pill and via their abortion
rate has always been extremely high.

244
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:59,000
Um,
in some special circumstances,

245
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,910
uh,
the abortion rates are sky high.

246
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,120
So in 1966 in Romania,

247
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,690
there were 408 abortions for every hundred
live births for abortions for every

248
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:15,470
one live birth.
And the history of that is very,

249
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:20,090
very interesting. Uh, in
the whole Soviet block,

250
00:17:20,091 --> 00:17:24,860
cause it was a complex of issues.
Uh, contraception was legal,

251
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:27,920
it was kind of available,
but the manufacturing was terrible.

252
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:31,640
So they had condoms in the
various Soviet bloc countries,

253
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:36,140
but there are so poorly made that the
people called them galoshes. They just,

254
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,180
they just didn't fit. Plus,
uh, the doctors were, were,

255
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,300
uh, working for the government
and not paid very well,

256
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,420
but they could privately outside
the government statistics,

257
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:50,220
they could privately do
abortions and make money on it.

258
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:54,300
So the doctors role pushing abortion
and a variety of other reasons. We'll,

259
00:17:54,301 --> 00:17:58,950
we'll talk more about countries in which
abortion is by far the dominant means

260
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,330
of birth control.

261
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,153
Okay.

262
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:10,690
Legally legal and medically performed
abortion by a trained doctor is one of the

263
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:12,860
safest methods of birth control.
No.

264
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,930
And here is the statistics on this.

265
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:20,060
This is from the,
you know,

266
00:18:20,061 --> 00:18:24,560
the physician's desk reference for for
many years all of the birth control pills

267
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,980
have to have this graph in it.
And what do you see here?

268
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,520
This is the annual deaths,
uh,

269
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,860
of for women per 100,000 non sterile
women who are either using or not using

270
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,813
birth control.

271
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,480
What you noticed the really high category
was the only super duper high is women

272
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:48,170
over 40 who smoke.
Then I did,

273
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:51,680
oh and use the pill smoking use depot,
that's pill.

274
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:54,470
The pill is their method of
contraception and they smoke.

275
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,650
If you're over 40 and you smoke,
don't use the pill.

276
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:03,050
That's not a healthy thing to do
for every other category of woman.

277
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:07,400
The white bars are larger
than any of the other bars.

278
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,430
And the white bar is not
using contraception at all.

279
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,850
And what this tells you is if
they're not using contraception,

280
00:19:13,851 --> 00:19:17,960
they're going to get pregnant. And that
the mortality dangerous, this is death.

281
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:19,160
So this is mortality.

282
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,400
But the mortality dangers from pregnancy
are a good bit higher than any of the

283
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:28,310
other methods of birth control.

284
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,490
What,
what year was this one?

285
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,560
This is,
um,

286
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:39,100
I think about 1990 and hasn't,
well,

287
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,350
what has changed is that,

288
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:45,550
let me finish and I'll tell
you what's changed since then.

289
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:50,970
So the safest is these little black bars,

290
00:19:51,071 --> 00:19:55,510
which can hardly see,
which is traditional contraception,

291
00:19:55,511 --> 00:19:58,870
which is condoms, what they're
talking about, backed up by abortion.

292
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,110
That is the safest of all of all methods.

293
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,210
And then the other methods
like a diaphragm and condom,

294
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,880
uh, Rud, uh,

295
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:13,700
pills and pills for
nonsmokers abortion only, uh,

296
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:18,430
are all sort of low but intermediate.
So the story is,

297
00:20:18,431 --> 00:20:20,680
with the exception of
older women who smoke,

298
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,840
the worst thing you can do is not use
any method that that's, that's dangerous.

299
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:30,940
The best thing you can do is use
a condom backed up by abortion.

300
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:36,000
That's surprising cause there's so
much popular myth out there, uh,

301
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,950
that,
that misconstrues these facts.

302
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:44,130
Now what has changed is that this data
was taken in the earlier days of birth

303
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:48,100
control pills, which were high dose.
You've probably heard about this.

304
00:20:48,101 --> 00:20:51,610
They used to have very high dose
because they were, it was new,

305
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:54,100
they didn't know about it and they
wanted to be sure the main thing was to

306
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:54,970
prevent pregnancy.

307
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,870
Then they realize they could get away
with lower and lower doses and the pills

308
00:20:58,871 --> 00:21:02,750
nowadays have much lower doses.
So they're much less side effects.

309
00:21:02,751 --> 00:21:06,100
So all of these columns
will probably be way,

310
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:11,080
way down from what they
were. So and, and yeah,

311
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,800
that's, that's what's,
that's what's changed. Um,

312
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,360
when you go to the developing
world, uh, this is,

313
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,990
this is United States data. When you
go to the developing world, of course,

314
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:27,010
pregnancy itself is much more dangerous.
Childbirth is much more dangerous.

315
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:32,160
So what you see is these white bars
go awful lot higher depending on the

316
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:35,800
country. If you're in the middle of
Africa, they're very high. If you're in

317
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:42,070
other places, they're pretty much
like the United States level.

318
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:58,510
Both, both, both, all of the above. Um,

319
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,090
okay.
Not only,

320
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:05,800
so this just shows you immediate
mortality and it's clear what's going on.

321
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,053
Um,

322
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:11,530
abortion apparently has no longterm
clinical effects whatsoever.

323
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:13,510
There's no physical effects. It, again,

324
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,910
we're talking about proper medically
done abortion, sterile abortions, uh,

325
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,790
properly done.
They're no long term clinical effects,

326
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:26,470
neither physical nor psychiatric there.
It doesn't make a women sterile.

327
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:30,250
It doesn't increase the
chance of sterility and it
doesn't cause you to go crazy

328
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:33,940
later. None of that stuff is
statistically true. Of course,

329
00:22:33,941 --> 00:22:38,020
there are women who either having
an abortion, not having an abortion,

330
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:42,040
go through all these bad events,
but statistically they're the same.

331
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,130
The number of women have had an abortion
and eventually go sterile will be the

332
00:22:45,131 --> 00:22:48,910
same as those who have not had an
abortion and eventually go sterile.

333
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,050
Now that's a medical sequelae.

334
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,620
What the emotional content
of having an abortion?

335
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:03,220
That varies tremendously depending.
It varies tremendously by country.

336
00:23:03,221 --> 00:23:06,340
We'll talk about some countries where
it's an absolutely like a nonevent having

337
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:08,680
an abortion and other,
other places.

338
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:13,450
And other individuals
where if their own ethics,

339
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:16,510
their own morality, their own
desire for a child, their religion,

340
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,240
if it really is opposed to abortion,

341
00:23:19,241 --> 00:23:23,470
then there can be a lot of
emotional difficulty with it.

342
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:27,820
But that's not, uh, a thing to
do with the abortion itself.

343
00:23:27,821 --> 00:23:28,870
It's to do with the,

344
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,580
so we say the moral context in which
that woman perceives the abortion to have

345
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:38,290
been done long with this. Um,

346
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,780
the, so you have these generally quite
high rates of abortion around the world.

347
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,890
And the question is what are
the determinants of that? Right?

348
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:49,940
What makes the rate higher?
What makes the rate lower? Uh,

349
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,500
many people believe that religious
prescription that the religions,

350
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:59,090
religion of the country is what is
the determining factor. But it's not,

351
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,320
uh, it's for instance, in
Europe, among Catholic countries,

352
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,020
Belgium has one of the
lowest rates in the world.

353
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,340
A 6.8 per thousand and Hungary and other
Catholic country has one of the highest

354
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:15,770
34.7 per thousand. So your, your span,

355
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:20,710
the whole range among Muslim countries,
Bangladesh is one of the lowest rates.

356
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:25,520
A 3.8 wild Turkey has six
or seven times that rate.

357
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,930
And again, the Bangladesh rate is
a little confused because of the,

358
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,680
they use a lot of
menstrual regulation there.

359
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,240
The U s largely been, certainly
not exclusively Protestant country,

360
00:24:38,241 --> 00:24:39,680
has about the same rate as Turkey.

361
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:44,910
So which is a strick is essentially
all Muslim. Of course, uh,

362
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,790
people believe that,
uh,

363
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:52,250
the Catholic Church of course teaches that
abortion is a mortal sin. It's murder.

364
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,070
But in the u s the abortion
rate for protestants,

365
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,960
which has 17 per thousand is lower
than for Catholics, 24 per thousand.

366
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,820
And as far as one can tell,

367
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,230
Catholics because of church becomes
slightly under use birth control.

368
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,850
So as a compensation they
slightly, uh, overuse abortion.

369
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,760
Uh,
the,

370
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:17,420
the error bars and all these basically
mean that there's barely detectable

371
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:20,750
difference between say Protestants and
Catholics within America, within one,

372
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,440
any one country. Uh, so there's two,

373
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,560
two issues of why the
Catholic rate is higher. Yeah,

374
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,660
this is per thousand.

375
00:25:31,661 --> 00:25:35,170
Those are numbers per thousand per
thousand women of reproductive age,

376
00:25:35,171 --> 00:25:39,040
not per thousand babies. So, uh,
the kind of a thing is most is,

377
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,990
most of the difference in that statistic
is that there's a large Hispanic

378
00:25:43,991 --> 00:25:45,490
population in America,

379
00:25:45,491 --> 00:25:49,120
which happens to be Catholic and as a
higher abortion rate than native born

380
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:53,710
women. So that is the most of the
reason why the Catholic rate is higher.

381
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:57,761
It's also,

382
00:25:57,761 --> 00:26:02,761
you can't tie it down to a
legal prescription whether
abortion is legal or not

383
00:26:03,971 --> 00:26:08,410
legal. You can't tie that down as a
determining factor in abortion either.

384
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,820
About half of the abortions in
the world are illegal and the old,

385
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,630
it's the old statistics
use the word illegal.

386
00:26:16,631 --> 00:26:19,300
But now there is such a variety of,

387
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:23,090
of legal rules and that was such a variety
of situations in each country where,

388
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,830
where it's legal or not. And now
different states and different cards,

389
00:26:26,831 --> 00:26:28,000
like in Mexico,

390
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:34,260
Mexico City has one law in each
state can have a very different laws.

391
00:26:34,561 --> 00:26:37,930
So it gets to be very
difficult to describe legality.

392
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,250
And that's all tied in with with safety,
which we'll come back to.

393
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:47,190
And you'll see to six about safe abortion
sometimes says about legal abortion

394
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,180
and they're usually,
they fit right on top of each other.

395
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:54,990
So about half of the abortions
in the world are illegal,

396
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,130
the other half are illegal.
Um,

397
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,930
so for instance,
in Europe,

398
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,160
abortionist is generally legal everywhere
under a very wide range of conditions.

399
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,530
It's abortion rate is 28,
uh,

400
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:12,270
per thousand in Africa where it's
illegal almost everywhere. Uh,

401
00:27:12,271 --> 00:27:17,070
it's 29. So again, uh, no, no difference.

402
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,780
The lowest rates in the world or
in western and northern Europe were

403
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,230
abortionists accessible with
few restrictions. So the total,

404
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,730
basically the total legality of abortion
is in a place where the rates are very

405
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:33,060
low.
Up to 2007,

406
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,930
abortion was banned in Mexico, so it was
totally illegal everywhere in Mexico.

407
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,000
Nevertheless,
uh,

408
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:44,210
the number of abortions rose
by 50% between 1,990 and
2006 with a constant legal

409
00:27:45,781 --> 00:27:49,920
situation of illegality.
And in 2006,

410
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:54,690
Mexico's abortion rate was 40% higher
than the u s rate, uh, next door.

411
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,880
And so here you have three countries
that are on the line. Canada,

412
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:01,560
the US and Mexico.

413
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:07,250
Canada has a much lower in the United
States is in the middle and Mexico and

414
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,550
those two are legal in
Mexico. It's illegal and it
has the highest rate of all.

415
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,800
So,
but of course,

416
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:18,801
I should warn you and probably
realize that that saying that,

417
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:23,040
that uh, abortion doesn't,
he can't use that.

418
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:26,220
The legal thing is not the
determining factor. These,

419
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:30,180
these intercontinent comparisons from
your country comparisons are not terribly

420
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:34,050
informative because so many between say
Mexico and the United States in between

421
00:28:34,051 --> 00:28:38,040
Africa and Europe, there are
so many variables, so many
socioeconomic variables,

422
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,780
education, medical care, standard of
living. All of this varies tremendously.

423
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,310
And the difference in abortion rates is
not to be found in the legal or illegal

424
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:51,150
nature of it, but in some of
those other characteristics.

425
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,500
Okay. Uh, in most countries,
abortion is legal.

426
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,360
And as of a few years ago,

427
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:04,980
61% of the world's people lived in
countries where abortion is permitted,

428
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,480
uh,
uh,

429
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:11,500
basically without restriction or
in a wide range of, of reasons.

430
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:16,380
Only 25% live in places where
abortion is largely illegal.

431
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,360
These are largely Latin America,

432
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,470
some of the Muslim countries in
sub Saharan African countries,

433
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:28,110
abortion is becoming a
legal in more places. Uh,

434
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,650
from 1985 to 98,

435
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:36,920
19 nations significantly liberalized their
abortion laws and only Poland Dee Dee

436
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,890
legalized
abortion,

437
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,070
which had to do with its independence
basically from the Soviet Union.

438
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,340
At the time there was 85 to 98.

439
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:51,280
From 98 to 2007. Again, the latest data,

440
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:56,460
16 nations liberalized their abortion
laws and two territories in one state in

441
00:29:56,801 --> 00:30:00,530
Australia liberalized its
abortion laws. And, uh,

442
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,700
in Mexico I mentioned Mexico or Mexico
City has now made abortion in the first

443
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:11,020
12 weeks, uh, legal and
that was in 19. In 2007,

444
00:30:11,021 --> 00:30:14,380
I believe. And then a few states
and Mexico has followed that.

445
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:18,400
So Mexico is now split, uh, place, uh,

446
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,630
in this, uh, 98 to 2007 timeframe, uh,

447
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,550
El Salvador and Nicaragua,

448
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:29,290
which already had a very restrictive
abortion laws when to absolute under no

449
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:33,310
circumstances abortions,
totally no, no rape, no death,

450
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:37,960
health of the mother and no exceptions
in Nicaragua and El Salvador.

451
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:45,210
In contrast to the safety
of legal abortion where
abortions are when it's legal,

452
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:50,560
it's almost always done.
Proper medical situation. Uh,

453
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,810
when it's illegal, it's an
extremely dangerous procedure. Uh,

454
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:56,771
there's,

455
00:30:56,771 --> 00:31:01,771
I'm like 67,000 abortion related
deaths a year and that leaves 220,000,

456
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:08,170
a quarter million children, uh,
without their mothers. As you may know,

457
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:09,220
when it's illegal,

458
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:14,580
the main procedure is inserting something
up the uterus and scraping around to

459
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:20,670
try to dislodge the, the, the
endometrium and, and, and the, um,

460
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,440
and the fetus.
Well,

461
00:31:23,441 --> 00:31:26,770
if you're scraping around in there with
a pointed stick or a hanger or something,

462
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,970
you're liable to puncture of the uterine
wall and make a hole between the inside

463
00:31:30,971 --> 00:31:31,541
of the uterus,

464
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:36,430
which is open through the vaginal canal
to the outside and the peritoneal cavity,

465
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:40,180
the inside of your body.
And so infection gets through that.

466
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,810
And so the main route isn't
the main reason why abortion,

467
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,700
illegal abortion is so dangerous,

468
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:51,120
is that non sterility of whatever
it is that's inserted a plus,

469
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:53,890
it's pointed usually,

470
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:58,750
and the break right through
the uterine wall. In addition,

471
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:03,660
you may know that the flow Pian tube is
open into the peritoneal cavity because

472
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,000
the, uh, the ovary, which
releases the egg is,

473
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:11,920
is it sits right on top of the Fallopian
Tube and the egg is released into the

474
00:32:11,921 --> 00:32:14,650
peritoneal space just
to the body fluid here.

475
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,180
And it's supposed to drop down into the
Fallopian tube and Cilia push it down.

476
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,870
But that's an opening.
So if you get something unsterile in,

477
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,910
into the womb and then the bacteria can
swim upstream and you're into the body

478
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:32,110
and then you to antisepsis
and you very likely die.

479
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,720
Um, so, uh, it's, uh,

480
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:41,690
it's a very dangerous
procedure when done, uh, not,

481
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,260
not properly. Um, the,

482
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,850
the very good statistics,
uh,

483
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,700
showing that the main determinant of
the maternal death rate from abortion is

484
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:01,930
legal status. So I think I
have this. So here again, no,

485
00:33:01,931 --> 00:33:05,900
I don't think I showed
this slide. So here is, uh,

486
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,260
places where abortion is legal.
Here's the abortion rate. This goes,

487
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:12,950
it goes back to saying that the legal
situation doesn't determine the rate of

488
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:16,400
abortion here. Various, uh, uh,

489
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,360
abortion legal places and the rate is
about six to 26 and here it's illegal.

490
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,050
Uh, and he had the range
of 23 to 52, so, you know,

491
00:33:27,051 --> 00:33:30,710
ballpark double or triple
this, right, so it's illegal.

492
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,750
These are all South America.
This is all Europe,

493
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,250
Japan, Australia, United States,
very developed countries,

494
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,220
countries that are partially developed,
shall we say.

495
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:48,520
So the legality correlates with the,

496
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,490
the, the abortion rate, but it's
almost certainly not the cause.

497
00:33:52,491 --> 00:33:56,540
Certainly being illegal is not
causing these high abortion rates.

498
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:59,120
But now when you go over and
look at the maternal deaths,

499
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,990
you see that there are there 10,

500
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,180
the developed regions
have an average of 10,

501
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:10,570
whereas in Latin America you have up in
102 hundred and even up to 300 range.

502
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,990
You go to Africa, 650. So they are,

503
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:19,991
the illegality really does make a
difference in the maternal death rate.

504
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:23,590
That's, that's the dominant effect of, of,

505
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:27,170
of making something illegal is,
doesn't change the abortion rate.

506
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,560
We have a number of examples,
but it changes the maternal death rate

507
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:33,710
very,
very clearly.

508
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,790
The most extreme example of this,

509
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:42,560
and the clearest example of this
is us from Romania. Romania had,

510
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,730
uh, uh, during,

511
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,670
after World War Two when it
was a Soviet puppet state, uh,

512
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,540
as I told you, the abortion
rate was extraordinarily high,

513
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:58,400
like four abortions for every
one live birth. And because the,

514
00:34:58,401 --> 00:35:00,410
the, the, the, well,

515
00:35:00,411 --> 00:35:04,250
they had a dictator then Nick Nicolae
Ceausescu who you undoubtedly have heard

516
00:35:04,251 --> 00:35:07,430
of, and he decided that for
the glory of Greater Romania,

517
00:35:07,431 --> 00:35:10,460
there should be more Romanians.
He wanted a big, strong state.

518
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,900
So he went on a pro natalist campaign.
Uh,

519
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:19,830
abortion was immediately
criminalized. Um, uh,

520
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,570
contraceptives became very hard to get.
They wouldn't import them,

521
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:25,940
they didn't manufacture them.
Uh,

522
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:31,810
so what he did is that all women between
18 and 45 were rounded up at their

523
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:35,600
workplace. Remember this? A socialist
state, so almost all the women worked.

524
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,180
They're rounded up at their workplace
and subjected to a gynecological

525
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,830
examination. And if they were not
pregnant, they had to explain to the,

526
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,590
to the, to the government
why they were not pregnant.

527
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:51,210
So it was about as intrusive
a pro natalist campaign.

528
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,820
As you can imagine, it's, it's somewhat
the mirror image of China's Eh,

529
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,860
anti birth campaign.
Romania had the blessed campaign

530
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:05,190
anyway. Uh, what happened immediately? Uh,

531
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,230
so previously 80% of
pregnancies had been ending.

532
00:36:08,231 --> 00:36:09,990
It had been terminated with abortion,

533
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:15,210
abortion disappears and it was legal.
Abortion had been legal and boom,

534
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:18,990
the birth rate does indeed go up.
Nothing like by a factor of five,

535
00:36:18,991 --> 00:36:21,500
but something like a factor of two as our,
as I remember.

536
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,500
But I want you to check that. Um, and,

537
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,580
but then very rapidly women's set up
networks of illegal abortion providers and

538
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,210
the birth rate goes up and the,

539
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:37,080
and the birth rate comes back down and
an ends up somewhat higher than it had

540
00:36:37,081 --> 00:36:40,590
been beforehand,
but not enormously higher.

541
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:45,660
But the maternal death rate is,
is what changed.

542
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:51,160
It rose a to 200 per 100,000
live birth from, from a,

543
00:36:51,161 --> 00:36:55,500
a number in a developed country. You
know, something in the tens or twenties,

544
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:00,030
it range to 10 times that amount.

545
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,830
The infant mortality rate because there's
mothers didn't want these children.

546
00:37:04,831 --> 00:37:07,830
Presumably the infant mortality rate,
uh,

547
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:12,030
rose to 83 deaths per thousand from uh,

548
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,780
like uh,
Chapin's rate is 4.8.

549
00:37:15,781 --> 00:37:20,160
The U S is 8.9 so it rose to 83.

550
00:37:20,161 --> 00:37:24,270
So and again something like a 10
times increase in infant mortality.

551
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,660
So the main effect of d
legalizing abortion was a
temporary rise in the number

552
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:36,090
of births, but a long term increase
in maternal mortality and infant.

553
00:37:36,091 --> 00:37:36,840
We're talking massive,

554
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,840
massive increase when by the time abortion
abortion of course when they got a

555
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,770
free of the dictator
it was legalized again.

556
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,340
And then by that time things have come
back a little normal but still the

557
00:37:50,341 --> 00:37:53,070
maternal death rate,
as soon as they legalized abortion,

558
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:55,440
the maternal death rate
dropped by a factor of three.

559
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:00,270
So that's Romania is one example.
In South Africa,

560
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:04,620
you route more recently, this was in the
late sixties, the remaining his story.

561
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
And in South Africa the abortion law
was liberalized and the incidents of

562
00:38:10,951 --> 00:38:15,540
maternal infection boot abortion dropped
dropped in half. So in all cases,

563
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:16,500
uh,

564
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,500
the major effect of making abortion
illegal is an increase in complications of

565
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,690
abort.
You don't change the abortion rate,

566
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:30,830
but complicated medical complications,
death of the mother, death of the infants,

567
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:35,920
the fundamental cause I would have been
going through things that are not the

568
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:38,200
cause of the high abortion rates.

569
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,870
It's not the religion that's not the
legality. The fundamental causes.

570
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,580
A kind of obvious is unintended pregnancy.

571
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:50,860
And you may remember that these, they're
very high rates of unintended pregnancy.

572
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:55,530
Oh, here is a comparison
of two regions, uh,

573
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,840
almost all legal in the developed
countries and in almost all of Africa it's

574
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,320
illegal. And the death rates an
enormous, enormous difference there.

575
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,600
So you may remember these statistics
just just to refresh your memory about

576
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,190
unwanted, uh, fertility.
So this is 71% of living.

577
00:39:15,191 --> 00:39:19,720
Women want to stop having children.
Yet as I showed you before, they,

578
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,340
they have more,
they,

579
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,250
they continue to have children because
they're not using contraception.

580
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,270
They don't have enough contraception.
And here are around, that's Bolivia.

581
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:31,300
And this is from previous lecture
around the world. Remember,

582
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:34,090
this is the line where people,

583
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,080
this is how many children people are
having. This is how many they want.

584
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,260
This is the line where they're equal.
All countries,

585
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:44,260
all developing countries are having
more children that they want.

586
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:49,030
So there's a large amount of unmet unmet
need in the world and the estimate for

587
00:39:49,031 --> 00:39:52,840
the world's 108 million, uh, women. Uh,

588
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,130
and these,
since there's an unmet need,

589
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:59,830
these women who don't want
to have more children,

590
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:04,860
he had do that results in some 51
million unintended pregnancies.

591
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,160
And of those using contraceptive,

592
00:40:09,161 --> 00:40:13,450
another 25 million happened as a result
of incorrect or inconsistent use of

593
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:15,880
contraception or method failure.

594
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:21,190
So you have something like 80
million unwanted pregnancies

595
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,490
in the, the world is 210
million pregnancies annually.

596
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,570
And about 40% of them are unplanned.
And about a quarter of an,

597
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,190
we know from a lot of places that
when there's an unplanned pregnancy,

598
00:40:36,191 --> 00:40:40,530
about a quarter of them end
in abortion. So the main, uh,

599
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:46,260
sequence is unwanted pregnancy
and then hi abortion rate.

600
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,900
And uh,

601
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:55,580
most most unintended
pregnancies in the world, uh,

602
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,900
well most unintend print
in the developed countries.

603
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,300
So there's difference here between
developed and undeveloped countries.

604
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,410
Contraception is,

605
00:41:02,411 --> 00:41:06,550
is very available and in highly
used in the developed world.

606
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,020
So in the developed world,

607
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:13,170
most unintended pregnancies are of people
who are using contraception and using

608
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:15,910
it fairly accurately.
But there's a method,

609
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,930
a failure that the
contraception just just fails.

610
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,920
And you have to remember that a woman
is fertile for say 30 years of her life

611
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,940
and she has 12 sites,
12 monthly cycles in a year,

612
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:34,110
a little bit more actually because
the cycle is 20 days and principle.

613
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:37,780
But that's close enough.
And so in order to,

614
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,510
to not have an unintended pregnancy,

615
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:45,560
her contraception must be
law be perfect for 30 years,

616
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,340
12 cycles a year. That's an awful
lot to expect of the contraceptive.

617
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,270
And just contraceptives, you
know, or just not, not that good.

618
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,790
So in developed countries also,
uh,

619
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:00,470
the main reason for unintended pregnancy,

620
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:04,370
it's very heavily, it's married
women who are using contraception.

621
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:08,570
They usually have several children
already and the contraception fails.

622
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:12,290
That's, that's the main
reason in developed countries,

623
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:17,330
in developing countries where
contraception uses is less prevalent.

624
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:22,310
The main reason is not
non use of contraception,

625
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:30,180
the very strong relationship between
contraception and abortion. So,

626
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:34,670
so we have a country, most country
in the world with this unmet need,

627
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:37,400
women before you start
collecting statistics,

628
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:42,350
want fewer children than they're
having. Uh, but it's not a big deal.

629
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:45,010
Then something changes
could be an economic,

630
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:49,280
we've discussed the reasons of cultural
change and economic change, whatever.

631
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,310
And people really start
wanting to have fewer children.

632
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:57,310
So this happened around 1964 in
Korea. And you read, you know,

633
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,190
I gave you one of the stories about an
example of how this happens in Korea.

634
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,200
And what happens is,
as women,

635
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:07,880
as the whole culture changes from
wanting the sort of a maximum rate of

636
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:12,000
fertility to wanting a lower rate
of fertility, the contraception,

637
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:15,830
the abortion rate picks up first.
Because in all these countries,

638
00:43:15,831 --> 00:43:17,300
abortion is a traditional method.

639
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,000
The women know it and are
moderately comfortable with it.

640
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,860
So you see first the abortion rate
starts going up. Then with a short lag,

641
00:43:24,861 --> 00:43:26,570
the contraception rate goes up.

642
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:31,040
It goes all the countries establish
a national family planning programs.

643
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:37,730
And what happens as people
use more abortion news,

644
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:41,390
Morgan's contraception,
so they're reducing their fertility,

645
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:46,430
but the rate of drop of desired fertility
can be so fast that that even the

646
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:51,170
psalm of contraception,
abortion can't keep up with
it. So both rates keep rising.

647
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:56,770
Eventually you peak where abortion
peaks and starts falling down.

648
00:43:57,141 --> 00:43:59,060
Contraception continues onward.

649
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:04,360
So this is the time when the demand to
have less fertility is more than either

650
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:07,490
method alone can cope with,

651
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:12,170
but eventually women and abortion
is easier cause the post,

652
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,740
it's a, it's an after
the fact, uh, method.

653
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:20,030
But eventually women learn
to use contraception views,

654
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,730
learn to use it and use you
learned to use it properly.

655
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:28,210
And so then the abortion rate declines
as the contraception rate continues on up

656
00:44:28,911 --> 00:44:31,260
to very high levels.

657
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,200
Most of the difference here is women
who want to get get pregnant, something.

658
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:39,090
So you have this trade off,
you have an early stage,

659
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:44,130
both of them rise together and her later
stage they do very divergent things and

660
00:44:44,131 --> 00:44:48,960
you'll see, uh, when you've got a
Prelim polemicizing discussion of this,

661
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,200
what you hear is that right
to life people say, oh,

662
00:44:52,201 --> 00:44:55,560
contraception is no good abortion
rises with contraception.

663
00:44:55,561 --> 00:44:58,140
And they use statistics
from this half and half.

664
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:03,420
People who are pro choice say no, no,
no or pro contraception. No, no, no.

665
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,610
It goes this way and they
use this half of the graph.

666
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:10,260
But you get both of these things.
And Korea is one example.

667
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:15,340
Here is another example of
the relationship between
contraception and abortion

668
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,540
in Bangladesh.

669
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,410
So here is member Mont Lob
where you read about my lab,

670
00:45:22,411 --> 00:45:26,700
where they chose some villages and got
a very strong family planning program.

671
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,510
And then other villages where they
left alone as a control region.

672
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:32,580
They had family panic because
it had the government program.

673
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:36,180
The government program wasn't any near
as good as the intervention program.

674
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:41,040
So here's the control region and a lot,
a lot to see here. So first of all,

675
00:45:41,041 --> 00:45:45,670
this is desired fertility and that starts,
uh,

676
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:51,800
at this level and drops down to somewhat
more than half desired fertility in the

677
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:57,270
Matlab region that was started about
the same level and falls about the same

678
00:45:57,271 --> 00:46:01,020
amount. So the difference in the
terrain is not desired fertility.

679
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:05,100
The actual fertility rate drops here,

680
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:10,500
starts higher and drops a little faster
here. So that ends up not very different.

681
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:14,310
So again, the difference is not
the actual amount of fertility,

682
00:46:14,311 --> 00:46:18,780
which the number of births
is an enormously difference
between the two regions.

683
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:23,880
But in the MOD law, in the,
uh, the experimental region,

684
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,530
the region where they
had the good program,

685
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,830
the contraceptive prevalence
goes very high. It goes rapidly,

686
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:33,720
very high from something like
30% more than doubles to 70%.

687
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:39,060
Whereas in the other
read the non girl region,

688
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,950
you have it starts much lower it,
it's, this rises very rapidly.

689
00:46:43,951 --> 00:46:46,080
This doesn't change at
all for a number of years.

690
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,650
Then the government actually the
government improves its programming,

691
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:52,830
jumps up a little bit, it jumps up a
little bit. So it's the contraceptive.

692
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:54,780
This is a really big difference.

693
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:59,950
The contraceptive prevalence is much
lower in the control region then in the

694
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:06,120
experimental region. And the result
is here's the abortion ratio, uh,

695
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,480
in the region where the contraceptive
prevalence is very high.

696
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:14,400
And here the abortion ratio goes
crazy where they don't have,

697
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:18,420
they're not using contraception,
uh, efficiently. And again,

698
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:20,550
here you can see in those two regions,
the same country,

699
00:47:20,551 --> 00:47:25,530
same time neighboring villages,
neighboring districts, uh,

700
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,860
that the, the, there's this trade off.

701
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:32,500
They either use contraception or
they was abortion in both places.

702
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:35,440
They're wanting fewer
children as time goes on.

703
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,070
But in one case they use contraception,
you know, the case, the use abortion.

704
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,580
Um, I think too, I have
another guy from that.

705
00:47:42,581 --> 00:47:46,480
Here's another example of this
rather different in Shanghai,

706
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,350
and this is a more complicated,
somewhat interesting case.

707
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:53,950
This is the one child policy comes in.

708
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,200
They're only allowed one child.

709
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:00,790
So they have that child and then they
try to do something to avoid the second

710
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:01,624
child.

711
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:06,630
And what they use is a contraceptive
methods and they don't work.

712
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,040
They start with very high. Uh,
let me get this straight here.

713
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:13,343
Uh,

714
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:18,600
they start with a low use of Iud,

715
00:48:18,601 --> 00:48:22,860
which is a really secure
method of contraception and
the abortion rate is very

716
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:27,861
high and they rather rapidly learn
that IUD only really secure way of not

717
00:48:28,891 --> 00:48:32,070
getting pregnant and then
the abortion rate falls down.

718
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,160
So it's another rather different
situation in which again,

719
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:37,770
the abortion rate in the contrast
and the effect of constants,

720
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,420
contraceptive rate are
mirror images of each other.

721
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:47,070
When you have a high high rate
of effective contraception,

722
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:50,130
you have a low rate of abortion.

723
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,920
So,
uh,

724
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:02,930
so Latin America shows the same pattern,
uh,

725
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,640
in Latin America,
abortion has been practiced for centuries.

726
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:07,970
It a certainly practice by,

727
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:11,920
by the Incas and the Aztecs in 1551,

728
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:16,540
the bishop of Venezuela reported to the
King of Spain that the natives did not

729
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:21,070
want their children to become
slaves. So they boarded them. 1551,

730
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:26,830
Chile has very good medical statistics
at the beginning of chilies,

731
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,460
uh, fertility transition in the 1960s, uh,

732
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:34,810
23% of Chilean women voluntarily
admitted to having an, uh,

733
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:36,790
an induced abortion. Again, remember,

734
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:41,590
Chile is very heavily Catholic country
and this is not really delving into

735
00:49:41,591 --> 00:49:43,180
medical records and making any cracking.

736
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,330
Just asking them whenever you had an
abortion. And a quarter of them say, yes,

737
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:50,470
I've had had an abortion.
And not only did they have an abortion,

738
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:55,150
but most of them had more than
one abortion. Up to three,

739
00:49:55,450 --> 00:50:00,010
8.4% of the women had
more than seven abortions.

740
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:02,710
This is,
this is early on,

741
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,753
uh,

742
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:09,430
10 years later in the 70s.
Now it's, we're women, uh,

743
00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:14,120
are really into their fertility decline.
They don't want the children. Uh,

744
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:18,680
the average woman has almost
three abortions, uh, lifetime.

745
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:21,650
So that that goes up.
And again,

746
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:25,370
those are the openly admitted numbers
and the real numbers must have been much

747
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,840
higher. And again, in
elsewhere, uh, in, in Chile,

748
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:31,490
almost all the women were married,

749
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:35,540
almost all middle class women and they
already had had four to six pregnancies

750
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:40,800
and they already had children and good
an experience with pregnancy in terms of

751
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:42,620
socioeconomic levels.

752
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,570
Middle class women had more abortions
than working class women married women had

753
00:50:47,571 --> 00:50:51,020
a greater abortion rate than
those living in temporary unions,

754
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,800
just casual unions. And in all
through all of this time, uh,

755
00:50:55,830 --> 00:51:00,350
abortion was completely illegal and
Chilean and it's still, uh, it's still is

756
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,440
going next door to lean to Peru,
uh,

757
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,070
in Lima in the 1970s, again, the time
when the fertility rate was going down,

758
00:51:10,071 --> 00:51:13,100
when people were wanting
fewer children in Peru,

759
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,440
the yearly increase in the
abortion rate was 24% every year.

760
00:51:17,441 --> 00:51:22,280
And there's 24% increase in abortion.
And in any given year,

761
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:25,910
a quarter to a third of the reproductive
age women would have abortions.

762
00:51:25,911 --> 00:51:27,020
It's one out of four.

763
00:51:27,021 --> 00:51:31,190
One out of three women every
year would have an an abortion.

764
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,433
Uh,

765
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,900
again, it's in this, the, the,

766
00:51:35,901 --> 00:51:40,901
the really high abortion rates
or when women are sort of,

767
00:51:41,121 --> 00:51:45,470
families are starting to want
fewer children and haven't
yet really figured out

768
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,410
how to use contraception.
Uh,

769
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:52,520
in Contemporary Latin
America, uh, abortion,

770
00:51:52,521 --> 00:51:56,360
although it's illegal almost everywhere
and it's almost universally a catholic

771
00:51:56,361 --> 00:52:00,290
place. Uh, abortion is
very widespread. Uh,

772
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:05,330
Latin Americans as a whole has one
abortion for every two live births.

773
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,450
Remember worldwide and
the U S it's one per 3.2.

774
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:11,900
Latin America has one
for every two live births

775
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:18,620
and eventually there's a generational
change and the younger women start using

776
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:21,950
contraception and then the
abortion rate starts to fall.

777
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:25,720
Oh, okay. Oh,

778
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:34,620
the Philippines and other example.

779
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:35,663
MMM.

780
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:44,860
Maybe. So in the Philippines, uh,

781
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,760
have a very interesting situation
of the politics. There's a,

782
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:52,390
there's a strong interrelationship
between the politics of the country, uh,

783
00:52:52,650 --> 00:52:57,510
the Catholic Church and the
citizens use of, of contraception.

784
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,580
And when Ferdinand Fidel
Ramos was president,

785
00:53:02,581 --> 00:53:04,650
one of the early very populous presidents,

786
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:09,330
he supported family planning and a
quarter of the Filipino women were using a

787
00:53:09,331 --> 00:53:12,360
modern method.
And since then,

788
00:53:12,361 --> 00:53:17,070
the desired fertility has gone
down in, in, in the Philippines.

789
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:22,310
And now more than half of Filipino
women want some form of birth control.

790
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,140
But the presidency has changed.

791
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:28,370
And a woman of Gloria or royal mockup,

792
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,860
a girl came in and since,
uh,

793
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:36,330
Ferdinand Marcos was a strong dictator
and they had strong presidencies,

794
00:53:36,331 --> 00:53:41,100
but then when he was kicked
out for massive corruption, uh,

795
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:42,550
uh,
and,

796
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,140
and dictatorial means they now have
democratic elections and the governments

797
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:49,830
have been quite weak.
They don't have much popular support.

798
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,200
And so the government needs to get
legitimacy from somewhere. And this Cape,

799
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:56,900
they get legitimacy from the Catholic
Church because they're the Philippines,

800
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,020
very Catholic country.

801
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:03,250
And so I'm fairly open deal was
made between mockup a gall and, um,

802
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,620
and the,
the Archbishop of,

803
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:10,630
of the Philippines that the church will
support you if you make abortion illegal

804
00:54:11,761 --> 00:54:14,610
and, and get rid of the
family planning programs.

805
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:19,200
And so now the government and that
was taken and she got elected.

806
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,480
And now the government, uh, uh,

807
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:26,070
only supports traditional family planning
methods, which is withdrawal basically.

808
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:31,410
Uh, and so, and this had an effect.

809
00:54:31,411 --> 00:54:35,940
So from like 93 to 98 and a five,
six year period,

810
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:40,680
the use of traditional methods went up
by 50%. Well, the use of modern methods,

811
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:45,780
uh, didn't actually didn't change much,
but when the government pushes something,

812
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,640
it often goes up.
And all of those women,

813
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,980
the traditional methods just
plain don't work. So there,

814
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:57,490
so the result was that the number of
abortions in Philippines in the easiest

815
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:02,730
increased, uh, by 19% from
400,000 was already high,

816
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,380
from 400,000 went up to basically
a half a million abortions,

817
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:12,720
and they're all illegal. Of course. Okay.

818
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,830
As I said in the beginning,
in America,

819
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:21,540
abortion is a great source of controversy.
This is not,

820
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:26,340
uh, not always the case.
So in a lot of places, so,

821
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,750
uh,
there's,

822
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,990
there's a lot of literature now on
with called the culture of abortion.

823
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:35,990
Those countries for whom abortion
has the noncontroversial, uh,

824
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:40,770
uh, noncontroversial place as
a mechanism of fertility crow,

825
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:44,940
just as contraception has a more or
less noncontroversial place as a form of

826
00:55:44,941 --> 00:55:49,620
fertility control and say,
Europe and America. So,

827
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:54,390
uh, I got invited to a few years back to
talk to the women's health class about

828
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:59,660
abortion. And uh, it was one of the
things we've talked about. And uh,

829
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,420
afterwards I was talking
with some students and a
professor with the next class

830
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:08,450
walks in and he turned out to
be from Russia and he asked us,

831
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:10,580
you know, what are you're talking
about? And the students had,

832
00:56:10,581 --> 00:56:14,280
they started asking me questions about
something about abortion and he was

833
00:56:14,281 --> 00:56:17,160
really puzzled. He said, abortion,
why is anybody interested in math?

834
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:19,260
Because in Russia,
just an ordinary,

835
00:56:19,261 --> 00:56:23,980
absolute ordinary kind
of thing in like Romania.

836
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:28,030
And I'm sure this is to some degree
true and probably the whole East Eastern

837
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:28,270
Europe,

838
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:33,270
you remember I mentioned to you the
old theory that the health of the body,

839
00:56:33,491 --> 00:56:35,770
it depends on the humors of that.

840
00:56:35,771 --> 00:56:39,250
You've got the four humors and bio
and collar and all this and stuff.

841
00:56:39,251 --> 00:56:43,000
And it's the balance that's important
and you have to reestablish and what the

842
00:56:43,001 --> 00:56:46,420
menstrual period does. Everyone knows
the worst fluid is fee, menstrual fluid.

843
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,870
And so you've got to get rid of that.
And if you don't,

844
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:54,190
if you're not periodically getting rid
of menstrual fluid, the bad spirits,

845
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:58,900
humors, fluids build up in
you and you get unhealthy.

846
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:03,100
So in places like Romania,
many people older,

847
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:07,030
less educated people believe that it's
good to have an abortion every so often

848
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,860
having nothing to do with pregnancy
even, which is good to do that, to,

849
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:14,020
to get rid of this evil humor.

850
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:19,710
And that has persisted as well as
a lot of other really unbelievable,

851
00:57:20,291 --> 00:57:23,980
almost unbelievable to us medical myths.
And as part of the reason for that very,

852
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:26,680
very high abortion rate in Romania

853
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:31,530
and the Ukraine, when the
Soviet Union fell apart, uh,

854
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,620
the family planning programs
that they had also fell apart.

855
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:41,520
And so the whole area was left without
effective family planning and the

856
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:45,280
International Planned
Parenthood Federation, the
nearest office was in Bangkok.

857
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,730
And so they couldn't,
they couldn't help very much.

858
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:50,410
And what they did is they said,
okay,

859
00:57:50,411 --> 00:57:54,420
we'll take just the city of Moscow
cause it's most cost effective to,

860
00:57:54,421 --> 00:57:57,820
to work in a city with a lot of people.
You don't have geographic issues.

861
00:57:57,821 --> 00:58:00,970
And we'll try to provide
some contraception in Moscow,

862
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:04,030
but that left all the other Soviet
bloc countries with nothing.

863
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,030
And the Planned Parenthood
Federation of Connecticut here,

864
00:58:07,031 --> 00:58:11,230
I was associated with them at the
time. Uh, con contact with the Ukraine.

865
00:58:11,231 --> 00:58:15,940
The only crane was like lefty raft of
kind of separate and gut [inaudible] got

866
00:58:15,941 --> 00:58:20,740
in touch with the, the main, uh, the
head in the university, uh, in Kev, the,

867
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:24,950
the head of the Ob Gyn Department
of very nice woman and uh,

868
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:28,510
started to help her provide, uh, you know,

869
00:58:29,470 --> 00:58:31,360
just by contraceptives here in ship,
my broad,

870
00:58:31,361 --> 00:58:36,190
actually we buy them internationally
very cheap. A cycle of pills is 80 cents.

871
00:58:36,191 --> 00:58:39,100
In the world market.
A condom is like a penny and a half.

872
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:42,400
A diaphragm has to dollar
dollar and a quarter.

873
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:46,060
So if you buying them United States,
they're expensive, you buy them in India,

874
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:48,070
wherever they're made,
things are a lot cheaper.

875
00:58:48,071 --> 00:58:51,520
So we can really help Ukraine a lot.

876
00:58:51,521 --> 00:58:54,880
What they wanted first was cause you
can't use any of these things if this

877
00:58:54,881 --> 00:58:55,960
pelvic infections.

878
00:58:56,170 --> 00:59:00,340
So they wanted a monistat and
other treatments for pell,

879
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:03,400
for a vaginal infections as a,
as a first line,

880
00:59:03,401 --> 00:59:07,860
and then they could start dealing
with contraception. So Anyway, um,

881
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:11,560
this program went on but
it wasn't very successful.

882
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:14,740
And the reason was the women were
using abortion and quite happy with it.

883
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:18,730
They didn't see anything wrong with it.
They were used to it and no problems.

884
00:59:18,731 --> 00:59:22,570
So why should we change?
And so one of the things that,

885
00:59:22,571 --> 00:59:25,690
that they did and we
helped them was we got, uh,

886
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:29,360
some of these rights to life films,
which show in the glorious way,

887
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:32,900
the way you know, the foot the fetus
looks like and what an abortion is like.

888
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,520
And you really are way,

889
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:38,360
way off the deep end and ship them to
them so they could show their patients

890
00:59:38,361 --> 00:59:42,890
that you see in is not just this
sort of nothing, uh, kind of event.

891
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:46,190
The most interesting case might be Cuba,

892
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:52,190
which has, uh, one of the highest
abortion rates in the world,

893
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:57,890
78 per thousand women per year compared
to Canada, which is 15 and a half,

894
00:59:57,891 --> 00:59:58,970
for instance.
Again,

895
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:03,971
that's the two sides of the United States
and almost 60% of what they call known

896
01:00:05,181 --> 01:00:07,850
pregnancies are terminated by abortion.

897
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:11,960
So they have a long history.
Before 1938,

898
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:16,910
they were very much tied
culturally to Spain. And Spain
was very, uh, conservative.

899
01:00:16,911 --> 01:00:21,630
That was Franco, uh, era of
very, very right wing fascist,

900
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:25,760
a catholic dictatorship. And
so all in, in the Spanish law,

901
01:00:25,761 --> 01:00:30,410
all forms of abortion, uh,
induced abortion were illegal.
And Cuba just use that,

902
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,090
that same law,
uh,

903
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,440
in 30 and it was up til 1938 and 38 they
liberalized a little bit for a rape,

904
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:39,740
uh,

905
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:44,200
likelihood of death of the mother
or severe fetal malformation, uh,

906
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,193
issues.

907
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:50,120
But despite these restrictions that it
was the mechanism of birth control in

908
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:54,200
Cuba, and it was used widely by
all the social classes. Well,

909
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,900
I'll tell you an exception
to that, uh, by poor people.

910
01:00:56,901 --> 01:01:01,670
And it was used in the cities and in the
countryside. So, so abortion was, it.

911
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:04,850
Contraception starts coming in,

912
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:09,410
but it's a foreign product and it's
expensive and you need some medical

913
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:13,340
knowledge to use it. So only
the upperclass uses, uh,

914
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:17,390
contraception at this time,
used contraception in, in Cuba.

915
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:20,340
And at that time, very, very, you know,

916
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,030
a few people owned all the sugar
plantations in everyone else's,

917
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,040
basically a slave on
the sugar plantations.

918
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:29,270
So the social gulf between the rich people
are using contraception and the poor

919
01:01:29,271 --> 01:01:32,570
people using abortion was enormous
and they didn't talk to each other.

920
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:37,840
So there was no social diffusion of the
ideas of contraception so that people

921
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:43,160
just continued using contraception.
1959,

922
01:01:43,161 --> 01:01:47,120
Fidel Castro has this
revolution and he takes over.

923
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:52,340
And in the beginning he's
antiabortion and he still is.

924
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:57,380
Uh, and, and a lot of events happen that
I'm simplifying a complicated history,

925
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:01,510
but in 1962, the United States
places in the Margo on Cuba,

926
01:02:01,511 --> 01:02:03,530
including medical supplies.
And guess what?

927
01:02:03,531 --> 01:02:07,240
The Cubans can't get contraception
because the United States was there.

928
01:02:07,241 --> 01:02:11,600
Their sources supply. So abortion
gets, gets more entrenched.

929
01:02:11,870 --> 01:02:16,040
The embargo might have done the biggest
thing to raise Cuban abortion rates.

930
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:21,030
No one has good statistics on that.
So,

931
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:26,100
uh, well, abortion is legal in Cuba.
The government really wants to,

932
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,310
uh, reduce it. Castro, ninth, 1998,

933
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:33,390
the pope visited Cuba as you probably
nay remember from all the headlines.

934
01:02:33,391 --> 01:02:36,330
And he talked against abortion.
And shortly after that,

935
01:02:36,331 --> 01:02:39,780
Castro gave a seven hour
lecture worse than me,

936
01:02:40,350 --> 01:02:43,920
a seven hour lecture condemning
abortion as a method of birth control.

937
01:02:44,370 --> 01:02:48,330
And he said it was his duty as a public
figure and the revolutionary leader to

938
01:02:48,331 --> 01:02:49,830
oppose widespread abortion

939
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:55,910
but didn't have any effect on the people.
And it's very interesting. They've,

940
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:56,250
they've,

941
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,950
there's now a wonderful article in which
actually should have assigned to you,

942
01:02:59,470 --> 01:03:03,930
um,
about what's going on in Cuba,

943
01:03:03,931 --> 01:03:07,710
but you have too much
reading already. And so, uh,

944
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,430
the medical is the government in the
medical establishment want to get people

945
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:14,870
wean people off abortion.
And so in these interviews,

946
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:19,500
one of the things they ask the respondents
were women of all ages and men of all

947
01:03:19,501 --> 01:03:21,600
ages. Uh, well,

948
01:03:21,601 --> 01:03:26,250
what have you heard from doctors
and healthcare professionals? Well,

949
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:30,450
that it's dangerous that you can
die from it, but just a man that's,

950
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,830
that's what she's heard from the festival.

951
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,220
But just imagine if you had to give
birth every time you got pregnant.

952
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:40,110
I got pregnant, had an abortion when I
was 15, even though I was on the pill.

953
01:03:40,530 --> 01:03:43,470
I also got pregnant earlier
when I was using an Iud.

954
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:47,130
This is a woman who at the time of
the injury was age 30 and she had,

955
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,560
this was after her fourth abortion.

956
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:54,990
And so the people's perception is very
different than what they're hearing from

957
01:03:54,991 --> 01:03:57,780
the medical establishment and
the government establishment.

958
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:03,200
It's an absolutely an unremarkable
subject for discussion.

959
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:08,520
One male who is now age 49
said I was about 10 years.

960
01:04:08,670 --> 01:04:12,210
You know, they ask you what have you
have you do hear about abortion as it is?

961
01:04:12,211 --> 01:04:16,230
It discussed it and he says, uh, sure.

962
01:04:16,231 --> 01:04:17,700
I was about 10 years old.

963
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:21,270
I heard about abortion from people
on the street also in my house.

964
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:25,260
My mom talked about it with
their friends in front of me. Uh,

965
01:04:25,350 --> 01:04:27,990
another respondent around the streets.

966
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:31,140
Abortion is a common thing people
talk about. It's an everyday thing.

967
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:35,040
A male age 23.
Um,

968
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:39,210
do you know the, the tumor, do
you know anyone in your family?

969
01:04:39,211 --> 01:04:42,180
Among your friends who's had an
abortion? Yes. And the antique mine.

970
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:45,420
What did she tell you that you don't
feel anything that they give you the

971
01:04:45,421 --> 01:04:48,150
anesthetic and stuff.
Everything goes fine.

972
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:52,050
That was a woman of 18 who's
just had her first abortion.

973
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,870
Another responded, yes. Friends of mine.

974
01:04:54,871 --> 01:04:58,730
They told me that they had it done and
then you don't feel anything. That was uh,

975
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:03,060
a 15 when you're a 15 year old girl.
Her first abortion, another respondent.

976
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:06,840
My cousin had an abortion. She told me
that nothing out of the ordinary happened,

977
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:11,640
that everything went well. This is a
female age 21 on her second abortion? No,

978
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:15,090
the responded when I was in school,
a friend of mine had an abortion.

979
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:19,210
She was fairly young, around 13
old because we in the eighth grade.

980
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:21,610
What did she tell you?
How did it go?

981
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:25,420
She told me it went well and
set the anesthetic was fine.

982
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,580
Girls talk about that kind of stuff.

983
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:30,910
This was a 31 year old woman
on her fourth abortion.

984
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:35,650
Another respondent.
Have you heard to the question,

985
01:05:35,651 --> 01:05:39,100
have you heard much talk about
abortion? Oh yes. Among girls at school,

986
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,980
they don't use anything.
Meaning they don't use any contraceptive.

987
01:05:41,981 --> 01:05:44,050
So when they get pregnant,
they go to get an abortion.

988
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:47,530
They talk about it like it's nothing.
It's like drinking a glass of water.

989
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:51,520
Some people have problems when they
get an abortion, but most people don't.

990
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:54,040
Almost always the procedure goes fine.

991
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:57,100
That's a 17 year old girl
after her first abortion.

992
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:02,920
It's a very interesting
case because while their,

993
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:05,970
their experience, they're hearing
one thing from the government,

994
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:07,300
the same thing for the medical community.

995
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:11,320
But they know lots and lots of people
have had abortion as a common subject and

996
01:06:11,321 --> 01:06:14,860
they're not hearing about any difficulties
from an, or, very rarely are they.

997
01:06:15,850 --> 01:06:18,250
So the government pushing comes to
them and they use contraception.

998
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:23,280
What's really at 92% of the Cuban women
have used contraception at some time

999
01:06:26,110 --> 01:06:26,943
or another.

1000
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:31,270
And even among adolescent girls who
obviously having a very rich sex life,

1001
01:06:31,271 --> 01:06:34,740
cause they're getting
pregnant all the time, um, uh,

1002
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:38,050
84% have used some form of contraception,

1003
01:06:38,770 --> 01:06:42,340
but it doesn't mean anything
to them because they're
just as happy with abortion.

1004
01:06:42,341 --> 01:06:44,920
So they're not, they're not
worried about getting pregnant.

1005
01:06:44,921 --> 01:06:47,890
So they sometimes use contraception.
They sometimes don't.

1006
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:52,210
And there their reports of when they
use it, or almost totally haphazard,

1007
01:06:52,570 --> 01:06:54,640
they'll use it for a while,
they'll stop using it,

1008
01:06:54,641 --> 01:06:58,690
they'll start again and they change
methods and it doesn't even have anything.

1009
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:02,260
So of course women go through
periods and men to know when their

1010
01:07:02,261 --> 01:07:05,470
interrelationship having sex or
just having a lot of casual sex.

1011
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:07,270
And the woman will tell you this.

1012
01:07:07,570 --> 01:07:11,500
And the use of contraception did not
correlate at all with periods when the

1013
01:07:11,501 --> 01:07:15,430
women were having sex.
So just a total disconnect.

1014
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:20,850
And undoubtedly the reason is that
they're perfectly happy with abortion and

1015
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:22,270
it's a fine backup.

1016
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:27,100
So they don't have to be terribly careful
about using contraception. And in fact,

1017
01:07:27,101 --> 01:07:29,780
as much as they're hearing,
uh,

1018
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:34,300
that abortion is no big deal,
uh, they're hearing that,

1019
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:38,350
that the other forms of contraception
are really not very pleasant.

1020
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:41,500
So here's more answers
to survey questions.

1021
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:44,860
I don't like the pill because
extra hormones in a woman's body,

1022
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:49,930
a male age 19 says that woman,
and this is a woman.

1023
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:53,680
No, I don't use any IUD because
my body can't support it.

1024
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:58,150
It falls out of place. So you
have used an Iud in the past? Yes.

1025
01:07:58,151 --> 01:08:01,810
I had an Iud two different times
and both times it fell out of place.

1026
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,690
I have problems with our yards.

1027
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:06,940
That's a 37 year old woman
on her second abortion.

1028
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,410
Iud causes pain to women.

1029
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:14,860
After my first pregnancy
I had an IUD inserted,

1030
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:17,720
but I had to have it removed
because it was causing pain.

1031
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:22,220
I started having problems with my
period and a lot of inflammation.

1032
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,090
And when I had sex it was painful.
So I had the IUD removed.

1033
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:28,790
Female Age 35.
Her first abortion.

1034
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:33,010
I had an IUD before I had
her for two years. Uh,

1035
01:08:33,260 --> 01:08:36,320
but I had it removed because I
had abnormal menstrual bleeding,

1036
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:41,090
a 42 year old woman, fourth
abortion, no other woman.

1037
01:08:41,091 --> 01:08:43,610
Sometimes we'll use protection,
but the condom broke.

1038
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,400
You explained these things to
the doctors and they say that,

1039
01:08:46,401 --> 01:08:49,700
that this doesn't happen,
but I'm telling you it's not a lie.

1040
01:08:50,030 --> 01:08:54,110
Sometimes condoms are bad and they
break some 19 year old girl on, on,

1041
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:58,780
on her third abortion, 88%. Uh,

1042
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:01,940
so at the time of the survey,

1043
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:06,530
88% were practicing contraception at
the time of the survey. And again,

1044
01:09:06,531 --> 01:09:07,241
among adolescents,

1045
01:09:07,241 --> 01:09:12,241
68% were using kind of at the time
of the survey yet the contraception,

1046
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:17,180
they didn't like it, it wasn't effective
and they were apparently just as happy,

1047
01:09:17,230 --> 01:09:22,010
uh, with, with the abortion. Um,

1048
01:09:22,610 --> 01:09:23,930
so,
uh,

1049
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:27,971
so it's,
it's,

1050
01:09:27,971 --> 01:09:32,971
it's a very interesting thing and this
is repeated in basically all of the East

1051
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:35,500
European countries where again,

1052
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:39,520
they have long experience with abortion
and they don't particularly see any

1053
01:09:39,521 --> 01:09:41,350
benefit to contraception.

1054
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:46,100
Now the standard thing that you'll hear
in America from everybody, you know,

1055
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:51,010
again, independent of, of their, you know,
they can be right to life or pro choice.

1056
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:54,100
And the thing is that the idea is,

1057
01:09:54,101 --> 01:09:58,330
and I've been sort of saying that here
the idea is to replace abortion with

1058
01:09:58,331 --> 01:09:59,450
contra contraception.

1059
01:09:59,451 --> 01:10:04,300
That contraception is a better
method of birth control and abortion.

1060
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:07,990
Uh, it's a controversial, but
now it's converse. Actually,

1061
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:11,530
what started me really looking into this,
it was a number of years ago,

1062
01:10:11,531 --> 01:10:13,990
I was giving a lecture and I was
saying very overtly that, well,

1063
01:10:13,991 --> 01:10:18,850
it's progress when one country and when
contraception replaces abortion. And,

1064
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:20,650
uh, no, it's,

1065
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:25,720
it's not so obvious because I showed
you this one that the safest method is,

1066
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:30,730
uh, is uh, uh, uh, uh,

1067
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,410
condoms backed by abortion.
And it's very,

1068
01:10:35,411 --> 01:10:39,670
it was very hard to, and so one student
asked me this question about why, why is,

1069
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:43,540
why do you, why you think
that contraception is better
than abortion is a very,

1070
01:10:43,541 --> 01:10:46,240
very hard question to
answer. And I, I won't, uh,

1071
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:49,690
won't even try to do this
today. It's, it's a very,

1072
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,430
it's a very difficult kind of issue.

1073
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:56,640
So the final thing that I
should tell you is that, uh,

1074
01:10:56,980 --> 01:11:01,060
one of the things we worry about is
population growth rate. That abortion, uh,

1075
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:05,170
makes a huge difference in the
global rate of population growth.

1076
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:10,690
As I've told you, this is, you know,
ballpark 75 million increase in the world.

1077
01:11:10,691 --> 01:11:12,190
Now,
uh,

1078
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:16,950
if the abortion rate is about
somewhere between 40 and 50 million,

1079
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:21,780
that means that the rate of
world population increase
goes up by three cut by

1080
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,840
75% or something because abortion is
such a large fraction of the birth rate,

1081
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:30,990
that if that if abortion disappears
and is not replaced by contraception,

1082
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:35,670
the population growth rate goes crazy.
And so,

1083
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:38,610
uh,
in the world as it is now,

1084
01:11:38,611 --> 01:11:42,900
there's probably not any chance
of stabilizing world population,

1085
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:47,580
uh, without abortion.
So, okay. Just on time,

1086
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:51,440
uh, we will continue with
the biology of abortion and,

1087
01:11:51,441 --> 01:11:54,050
and some of the history and,

1088
01:11:54,051 --> 01:11:57,450
and philosophical considerations
in the next lecture.
