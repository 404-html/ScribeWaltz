1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:15,180
This is one family's experience in a
string says it's, it's quite different,

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,170
different people.

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,710
But what you should realize is that
this is one of 300 million such stories.

4
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:24,870
The stories may be different,
but there's 300 million of them.

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,350
That's what the Chinese government is
now saying that the one child policy has

6
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:34,680
averted 300 million births in China,
that the population,

7
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,720
instead of being 1.3 billion
now would be 1.6 billion. And

8
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,170
that 300 million people is the total
population of the United States.

9
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,570
So China has as, as they perceive
it as they claim, averted,

10
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,370
putting another United States
worth of population into the world.

11
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,230
And that's the significance of,
of spending two full lectures on China.

12
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:03,030
And we could of course spend a lot more,

13
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,290
is that China's just so big that
everything that happens there has these

14
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:08,400
tremendous,
uh,

15
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,990
significances both on an
individual personal level
for each individual or family

16
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:16,080
that experiences it could
also on the global level,

17
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,690
one out of every five human beings
lives in China. So it is very big.

18
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,243
Um,

19
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,500
we'll talk in a later lecture
explicitly about the one child policy.

20
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:31,740
But there's information I have to give
you today to understand what it's about.

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,620
But let me just say now that the
Chinese government has of course,

22
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:39,621
well aware of the human and human rights
sacrifices of the individual people

23
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,060
and, but they argued that the
benefits outweigh the suffering.

24
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,300
And so just to give you a little hint of,

25
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:50,960
of the way the government
thinks about it and,

26
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:55,961
and many other people in China that the
great economic boom that China has had a

27
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,370
most economists now around
the world are attributed, uh,

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,760
the kickoff of that to the reduction
in fertility that they don't,

29
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,360
they didn't have to cope with so many
children and that's the cause of their

30
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:12,090
economy taking off. So, uh,

31
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:16,500
they perceive that the one child policy
has allowed China to merge from this,

32
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,310
you know, grinding poverty that they
were in and become a modern, uh,

33
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,420
we start to become a modern nation
in the world. Another story,

34
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,510
another data set that I just recently
came across was had to do with carbon

35
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:34,380
emissions that uh,
three at at,

36
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:36,900
at a world average of,
of carbon usage,

37
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:40,230
which is probably below
what China's actually using,

38
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,180
a 300 extra million people
would have produced 1.5 billion.

39
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,990
That's billion with a B billion
tons of co two each year.

40
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,190
And that's more than the total CO2
production of an industrial giant like

41
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:57,630
Germany. So if you're looking at this
issue from an environmental point of view,

42
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,990
the reduction of people there, their
environmental impact, it makes again,

43
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,550
a huge difference. And uh,
the Chinese for instance,

44
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:09,670
feel that because of the
one child policy alone,

45
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,040
they have done more than any other
country to ameliorate the environmental

46
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:19,690
crisis. Okay. That's just
a hint of very difficult,

47
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,720
uh, things. How do you weigh, uh, the,

48
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,270
the story of a family and
300 million families like,

49
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,680
like you've just heard against
the sort of macro issues and it,

50
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:31,540
it is not easy.

51
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,640
So the question I want to set up today,

52
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,070
which is to go backwards,
is

53
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,420
this kind of policy happens only in China.

54
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:48,170
This kind of enormous population
as the Chinese proceeded,

55
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,140
overpopulation happens in China really?

56
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,660
And in India in terms of massive stuff.
And we've,

57
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:56,380
we've talked a little
about India and South Asia,

58
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,980
but the question is what's
special about China?

59
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:04,540
Why did this happen in China? Why did, uh,

60
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,500
as they perceive it,

61
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:09,910
population got so out of control that
the government felt that they had to

62
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:13,950
introduce such a draconian policy
is there's such a stringent, uh,

63
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,100
kind of policy.

64
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,880
And the flip side of that coin
is why has China just now,

65
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,580
uh,
digging out from the abject poverty that,

66
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:28,210
that the people were in when a Europe
and America dug out 200 years ago?

67
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,400
England started, but all
of Europe and America, uh,

68
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,720
went through this phase 200
years ago. And, and why,

69
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,520
why not China? Of course,
this is a, is a very,

70
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:46,960
very hotly contested
issue among historians.

71
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,680
And the basic setup of the story is that
in about 1800 when morphis was writing,

72
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,280
uh, China was very powerful, very strong,

73
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,230
very rich country and,

74
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,060
and the West was,
was beginning to be that way.

75
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:06,460
The industrial revolution
with just starting in England.

76
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,500
And you would have seen
enormous differences between
China and say England or

77
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,460
Europe in 1800,

78
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,500
but you would not have been able to
predict which model was going to take over

79
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:20,500
the world, which country was going to
become bigger and stronger in the future.

80
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,420
China was a very impressive plus
impressive place in 1800 and Europe was

81
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:28,150
beginning to be a very
impressive place in 1800.

82
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,730
And then I may go into a little bit the
history a little bit more, but by 1840,

83
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,170
when the British invaded,
uh, with the Opium War, uh,

84
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,110
the British started to Dick,

85
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:43,780
the Chinese to opium and the
Chinese government said, no,

86
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,420
the British tried free
trade and invaded to,

87
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:51,070
to force China to accept a British opium,

88
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,420
which they got a India. Okay,
that's a separate story,

89
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:58,900
which we may or may not
have have time for. Oh.

90
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,270
But then so in a very
short period of time,

91
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:07,340
China goes from being one of the dominant
countries in the world to being sort

92
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:11,510
of, uh, the porn in the world that the,
that the British start colonizing it, the,

93
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:14,150
the German start colonizing it,
the Americans take advantage.

94
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,970
Everybody starts taking
advantage of China,

95
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,270
starts the colonization of China and
starts the dismembering of China.

96
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,920
And why did this happen is one of the
major issues in, in world history.

97
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,330
And there's many,
many different points of view on this.

98
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:35,300
There's 10 major theories or something.
Uh,

99
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,850
and in this class I just have
to unwind one thread, uh, uh,

100
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,220
one version of the story and
only one thread of that story.

101
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,310
And that's the relationship
between the population of China,

102
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:49,430
the wealth of China and
the poverty of China.

103
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,990
This particular thread about population
was obvious to Europeans visiting China,

104
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,050
even in the European Middle Ages.
And you know,

105
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:05,051
Marco Polo visited China in the 12
hundreds and he described China's

106
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:08,930
cultivation, how every little bit
of land was under very intense, uh,

107
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,960
cultivation already a popular snus that
the population was already incredibly

108
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:17,750
dense as viewed through European eyes of,
of,

109
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,920
of the same time and Indus Industry.
The people work very hard and we're,

110
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:26,840
whatever they did, they were very
productive at it. So, and he, you know,

111
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,400
they're the stories of Kubler con and all
that were from Marco Polo that he sort

112
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:36,170
of idolized China as this
incredibly rich, uh, but very,

113
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:40,940
very crowded place.
Adam Smith in the 17th century,

114
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:45,740
the guy who started modern economics
said China has long been one of the

115
00:07:45,741 --> 00:07:47,690
richest,
most fertile,

116
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,700
best cultivated and most industrious and
most populous countries in the world.

117
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,930
So Adam Smith was aware of it and
all of these great scholars of,

118
00:07:57,931 --> 00:08:02,240
of the, of the lady 17 hundreds were
looking around the world. Funny.

119
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:04,190
There was enough,
a seafaring us,

120
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:07,490
they could go around the world and
compare different things and try to figure

121
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:09,600
out what was the best system
for people to live under.

122
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:14,601
A few years after Adam Smith Maltus
writes and he quotes the information that

123
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:19,430
Europeans were getting were mostly from
Jesuit priests who had gone over to

124
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:22,160
China to try to convert the population.

125
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,930
And he quotes one a rather
well known a Jesuit priest.

126
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:31,931
Then China is code the richest and
most flourishing empire in the world.

127
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,530
But the priest goes on because
of Oprah overpopulation,

128
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,240
the people are the poorest
and most miserable of all.

129
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,460
And so right from way,

130
00:08:43,461 --> 00:08:46,700
way back people that where they're trying
to was basically very rich country.

131
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,340
But because of the huge population,

132
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:54,110
the individual families were
often in abject poverty.
Well, if you looked at the,

133
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:56,250
at the emperor and the,
and the nobles,

134
00:08:56,251 --> 00:08:59,910
of course they had enormous wealth.

135
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,550
These early observers were
certainly correct, uh,

136
00:09:04,551 --> 00:09:06,390
about the population issue there.

137
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,720
So we have data from say 1750 and China
had 500 people per cultivated a square

138
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,260
kilometer.
At the same time.

139
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:20,190
Europe had about 70 people
for the square kilometer.

140
00:09:20,191 --> 00:09:25,191
So China had to on the same farm land how
to support seven times as many people.

141
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,550
And of course numbers from 1750.
Uh,

142
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,590
don't take that as any kind of
an exact number up to today.

143
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,610
China has something like 20% of the
world's population because the one child

144
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:42,190
policy, the ratio was higher.
They had more than 20%. Uh,

145
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,600
but now it's down to about 20%
because India is still coming up.

146
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:48,810
A lot of the world is still coming up in
China. Population is still increasing,

147
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:51,720
but increasing at a,
at a rather slow rate.

148
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,860
It has now 20% of the world's population,

149
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,390
but only six to 7% of the arable land,

150
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,400
the farmable land in the world,

151
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:08,120
the amount of farm land per
person is 0.2 acres, uh,

152
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,270
per person 10 times less
than the United States has.

153
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,620
So there's a real problem,
uh, with China's population.

154
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,310
And the question is why,
why,

155
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,400
why did China's population press up
against the resources and riches of,

156
00:10:24,401 --> 00:10:27,180
of the land?
So much more so than in,

157
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:31,410
say Europe for most of history.

158
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,450
Uh, China's, uh,

159
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,130
population does not
look terribly different.

160
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,950
Hang on. Anyway, you can, you can
see this, that in the Han dynasty,

161
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,080
which was the first unifying dynasty

162
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,360
of China, very much the same
time as the Roman empire,

163
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,510
it had a population of 50,
60 million.

164
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,630
Then according to this reconstruction
of China's history and all of these

165
00:11:06,631 --> 00:11:09,050
reconstructions were very iffy.
Uh,

166
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,510
you notice population stays
stable for a thousand years.

167
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,280
Then during the Song Dynasty,

168
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:19,310
which is one of the very most important
dynasties and try very successful

169
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,830
population rises and then
it falls back down again.

170
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,480
The one which is the Mongol invasions.
This,

171
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:30,210
this decline that probably is very much
characterized by the Mongol invasions.

172
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,440
The particular dates here are dates
when we have censuses in the various

173
00:11:34,441 --> 00:11:36,420
emperors took census as an in between.

174
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:40,920
You really don't know what's happening
and you're also not sure how complete

175
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:45,570
these censuses are. But anyway, the
Mongol invasion then stays constant.

176
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,260
And then some time in this period,
uh,

177
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,810
probably there's no census really.

178
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:56,170
They don't have any data between 1,417 50.

179
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,620
So this curve in here
is kind of guesswork,

180
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,160
but sometime in the 17 hundreds,
as in Europe,

181
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:08,430
the population takes off something
like this doesn't look wildly,

182
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,160
uh, in shape, in magnitude.
It's different, but in shape,

183
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:16,780
it doesn't look very
different than Europe. Uh,

184
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,580
the third,
uh,

185
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:24,300
in the Han dynasty 60 million
Chinese 1400 years later in 1,393,

186
00:12:24,971 --> 00:12:27,820
they kind of 60 and a
half million of people,

187
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:32,380
and in between the population
went as low as 37 million.

188
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,480
And then as I said,

189
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:39,481
the Mongol invasions decimated
the population and then
just before the European

190
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:43,780
black death, but a decimation in the
same sense as the European black death.

191
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,930
And then it took a long time
per China's population, uh,

192
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,680
to come back up by the
beginning of the Ming Dynasty,

193
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:54,190
one of the also very flourishing
periods in Chinese history.

194
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:58,390
China had maybe 75 million people
up from up from 60 million,

195
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,370
and then it starts doubling in the
next 200 years. It doubles, uh,

196
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,170
and continues on up
as in Europe,

197
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:11,980
there were major epidemics in the 1640s,
uh,

198
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,560
there was some major epidemic
that we can like him to play,

199
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,400
but people really don't know
what kind of a of a disease.

200
00:13:18,401 --> 00:13:22,000
It was an a Chinese scholar wrote in 1642,

201
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,780
the pestilence, you don't know
what the pestilence arose. Again,

202
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:30,781
on a large scale effecting eight or nine
of every 10 households in a household

203
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:37,330
of 10 or 20 people, all would be
afflicted and often all would die.

204
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:42,280
At first, the bodies were buried
in coffins and next in grasses.

205
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,430
But finally they were just left in the
places where they died in one big city in

206
00:13:47,651 --> 00:13:50,260
1643,
there were few suits.

207
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,870
There was basically no signs
of human life in the streets.

208
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:57,040
Only the buzzing of flies broke
the silence. Those are quotes from,

209
00:13:57,041 --> 00:14:01,150
from Chinese observers.
Very interesting.

210
00:14:01,151 --> 00:14:03,640
It was at this time and in the 1640s,

211
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:06,910
that the Chinese having
experienced this massive disease,

212
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,380
developed a new theater, new medical
theory of disease and epidemic spaced on.

213
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:13,080
She knew all her cheat,

214
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:18,090
which is supposedly sort of the life
force that's involved in acupuncture and

215
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:18,934
everything.

216
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,940
And their view was that there was this
sort of non material substance force,

217
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:29,971
kind of like Phlogiston in the
west and it had to be in balance.

218
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,200
And when the CI on Heaven and Earth there
was CI and heaven and she on Earth got

219
00:14:35,201 --> 00:14:36,580
disrupted,
uh,

220
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,080
then playing and then chaos broke out
on earth and people started dying of

221
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:43,900
various diseases. And of course, you know,

222
00:14:43,901 --> 00:14:48,490
Americans have recently become wildly
infatuated with Chinese medicine and,

223
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:52,370
and the, the chief theory of
things and acupuncture. And uh,

224
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:57,320
we can talk a lot about that
privately if you wish. But, uh,

225
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,920
the point of that did not help the
Chinese at all. You can see the birth,

226
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,310
the medical statistics as again,
as far as we have them.

227
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,850
And up until recent times from
the practice of acupuncture,

228
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:12,750
you don't see any form of disease lessened
at all. And the only thing you see in,

229
00:15:12,751 --> 00:15:13,371
in China,

230
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:17,240
and Japan also is a tremendous rise in
hepatitis because of the transmission

231
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:20,660
from the needles because they didn't
understand anything about sterilization.

232
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,211
Okay.

233
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:27,980
And then these plagues caused enormous
political changes just just as in Europe.

234
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,800
So the, the Ming Dynasty, for instance,

235
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,930
fell possibly as a result of the
depopulation and chaos of the,

236
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,501
of the plague.

237
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:40,550
And that allowed the Mongols to come in
and set up their own dynasty. I'm sorry,

238
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:44,060
the, uh, uh, the Manchu for Manchuria,

239
00:15:44,061 --> 00:15:47,180
the Manchu to come in and
set up the Ching Dynasty.

240
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,690
And similarly, uh, to Europe, uh,

241
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,930
after one of these decimation
of the population, uh,

242
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:59,780
good land became available and people
moved into the good land and they had a,

243
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,680
a blossoming of, of, of
wealth and culture for the,

244
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:04,910
even for the peasants.

245
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,600
And it's a cycle not very different
than what morphous talked about,

246
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:12,470
balancing the relationship between the
number of people and the amount of land

247
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,460
available
throughout this whole period.

248
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:20,110
A life expectancy was very poor.
Uh,

249
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,860
we have scattered statistics.

250
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:26,630
So a village in the 1790s showed that
one third of male children died in their

251
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:30,800
first year of life and half of them
died before they were, they were 20.

252
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,080
And the female situation was comparable,

253
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:35,330
but probably worse because of infanticide.

254
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:39,740
So they're probably counting only
those that got through the period of

255
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:43,620
infanticide. Life expectancy was 32, uh,

256
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,050
in this particular village,

257
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,430
and only 4% of the
population lived past 65.

258
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,870
And again, it's not terribly different
than what we saw in the statistic. The,

259
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,670
the graph for CIS Alpine goal.

260
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,360
We're about a third of the of the
women are dead before they start their

261
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:00,650
reproductive life.

262
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:08,460
But when the main came to power, uh, um,

263
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,250
there was still land, uh, unoccupied
land available. As Martha said,

264
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:17,560
the best land was already
used for agriculture, but
there was less good land, uh,

265
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,870
still available. And under
the main, the population grew.

266
00:17:20,871 --> 00:17:25,550
We're talking 16 hundreds into
17 hundreds. Uh, the main, uh,

267
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,290
uh, I'm sorry, the ends
and the 1650 or so. Um,

268
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,000
and the population grew,
what the people do,

269
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:37,001
they moved onto the marginal land and
that meant higher into the mountains on

270
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:42,020
steeper trying to farm on steeper slopes.
They cleared forested areas,

271
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:44,390
they moved into dry areas.

272
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,410
And the result of all this was enormous
soil erosion that especially the

273
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:51,420
mountain sides and the dry areas,

274
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,470
the productivity dropped because
this land is just not good.

275
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,780
And the erosion, the forest couldn't hold
the water anymore. The period of China,

276
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,630
China has always had floods.
It's a big part of Chinese history,

277
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,310
but these really massive,

278
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:09,390
massive uncontrollable floods date
from this period where the people,

279
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,990
the population increased and people
started going into areas where, uh,

280
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,920
it's ecologically very unstable,
cutting down the forests.

281
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:20,400
And then when it rains you
get these enormous floods.

282
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,280
And also the floods, not
only uh, uh, there was the,

283
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,630
but they devastated the
agriculture in the low lands.

284
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:32,880
So you not only had a poorer agriculture
per capita in the high lands,

285
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:38,180
but you also reduce the per capita
of farming in the low lands.

286
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,940
Again, population growth, uh,

287
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,760
can, can make it difficult
for everybody. So again, like,

288
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,110
like Europe, like Africa, uh,

289
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,180
American foods when they were discovered
when into China, because they, as I said,

290
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:58,980
have something like twice to kill caloric
content of, of anything except rice.

291
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,750
If you can grow rice, rice is as good
as potatoes are just about as as good.

292
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,150
And so China picked up a sweet potatoes,
especially peanuts, especially,

293
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:13,710
uh, some white potatoes and
they doubled food production.

294
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:18,150
And guess what happened? The
population doubled. So again,

295
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:22,080
the introduction of these foods and the
tremendous improvement in agriculture

296
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,360
didn't help, uh, the per capita eating
the per capita amount of food, uh,

297
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,920
for individuals.
And the,

298
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,470
during the same period as
people increased, uh, one
farmer could grow more land,

299
00:19:37,471 --> 00:19:40,560
but the people that could eat
needed more land for themselves.

300
00:19:40,561 --> 00:19:42,420
So they moved again out.

301
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:47,460
And the land under cultivation
increased by a factor of 4.5 times.

302
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,560
But, but again, uh, during this sort
of second round of population growth,

303
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,520
one is after the,
uh,

304
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,040
when the main takeover in one is
after American foods are introduced.

305
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,110
Um, the erosion becomes extreme
and it's so extreme that by 1978,

306
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,980
about one,
uh,

307
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:11,060
one third of all arable land in China
had to be abandoned because of erosion.

308
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,030
So it's an, it's an enormous
problem in, in China.

309
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,150
And so this is really trying
to experience small cysts,

310
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,120
what I call my office with
a vengeance. So this is, um,

311
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,420
the, uh, cultivated only
still didn't find it.

312
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,750
Oh, there it is. There
it is. Okay. So, uh,

313
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:39,120
this is cultivated land
and you can see that here.

314
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,620
1700 sold.
Basically,

315
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:44,760
American foods come in and you can plant
stuff everywhere and the amount of land

316
00:20:44,761 --> 00:20:48,860
under cultivation goes up like
crazy. Some of this decline is, is,

317
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:50,710
is very recent as industrialization,

318
00:20:50,711 --> 00:20:53,770
cities growing and some
of it is you erosion.

319
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:58,030
So the land thing looks like an
enormous increase in the amount of land

320
00:20:58,031 --> 00:21:01,510
available for farming.
But here is the per capita amount of land,

321
00:21:01,511 --> 00:21:04,930
the cultivated land,
heck terrace per capita where this is,

322
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,440
this is simple hectares. And, uh, it, it,

323
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,780
it grows then it,

324
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,890
then it crashes probably again to do
with the Mongol invasions are just fewer

325
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:18,670
people. Uh, I'm sorry, I've gone
probably have this backwards rises here.

326
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,230
The land per, uh, per capita because
you just get rid of the people.

327
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,960
And then in the modern population growth,

328
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:31,060
the land per capita just just
crashes down and now it's,

329
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:33,220
this is 0.2 hectares.

330
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:36,700
Now we're 0.1 hectare per person,

331
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,440
which is like a quarter of an acre,

332
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,090
very small amount of land per person.

333
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,880
And of course the Chinese realize
this as well as anybody. And uh,

334
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,770
it was in a matter of official concern
during the Ming and the Ching dynasties.

335
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,100
And in 1790 just before Malthus wrote
a Chinese scholar and high government

336
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:02,590
official a hung a young g,

337
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:06,850
he started warning the Chinese about the
difficulties that unchecked population

338
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:11,110
growth would cause as an outrage.
Chinese productive capacity.

339
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,580
That's the way he phrased it.

340
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,760
So it's clear that the original
understanding of of China,

341
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,780
that its population was pressing really
severely against it. It's resources, uh,

342
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,970
was accurate,

343
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:30,150
but it still doesn't explain why was it
in China that you got these incredibly

344
00:22:30,191 --> 00:22:31,120
dense populations.

345
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,710
Why didn't that happen elsewhere
saying China or England.

346
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,900
And so what, what jumps to your mind?
Probably at a very high fertility.

347
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,590
They had no in,
in,

348
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,640
in England we talked about the late
marriage system and everything,

349
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:50,641
which kept fertility down on Americans
generally have the image in western

350
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:55,470
history only have the image of uh,
the Chinese, uh, reproduce, uh,

351
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,010
have a lot of children all the time.
It's like your grandparents or something.

352
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,730
So in this makes good sense.
In the Chinese culture,

353
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,650
the principal goal of life was to produce
sons as you've heard over and over

354
00:23:08,651 --> 00:23:13,450
again. And uh, this origin of
ancestor worship I think is,

355
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:18,280
as you just said, goes back at least
the second and third millennium BC.

356
00:23:18,281 --> 00:23:21,100
So 5,000 years. What Ching said is, is,

357
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,210
is the scholarly number.
And uh,

358
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,940
they did all kinds of things to get us
on adoption was very, very calm, calm.

359
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,330
And you'll read about that in the
reading if you haven't already.

360
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:34,360
James Lee talks about very
high rates of adoption.

361
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,620
People who didn't have a
son would get an adoption.

362
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:42,040
And the filial piety that
they had a confusion system,

363
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:45,860
which I'll talk about in a
moment where you know, the older,

364
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,320
the younger brothers for instance,

365
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:51,890
had to pay absolute obedience to the
older brothers and they all had to pay up

366
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:53,090
through the obedience to the father.

367
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,230
So if a younger brother had a son and
the older brother didn't do younger

368
00:23:57,231 --> 00:24:01,610
brother had to give that son, uh, to
the older brother, my modern times,

369
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,430
that was the same situation and chinks
on the, of course, that confusion,

370
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:07,760
that strict Confucian thing
doesn't exist anymore.

371
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:10,760
But in the old days it would
always be the younger sons,

372
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,620
no matter what the biological story was.

373
00:24:12,621 --> 00:24:16,970
It would always be the younger sons
that did not have, uh, a male children.

374
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,510
And so in China, everyone
was expected to marry, uh,

375
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:28,070
and, and, uh, they married very young
in order to secure a bride. Because,

376
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:32,960
as I mentioned to you, I
think with respect to the
little sex selective abortion,

377
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,370
traditionally China has always done
away with 10 to 25% of its females.

378
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,290
So there was always, not always,
but as much as we have data, um,

379
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,070
and so there's always been an excess
of males and, and a lot of, you know,

380
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,840
they can't get married.
Uh,

381
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,940
so they did all kinds of things
to secure a bride for, for a son.

382
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,040
And that included getting patrolled very,
very young and,

383
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,800
and starting reproduction
as soon as puberty allowed.

384
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,823
Um,

385
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:08,210
and it was made worse by the fact that
it was quite acceptable for males to take

386
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:12,050
second wise or third wives or
fourth wives down into concubines.

387
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:17,051
And every time one male had more than
one wife than some other nail and got no

388
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:21,530
wife at all.
Okay.

389
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:25,430
So let's look, so one of the
possibilities is the obvious one is,

390
00:25:25,431 --> 00:25:29,300
is trying to have very high fertility
and we'll see if that's true.

391
00:25:29,301 --> 00:25:32,900
So here's a bunch of of data.
And what this is,

392
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,030
is the age of,

393
00:25:35,031 --> 00:25:40,031
of the woman and they don't have much
reproduction beyond age 40 in the sample

394
00:25:41,241 --> 00:25:46,070
of though modernly we would have the age
of the woman and what her rate is per

395
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,120
uh, I guess per thousand
uh, uh, uh, women.

396
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,920
And you can see,

397
00:25:51,921 --> 00:25:56,570
so women start out at age 20 with a very
high rate and all these curves with a

398
00:25:56,571 --> 00:26:00,990
high rate of reproduction, it either
goes down a little bit by age 25 or,

399
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,310
or sometimes in some places it
increases a little bit by age 25.

400
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:08,450
And then as a woman gets older,
a fertility drops off.

401
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:13,310
There's fewer and fewer children per
year at 40 year olds just have fewer

402
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:16,520
children than 20 or 25 year olds.
That's a very obvious kind of thing.

403
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,140
Now these are two different
sets of pop thing.

404
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,960
This is date their data from one area of
the world data from another area of the

405
00:26:23,961 --> 00:26:27,310
world. One area is cha, all of the data,

406
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,120
China with one line from Japan.

407
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,340
And the other set of data is a Europe,
various European countries.

408
00:26:34,341 --> 00:26:35,630
And guess which is which

409
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:41,110
some hands,
the big difference and fertility.

410
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,943
Yeah.

411
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,790
You think John is the one at the bottom?

412
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:04,070
That's right. That's the lead
article. So in the lecture where one,

413
00:27:04,071 --> 00:27:07,580
one lecture behind us,
as you've probably realized already,

414
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:11,990
and so the reading that you
should do tonight actually
gave away the answer. Yes.

415
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:14,090
This is the European population.

416
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,160
This is the Chinese population so that
the Chinese once married within marriage

417
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:23,870
and both places extra marital fertility
is not a big deal. So this is,

418
00:27:23,871 --> 00:27:26,870
you can take this as general repression.
But within marriage,

419
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:32,080
the Europeans had a much higher rate of
child bearing than the Chinese didn't.

420
00:27:32,511 --> 00:27:32,841
In fact,

421
00:27:32,841 --> 00:27:37,841
it's almost a factor of two
from 200 to 300 to 400 to 500,

422
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,300
that it was a lot. Uh, uh, the Europeans,

423
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,520
once married one's having access to,

424
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,930
to sex really had children
uncontrollably as, as, as one says,

425
00:27:47,931 --> 00:27:51,620
where's the Chinese were doing
something, uh, to control, uh,

426
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:56,840
their, their births. And that was
a shocker when this data came out.

427
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,440
And it's fairly recent data because the
presumption from at least small offices

428
00:28:00,441 --> 00:28:03,380
time was that, you know, the
Chinese just reproduced like,

429
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:08,060
like like flies or something and that the
Europeans had this wonderful restraint

430
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:12,710
and it turns out that's just the
opposite of what is what is true.

431
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,680
And it's,

432
00:28:15,681 --> 00:28:20,681
and it's very surprising given the
cultural emphasis on reproduction by the

433
00:28:21,441 --> 00:28:25,460
Chinese. So one of the big
issues now under discussion is

434
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:31,490
whether this is a sign that the Chinese
were consciously doing some kind of

435
00:28:31,491 --> 00:28:32,060
birth control.

436
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,900
They were consciously trying to limit
their families or whether it was one of

437
00:28:35,901 --> 00:28:39,680
these cultural things where the culture
in some sense stumbles onto a practice

438
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,280
and it makes that cultural successful
even though the people have no idea what

439
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:44,900
the purpose of of it is.

440
00:28:44,901 --> 00:28:49,901
It may just be as sort of
an as an artifact of culture
and they will think the,

441
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,080
the, the population will think
this is due to their, uh,

442
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,770
their following God's rules
or the proper decorum or,

443
00:28:56,771 --> 00:28:58,510
or various cultural reasons.

444
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:02,180
They will give a cultural reasons why
they have few children and not understand

445
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:05,300
that that's what makes
the whole society survive.

446
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,990
And James Lee, who is, uh, definitely the,

447
00:29:10,991 --> 00:29:14,710
the world's foremost
demographer of China are,

448
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:19,190
he has no doubt, even though the data
is not as solid as one would like,

449
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,720
here's no doubt that it was
infrequent sexual activity, uh,

450
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:26,300
that led to the low of birth
rate as a cultural thing,

451
00:29:26,301 --> 00:29:30,720
not as a conscious way of,
of, of, of reducing, uh,

452
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,750
fertility. And he describes
a story where, uh,

453
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,890
a young couple gets
married and they're in the,

454
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,570
what we perceive as the height of,

455
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:43,630
of sexual desire and what their sleeping
arrangements are. They have, uh,

456
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,570
there's a double decker bed and the two,
there's married,

457
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:50,590
the young married couple of sleeps above
and the grandmother is in the bed below

458
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:55,060
and the grandmother has it, carries
her cane to bed and we never upstairs,

459
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:59,140
she started hears things starting to
go on, Bang, Bang, Bang, cut it out.

460
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:05,370
And so that kind of thing that the
old people didn't go along with this.

461
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:10,300
And the reason for this, I mean
as, as as the Chinese would see it,

462
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:14,620
is that the confusion Etha ethic,
they don't have, it's not right.

463
00:30:14,621 --> 00:30:17,890
It's not a religious thing
and all. There's no, no
sense of a deity or anything,

464
00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:23,080
anything supernatural going
on. But personal relationships
are what's important.

465
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:27,790
The sub and their set of unequal,
a personal relationship,

466
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:31,750
a subject has to give absolute
deference to the ruler is the emperor.

467
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,160
A children have to give absolute
deference to the parents and to elders.

468
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:40,230
Women have to give absolute deference
first to her brothers and that her

469
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:43,170
husband's women to men.
Uh,

470
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,360
younger brothers have to give absolute
deference to their older brothers and of

471
00:30:48,551 --> 00:30:52,750
these, the only relationship that's
equal his friend, friend relationship.

472
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,690
That's the fifth relationship.
So you can be buddies with your friend,

473
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,250
but you must be superior to wife.
New Wife must be inferior to you.

474
00:31:00,251 --> 00:31:02,680
And so you cannot be friends with them.

475
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,430
Love or passion between the married
couple. Not only didn't happen,

476
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:10,240
it was not approved of. It was like be
you're being bad. If you love your wife,

477
00:31:10,241 --> 00:31:13,810
if you have passion for why
that an a not a good thing.

478
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:19,200
And so husband and wife did not relate
to each other as lovers or even as

479
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:23,370
friends. And there's a very
famous Chinese story, uh,

480
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,410
where a young man had been married some
years is walking with a friend with a

481
00:31:29,231 --> 00:31:32,950
mail from another male friend with
whom he can be fun and converse.

482
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:38,020
And he's bemoaning his fate that
here he loves his wife. So extremely,

483
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:43,030
but he can't have a, uh, he can't
express his love for her to her.

484
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,300
He can't have walks in the moonlight
like he's having with his male friend.

485
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:51,250
He can't have this kind of a chat with
her because that is against the morality

486
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:55,540
and ethics, uh, of the, of the system. So,

487
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,900
uh,
these cultural things,

488
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:03,820
which I think no Chinese of
the time would describe as, oh,

489
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:08,850
that's the way we keep our population
down or what is the explanation for this

490
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:14,270
rather than, uh, some kind of, uh, uh,

491
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,660
of conscious effort.
Also,

492
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:21,661
another factor that is not a conscious
sort of thing is the Chinese married

493
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:25,780
younger than Europeans. So when
you do an age adjusted thing by 20,

494
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:29,470
they had been married for several years
and is what's called the boredom factor

495
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,200
going on now. And no matter
what age, couple of Marriott,

496
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,560
they have sex a lot in the beginning.
And so they,

497
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:37,380
if they're not protecting themselves,
they have a,

498
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,410
a high birth rate and then it falls down.

499
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:44,360
And some fraction of this difference
here may just be to due to the age of

500
00:32:44,361 --> 00:32:45,200
marriage.
Yeah.

501
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,690
Yeah. So we're going to get to that. Uh,

502
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,910
actually we may not get to it till
next time, but that's still, again,

503
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:00,870
we're pushing out. We still haven't
explained why the population, uh,

504
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,520
is more dense and it's getting time.

505
00:33:04,521 --> 00:33:09,130
Let me just finish saying something
about this. 10 to 25%, uh,

506
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,630
getting rid of the females,
which again would reduce the population,

507
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:16,100
would lead you to not think there
was a such a density, uh, in the,

508
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:20,330
in the 17th century. Uh, again, this
is from Jesuit missionaries to China,

509
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:25,700
uh, reporting back to Europe. They were
horrified to find that in Beijing alone,

510
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,030
taking it at the time,
several thousand babies,

511
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:34,090
almost exclusively females were thrown
into the streets like refuse to be

512
00:33:34,281 --> 00:33:39,110
collected each morning by carriers who
dumped them into huge pits outside the

513
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:41,660
city.
And it sounds very much like,

514
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,480
like Europe of of a similar time.

515
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:50,140
And what's interesting is that right
now China is approaching pretty much the

516
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:54,080
same female with their
sex selective in fancy,

517
00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:59,000
pretty much the same female deficits
that's been as far as we can tell,

518
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:00,800
the traditional, uh, level of it.

519
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:04,130
But now there's all this moaning
and groaning about, you know,

520
00:34:04,131 --> 00:34:09,020
all these unmarried males and how it will
utterly disrupt Chinese society. And,

521
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,020
and you know, it's a horrible
sort of thing. And also,

522
00:34:12,021 --> 00:34:15,650
I think I mentioned this before, as you've
seen in Europe, we're rather than, uh,

523
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:20,090
10 to 25% of the males not being able to
get married because of Devs, a females,

524
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,010
40, 50, 60% of the males did
not get married in Europe.

525
00:34:25,011 --> 00:34:28,880
I showed you the graphs of that
when we discuss, uh, Europe.

526
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:35,840
So the Chinese, uh, system, uh,
fertility system, which, which,

527
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:40,400
uh, keeps their population manageable,
not, it's not small, but manageable,

528
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:45,560
uh, is, uh, moderately
early, not extremely early,

529
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:49,940
moderately early, a nearly universal
marriage of surviving females. Uh,

530
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:51,680
in 1998 for the prince,

531
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:55,490
only 1% of Chinese women
were unmarried by age 30,

532
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:00,470
whereas in the West in that year,
15% are unmarried, 15 times as much,

533
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:04,190
uh,
even by age 14 in the West.

534
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:10,330
And so the European system was that only
about half of everybody got married.

535
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,830
Uh, but once, uh, once married,

536
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:20,330
they had births at about twice
the rate of Chinese. In Chinese,

537
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:22,340
all the women got married,

538
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,630
but within marriage they
had a low rate of fertility.

539
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:30,680
So you have to cut your
fertility down by half,

540
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,350
either by the European thing of,

541
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:37,351
of less than complete marriage or by the
Chinese thing of less than complete a

542
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:42,260
fertility. So it looks like, uh, that, uh,

543
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:46,790
pop fertility there. The total fertility
rates should be more or less the same,

544
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:50,460
the same between China and,
and Europe,

545
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,720
but by essentially opposite
kinds of fertility systems.

546
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,210
And we'll see. I'm sorry. Next
time we'll continue and we'll see.

547
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,280
What is one of the theories for why
China got into the, the difficulties.

548
00:36:05,281 --> 00:36:07,500
It was not just uncontrolled reproduction.
