1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:05,290
Now I have, I do, I must tell you
that I have very bad news for you.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:07,571
Oh God.

3
00:00:07,571 --> 00:00:12,430
She said it has nothing to do with the
exams that I've been talking with my

4
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:13,870
economist friends.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,670
And what they tell me is
that you are inferior goods

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,300
and they even tell me that Yale students
are probably among the most inferior of

7
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:28,540
all goods. So of course, you know,

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,110
put on my naive face and said,
what are you talking about?

9
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,840
And this is what I
learned. So you take, ah,

10
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:39,460
I hope I've learned to bring my

11
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,173
yes,
good.

12
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,930
This is standard economic kind of diagram.

13
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,410
And what it shows is the amount of
clothing that an individual buys and if

14
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:03,390
they're very poor,

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:07,830
they buy at the Salvation Army store
and they spend very little bit, or they,

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,030
they buy very few clothing
when they get rich. Oh,

17
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:15,240
they go to Brooks brothers and
buy suits for thousand dollars.

18
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,170
And that's probably an underestimate
of what they actually spend.

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,360
And so as their income increases,

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,070
the amount that they spend with a number
of things that they buy increases all

21
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,500
very standard kind of thing.

22
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,980
The ratio,
there's an extra little Phillip to this,

23
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,070
not wildly important for this course
is how much this line increases.

24
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,360
Uh, and for a particular change in
income is called the elasticity.

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,970
How,
how big a change there is.

26
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,620
And in clothing you really don't need
an awful lot of clothing had to go on.

27
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,030
Uh, so, but you can, you
know, spend a lot on it.

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,330
And I know myself that when
I was a graduate student,

29
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:05,070
I used to buy all my clothing at the
goodwill store and now that I'm professor

30
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:08,760
of a little more income and they don't
buy so much of the goodwill store,

31
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,570
but it's still a great place to my things.
And I see the other graduate,

32
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,140
the graduate students know exactly
what I'm talking about. They make,

33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,840
clothing has a big, uh, elasticity,

34
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,260
but food down here,
you know,

35
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:26,430
you really can't eat that
much more food. Uh, you know,

36
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,230
we try of course, uh, but we don't
succeed. So no matter what your income is,

37
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:35,520
if you, uh, certainly if you
measure the food in pounds, uh,

38
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,760
you don't eat an awful lot more.
If you measured in dollars,

39
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,510
you can buy caviar and you know,
live on caviar,

40
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,910
but basically there can be a high
elasticy city or or low Alasta city.

41
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,200
Okay,
so that's one of the clear clearance.

42
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:56,370
Simple ideas that economics and I'm
sure it's nothing new to you now.

43
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:59,800
Can you think,
think of a counter example to this?

44
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,160
Something that as people get richer,
they buy less of

45
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,243
what?

46
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,110
Spam. Good. Cheap food.
What's a, what's a car that's,

47
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:14,150
that's a generation. Go Spam. How
many of you have ever eaten spam?

48
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,280
You went to prep school or something?

49
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,960
I have never eaten spam
but Mcdonald's hamburgers.

50
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,060
I wonder those kinds of things.

51
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,960
And for people in a
poor country like rice,

52
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,010
what do they go from what?

53
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,543
Yeah,

54
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:36,490
brown rice. Unpolished rice is what the
poor people eat or in India, millet.

55
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,910
And then when they get more money to
go to polish rice and they go to wheat,

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,410
that in all countries,

57
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:45,190
food is one of the important things that
you eat up higher on the food chain.

58
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:49,000
You change what you want to eat depending
on your income and you can eat less.

59
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,340
Of what you previously did.

60
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,120
A lot of public transportation is another
example of goods that you buy less of.

61
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:02,230
As you get richer, you
take you, you take it.

62
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:05,350
If you get Richard to take a taxi or
you have your own limousine and the show

63
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:07,510
forward and so forth if
you're really wealthy.

64
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,130
So all of these things do the
opposite, uh, thing to that.

65
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,640
Economists have a word for that
kind of a good and it is inferior.

66
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:20,080
Good.
Okay.

67
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,800
Now what's another example of that you
guys that one of the most robust uh,

68
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,830
phenomena in the world is this fact
that poor people have a lot of kids,

69
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,520
rich people have very few kids.

70
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,980
This works no matter how you spin it,

71
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,250
you can compare a poor country cause I
take any sub Saharan Africa country that,

72
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,610
that you want to a rich country
take any European American,

73
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,840
Japanese country that you like.

74
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:58,130
If this is income across countries
as they say, cross sectional, uh,

75
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,920
this is very, very true. If you
look within a country like pick,

76
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:03,910
pick any country,

77
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,100
the rich people tend to have fewer
children than the poor people.

78
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,520
And also you can spin it
a third way with time.

79
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,060
If you look at when a country was poor,
there'll be having a lot of children.

80
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,110
And then as they develop economic and
the get rich, they have fewer children.

81
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,380
So this is an absolutely
a robust kind of data.

82
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:26,380
One of them.
Yeah.

83
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:31,300
What have you measured?
Valued children by investment per child.

84
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,740
Ah, we're going to get
to that, that later,

85
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,240
that that's at the end of a
lot of intermediate stuff.

86
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,230
So, but this is the number
of children that you get.

87
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:43,650
It's not how much you're spending on them,

88
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:46,220
but the number of children that you have.

89
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,800
So you have these three different
ways that you can have a high slope,

90
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:56,740
a low slope, and the slope
can even turn down. Whoops,

91
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:01,690
whoops. Whoops. This is
some real data for, uh,

92
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,730
this is,
uh,

93
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,230
the total fertility rate and going from
one or even less up to eight children.

94
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,600
And this is the gross domestic product
per adult. And this is the log of it,

95
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:18,230
cause it goes over six orders
of magnitude. That's some,

96
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,820
some bases earn an awful lot.
Uh,

97
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,190
more so there's not a linear scale but,
but a log scale.

98
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,150
But over that whole range you can see
it's a very good correlation that uh,

99
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,440
those countries which have a poor income
have lot of children and those that

100
00:06:36,501 --> 00:06:39,590
have a lot of income,
have few children.

101
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,580
And this is two different periods in time.
1960,

102
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:48,581
which is really before the third world
fertility transition in 2000 when you're

103
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:53,840
in the middle of the third world fertility
transition and you have these points

104
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:56,180
for the 1960,
the circles,

105
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,720
the pluses for 2000. And you see, there's,

106
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,960
what's happened is they've
slid down this line.

107
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:04,880
The countries have slid down this line.

108
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:08,390
There's still pretty much
the same relationship. Uh,

109
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:12,590
but uh,
the country's progressed in,

110
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:16,760
their income grows up. This
is the regression line, uh,

111
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,760
for this regression line for 1960.

112
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:22,970
This is the regression line for
2000 and small difference. Not,

113
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:27,720
it hasn't changed very much. So again,
this is really a very robust, uh,

114
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,040
kind of thing.
If you compare countries,

115
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,640
a 10% increase in per capita income
equates to a 13% decrease in fertility.

116
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,450
And it's a very interesting thing.

117
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,720
You have big cultural differences
between countries within a country where

118
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:50,390
you're under more or less,
if you have a homogeneous country,

119
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,680
more or less the same culture,
the,

120
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,850
the freedom of people to change
their for chill, to control,

121
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,290
to choose their fertility as much
more limited within a culture.

122
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:04,370
So now if you look only within a country,
you get a much smaller change,

123
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:09,371
a 10% increase in income correlates
with only a 1% change in fertility.

124
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,580
So it depends exactly how you run your
statistics, how big an effect this is.

125
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:16,610
But it's absolutely robust.
Uh, we always find it.

126
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,930
So here's a,
here's a great term paper for you,

127
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:24,680
or even a research paper
for the summer or something.

128
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,950
So it's usually this respect
to the Yale students.

129
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,920
It's usually presuming that the families
of the ELL students generally have a

130
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:33,920
very good income, probably
even within, I mean, we yell,

131
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,660
tries to get a distribution of incomes,

132
00:08:35,661 --> 00:08:38,210
but within each class we
probably do very well.

133
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:41,930
So we're a high income group and it's
probably also true that we generally have

134
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:45,740
very few children, that your family's
probably each have very few children.

135
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,640
So you can take a ratio of a family income
to number of children and that ratio

136
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:57,180
for different groups. It's probably
a measure of how you are, right?

137
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,450
The higher the ratio income
to number of children, uh, uh,

138
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,260
tells you how much parents
don't want children because
they have a lot of income.

139
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,690
And guess who has this data?

140
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:15,120
Where have you filled in
this data admissions office?

141
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,520
If you're applying for a scholarship,

142
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:20,070
which I think at least three quarters
of you apparently do some sort of

143
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:21,970
financial aid,
uh,

144
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,190
they have income data on your family and
they also have the number of siblings

145
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,500
in your family.
All that is data that they have.

146
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,660
So if you can get it out of admissions,

147
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,950
you could really do some very interesting
study of what is that ratio for Yale

148
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:38,100
students. And then once it's
published from yell, everybody,

149
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,900
every other school in the
country is going to try to do it.

150
00:09:39,901 --> 00:09:41,400
And it'll do for different works.

151
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:45,720
I haven't seen these kinds of things
published that this ratio for various

152
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:49,530
special socioeconomic groups.
Okay.

153
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,170
So this is kind of a
surprising, uh, uh, phenomenon,

154
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,360
uh, that, that, that, that rich
people buy have fewer children.

155
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,793
And

156
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,650
one year I taught this course
and there was a guy in it,

157
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:10,470
somewhat older guy who was actually
already a professor in Kenya,

158
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,300
but he'd come to Yale for more education.

159
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,020
They took this course and after the
course he told me that he was just blown

160
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:16,381
away,

161
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:21,381
that he had never realized coming from
Ken that that poor people had more

162
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,850
children than rich people actually put
it the other way. He had no idea that,

163
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,830
that one of the aspects of being
rich was that you have fewer,

164
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,570
fewer children using it. A
college professor, a university
professor in, in, in,

165
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,130
in Kenya. So this is quite,
uh, actually quite shocking.

166
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,200
Um, you heard, I mean, a whole cultural
story is that parents love children.

167
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:46,640
Parents want children while they
want them. Maybe they love them. Uh,

168
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,260
well not when they're teenagers of course.
Uh,

169
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,850
and so you'd expect that more income
would be an an an enabling factor,

170
00:10:53,851 --> 00:10:57,360
very big enabling factor that you
in general have more children.

171
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,830
But it isn't the case.
Well this is anomalous.

172
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,950
Things are of great interest to
scientists including social scientists.

173
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,510
And so economists of course paid a
good amount of attention to this.

174
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,200
And the way they talk about children is
that they tried to general just the way

175
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,830
scientists try to generalize things, make
Newton's laws, applies to everything.

176
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,020
Whereas before there were
a lot of different things.

177
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:26,850
So they tried to use the same words they
use for suits, who food for children.

178
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,550
And the kinds of things they say are
that children are a time intensive

179
00:11:32,551 --> 00:11:36,090
commodity. They take a
lot of, a lot of time to,

180
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,890
to either enjoy or bring
up, uh, properly. Uh,

181
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,700
women's value of time is a key component
in the price of children that children

182
00:11:46,951 --> 00:11:51,840
have a price like any other,
uh, good, uh, the time this,

183
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:54,490
this all quotes out of recent articles,

184
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,350
the time cost of children and
other household production
children are one of the

185
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,150
things that households produce.

186
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,550
Then they talked about the opportunity
costs for households to produce and

187
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:10,660
consume a child. I loved
the idea that, well,

188
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,700
what parents are doing is consuming
you and I will put on the web,

189
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,610
uh, uh, an article by
Jonathan Swift, you know,

190
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:20,560
the same guy who did Gulliver's travels,
you know,

191
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:25,350
this article Amato's proposal.
Exactly. And what he,

192
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,740
and this is tongue in cheek in his part,
but at that time and much earlier,

193
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:33,050
much later, the English were concerned
about the Irish problem. There are shoe,

194
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,840
very poor. They had tons of kids and
they didn't like to be ruled by England.

195
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,490
Uh,
so the,

196
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:43,630
the Irish problem had to be solved in
what swift's suggested was that the Irish

197
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,500
eat their children and what this would do,
provide good food for them,

198
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,540
a lot of the protein and everything,

199
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:54,270
so it would solve their
starvation problem and reduce, uh,

200
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:58,270
the population problem there.
So of course this was tongue in cheek,

201
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:01,780
but it makes really interesting reading
and especially his notice his use of,

202
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,190
if you, if you bothered to read it, it's
not, not required. It's use of numbers.

203
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:10,750
It's full of numbers. It's a real
takeoff on what fairly contemporary.

204
00:13:10,751 --> 00:13:14,670
And he has people like the people
starting to write a co economics. Uh,

205
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,780
we're writing. Okay. Uh,

206
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:25,290
so this idea that economics deals with
children just as they do with any other

207
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:28,950
commodity. It's, it's, it's the gene,

208
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,860
it's the genius of economics to be able
to do that just as the genius of science

209
00:13:32,861 --> 00:13:34,480
to be able to make journalism.

210
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,450
But it's also one of the reasons
people reject the approach. They just,

211
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,230
people generally don't want to
consider themselves a commodities.

212
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:47,920
So why should people want fewer
children as, as they get richer? Well,

213
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:52,510
the basis of essentially all modern
economics is rational actor theory, uh,

214
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,490
that people act to maximize their
happiness or utility or preferences.

215
00:13:57,491 --> 00:14:01,570
There's a lot of different jargon words
with slightly different meanings and

216
00:14:01,571 --> 00:14:04,060
they don't act against
their self interests.

217
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:07,940
Now there's new psychological
economics or neuroeconomics,

218
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,160
which finds out this isn't really true,
but that doesn't matter.

219
00:14:12,161 --> 00:14:15,460
Most theory depends on
rational actor theory.

220
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,260
And so they'd be kind of believe that
people decide what to do based on a

221
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:21,130
calculation.

222
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,600
It doesn't necessarily have to be a
conscious calculation which little problem

223
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,780
there of what's good for
them and they act that way.

224
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,030
So somehow economists have to figure
out why is it good for people who have

225
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:37,600
money to have fewer children,
what is in their self interest?

226
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,000
And actually, uh, a guy wrote a paper, uh,

227
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,990
Gary Becker in 1960 and then
he got a Nobel prize for this,

228
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,860
for bringing family when they go
family economics into the mainstream of

229
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:56,861
economics and treating
children like any other good.

230
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,650
And some of what I'm going to tell you,
it really comes from,

231
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:05,000
from Becker's theory. So, uh,

232
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,021
as I mentioned,

233
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:10,340
one of the fundamental ideas is that
it costs money to rear children.

234
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,400
And so they can be considered
an item to be purchased.

235
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,870
And so they call them a good, anything
that you purchased. This is called a good.

236
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:22,670
So children are, there's different kinds
of goods and children are all of them,

237
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:26,820
or at least most of them. One, there
are production good like a machine.

238
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:30,920
And production good is something like
you buy a machine for factory to do work.

239
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,730
And children, of course, especially in
poor settings, do various kinds of work.

240
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,850
We'll come back to each of these things.
Their consumption,

241
00:15:37,851 --> 00:15:42,320
good consumption good is something
you buy and maybe eventually use up.

242
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:43,101
But you enjoy it.

243
00:15:43,101 --> 00:15:47,990
You buy it because you get pleasure
in some sense out of having that,

244
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:49,520
not because it does work for you.

245
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,550
And the third thing is
they can be an investment.

246
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,110
Good that you put money into a child
when they're young and then when they're

247
00:15:57,111 --> 00:16:00,650
older you get something
back for the return.

248
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,930
Just like putting money in a bond,

249
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,760
you put it in and then you wait some time
and you get, uh, presumably more back.

250
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,230
So first consider a children
as a production good,

251
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,880
which is very largely the case in,
in poor countries.

252
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,550
Uh,
uh,

253
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,060
one thing that's pretty obvious as
a child does not cost much to make.

254
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:27,620
It's pretty cheap. Uh,
and in a peasant family,

255
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:30,860
children do a lot of work for the family.
They can run errands,

256
00:16:30,861 --> 00:16:35,300
they collect firewood, they can fetch
water, they take care of younger children,

257
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:39,740
they weed the fields. There's a whole
bunch of things that children will do.

258
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:44,360
And you read, you have some readings
on that in today's readings,

259
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,920
uh, and they actually do
a lot of work. Here's a,

260
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,030
here's an example of a little bars.

261
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,430
The name of the kid can run all over,

262
00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:00,550
fetch up cows out of the stock fields
or oxen carrying stove wood in climbing

263
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,750
the corn crib and feed the hogs and
going errands down at his grandma's.

264
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,150
Guess where that description comes from?
Could be anywhere in the world.

265
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:14,150
It happens to be Kansas settler
in the late 18 hundreds.

266
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,780
So an American like other
places in the farm economy,

267
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,270
kids do an awful lot of work.

268
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,500
There's a saying from
Indonesia that by age seven,

269
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,300
a child does more work for the family
than the war family has to do for it.

270
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,670
So where,
so in to study that sociologists,

271
00:17:34,671 --> 00:17:39,590
anthropologists and economists actually
go out in the field and observe in a

272
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:42,750
peasant societies and the professor
or a graduate student, uh,

273
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,880
stays with the family or stays very in
the same village with the family and

274
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:48,890
always carries around
a clipboard of these.

275
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,430
And what they do is they write down
everything that the parents do for the

276
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:56,400
children and everything that
the children do for the parents.

277
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:01,530
[inaudible] mom is cooking. Ah,
sister is washing vegetables.

278
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,870
Oh, little brother is sent
to the neighbors for a bit
of cooking oil. Oh baby.

279
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:09,220
Just defecated. Yup. Mom.

280
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,580
MOM stops cooking to clean up the baby,
etc. Etc.

281
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,630
You can imagine all this
down on a clipboard.

282
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,750
That's when a child is young. Uh, the
family puts a lot of work into the child.

283
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,400
As the child gets older,

284
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:28,401
they require less and less from the
family and they start doing more work for

285
00:18:28,591 --> 00:18:32,940
the family. And so economists count,
you can calculate or anthropologists,

286
00:18:32,941 --> 00:18:34,710
anybody can calculate a crossover age.

287
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,920
What is the age at which children do
more work for the family measured saying

288
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,730
ours. Then the family does
work, uh, for the children. Uh,

289
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,400
it's no longer quite as young as the
seven that the Indonesians talked about,

290
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,180
but modern calculations showed
something like at age 13,

291
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,270
children are doing more
work in an agrarian society.

292
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,740
Children doing more work for the family,
then the family puts in to them.

293
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:06,090
In your reading packet is
a story about ton of mom,

294
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:11,270
ton of mine money, uh, from Malaysia
and every year students don't.

295
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:15,360
Why did, it's a wonderful story. Your
love, why did, why did I put that in?

296
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,420
And of course it's child labor.
It shows you what,

297
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:21,390
how exactly a little bit unusual instance,

298
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:23,580
but how children are viewed
is not romantic at all.

299
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:25,200
It's a straight economic calculation.

300
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,340
You maximize the amount of work
that you get out of the child.

301
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:35,100
Jonathan swift and thinks mentions age
six as the age when children can begin

302
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:39,810
earning money as pickpockets and David
Copperfield was sent to work apparently

303
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:44,310
at the age of 10 and Charles Dickens
himself went to work at the age of 12.

304
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,000
Currently calculations from the uh,

305
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,020
United Nations International Labor
Organization shows that there's something

306
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:57,021
like 250 million children each five to
14 that are employed in half of these

307
00:19:58,411 --> 00:20:02,430
children employed full time,
not as casual laborers but as full time.

308
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,440
And this estimate, this is not a
decreasing phenomenon, but, uh,

309
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,450
this estimate is up from earlier
ones of 73 million children.

310
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:17,750
So from 73 to a 250 million child
labor is apparently increasing quite

311
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:22,590
significantly in the world.

312
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,600
So an agrarian societies just
from the work that children do,

313
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,720
children can be an economic benefit.
And so people want a lot,

314
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,210
a lot of them to work around the farm.

315
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:38,870
And even in the early
stages of industrialization,
children are often sent, uh,

316
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,070
into earning work or they earn cash.
And,

317
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,800
and in real poverty situations in
industrially developing countries,

318
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,230
even the small wages of children
can make us sort of life and death,

319
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,250
life and death difference in
the survival of the family.

320
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,850
But notice that this all changes.
Now when modernization comes in, uh,

321
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,730
one thing to have the children go
to school and if they go to school,

322
00:21:03,731 --> 00:21:07,590
they have fewer hours to work at home.
So their costs there,

323
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:12,340
their benefits goes down. Money has
to be provided for tuition, for books,

324
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:16,810
for clothing or uniforms
for shoes. Children on the
farm often don't have shoes,

325
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:19,570
but when they go into
the city to be proper,

326
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:23,410
they usually have to have shoes.
So their costs go up,

327
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:26,080
their benefit goes down,
their costs goes up.

328
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:32,050
Another aspect of monetization medicine
becomes available now for child gets

329
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:32,441
sick,

330
00:21:32,441 --> 00:21:36,670
the parents have to spend money on doctors
are on medicine or they perceive that

331
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:40,960
they have to do such a thing
if,

332
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,410
if the families in the
city and previously,

333
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,600
and it gets to be a lot
of children working,

334
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:49,270
but they're also a lot
of adults out of work.

335
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,190
The government eventually puts in child
labor laws and says children can't work

336
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,250
and it makes it illegal
and therefore you can,

337
00:21:57,251 --> 00:22:01,480
children can't work at all their benefit.
It goes down.

338
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:07,650
So all of these things act to reduce the
value of children as production goods.

339
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,720
They're just not as good a
production good as they used to be.

340
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,240
Now considered children as
a consumption. Good. Again,

341
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:21,060
that's the pleasure that uh,

342
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,980
or fulfillment that parents
get out of having children. Uh,

343
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,140
one article I read talks about
children as a consumer durable.

344
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,180
That's cause they last a long time
and they're like refrigerators.

345
00:22:34,181 --> 00:22:35,200
They last a won't do either.

346
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:39,660
A durable good and you see the
reports every month or what, how do,

347
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:43,480
how many more of less Stewart
durable goods are being bought.

348
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,830
Um,
so it's very incent codes.

349
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,990
The purchase of durable goods you
don't usually pay cash for that.

350
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:55,030
They go into credit card and an easy
payment plan, uh, for later payment.

351
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,390
And it's the same for children.
They don't cost anything,

352
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,330
they don't cost much to make
and the costs come later.

353
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:06,870
I'm thinking of the child is kind
of like a house if you poor, uh,

354
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,440
or you can or could. And until the recent
debacle by House with no money down,

355
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,311
you don't have any,

356
00:23:12,311 --> 00:23:16,450
any money and you get a mortgage and
it's later on after having the house that

357
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:18,940
you have to every year
pay off the mortgage,

358
00:23:18,941 --> 00:23:23,200
you've got to maintain the house insurance
for the house taxes for the houses

359
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,070
that the upfront cost is
very small, uh, later.

360
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,740
And as you know, a lot of people,
uh, enjoy shopping very much.

361
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,580
And then once they choose,
they said, this is what I want.

362
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,960
They go to get to get a big bang
out of the actual purchase. And uh,

363
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,440
making children is very similar.
Uh,

364
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,230
people enjoy the foreplay
and then they get a big bang.

365
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:51,950
Well that didn't work very well.
Okay,

366
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:58,070
so another aspect finally. Got It. Uh,

367
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,510
another aspect of this is
children as consumption of goods.

368
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:07,511
And this has to do with modernization is
that you can't consider good separately

369
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,320
one from the other.

370
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,470
People have a certain amount of money
and what they buy will depend not only on

371
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:18,230
the cost of each individual good,
but on their relative costs.

372
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:22,910
And so what happens when
a country modernizes the
respect of children's at the

373
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:27,890
cost of children is perceived to
go up, that you education, health,

374
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:29,150
all these,
all these clothing,

375
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:34,040
all of these costs go up in inexorably
where at the same time the cost of

376
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:38,900
manufactured items goes down
or radio player, television,

377
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,190
any of the goodies that you
spend an awful lot of time with,

378
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,360
as time goes on, technology improves.
The cost of those goes down.

379
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,760
So modernization increases not
only the absolute cost of children,

380
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:53,594
but more,

381
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,920
even more intensely the relative
costs causes their costs go up,

382
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,590
costs of other things that
people want a go down. So, uh,

383
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:08,780
that's another cause why people might
want fewer children as time goes on.

384
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,640
Another aspect is the
time cost of children.

385
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,600
An important idea is that people
have not only in limited income,

386
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:25,340
which they can spend as they choose,
but also limit amount of time.

387
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,930
And we all use the phrase of spend
their time and economists take that as a

388
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:34,220
serious issue and they think that
time is spent in a rational manner.

389
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,830
Time can be used for, for
leisure time can be used, uh,

390
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,120
for parenting or if the person works,
time can be money,

391
00:25:41,121 --> 00:25:45,410
it can be used to work and earn money
and each person has to balance where each

392
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,270
family has to balance these things.

393
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,930
Most of the time,
and I'll show you some data on this,

394
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,560
required for child rearing is
spent by the mother. In fact,

395
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,880
almost exclusively in most societies, the
mother does all basically all the work.

396
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,810
Um,
in the peasant society,

397
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,180
the mother does all the housework,

398
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,840
everything at home is
jointly done by the mother.

399
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,150
And this time is not valued at all.

400
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,820
Mostly in peasant cultures. Women's work
at home doesn't count. She may do the,

401
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,670
she and the children may go out into
the field to do an awful lot of work,

402
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:22,740
weeding and everything.
And also again,

403
00:26:22,741 --> 00:26:24,840
culturally this usually
just doesn't count.

404
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:30,230
So women's time is not particularly
valued in traditional societies.

405
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,550
And in traditional time
she can't get a job,

406
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:39,720
so she's not going to be able to get
there, just no jobs available for her.

407
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:45,270
But then modernization comes in and
jobs available in the cash economy and

408
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:49,470
cashews, what people value. Cash
in an agrarian society is so rare,

409
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,460
so difficult to come by that that's what,

410
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:56,470
what is really a valued jobs become
available and in many de industrializing

411
00:26:58,261 --> 00:26:59,620
situations,
you know,

412
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,510
and especially in the third world now
the first jobs that become available are

413
00:27:03,511 --> 00:27:08,040
low skill jobs like sewing that almost
every country that enters into the modern

414
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:08,940
war has started.

415
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:13,941
It's in code industrial revolution
by selling jobs in factories,

416
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:19,710
Bangladesh, Indonesia, all over the
world. Sewing is the first kind of thing.

417
00:27:19,711 --> 00:27:24,711
And this is largely women's job and you
see this in China all over the world

418
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,990
that some of the earliest jobs in the
modern sector are for women assembly.

419
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,790
You look at a of pictures of assembly
lines and almost saying electronic goods,

420
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:36,990
who's doing the assembly? Very
largely, uh, women are doing it.

421
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,553
Um,

422
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,200
so the once job opportunities
become available,

423
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,270
then you start,

424
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:49,580
you set up a competition between child
bearing and working childbearing.

425
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,670
The woman is at home,

426
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:55,590
she can't be out in the city working
and her time is spent taking care of the

427
00:27:55,591 --> 00:28:00,000
children and therefore she doesn't earn
an income or she can have fewer children

428
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:03,270
or no children and go
to work and earn income.

429
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,260
So monitor what happens is
the opportunity cost to women,

430
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,590
which was considered essentially
zero in traditional times,

431
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,500
starts rising as jobs
become available for women,

432
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,540
the opportunity cost of
having children rises.

433
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,270
So that's another thing that
is modernization, uh, proceeds.

434
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:28,740
You might expect that families want
fewer children as modernization,

435
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:33,741
perceived people get richer and all of
these effects might really not be due to

436
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:37,200
the income, but just time going on, uh,

437
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,770
in the way that I've been been talking
about the changes that modernization

438
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:42,263
brings.

439
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,090
Now the third kind of thing
we have to consider, uh,

440
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:51,030
for children is to consider
them as an investment. Good.

441
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:54,630
That means you pay now
you get a return later.

442
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:58,590
And of course the value of children
doesn't stop once they grow up.

443
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,610
If the culture has strong families,
and that's a very important,

444
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:07,830
if then the children when they grow
up will perceive that they have a

445
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:12,630
responsibility toward the parents and
that they have responsibilities to support

446
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,560
the parents in old age
reason before old age.

447
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:22,760
It's interesting to note that if there's
no stock market in a country or banks

448
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:26,070
and poor people really don't have
access to these things in most places,

449
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:27,720
at the earliest stage of industrious,

450
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:32,220
there's nothing else for people to invest
in. There's just no market for things.

451
00:29:32,221 --> 00:29:35,170
There's no market for their savings.
Uh,

452
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,860
because rats and insects
eat up an awful lot of food,

453
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:41,230
you can't really store the food. So, uh,

454
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,810
basically the, oh, almost the only
mode of investment is in children.

455
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,630
So children are indeed in a,

456
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,950
in premodern society is very
much an investment. Good.

457
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:58,930
And uh, this is brought home, I
mean, I read a lot about this,

458
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:02,320
but the experience of it in a developing
country, it's very interesting to hear.

459
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,820
So we had a graduate student,

460
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,730
he was from India and he was
from an upper class family. Uh,

461
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,730
and uh, that his family had only a
few children and all his relatives,

462
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:13,600
this whole class,

463
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:17,620
the people he really knew I had already
done their fertility transition,

464
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,120
had very few children,

465
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,780
but he was a good hearted soul and uh,
wanted to um,

466
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,320
help, uh, uh, poor people. So, um,

467
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,230
he worked before he came to Yale,

468
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:36,040
he worked in an adult literacy program
and that's really one of the best things

469
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,180
that you can do in this particular program
was aimed at the very poorest people

470
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,190
who are still illiterate.

471
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:46,840
And in the course they discussed
everything cause you need vocabulary,

472
00:30:46,841 --> 00:30:50,830
you need to discuss it. So there's a
lot of discussion as well as reading.

473
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,060
And one of the things they discussed
was family planning. In fact,

474
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,020
a non had been speaking in class
strongly in favor of family planning,

475
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:01,960
trying to convince them that they
shouldn't have so many children,

476
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:03,700
that they would be better
off with fewer children,

477
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:07,480
which was the experience of
his social class. But one day,

478
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:11,680
one of the adults took it on
this guy aside to, you know,

479
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,690
you were wrong about family planning.

480
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:19,090
I have no money to save for retirement.
There's no social security.

481
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,460
The government won't
care for me in old age.

482
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:26,200
I need a son to care for me in old age.
I have 10 children.

483
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,680
If even one of them survives
and become successful,

484
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:33,250
then I'll be lucky and
have a comfortable old age.

485
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:38,950
So that was very nicely put what
the, what the man said to a non, uh,

486
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:43,360
but it's also a nice reaction. Was,
was also very interesting that uh,

487
00:31:43,361 --> 00:31:46,390
even they grew up in India, had never
thought of that about that before.

488
00:31:46,391 --> 00:31:47,211
He never heard about it.

489
00:31:47,211 --> 00:31:50,860
He never thought that he never perceived
it from the point of view of a poor

490
00:31:50,861 --> 00:31:55,390
pres. And he was very impressed. And,
and when he told me this story, uh,

491
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,740
what he said, he, he was, he was just a,

492
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:02,050
he was amazed at how compelling the
argument was and he couldn't think of

493
00:32:02,051 --> 00:32:07,051
anything to say back to the person
in support of his previous views.

494
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,570
Uh,
so again of the very,

495
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:18,571
for the very poorest people about the
only strategy they have for old age is to

496
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:20,710
have children to take care of them.

497
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,920
And in most cultures that means
a son who will take care of them.

498
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:30,100
Kids cost very little in a
poverty stricken uh, culture. Uh,

499
00:32:30,101 --> 00:32:31,190
they uh, they, they,

500
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:36,250
they were a hand me down clothes that
they don't have a toys or lots of any,

501
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,250
anything like that. They get basically
no school or medical care. Uh,

502
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,440
the kind of food that poor people eat
is fairly cheap and interesting in terms

503
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,940
of time beyond the first child. Uh,
if you have the first Saint John,

504
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,910
as soon as they get up
to be five, six, seven,

505
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,590
they start taking care
of the younger children.

506
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,970
So the time burden on the mother sort of
goes away once you have somewhat older

507
00:32:58,971 --> 00:33:00,890
children and older means like five,

508
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,400
they can start scrapping the baby on
their back and going around with the baby

509
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,050
so that extra children are not, don't
even cost much time off for the parents,

510
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:11,930
they cost very little money. You already
have all the hand me down things.

511
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:16,370
So it's just a subsistence amount of,
of cheap food that the child needs.

512
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:20,130
So it's, it's uh, it's, it's, uh,

513
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:25,330
children are very small cost and their
benefit as old age insurance is perceived

514
00:33:26,001 --> 00:33:27,560
to be quite,
quite great.

515
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,280
Okay. But what happens, uh, as,

516
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,850
as modernization.
So parents are basically willing,

517
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:40,820
poor parents who are willing to invest a
little bit that they have a little bit,

518
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,630
uh,
that's needed in a lot of children.

519
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,600
How does modernization
affect this investment?

520
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,620
If jobs start to be
available on the cities and,

521
00:33:51,621 --> 00:33:55,370
or possibilities open up for
migration abroad to jobs?

522
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,390
All the people from India and Pakistan
that go to the Middle East to work in oil

523
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,770
related jobs as the rich economies.

524
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:04,520
There are people that come
to America to find jobs.

525
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,270
They all sent back. Remittances, at
least the first generation is very,

526
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:12,430
very good about sending back remittances,
which is a huge fraction of,

527
00:34:12,431 --> 00:34:14,480
of poor people's income.

528
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:18,410
And even though the remittances may
not be a huge fraction of what they're

529
00:34:18,411 --> 00:34:21,200
earning in America or in Saudi Arabia,
uh,

530
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,430
in terms of the income that they're
parents are living on poverty stricken,

531
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:30,170
it can be a very, very big
increment, uh, to their income.

532
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,550
And so children can be really good
investment if they can get up,

533
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:38,300
get a job in the city or
get a job, uh, abroad.

534
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:43,450
They are really good investment and
that's modernization increases everything

535
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:46,370
else.
It decreases the value of children.

536
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,500
But modernization increases their value
of this aspect of their value as an

537
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:52,334
investment.

538
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,690
Several other things happen
during modernization that
increased the value, uh,

539
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:01,580
investment. First of all, child mortality,

540
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:04,610
the first thing in the
demographic transition are
usually the first thing that

541
00:35:04,611 --> 00:35:08,690
happens is of quite severe
drop in infant mortality.

542
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:13,130
And what that means is children now
likely to grow up that previously children

543
00:35:13,131 --> 00:35:17,480
died very young or died,
uh, various times, uh,

544
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,070
in their, their young ages. And if
something is going to disappear,

545
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,560
like if somebody is going to
get stolen from you, you know,

546
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:26,810
you don't try to buy a really fancy car.

547
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,370
If you're pretty sure
it's going to get stolen.

548
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,050
And it's the same thing with children.

549
00:35:30,051 --> 00:35:33,800
If the odds are very high
that your children are going
to die, it's really not.

550
00:35:33,801 --> 00:35:36,290
And if the modern
medicine isn't available,

551
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:40,850
it's not really a good idea to put a
lot of investment into a child, uh,

552
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,630
that's going to,
you're going to die.

553
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:47,460
But as monitorization some ideas of
sanitation, public health come into play,

554
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,930
and the expectation that
children will live increases,

555
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:56,780
then there's a longer period for
them to live and return income, uh,

556
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:01,110
to the parents. The other side of
the coin is, is pretty much the same.

557
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,110
The parents are living longer. So, uh,

558
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,710
in the old style of fertility,

559
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:12,450
married people just kept having children
until they became a sterile at 45 or

560
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:16,350
something like that.
And then at the old life expectancy,

561
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:18,810
they didn't have much longer to live.
So,

562
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,700
and they were still capable of working at
40, 45, and then they, and they die. So,

563
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,980
uh, even if they have
children that stay alive,

564
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:30,390
there's not a long period of dependency
where they'll get income from their

565
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:35,070
children.
So if you have your last child,

566
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:38,360
it's a 40 or 45, uh, uh,

567
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,290
then they're going to reach maturity when
you're 60 or over something almost 60.

568
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:46,230
And that's, uh, at or above the,

569
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:51,070
the life expectancy in very
poor countries. So the,

570
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:55,380
the increased longevity of
both children and parents, uh,

571
00:36:55,950 --> 00:37:00,930
make it a much better deal to have
children as an investment. Good.

572
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,710
Because as longer time they can pay you
and you're going to be around for longer

573
00:37:04,711 --> 00:37:07,800
time to get this.

574
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:11,910
So as opposed to the other ways that,

575
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,750
that children are looked at
economically as an investment, good.

576
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,040
A modernization can massively
increase the value of children.

577
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,060
So that would be,
so we have counter balancing.

578
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,130
If people have more money
as modernization goes on,

579
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,170
you think they could afford more children,

580
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:31,200
but they become less good
as consumption goods.

581
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,660
They become less good as production goods,

582
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,570
but they come much better
as investment goods.

583
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:39,630
And of course as people have more money,
they have more money that they can save.

584
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:42,630
And one of the ways they save it
is by investing in the children.

585
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,340
So one of the issues then is, okay, if,

586
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:51,000
if the value of children is now
mostly as an investment, good.

587
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,710
How do you maximize,
uh,

588
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,090
this investment in agrarian societies?

589
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,110
They're really no opportunities
outside farming. That's,

590
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,730
that's what the society
does, period. We're done.

591
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,480
If in indeed the
agriculture is traditional,

592
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:10,350
you're doing it exactly the way your
grandfather did it and his grandfather did

593
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:15,060
it. And that's a very safe way
to farm because you're, you're,

594
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:19,740
you're on the edge of thrive. The Vir
crop doesn't grow, you're in big trouble.

595
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:25,080
So if you try something new, there's
always a danger that it might not work.

596
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,130
If you do something the way it's been
done for hundreds of years or thousands of

597
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,940
years, or you perceive as thousands
of years in your family, on your land,

598
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,740
you're pretty sure that
it's going to work.

599
00:38:34,741 --> 00:38:38,650
You may not get an awful lot out of it,
but assure you it's going to work.

600
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:43,090
So peasants are very conservative,
not only about their,

601
00:38:43,091 --> 00:38:45,640
their production,
their agricultural production,

602
00:38:45,641 --> 00:38:48,420
but everything else in their
life because they don't have any,

603
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,340
anything extra to gamble,
gamble with.

604
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:56,140
So they're not going to take on anything
new. And the old way of doing it,

605
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:59,110
father passes it off to Sun.
Exactly has been doing it.

606
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:03,370
You don't need an education to do
farming in a traditional kind of way.

607
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,880
You learn it while doing,
uh, with your father.

608
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,300
Um,
so,

609
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:14,710
but when education gets
modernize, when, uh,

610
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,920
when agriculture gets modernized,
there's fertilizers,

611
00:39:17,921 --> 00:39:21,010
there's new varieties of seeds.
You have to pay attention to money.

612
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:23,110
And when you enter into
the market economy,

613
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,140
you have to have some mathematical
abilities to know about money.

614
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:29,350
You may have to borrow money. This
interest rates, this payback schedules,

615
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,730
there's all kinds of things.

616
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,530
So that education starts becoming
very valuable even in agriculture.

617
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,360
And so early on,

618
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:43,430
the combination of not needing,
uh,

619
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:47,450
education and the propagated that
kids will die young invest with,

620
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:51,280
there's really not much benefit in
investing in education in an early

621
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,060
agricultural society.
Uh,

622
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,800
so the best strategy at that time is to
have a lot of children and put them in a

623
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,910
minimal investment,

624
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:05,190
in a minimal investment in each of them
and hope that some of them don't die.

625
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:09,470
And that's in fact empirically
true that the investment, uh,

626
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:12,370
before the for the demographic transition,

627
00:40:12,371 --> 00:40:14,620
the investment that people
put into their children,

628
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,650
each shore was indeed very small and
subsistence carried on the way it always

629
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:21,784
was.

630
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:26,740
But now population increases cause,
uh,

631
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:30,290
foreign foods come in,
all kinds of things happen and,

632
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,610
and population starts increasing.
Land become scarce.

633
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:38,650
Now imagine you have a small farm and
you yourself are living as a subsistence

634
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:43,651
farmer and you've got a whole bunch of
kids and now you're faced with dividing

635
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:46,300
up your land among the
kids. Well, you know,

636
00:40:46,301 --> 00:40:49,900
the kids aren't going to be able to do it.
You can barely do it on your size.

637
00:40:49,901 --> 00:40:53,500
Farmers who divided up among two,
three or so sons,

638
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,990
it just ain't gonna work.
So you're in crisis. Uh,

639
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:00,580
and when the kids inherit session,
a little bit of land,

640
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,850
not only are they going to have big
trouble and then I can have any access to

641
00:41:03,851 --> 00:41:04,840
provide for you.

642
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:08,680
So children's stopped becoming junior
if they stay in the farm economy,

643
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:13,480
stopped becoming any kind of
a decent investment, uh, to,

644
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:18,340
uh, to keep you going when you're,
when you're getting a little old.

645
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,100
So you've got to figure out what,
what to do.

646
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,000
You're facing the crisis,

647
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,340
but the outside economy is modernizing.
You may not be modernizing,

648
00:41:30,341 --> 00:41:35,341
but the outside economy is modernizing
and jobs become available largely jobs

649
00:41:36,321 --> 00:41:38,990
that requires some sort of education,
white collar jobs.

650
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:42,300
The government jobs are big,
huge bureaucracies spring up,

651
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:47,120
I'll mention that a little bit.
And uh,

652
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:53,290
parents rather rapidly realized that
the only option is for the kids to go to

653
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:57,890
the city and get a job. And,
but there's all the parents,

654
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:00,590
everybody reaches that state
pretty much the same time.

655
00:42:00,591 --> 00:42:04,220
So the cities are just flooded with
people coming in looking for the still

656
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:07,250
scarce jobs.
How do you have an edge up?

657
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:11,540
It has to be education that the only way
you can get these are white collar jobs.

658
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:15,530
Absolutely need an education. In
manufacturing jobs, you do better.

659
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:18,380
You have to deal with machinery. You
have to know things about the machinery.

660
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:24,520
I was in Peru quite a ways back and
they took peasants off the Altiplano.

661
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:29,180
There's high dry playing with there's no
water and the land is terrible and they

662
00:42:29,181 --> 00:42:33,710
live on about a dollar a day.
And in order to get a job in the mines,

663
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:36,890
the first job is you take a shovel
and you shove your, you know,

664
00:42:36,891 --> 00:42:40,340
there's big machines that eat
away at the rock face and,

665
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,970
but a lot of it drops down in the,
uh,

666
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,580
people with shovels to get the rest
of it and dump it into the truck.

667
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:51,290
So this is really a minimum skill, labor
job. But they needed to have two things,

668
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:55,430
which not everyone had one.
To know that machines can be dangerous,

669
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,290
that they can get hot from
spinning around, that they
can be electrified. They do.

670
00:42:58,291 --> 00:43:01,910
You don't just touch something
unless you know what's going on.

671
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:06,380
And the same thing, you have
to know enough about time
to get to the job on time.

672
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:10,760
Every day to shift comes on you. You've
got to be there and the peasants don't,

673
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:15,110
don't come knowing those sorts of things.
And those that do know those things.

674
00:43:15,111 --> 00:43:16,830
Can, uh, uh,

675
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:21,870
double their income to like $2
a day if they can get jobs in.

676
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,900
So, uh, that's,

677
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:31,901
that's even the most basic kind of
job requires a kind of mindset and

678
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:35,930
educational thing that you
don't get a generally on a farm.

679
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:37,973
Um,

680
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:45,290
so education becomes an extremely
valuable, uh, commodity.

681
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,140
And uh,

682
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:53,630
so in order to get the job and to
stay live, kids have to be healthy.

683
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:56,300
So you also have to put,

684
00:43:56,510 --> 00:44:00,890
you have to put money into education and
you have put money into health for the

685
00:44:00,891 --> 00:44:03,890
kids. That's the projected
to have. If you have a,

686
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:07,790
you can have a bond like your kid,
you got to have a safe deposit box for it.

687
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:12,790
That's like health insurance or health
care for it and otherwise it's going to

688
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:18,050
disappear on you.
So this investment in children,

689
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:21,260
which in education, in
health care, uh, uh,

690
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,160
becomes a very good deal that if you
can manage to invest that much in your

691
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:27,140
child,
didn't go to the city or go abroad,

692
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,860
get a good job and their income
will be so much more than yours,

693
00:44:30,861 --> 00:44:32,910
that they can send you
back a significant amount.

694
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,000
These investments with
children called human capital,

695
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,550
the result of them is
called human capital.

696
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,400
It's the health and
education of the population.

697
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:47,060
And it's now realized that when
the economists study, you know,

698
00:44:47,061 --> 00:44:51,060
why is one country rich and one country
poor? Well, part of is their physical,

699
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:55,260
their stock of physical capital,
physical capital is the factories,

700
00:44:55,261 --> 00:44:59,610
the machines, the buildings, all
the stuff that you come knock on.

701
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:03,630
But they realize that that's
not the biggest difference.
The biggest differences.

702
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:08,100
Human cat, what they call human capital,
how educated and how healthy, uh,

703
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:11,490
the population is.
So it's a very big

704
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:12,993
thing.

705
00:45:14,910 --> 00:45:18,060
And so an interesting thing we have to,
uh,

706
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,713
uh,

707
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:26,410
different factors that are now in play.
Why a child becomes a good investment,

708
00:45:26,411 --> 00:45:30,400
good one. With education, they
can get a higher paying job.

709
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,470
And with better health they can live
longer and the parents can live longer.

710
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,800
So they're paying you back not only at
a higher rate if they're educated and

711
00:45:40,961 --> 00:45:43,780
healthy,
but for a longer time period.

712
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:48,260
So we normally think of the things they,
well you get a certain benefit, uh,

713
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,190
from uh,
their education earning more per,

714
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,860
per year and you get a certain
benefit from their health.

715
00:45:53,861 --> 00:45:56,860
They're living longer and you
might be tended to add those too,

716
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:02,040
but in fact they multiply that you're
getting a certain extra amount per year

717
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,620
over 30 years or something like that.

718
00:46:05,621 --> 00:46:10,621
So the two factors multiply and that's
one of the really big things in Becker's

719
00:46:10,721 --> 00:46:15,721
theory is how these factors that go into
the income that a child will bring in

720
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,870
the health and the education
multiply with each other.

721
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:25,120
And so even fairly small increments
in either one, the to a very big,

722
00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:29,560
uh, return multiplication
is a very large effect.

723
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:34,240
So the end, the end of
this, that as an investment,

724
00:46:34,241 --> 00:46:37,630
good investment in children's health
and education is very rewarding.

725
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:42,400
It's a really rewarding kind of investment
in the kind of economic situation

726
00:46:42,401 --> 00:46:43,720
that we've been discussing.

727
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:49,630
But here's the catch that if you're poor,

728
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:53,050
you can't make these investments in
a whole lot of a lot of children.

729
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,000
And so the best strategy,

730
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:00,180
instead of having a lot of children of
dividing up your assets among a bunch of

731
00:47:00,431 --> 00:47:04,270
them, you have a very few children
and you concentrate your assets,

732
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:04,961
your concentrate,

733
00:47:04,961 --> 00:47:09,961
what you can invest in a few children
and you get them fairly good healthcare

734
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:12,700
and as good an education
as you can get for it.

735
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:18,400
Children that have these two things, it's
called the quality of the child. Again,

736
00:47:18,401 --> 00:47:23,200
that's another economic jargon term that
the health and education child are of

737
00:47:23,201 --> 00:47:25,090
the quality of the child.

738
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:30,480
And the way this change that goes in
the demographic transition is called the

739
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:38,341
switch or the trade off from quantity
to quality before the transition.

740
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:39,693
Uh,

741
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:44,050
parents want a lot of children because
the main thing they're worried about is

742
00:47:44,051 --> 00:47:45,670
the probability that
they're just going to die.

743
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:50,420
And there's nothing in the parents can do
about that. The local folk medicine is,

744
00:47:50,421 --> 00:47:52,030
is almost totally ineffective.

745
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:54,580
So the kids are just going
to die kind of randomly.

746
00:47:55,390 --> 00:48:00,070
But as time goes on, uh,
that's, that's not true anymore.

747
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:03,940
They can do something about it to keep
their kids alive and they get the kids

748
00:48:03,941 --> 00:48:08,440
educated so that they can earn
a good rate of, of, of income.

749
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:10,480
And so they,

750
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:15,220
there's this trade of the switch from
wanting quantity to one in quality in the

751
00:48:15,221 --> 00:48:16,054
children.

752
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:20,990
And parents catch onto this very quickly.
Some of the,

753
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:25,991
the very re rapidity of some of the third
world fertility declines has been due

754
00:48:26,591 --> 00:48:30,010
to that. Uh, when the land
gets filled up, my people,

755
00:48:30,011 --> 00:48:32,530
it becomes very obvious right away
that you've got to do something.

756
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:36,280
And the only job, the only thing available
jobs in the cities, and it's very,

757
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,730
they know very well that,
that the kids need education to,

758
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,680
to compete in that job market.

759
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,320
So in terms of policy,

760
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:49,930
you get some really
interesting kind of conundrums.

761
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:54,670
So one is education is what the
people want. They want it desperately.

762
00:48:55,510 --> 00:49:00,490
And yet if they keep having
eight children, the country
is going to be hopeless.

763
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:04,900
So policymakers like the idea
that in order to get an education,

764
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,030
people have to reduce their,
their fertility, but they
also is with good hearts,

765
00:49:10,031 --> 00:49:11,620
wanted to make education free.

766
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:16,950
So the question in a developing country
of how much to charge for education is,

767
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,561
is a very,

768
00:49:17,561 --> 00:49:21,790
very major issue because you need to
strike a balance between allowing,

769
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:26,710
setting the price low enough so that you
can get a lot of your children educated

770
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:31,100
yet setting some price so that it's an
incentive to parents to not just absolute

771
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:34,840
flood the system and
overwhelmed, uh, everything.

772
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,290
And wherever you set this,

773
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:43,090
parents will always use strategies
to maximize their, their,

774
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,880
their benefit.
And one of the kinds of strategies that,

775
00:49:45,881 --> 00:49:50,881
that people worry about that parents
can do is have the first child stays at

776
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:55,720
home.
Second child stays at home entry,

777
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:59,590
that child grows up and starts doing
work and then they can do the work around

778
00:49:59,591 --> 00:50:03,220
the house that's needed in the weeding
the field and the work on the farm.

779
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,970
Your third child is now in a sense
surplus. You don't need their labor.

780
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:10,720
If there's free education, get them
educated, send them to the city.

781
00:50:10,870 --> 00:50:15,130
And you can do that. If there's no cost
to getting a child educated third, fourth,

782
00:50:15,131 --> 00:50:18,160
fifth, sixth, there's no limit to the
number of children that you can have.

783
00:50:18,161 --> 00:50:22,180
You send them all off to the city, they
send you back money. Same with healthcare,

784
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:27,440
that if you have a a welfare government
and it doesn't set this just right.

785
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:31,460
If, if, uh, hell, if healthcare
is also a free or nearly free,

786
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:34,730
then again, there's no cost
to having the extra children.

787
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:38,900
People may continue to have that many
children and then the whole system just

788
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:43,070
gets flooded and you
have a failed experiment.

789
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:49,440
So education and healthcare are,
um,

790
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:54,880
some of the fundamental variables in this,
uh,

791
00:50:54,881 --> 00:50:56,710
this religion between
economic development,

792
00:50:56,711 --> 00:50:59,950
jobs becoming available and how
many children that you have.

793
00:51:01,150 --> 00:51:05,620
And in developing countries, as you know,
there's a lot of people, labor is cheap,

794
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:08,690
but capital is scarce.
They're not rich. They,

795
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,250
they don't have a lot to invest
in factories and everything.

796
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:16,300
So it's hard for them to build a steel
plant or a petrochemical plant that takes

797
00:51:16,301 --> 00:51:21,220
a lot of box in a lot of know how. But
what about, uh, producing a teacher?

798
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:24,160
Is that an expensive or cheap proposition?

799
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,370
Teaching is labor intensive.
It's not capital intensive.

800
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,320
You need maybe a chalkboard and some
chalk and some places don't even have have

801
00:51:32,321 --> 00:51:33,154
that.

802
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:38,050
And so education is being labor
intensive is one of the cheap things that

803
00:51:38,051 --> 00:51:38,920
countries can do.

804
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:43,680
So basically even the poorest
country can have a surplus labor law,

805
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:47,860
largely female and give it a minimal
amount of training or you have to do is

806
00:51:47,861 --> 00:51:52,060
make them basically literate and they
can go out into the villages and teach

807
00:51:52,061 --> 00:51:56,710
children to read and to write,
which is an amazing progress.

808
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,660
And then that bootstraps itself.

809
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,780
And if you look at at
developing countries,

810
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,710
that's one of the things
they really invest in is,

811
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,210
is his first primary education.

812
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:10,990
And they get a big return from that.
They're very,

813
00:52:10,991 --> 00:52:13,480
they have the finances to do that.
And in fact,

814
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:18,940
almost all developing countries also
have a pretty good, uh, university,

815
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:20,600
uh,
structure,

816
00:52:20,601 --> 00:52:24,550
not a research level university
but a teaching university.

817
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,020
So if you look at places
they're producing doctors, uh,

818
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,190
I don't know if you know this,
but in America,

819
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:34,870
something like half of all the doctors
that get licensed or trained abroad now,

820
00:52:34,871 --> 00:52:36,760
some of them, England,
Sweden, Germany or you know,

821
00:52:36,761 --> 00:52:40,810
train pretty much of the way we are, but
they're coming in from India, Pakistan,

822
00:52:40,811 --> 00:52:42,730
Philippines,
places like that.

823
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:47,530
And the people just as smart as anywhere
else there, there may be work harder,

824
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:51,730
more and more ambitious. Maybe it's
harder even to get an to get into,

825
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:55,360
but they can train thousands and
thousands of doctors and you know,

826
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:59,360
a medical school class in Mexico City
will be like 3000 students or something.

827
00:52:59,361 --> 00:53:04,120
The law classes are all very, very huge
because it's cheap and the, and the,

828
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,590
the marginal cost, if you're
ready, have a class in it,

829
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:11,410
in physiology with somebody lecturing
and another hundred students doesn't cost

830
00:53:11,411 --> 00:53:16,310
you anything. So education
up to very high levels, uh,

831
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,790
is is something that,
that uh,

832
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:24,130
developing countries can often afford
because it's a labor intensive occupation.

833
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:26,790
And when you think of,
of, of the brain drain,

834
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:31,120
what happens then as you get more doctors
than India can support more doctors or

835
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:34,860
the Mexico can support.
So they want to come to the United States.

836
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:38,310
You get the brain drain that the most
highly educated people from all these

837
00:53:38,311 --> 00:53:39,300
developing countries,

838
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,630
which the government has invested
in to to pay for their education.

839
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:45,540
They go to England, they go
to America, they go to France,

840
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:49,770
they go to Japan if they're
allowed in and they get a job.

841
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,940
So that's the old style brain drain where
the people physically moved to here.

842
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:58,110
But it's also the modern
job flight that now again,

843
00:53:58,111 --> 00:54:02,250
as I said with the Internet and cheap
shipping costs or these jobs can stay in

844
00:54:02,251 --> 00:54:05,820
India or somewhere. And we shipped
the jobs out the accounting.

845
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:10,020
So accounting is done in the daytime
banks to all the kinds of transactions.

846
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:14,100
They ship all that data overnight
to India. And during our night,

847
00:54:14,101 --> 00:54:16,470
which is India's day,
the Indian accounts work on it.

848
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:19,110
And by the morning you have
all your accounts settled.

849
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:23,370
Engineering has worked on in
Chicago, uh, during the day.

850
00:54:23,371 --> 00:54:28,140
And then however far the plans of God a
shipped off to you can usually India and

851
00:54:28,141 --> 00:54:32,160
the, the, uh, the architects, their
work on it and shipped back to Chicago.

852
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,560
And that's increasing.

853
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,940
And so one of the important factors
in this is basically the cheapness of

854
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:42,600
education, that education,
labor intensive operation.

855
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:45,810
And so developing countries
can do it quite well,

856
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:52,650
but within the developing countries,
they can rather rapidly produce a lot of,

857
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:57,050
say, college educated people. And these
people expect good jobs. You know,

858
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,630
they've risen up by maybe by great
amount of effort risen up from,

859
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,880
from the utter poverty in their villages.

860
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:07,770
And now they have a college education and
they're ready for a job at the country,

861
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:10,230
usually doesn't have jobs for them.

862
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:14,790
The economies is not yet developed.
So what is,

863
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:19,791
there's a tremendous demand for BlueCat
for white color jobs and who and in,

864
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:22,800
and if they don't get
these white collar jobs,

865
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:26,700
they're tremendous unrest among the young
educated people. They're very verbal,

866
00:55:26,701 --> 00:55:29,130
they know each other, they know
how to communicate. They're mobile.

867
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,150
You can have a very unstable
political situation up right away.

868
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:36,840
So the governments and all
the things almost always
respond with government jobs.

869
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:41,340
Since there isn't a private sector
is not yet capable of producing John,

870
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:45,780
there's government jobs and you'd get
these enormously bloated bureaucracies and

871
00:55:45,781 --> 00:55:49,770
almost every, uh, underdeveloped country
where to do the tiniest little thing,

872
00:55:49,771 --> 00:55:52,850
you need 16 different people to,
to stamp it and sign it and improving.

873
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:55,950
It takes three days for each of
these people to make a decision.

874
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:03,000
And so that's sort of things
get out of whack when,

875
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,970
because it's cheap.
You can produce a lot of education,

876
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,310
but then you can't get them jobs.

877
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:11,340
And then once you establish
these big bureaucracies,

878
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:16,050
then further economic development become
difficult because to do the slightest

879
00:56:16,051 --> 00:56:19,410
thing, build a factory or do
something new or import something,

880
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,330
you have to go through
all this bureaucracy.

881
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:24,940
And because the government doesn't
have money pay these people, you know,

882
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:27,370
they get paid very poorly. So
corruption, they can, you know,

883
00:56:27,371 --> 00:56:29,950
if you give us very small bribe,
this is,

884
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:32,010
this is a wonderful thing
for the bureaucrats.

885
00:56:32,011 --> 00:56:35,140
So he'll pay attention to your thing
and only take two days instead of three

886
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:39,400
days to approve whatever it
is you've given him. So again,

887
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:44,670
this is the problems of the relationship
with demography and international and

888
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,330
economic development in poor countries.
It's all these interlocking things.

889
00:56:49,331 --> 00:56:53,830
The demography always interlocks with
every other aspect of your economic

890
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,203
development.

891
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,710
Okay. So in terms of, uh,

892
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:08,530
the whole picture of,
of the change in the world,

893
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,240
probably this is the kind
of sequence does that,

894
00:57:12,241 --> 00:57:16,240
we've talked a lot of different factors
that, that happened to bring people into,

895
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:20,000
into
modernity.

896
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:25,320
And so I want to sort of
summarize a lot of that. Um,

897
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:28,030
the first thing that apparently happens,

898
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:33,040
it starts in the renaissance in the
west and then continues on into,

899
00:57:33,371 --> 00:57:36,970
and the enlightenment and
then the industrial evolution
is that the first thing

900
00:57:36,971 --> 00:57:40,960
that happens is people start thinking
supernaturally about things and start

901
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:44,800
thinking about the real world and
trying to think rationally about it.

902
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:49,030
So technological progress and sewers
and allows them better shipping,

903
00:57:49,031 --> 00:57:52,630
better navigation. They get all the way
to America, discover American foods,

904
00:57:52,631 --> 00:57:56,950
bring them back and start a
population increase. Uh, in Europe,

905
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:01,390
uh, good ways to prevent
disease are discovered. Uh,

906
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:03,370
industrial revolution
increases productivity.

907
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:06,910
You start thinking rational about
things and everything can get better,

908
00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:10,490
more food and it means less staff.

909
00:58:10,491 --> 00:58:15,491
And so population increases and the
starts in the 17 hundreds in Europe and

910
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:21,040
really starts saying 19 hundreds in
the currently developing countries.

911
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:24,070
And we saw before that sometimes you know,

912
00:58:24,071 --> 00:58:27,820
that the relationship between
mortality drop and fertility drop was,

913
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:32,560
was not a given. And,
but in almost all cases,

914
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:36,880
whether they went in parallel,
that mortality was below fertility.

915
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:42,060
So since early time population has been
increasing and even in a still agrarian

916
00:58:42,161 --> 00:58:44,360
society,
that means is population increase,

917
00:58:44,361 --> 00:58:49,361
the pressure on the land
is going to go up and uh,

918
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:54,370
you're, you're going to get
tinier and Tinier plots until
you reach a crisis. Now,

919
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:58,270
some places it remember what a
surprise we had that England,

920
00:58:58,271 --> 00:59:01,270
which was an industrially advanced
as urbanization was advanced.

921
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:03,040
It's educational then
everything was advanced,

922
00:59:03,250 --> 00:59:07,480
but it had one of the latest
fertility transitions. Why?

923
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:11,650
Maybe because of primogeniture that they
didn't have that kind of pressure on

924
00:59:11,651 --> 00:59:15,550
the land because only the oldest son
inherited and the land plots did not get

925
00:59:15,551 --> 00:59:16,540
smaller and smaller.

926
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:21,320
And the political structure was such that
the landed gentry gentry were the ones

927
00:59:21,321 --> 00:59:22,580
that controlled parliament.

928
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:27,230
And the city's really didn't count
that much where the excess people were.

929
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:32,530
So England of France did not
experience the same kind of tiny,

930
00:59:33,420 --> 00:59:38,420
entire pots and the vast amounts of
rural poverty that other places had.

931
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:45,030
So anyway, uh, with the scarcity of land,

932
00:59:45,031 --> 00:59:48,200
the plots get smaller and
huge number in most places.

933
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:52,070
Huge numbers of people fall into
this abject kind of rural poverty.

934
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,250
And then two things that
I'm talking about today,

935
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,400
one or one of the things that I've
talked about today happens next for as

936
00:59:58,401 --> 01:00:01,280
individual families have to
figure out a new strategy,

937
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:06,080
they realize that education for kids
is the only way out of of their their

938
01:00:06,081 --> 01:00:10,670
situation and that means that they have
to have fewer children at the same time

939
01:00:10,671 --> 01:00:12,770
with the spectrum,
they're currently developing countries,

940
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,510
the western governments,

941
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,660
either out of the goodness of their
heart or because they're scared about

942
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:22,370
revolution and communism and
anti-americanism, they have
to help the third world.

943
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:27,610
So they start supporting family planning
programs and what they do is two

944
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:32,660
things. One, they buy advertising
and just setting up Clements,

945
01:00:32,661 --> 01:00:33,890
the the social,

946
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:37,880
the cultural acceptability of
controlling fertility by some sort of

947
01:00:37,881 --> 01:00:39,470
contraception becomes acceptable.

948
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:44,740
It's not any more a totally taboo topic
and then they actually provide the goods

949
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:47,750
themselves,
so allows people to work there.

950
01:00:47,751 --> 01:00:51,550
Their economic interest is in having
fewer children. But if their culture,

951
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:55,010
if there's not the contraceptives
available as say in China,

952
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,230
there was for a long time or
it's not cultural acceptable,

953
01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:02,200
they can't act on that desire for
family planning programs committee,

954
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:05,200
the government ones are foreign
supported ones and you know,

955
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,690
their own government supported
ones or foreign ones towards once.

956
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:13,930
And that allows people to act on
their desires to have fewer children,

957
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:19,430
then fertility falls because they're
now using some sort of contraception.

958
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:24,140
Uh, and then as we saw, I guess,

959
01:01:24,141 --> 01:01:28,160
La last lecture that when fertility falls,

960
01:01:28,161 --> 01:01:32,180
then you get this bulge of workers
and then the economy takes off.

961
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:37,540
So that's kind of a way of
putting the whole thing together.

962
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:44,340
Now, this is all very nice theory
that I proposed to you. Uh,

963
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:48,860
and, uh, you noticed, or not too many
data slides that I put up for this.

964
01:01:48,861 --> 01:01:52,310
It sounds great. I'm sure
you're all convinced yet
that's, that's a good answer.

965
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:57,800
When you started looking at
this, um, uh, in, in more detail,

966
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:02,870
uh,
things don't turn out to be so convincing.

967
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:07,610
Um, one about the cost of children, uh,

968
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:11,480
going up, which is the first part with
the children as a consumption. Good.

969
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:16,280
Well, what the children actually
need. They need some clothing,

970
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:20,730
they need some food, and it's
basically what they need to stay alive.

971
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,760
And that's all that they
got in the old days. Well,

972
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:28,890
what's happened to the price of
clothing in the last several decades?

973
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:34,260
No price or coding or wrong was fallen
tremendously. Clothing with a new fabric,

974
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:36,900
you can't wear it out. First
of all, I have that problem.

975
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:40,740
I can't throw things away. So my
clothes is just wrong. It's very cheap.

976
01:02:40,741 --> 01:02:42,810
It's made in China, Bangladesh,
all around the world.

977
01:02:42,811 --> 01:02:47,030
The price of clothing who has dropped
tremendously as a fraction of income, uh,

978
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,110
you always have to do it
as a fraction of income.

979
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:52,920
The price of food has dropped around
the world as a fraction of income.

980
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:58,070
So the basic necessities of children have
really dropped in price and drop quite

981
01:02:58,261 --> 01:03:02,670
drastically. When you see a graph of
that, it, it's, it's quite drastic.

982
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:08,150
So if you consider the cost of providing
the same goods that pretends people

983
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:10,650
provided for the kids,

984
01:03:10,651 --> 01:03:15,651
if two cost of providing that now has
gone way down as a fraction of income.

985
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,990
And as I said,
often it,

986
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:23,040
usually education is provided
free by the government and uh,

987
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:27,570
sometimes, uh, healthcare is
provided free by the government.

988
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,500
So,
uh,

989
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:33,900
it doesn't look like an economic issue
that if you want to just have kids the

990
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:37,110
way you're used to have them,
uh, the cost has not risen,

991
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:42,780
but the cost has gone down. But what
has changed is in the minds of people,

992
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:43,680
uh,

993
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:48,660
they now perceive that they must provide
for their children to completely expand

994
01:03:48,661 --> 01:03:52,700
different than expanded set of
goods than, than previously. Uh,

995
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:55,590
children have to have the
kind of education that they,

996
01:03:55,591 --> 01:03:59,400
that they never had before. They have
to have enrichment activities, uh,

997
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:04,470
all kinds of stuff. And if
you read about China, I mean,

998
01:04:04,471 --> 01:04:05,820
it's amazing what Chinese,

999
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:09,240
they have only one child and
that child is so over programmed.

1000
01:04:09,241 --> 01:04:10,380
It makes you look lazy.

1001
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:14,640
I mean they go to dancing lessons and
music lessons in English last at all

1002
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:17,760
afterschool.
The kid is just working like crazy.

1003
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:21,390
You may have noticed near the beginning
but not at the beginning of the previous,

1004
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:24,300
like a whole bunch of Chinese
came in and sat over there.

1005
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,080
They were the presidents of the student
nurse. I didn't know who they were.

1006
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:32,010
They turned out to be the presidents of
the student associations and some of the

1007
01:04:32,011 --> 01:04:35,160
really big universities in
China. So these are, you know,

1008
01:04:35,161 --> 01:04:39,060
to get to be top dog and huge
university is a big, big deal.

1009
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:42,480
And what were they interested
in this issue of modernization?

1010
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:46,980
That they're spoiled.
They realize that they were telling me,

1011
01:04:46,981 --> 01:04:49,890
I spoke to them later that they
didn't want to have siblings.

1012
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,770
They were really enjoying getting
everything as an only child.

1013
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:56,250
They did not want a sibling.
She's laughing cause you know that story.

1014
01:04:56,730 --> 01:05:01,260
But also the other side of the coin is
as the only child they have to succeed,

1015
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:04,800
they have to get top
grades in their education.

1016
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:09,330
So the amount of pressure on them to
work like crazy all the time to study,

1017
01:05:09,331 --> 01:05:12,600
study, study, uh, is severe.

1018
01:05:12,601 --> 01:05:16,150
And they were interested in largely in
the pressures on them, which they were,

1019
01:05:16,151 --> 01:05:18,780
they were feeling guest as presidents of
the student bodies that are probably be

1020
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:23,860
overachievers like crazy. And so they
would feel this pressure enormously.

1021
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:28,960
And then your other stories where
kids learn to play this game.

1022
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:31,180
So if a parent wants them,
oh,

1023
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:34,240
why don't you wash the dishes tonight
or help around the house? Oh, if I do,

1024
01:05:34,241 --> 01:05:38,410
if I take time away from my studying,
I'll fail my course. So, uh,

1025
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:42,680
it's this change in mentality,
uh,

1026
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:47,510
that has raised the cost of childbearing.
It's not the actual that, that the,

1027
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:52,210
the actual cost of child raising
if you raise them the old way,

1028
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:56,950
that went way down. But there's been
a culture change that's required,

1029
01:05:56,951 --> 01:06:00,610
an enormous increase in the
expenditures on children.

1030
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:05,500
And of course nowadays for you parents
don't expect probably anything from you

1031
01:06:05,501 --> 01:06:08,010
in return as, as an
investment. And you know,

1032
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:11,830
just to pay one year of Yale is probably
more than some Chinese might make in

1033
01:06:11,831 --> 01:06:16,680
their whole life. Okay. Um,

1034
01:06:19,330 --> 01:06:24,020
now opportunity cost is
another interesting thing.
We talked about, uh, uh,

1035
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:26,990
mother's time.
So it was his,

1036
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:31,420
remember the cost of children is
not just what you spend in cash,

1037
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:34,750
uh, but it's the opportunity
cost of childcare time.

1038
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:36,940
And if you're out doing childcare,

1039
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:39,340
you don't have the option
to also work at that.

1040
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:43,450
And studies have shown that it's actually
the time cost of children that way

1041
01:06:43,451 --> 01:06:47,590
outweighs the, the, the, the direct
cost of buying things for them.

1042
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:52,860
And 70% of the cost of a child is in
the value of the time spent on it.

1043
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:55,870
So as people get richer,
yes,

1044
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:59,920
they buy more for their children
and they buy more expensive things,

1045
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:03,670
but their earning power
also rises. So, uh,

1046
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,620
and it's this rise in earning
power that makes the 70%, uh, that,

1047
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:13,360
so the 70% of the cost of children is at
the time they're not spending working.

1048
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:18,200
But, um, when,

1049
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:22,180
when the people go out and do
these times study things. Uh,

1050
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,100
I don't know how well you can see this,

1051
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:29,340
but this is the amount of time that
a mother spends in child care for her

1052
01:07:29,981 --> 01:07:32,650
children.
And there's one children,

1053
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:37,680
it's 2.2 hours a day and even up to six
when they have five to six children,

1054
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:45,130
the wife is not employed as a stay
at home mom. It's 1.9 there's,

1055
01:07:45,131 --> 01:07:45,940
there's really no,

1056
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:48,970
no significant difference depending on
the number of children that you have.

1057
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:52,900
This is upstate New York and then I
think the 1950s this is fairly recent.

1058
01:07:52,901 --> 01:07:54,340
This is not even a developing country.

1059
01:07:54,550 --> 01:07:56,980
The amount of time spent
is actually quite small.

1060
01:07:57,130 --> 01:08:00,090
Now compare this to the
mother getting a job. She's a,

1061
01:08:00,091 --> 01:08:02,410
so people were 40 hours a week.

1062
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:07,300
Say if it's a nine to five and if they
don't get paid for the half hour of lunch

1063
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:08,860
they can, it's like, I'm sorry.

1064
01:08:08,860 --> 01:08:11,890
They work eight hours a day and
depending on how you do lunch,

1065
01:08:11,891 --> 01:08:15,560
it can be eight and a half or nine hours
and then they have to commute and maybe

1066
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,960
half an hour to work and half an hour
back was getting properly dressed for the,

1067
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:23,600
for the job and commuting and
getting there. So we're talking nine,

1068
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:26,360
10 hours a day that are
working mother in this case.

1069
01:08:26,361 --> 01:08:28,190
But it could be a father
is away from home.

1070
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:31,070
So that's the cost of having
a job is like 10 hours.

1071
01:08:31,370 --> 01:08:34,160
The cost of having any number of children,
I mean it's seven to nine,

1072
01:08:34,161 --> 01:08:37,280
something different is going on and you
know, it's only about two hours a day.

1073
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:42,820
So the cost in time of children
is not really all that great.

1074
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:46,820
And the only time it gets bigger as if
the child is less than one year old,

1075
01:08:46,821 --> 01:08:51,500
which it takes three or four hours
a day to take care of the child. Uh,

1076
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:56,210
now this is for all the members of
the family. This is just the mother.

1077
01:08:56,450 --> 01:09:01,210
This is all members of the
family. So again, now this
is 2.7. Compare that to two.

1078
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,440
They have one child,
it's a half an hour.

1079
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,610
The other members of the family together
put a half an hour into the child is

1080
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:09,170
2.3 this is a little bigger,

1081
01:09:09,260 --> 01:09:13,730
but it's never more than an hour a day
put into the child for all of the other,

1082
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:16,940
uh, uh, uh, things. And again,

1083
01:09:16,941 --> 01:09:20,090
it doesn't change an awful lot
with a lot of children later.

1084
01:09:20,091 --> 01:09:24,770
Children are cheap because there's
basic little incremental cost to that.

1085
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:30,070
Here's more recent data and this,
the,

1086
01:09:30,071 --> 01:09:33,840
the,
the red line here is mother's child care,

1087
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:37,460
and this is per week,
not per day.

1088
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,600
So it's something starts out
in the sixties and seventies,

1089
01:09:41,601 --> 01:09:46,070
which is comparable to the
data you just saw. It was nine,

1090
01:09:46,071 --> 01:09:50,510
10 hours a week, which is just a
little bit over an hour, a day.

1091
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:53,990
And time goes on and I'll talk about
that later. It didn't, it increases,

1092
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:58,490
but it's very small. And here's the
father's house work. It's like two,

1093
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:02,240
two and a half hours a day.
So it's not,

1094
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:07,450
so the amount of of time it
takes to deal with children,

1095
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:10,730
although our myth is that it's very,
very time consuming.

1096
01:10:10,731 --> 01:10:12,740
And actual fact when you,
when you take the data,

1097
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:15,650
it doesn't really work out that way.

1098
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:20,660
And now you have be careful this is x,
this is extra time.

1099
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:25,010
So this, uh, if you do house or this,

1100
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:29,120
these numbers are extra time.
So even if you have no children,

1101
01:10:29,121 --> 01:10:32,440
take certain amount of time to, to take
care of a house. So that's, that's,

1102
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:33,590
that's a fixed thing.

1103
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:36,830
And then all of these numbers ask how
much extra time are you spending if you

1104
01:10:36,831 --> 01:10:39,380
have children. So compared to people
without children to people, children,

1105
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:43,340
and of course that's the proper
number. Uh, without that we want,

1106
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:47,300
um,
and

1107
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:58,660
okay, so here is, um,

1108
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:04,130
interesting thing.
So as this data gets more sophisticated,

1109
01:11:04,550 --> 01:11:05,181
you say,
well,

1110
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:09,980
what does childcare mean when you can
take no children and compare it to people

1111
01:11:09,981 --> 01:11:13,680
with children. But if you
look at differently what the
mother is actually doing.

1112
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:17,380
Sometimes it's her primary activity.
She's actually doing the child,

1113
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:19,830
not really doing,
if anything else she's doing.

1114
01:11:19,831 --> 01:11:23,550
It's secondary like watching TV
or Washington or something. No,

1115
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:26,610
that's primary and that's
an an hour and a half a day.

1116
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,470
If it's primary or secondary.
So she may be what?

1117
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:34,020
Washing the dishes or vacuuming and the
kid is right there and she's talking to

1118
01:11:34,021 --> 01:11:38,970
the kid and playing with a little bit.
It goes up a little bit and,

1119
01:11:38,971 --> 01:11:41,670
but it's still this,
this is pretty much the same number.

1120
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:44,490
You seen the two previous slides,
so there's a couple of hours a day.

1121
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:47,070
This is again per day and
the other slide was per week.

1122
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:50,820
If you just count the time
there with the children at all,

1123
01:11:50,821 --> 01:11:53,850
you know they're linking both be watching
television together or they're not

1124
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:56,940
really doing childcare that just
with the children it's still,

1125
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,040
it gets to be more significant.

1126
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:03,360
But this is not time taken away from
anything else that just a child happens to

1127
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:04,194
be there

1128
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:08,880
now and this is that this
is moderately stable.

1129
01:12:08,881 --> 01:12:12,150
It doesn't change between
65 and 98 about the same,

1130
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:15,000
a little bit different
about about the same.

1131
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:20,280
Now there's something interesting that
you might have missed in the slides.

1132
01:12:20,281 --> 01:12:23,380
I know we're going to stop in a minute.
Uh,

1133
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:28,970
what's happens between 1965 and 1998 or
in the previous graph between 1965 and

1134
01:12:31,411 --> 01:12:34,770
2003 women go to work.

1135
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:39,510
There's a huge difference in the number
of women, the fraction either the num,

1136
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:43,740
both the number and the fraction of women
working between any of these ages and

1137
01:12:43,741 --> 01:12:44,081
yet what,

1138
01:12:44,081 --> 01:12:49,081
what do you see the amount of time that
the mother spends in Charlotte care goes

1139
01:12:49,501 --> 01:12:51,720
up from, you know, the
old during this period,

1140
01:12:51,721 --> 01:12:56,670
nine to 10 hours up to like 14 hours.
That as women go to work,

1141
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,760
they spend more time with their children.

1142
01:13:00,450 --> 01:13:04,830
Part of the answer to that is this is
in the rest of house care non child.

1143
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:09,090
How scared and with modern
gadgets and throw away stuff,

1144
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:13,770
that amount has allowed women to
spend more time with children.

1145
01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:14,790
So again,

1146
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:18,930
all this goes to contradict that part
of the economic theory that says that

1147
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:24,620
childcare competes with working and
the evidence is very, very skinny. Uh,

1148
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,690
uh, on that hypothesis. In fact,

1149
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:31,410
if you ask your mothers were
any woman that has children,

1150
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:36,000
what goes away when they go to work,
not childcare,

1151
01:13:36,810 --> 01:13:38,430
leisure time,
leisure time,

1152
01:13:38,431 --> 01:13:43,290

what women do differently when they work

1153
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:47,670

less leisure time. So, uh,

1154
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:51,450
I guess that's all we can do today.

1155
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:55,830
So see you Thursday.

1156
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,120
We may not continue on this topic.
I think you get, get the idea.
