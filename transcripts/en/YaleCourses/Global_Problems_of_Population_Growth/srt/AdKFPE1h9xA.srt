1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,040
Okay. Um, we are now at
the part of the course.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,170
We're coming up to fairly
modern times. The, uh,

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,620
it's been very breathless run from 6
million years of chimpanzee evolution

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,430
through many,
few million years of human evolution.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,110
And we're coming up to
more or less than 1960s,

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,040
which is the period of the,
the,

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,020
the greatest percentage increase
in human population on earth ever.

8
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:35,070
Uh,

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,070
so this is the peak of what's called the
population explosion and we're gonna be

10
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:45,030
talking about that till almost
the end of the term now.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,550
So I have to tell you,
uh, a little bit, uh,

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,640
truth in truth in a teaching or something.

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,630
How I got interested in this topic

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,520
when I was a just a little
bit older than you are now.

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,230
I did the fairly usual thing of going,

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,360
putting on my short pants and going
around the world and around Asia anyway,

17
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,040
uh, with almost no money in
my pocket. And uh, you all,

18
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:19,050
if you haven't ever done that,
you should do it.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,930
Definitely an after you graduate college.
It was a great time to do it.

20
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,040
And one of the places I went to
was Hong Kong. Now Hong Kong.

21
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:30,090
At that time there were huge numbers
of people coming out of China.

22
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,280
China was still extraordinarily poor at
the time and anytime anybody could leave,

23
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:39,810
they left. And so Hong Kong
was incredibly crowded, uh,

24
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,400
with very poor people. And it's still
incredibly crowded place of course.

25
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,540
And migrants are still
coming out, uh, if they can.

26
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,130
So one of the, uh, what, where
would these people going to live?

27
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,640
They were hillsides with shanty towns,
lots and lots of shanty towns,

28
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,550
but also the low, the, it's right on
the ocean. It's an island, a part of,

29
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:04,860
it's an island.
So the water is free.

30
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,780
So many people were living in little
sampans little boats called sand pans in

31
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,900
just in the harbor dock to
sort of almost anywhere.

32
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,850
And I thought, well, that's
interesting. And one of my friends,

33
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:22,851
I had number of Chinese friends took
me to look at the boats and it was

34
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:28,050
interesting. I, you know, I wasn't
yet really interested in demography,

35
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:32,580
but I couldn't help notice that. Basically
every boat had a little girl on it, 11,

36
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:36,930
12, 13 or something, uh, maybe younger.

37
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,340
And then, uh, we got invited
on the boat one of the first,

38
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:43,800
but one of the boats and uh,
you know,

39
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:47,490
people extremely polite even though
very poor, very polite and you know,

40
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:50,400
a lot of bowing and
shaking hands from my part.

41
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,520
And they wanted to offer me something,
a little bit of tea,

42
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:57,060
a little bit of rice cake,
you know, they're just as
wonderful as they could be.

43
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,940
And I noticed that when something
had to be done, like the tea,

44
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:02,980
how to be gotten or this
side of the other thing,

45
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,900
it was that little girl that was doing
all the work then. Okay, so what,

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,970
that's the one of the kids that's,
you know,

47
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:13,690
it's good for kids to have some
chores and then since you know,

48
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:14,820
they didn't have television nerd,

49
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:18,850
a lot of entertainment and here was this
Westerner and they weren't so used to

50
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:23,050
seeing a lot of westerners on their boats.
I sorta got passed from boat to boat.

51
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,420
When you go walking around the world,
that's a very good thing.

52
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:27,700
If you go to places where
they don't see Westerners,

53
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,680
you can get passed on very easily.

54
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,450
So in boat after boat and this phenomenon
repeated itself that there was this

55
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:37,900
little girl in every boat and she
seemed to be doing all the work.

56
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,150
And so finally I asked my friends,
you know, what's what's going on here?

57
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,320
And a little hard to get the information
out of them, but actual factors,

58
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,430
the form of a,
shall we say,

59
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:56,000
family population control
that uh, the, there,

60
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,600
this was a non contracepting population.

61
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,370
So children just kept coming and they
couldn't support the number of children

62
00:04:03,371 --> 00:04:08,320
that they had and they did
not value girls very much.

63
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:13,500
So what they did is basically they sold
the girls from one boat to the next boat

64
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,430
and then the little girls were
basically servants. Again,

65
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:20,050
you can use the word slave if you want,

66
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:24,400
but servants in whatever
boat they had been sold to.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,700
And some money changed hands.
Of course,

68
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:32,050
all illegal because Hong Kong was
in a hundred British rules. I mean,

69
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:36,880
it's legal almost
everywhere anyway. Um, and,

70
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,360
uh, they were just working, doing as much
work as could be, gotten out of them.

71
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,850
Well that was very sad. Um, but
wasn't a disaster because you know,

72
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:50,470
everybody was living very poorly.
Then later, same trip, uh,

73
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,330
with my medical connections,

74
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,100
I got to tour one of the big British
build Queen Elizabeth Hospital,

75
00:04:57,101 --> 00:05:00,580
one of these big, there's big city
hospitals have ward after ward.

76
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,210
And one of the things I was taken to
see tuberculosis was a very big problem

77
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:09,740
back then. Leprosy was a problem
with tuberculosis was a problem too.

78
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,800
I did something stupid with leprosy.
I visited,

79
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:16,801
there was a leper colony on an island
of Hong Kong and they were constructing

80
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,880
stuff. And uh, and I cannot stand around
what people are working in me not.

81
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:24,600
So I grabbed a pitch for um,
uh,

82
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,500
a pick ax and started working with them.
And of course the pick ax is rough.

83
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,090
It's made of not terribly
well polished wood.

84
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,760
And there I was banging away with
it and it rubs whatever. So, uh, uh,

85
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,030
leprosy is a bacteria that gets into
your skin and the only way to get her to

86
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:44,630
get that leprosy into your skin.
So,

87
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,430
so the lepers had been working with it
and rubbing it into their skin and they

88
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:53,370
were rubbing it into the wood of
the accident on to me, I did not,

89
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,950
I was really stupid in retrospect, but
you know, you do a lot of stupid things.

90
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,800
Um, and I did not catch leprosy in
it. And in fact, by that time, uh,

91
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:07,610
most they had a drug,
an antibiotic against leprosy,

92
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,600
and most of the leper leprosy,
bacillus in these people were dead.

93
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:16,160
So it probably wasn't quite as dangerous
as, as, as, as it might have been. Anyway.

94
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:20,000
I did not catch leprosy.
Sorry, I'm throwing. You can
shake my hand and so forth.

95
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,290
But the people there, and you don't
have the old, this is an aside,

96
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,200
but it's about poverty
and in Philadelphia.

97
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,340
So leprosy affects the nerve cells
and it doesn't make directly make your

98
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:35,750
fingers or nose full off, but you don't
feel wounds. So, you know, he goes,

99
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:39,180
you don't have the nerve cells. So you
don't take care of wounds, adventure,

100
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,370
the fingers gets infested
and infected and damaged.

101
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,420
Damage is kind of constant and
parts of you fall off actually.

102
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,750
But it's not the leprosy bacteria itself,
which only attacks nerves.

103
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,380
It's the damage that you're not paying,
you're not noticing, you're not aware of.

104
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,650
So, okay, sorry. That was an excursion.

105
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,570
So leprosy was a big thing in Hong
Kong at the time as was tuberculosis.

106
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,830
And then the big British hospital,
I went in and,

107
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:09,130
and one of the things I saw
was huge wards, you know,

108
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,940
big places with again,

109
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:16,030
so a ward full of these just pubescent
or prepubescent girls and they all had

110
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:21,380
TB. And then there was two or
three of these wards actually.

111
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:26,030
So very large number of girls
there. And I said, what's going on?

112
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,380
You know, and then the story, the
full story came out that yes, indeed,

113
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,420
there's a lot of selling, uh, of the, of
the children between boats and, and yes,

114
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:40,450
they work and because they're underfed
and overworked and TB is rampant,

115
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,310
these girls get tuberculosis.

116
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:49,080
And then what happens is they take them
to the health station and, and the,

117
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:49,831
the doctor say,

118
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:54,320
you got to build up this girl and they
give them milk powder milk is taking them.

119
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:55,610
What do you think they
do at the milk powder

120
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,550
given to the boy child,
right?

121
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,500
So the girl gets sicker and then she's
getting quite sick and she's brought back

122
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:09,260
and now she's given medicine a antibiotic.

123
00:08:09,261 --> 00:08:12,650
And guess what happens with the
medicine taking to the market?

124
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,890
Sold money is used boy rice or millet
for the boy children eventually.

125
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,570
So TB is probably where it gets the lungs.

126
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:28,100
It can also get in the long bones of
the body and the venture and infects the

127
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:29,750
long bones and the long bone start.

128
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,050
There are huge amounts of pus builds
up and eventually it breaks through the

129
00:08:33,051 --> 00:08:37,930
skin. So what someone who has a child
with this kind of long bone, uh,

130
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:42,920
uh,
tuberculosis sees basically pus the skin,

131
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:47,020
eventually breaks in the Puss,
starts pouring out and uh,

132
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,140
the parents are terribly afraid and
they're afraid for their biological kids.

133
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:55,220
They're biological sons especially.
So as soon as this happens to the girl,

134
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,080
they just dumped dumper at the British at,

135
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:02,340
at whatever the public hospital is.
And um,

136
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,720
I, and, and they just
just abandoned them there.

137
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,630
And what the doctors told me was that
the girls are now 13 and 14 and the lip,

138
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,670
the tuberculosis is so far gone that
there's nothing they can do in the girls

139
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:21,450
die. So this was, you know,

140
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:26,520
my first introduction to that
nexus of extreme poverty,

141
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:30,930
extreme over crowded conditions,
overpopulation.

142
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,100
And I'm not saying the causal
relationship between those two.

143
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:37,650
It's a complicated story,
which we will, we will get to.

144
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,300
But that nexus of you always see whenever
you see incredibly dense populations,

145
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,740
you always see this kind of poverty and
the kinds of things that people undergo,

146
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,400
you know? Yeah. I was trying to put
myself in the mind of a parent. You know,

147
00:09:50,401 --> 00:09:54,900
what kind of a situation of
the end that they sell their,

148
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,810
their daughters to fairly certain death.

149
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,560
And the situation is,
as I've described to you

150
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,900
now, even though I saw this as a huge,
as a very large phenomenon, a surprise,

151
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,350
I've never seen this in the,
in any literature.

152
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,300
I've never seen an
academic paper about it.

153
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:15,610
I've never seen a newspaper
story about it. Uh,

154
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,920
it's not discussed in demographic
circles and some public health circles,

155
00:10:19,921 --> 00:10:23,970
which I'm aware of. I, it, it
just isn't, isn't brought up.

156
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:28,800
And so I'm thinking to myself, you know,
I was not a, a scholar of this thing.

157
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:30,660
And I said,
have I miss remembered this?

158
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:34,170
You very frequently you miss
remember things. Have I blown up?

159
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:37,770
Did I see one or two cases and have
somehow aggrandizement? I eventually,

160
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:42,540
after telling the story quite a bit, even
in their early runnings of this class,

161
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:46,650
I started doubting that this, you know,
that somehow I why such a big thing,

162
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:50,130
why wasn't it shown in one year I
decided, okay, this is the last year.

163
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:52,470
I'm not going to tell this
story again because you know,

164
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,800
I don't have any references for it and
everything. I, I say I try to, you know,

165
00:10:55,801 --> 00:10:56,640
student comes to me,

166
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:59,940
I can give you a reference and you can
see in the notes a lot of things have

167
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:03,750
little references which you probably can't
read, but if you call me or email me,

168
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:07,560
I'll tell you what that
little scribble means. Anyway,

169
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,090
at the end of that lecture,
actually it was about two lectures later,

170
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,630
uh, cause it was an exam
coming up right after that.

171
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,980
After more than this
class in previous years,

172
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:21,900
students used to come up and
we used to spend half an hour,

173
00:11:21,901 --> 00:11:26,901
an hour discussing whatever they want to
discuss and one girl stayed by the side

174
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,860
and then when everybody is gone,

175
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,850
she came up to me a
little bit shy and said,

176
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,770
thank you for telling that story.

177
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,600
My mother was one of
those girls and she would,

178
00:11:39,601 --> 00:11:43,140
she knew from her mother was
basically what I had said.

179
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,830
But the difference was that this was her
bio biological mother and this wasn't

180
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:54,010
an abandoned girl. She said she remembered
being in the hospital with all girls,

181
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:58,900
basically the mother, I'm
sorry, I text him. So I said,

182
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,460
oh my gosh,
you know,

183
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:05,461
would your mother come to class and
describe what this situation was like?

184
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,820
And the, and yes, the mother was in fact
a professor at a college in New Jersey,

185
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:12,430
not Princeton.
And she came up here and,

186
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:16,780
and described it and again described
it in great detail, you know,

187
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:19,630
more or less as, as, as I've described it.

188
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,830
And she said that when she was in the
hospital and she's all the other little

189
00:12:23,831 --> 00:12:26,500
girls who more or less the same age,
same medical problem.

190
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,620
And she said as a little girl,
she was wondering why their parents,

191
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:31,120
their mother didn't come to visit them.

192
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,900
Why their parents didn't come to visit
her. She was one of the few whose,

193
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,680
whose mother I guess the father.
I don't really remember that detail.

194
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,260
Did come to visit.
Well,

195
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:46,350
the doctors kind of noticed that this
girl had a bio parent and so they took her

196
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:51,901
out of the big ward and put a lot of
incredibly special effort into this one

197
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:53,224
girl.

198
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,800
And eventually she got the
bacteria out of her and survived.

199
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,970
She was, uh, uh, you know, walk like this,

200
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:08,720
missing a hip and had a fair number
of, of sequella from the bone, uh,

201
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,120
TB. Uh, but she might,
she got cured, grew up,

202
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,640
managed to get educated, migrate to
America, and became a professor at, at,

203
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,820
as I say, a college in New Jersey and had
a daughter at Yale taking this course.

204
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:26,380
So it's one of the miracle stories.
Uh,

205
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,460
but I'm convinced now that,
and I didn't dream this stuff up.

206
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,250
Okay. So that's really my
personal motivation, that star,

207
00:13:37,251 --> 00:13:40,980
my personal motivation for being,
doing all this uh,

208
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,520
course stuff. Now, uh,

209
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,140
what's the word we described
for this era of the sixties?

210
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,650
The population explosion.

211
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:58,950
Why do we use the word explosion?
It's a rather, uh, you know,

212
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,960
emotive kind of word and it's for this
reason that here is a somewhat fanciful

213
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,920
recreation of history, but we know it's
can't be very much different than this.

214
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:12,250
Cause we know what the, we start
knowing what the populations were here.

215
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,540
So we put in some sort of a reasonable
growth rate in the population going to

216
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:20,500
look like that. The only thing you
can really see is the black death.

217
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,680
Then as we've talked about in this class,

218
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:28,770
starting roughly in the 17
hundreds population just takes off

219
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:34,390
and you've heard of
exponential population growth,

220
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,610
and you may or may not
know what that means,

221
00:14:36,611 --> 00:14:40,690
but what precisely means is
there's a certain rate of growth,

222
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,750
a certain percent per year in each year,

223
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:47,830
the population grows by that same percent,
1% a year or 2% a year,

224
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,060
3% a year.

225
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:54,200
But the percentage growth is the
numbers of people added every year grows

226
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:58,940
because the base grows. But the
percentage edit every year is constant.

227
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,740
That's exponential growth. In
fact, during this period, in fact,

228
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,180
during most of this period,

229
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:10,520
the percentage rate of growth has
been increasing and an increased from

230
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:11,780
somewhere out here of you know,

231
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:16,781
0.001% to then 0.0 1.1 and
in this period it went up to,

232
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,690
uh, two, even 3% global,

233
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:28,280
the whole world population growth
rate in this incredible, uh,

234
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,750
ex expansion. As you can sort of
see, again in this somewhat scheme,

235
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:37,751
Matteis used a graph that the incredible
rate of growth has slowed down a little

236
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:43,730
bit and we'll, we'll talk about what
that means, but it's still growing, uh,

237
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,200
outrage or they project that,
that it should slow down. This is,

238
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,300
we are now at about 6.7 billion.

239
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,450
So some of that graph
is, is, is a projection.

240
00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,820
So you can call this kind of population
of hyper exponential where the,

241
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,800
the rate,

242
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,580
not only does the growth get
faster in an exponential way way,

243
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:12,410
but the rate of growth itself grows.
So it's hyper exponential growth.

244
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:18,260
Now there's a, the whole issue of
population growth is very politicized.

245
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,600
Uh, uh, some people don't think that
we should pay. It is no problem.

246
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:25,850
Some people think we shouldn't
go into anything about it.

247
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,400
Some people think it's too
politically sensitive, uh, to, to,

248
00:16:29,401 --> 00:16:31,670
to say anything about it.
And

249
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,930
in this discussion, one of
the things you hear is, oh,

250
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:38,960
the world's population has
been growing for a long time.

251
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:44,000
We've been able to cope with it. And
Arik economics is, is wonderful. We can,

252
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:45,350
we've industrialized.

253
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,860
The population has been growing and
people have been getting richer.

254
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:51,230
And that is certainly
true since Malthus wrote,

255
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,660
the population has multiplied many times,

256
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,220
and yet these mass mass starvations
have not happened. In fact,

257
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:01,160
not only as the population has grown,
people have gotten richer.

258
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,170
So they say we've coped with this in the
past. We can cope with it in the future.

259
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:09,200
The problem is that this is unprecedented,

260
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,550
that we don't really have any significant
length of history for something like

261
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:16,580
this. So anybody who's had
tells you that they have,

262
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,340
they know what's going to
happen in the future is just,

263
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:25,500
he's just ignorant. This is absolutely
in unknown territory, unknown territory.

264
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:28,970
It doesn't mean I'm not saying they was
going to absolutely be a disaster or

265
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:30,380
it's absolutely going to be fine.

266
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:34,700
It's just that we have no way of
predicting basically anything with the

267
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:38,360
population growing like that.
Um, up to a few years ago,

268
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:41,330
basically nobody predicted all
the environmental, for instance,

269
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,340
nobody predicted all the environmental
problems that we're having now that came,

270
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:48,410
uh,
essentially out of the blue.

271
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,810
Now this is a scheme Matteis thing.

272
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,380
Here's kind of a more cartoonish kind of,
uh,

273
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,370
even workout change,
but it doesn't go quite so far back.

274
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:03,420
So it's a little bit better data here.
And again, showing the same thing.

275
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,110
This was a, you are here,
this was drawn in 2004.

276
00:18:07,111 --> 00:18:11,910
We're now in 2008 and we're about 6.7.
So in,

277
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:16,950
in the, just the four years since this
was made, we're still on this trajectory.

278
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,000
No,
nothing very unexpected has happened.

279
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:27,320
Here is the, uh, the US census
bureau a projection, uh,

280
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,880
uh, update December, 2008.

281
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:34,310
So it's as recent as you can
find for what's happened. They,

282
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:39,150
they do a hundred years and
you may know it as 3 billion,

283
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,100
4 billion, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

284
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,930
Just keeps going and out at
the end they're protecting
a little bit of fall off.

285
00:18:45,931 --> 00:18:50,250
But when doesn't know that by 2040,

286
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:55,320
they're expecting 9 billion
people and still growing.

287
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,740
So there's no, well you've
heard a lot about, you know, uh,

288
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,090
Europe and,
and Michael titled,

289
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:08,010
Mom gave you a lecture on
the low population growth
rates in Europe and Japan

290
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:11,040
in, in, in quite a number
of countries in the world.

291
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,280
And that's correct that the population
growth is extremely unbalanced in the

292
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:21,210
world. The developed countries
are having zero two at most,

293
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:23,660
5% of the increase they're
growing at you know,

294
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,350
0.1% whereas some of the poorer
countries are still growing at two,

295
00:19:28,351 --> 00:19:29,184
3%.

296
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,630
So I'll show you in a minute
that basically all of this
growth is in the poorer

297
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:38,310
countries where they're least least have
the least resources to cope with this

298
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:43,110
amount of growth. Now here is, uh,

299
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,423
the,

300
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:49,610
the population change in millions and
we will see that that has basically been

301
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:50,221
growing.

302
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:55,221
This is where we are now
basically grew up to 1990.

303
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,970
It's a fallen off a little bit here and
then it's predicted to keep growing for

304
00:20:02,671 --> 00:20:06,960
another, a few years and then
it's predicted to go down here.

305
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:10,890
I emphasize guesswork. I,
this was not on the original.

306
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:14,760
This is data and we have fairly
decent reason. But again,

307
00:20:14,761 --> 00:20:17,280
this error bars on here and we
don't know what those error bars,

308
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,930
how big they should be and
this is really guesswork.

309
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:27,650
The guesswork is not too bad for
the near future because the, the,

310
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,400
the, the women who are going to have
these children are ready, born the ready,

311
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:34,260
close to maturity.
Uh,

312
00:20:34,261 --> 00:20:38,910
we know that fertility rates
generally don't change all that fast,

313
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:42,120
although I will show you plenty of
exceptions to that in the next lecture.

314
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,950
So you can maybe more or less believe
the next dozen years here or something

315
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,190
that, and then, uh,

316
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:52,090
you'll make various projections and
I'll show you those projections can be

317
00:20:52,091 --> 00:20:56,080
almost anything because we don't
have a very good basis for that.

318
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,210
But the rear near term projection that
the number of people at it every year is

319
00:21:01,211 --> 00:21:03,930
going to go up.
It's probably a

320
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,020
pretty accurate because
it's very near term.

321
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,740
And now again,
what are the,

322
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:16,150
the optimist take that data that here's
the number of people added and you'll

323
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:18,970
see it's has been going up.
It's kind of jiggling around.

324
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,120
It may or may not decline in the future,
but

325
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,340
because the base has been growing
because the population keep scrolling,

326
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,220
if the same number of
people are added every year,

327
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,430
then the percentage increase goes down.

328
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,990
So when you hear a lot of optimism
about the population situation,

329
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:41,950
what they're talking about is that the,
that the peak

330
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:51,210
rate of growth here in the 1960s has
come down as a percentage of the base.

331
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,510
But as you just saw, since the base
is growing, the number of Apps,

332
00:21:57,511 --> 00:22:01,930
Lou actual number of people added
is not changed all that much.

333
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,980
And again,

334
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,970
we're growing the world's going something
like one and a one and a quarter

335
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,000
percent when one to one and a
half percent a year currently.

336
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:15,070
And the guesswork is, and the hope is
that we'll continue down. In fact, the,

337
00:22:15,071 --> 00:22:16,530
this, this, uh,

338
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:21,070
continued decreases based on some pretty
optimistic assumptions and they'll

339
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,800
just,
we may get time to talk about them later,

340
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:26,200
but fertility has been falling.

341
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:32,010
If you presume that fertility is fallen
as far as it going to a four and now

342
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:33,460
it's going to stay constant.

343
00:22:33,461 --> 00:22:36,730
So the most conservative
projection is constant fertility.

344
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,130
Whatever we are at now,
that's the way it's going to be.

345
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,530
Then you don't get anything like this.
You get an a huge takeoff.

346
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,960
This presumes that fertility will keep
falling until people have two children

347
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:53,050
per family and fairly rapidly.
And uh,

348
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,120
that's a nice guess, a nice prediction.
But we really have essentially no theory,

349
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:02,080
no decent theoretical
basis to presume that.

350
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,210
Now here is the one number you
should really keep in your mind.

351
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,010
This is right up to date.

352
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:14,011
This is the Census Bureau 2009 this gives
you the world events and it just Britt

353
00:23:15,171 --> 00:23:19,480
for being kind of cute. It breaks it down
to how much is the increase each year,

354
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:23,890
month, day. You can do it down
to the second and notice, and I,

355
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:28,630
and I gave you these numbers last
time in as ratios as per thousand.

356
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,220
This is the number of births.

357
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:31,863
Yeah,

358
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,670
this is the number of births per year.
135 million. And the number of deaths,

359
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:41,840
55 million. So that's the difference.
That's the population growth rate,

360
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,510
80 million people.
So that's,

361
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,660
I think one of the key numbers to just
keep in mind rounded off 80 million that

362
00:23:50,271 --> 00:23:53,840
the increase every year on
earth now is 80 million.

363
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:58,730
And it's been a roughly
that for quite some time.

364
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,960
The,
uh,

365
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,850
the maximum here was
something like 90 million,

366
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:09,620
knocked, not quite 90 million, and
now we're just about 80 million.

367
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,060
So when people say though the birth,
everything's coming down,

368
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:16,730
things are getting better, we're
going to come to a soft landing. Well,

369
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,120
what we actually know is the difference
between 87 million and 80 million with

370
00:24:22,281 --> 00:24:26,240
large and unknown error bars. So might
not be a decrease at all. I mean,

371
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:27,350
we just don't know.

372
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:32,351
But nothing drastic has happened to
engender such optimism about the future of

373
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:40,220
human population. Although you will
hear that over and over and over again.

374
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,070
Now,
um,

375
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,953
as,

376
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:51,520
as I showed you this, this
graph that, uh, we are here

377
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,170
at, at the, uh, at the

378
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,120
sure here to 6.7 billion and all of
the projections show it to continue to

379
00:25:02,941 --> 00:25:04,110
increase.
Again,

380
00:25:04,111 --> 00:25:08,040
the rate of increase gets fuzzier and
fuzzier as you go further out in time,

381
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,130
but it will increase.
And uh,

382
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,120
the projections are that by 2040
will be 9 billion and still growing.

383
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:22,950
So we're adding a billion
at 80 million a year.

384
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,310
We're adding a billion
every 12 and a half years.

385
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,350
If it falls a little bit,

386
00:25:28,351 --> 00:25:31,800
we'll add a billion every
13 years or 14 years.

387
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:36,660
And what's to keep in mind and
when you think of those numbers,

388
00:25:36,661 --> 00:25:40,350
so that's a billion people
every 12, 13, 14 years,

389
00:25:40,351 --> 00:25:43,590
pick whatever number you like
and think of everybody's green.

390
00:25:43,591 --> 00:25:45,000
Anybody Green in this class?

391
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:50,610
Anybody not green or you environmentalist.
Yes.

392
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,790
Who's an anti environmentalist?
Hello? One, two.

393
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,970
Well, I'm going to return
to this theme, but uh,

394
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,080
they can't be repeated enough times that
think of the environmental footprint of

395
00:26:04,591 --> 00:26:07,980
a billion extra people.
Every dozen or so years,

396
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:11,820
a billion extra people. Now add up
all the environmentalist, moldy,

397
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,640
the achievements of this wonderful
environmental movement there.

398
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:19,350
There it's a wonderful thing and it
pales in comparison that, that, you know,

399
00:26:19,351 --> 00:26:22,650
it's just we're playing a losing
battle with the environment.

400
00:26:22,651 --> 00:26:25,950
As long as we're growing at a
billion people in so many years,

401
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:29,940
we're not going to solve the environmental
problems no matter what we we do.

402
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:33,300
It's just too, too great an
increase of people. And yet,

403
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,900
environmentalist generally never
talk about a human population.

404
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,890
It's too politically
dangerous to talk about that.

405
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,421
Hence this course,

406
00:26:42,421 --> 00:26:47,040
one of the very in the country or anywhere
in the world that that really hits,

407
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,510
talks about population a straight on.
Okay,

408
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,390
so why do we, why are we, why are we,

409
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:59,391
why is everybody projecting that the
population is going to keep increasing

410
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,080
their, and it's simply, you look at
the age structure and something like,

411
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:09,300
half of the world's population,
uh, is under 15 years old.

412
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,290
He just coming in, uh, I'm sorry,

413
00:27:12,291 --> 00:27:15,600
a third of the world's
population is under 15 years old.

414
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:20,340
And so just coming into reproductive
ages and we know that for the next they

415
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:23,730
will come into reproductive ages and
then B of reproductive potential for the

416
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:25,860
following 30 years.

417
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,220
And we know that this increasing number
of now 10 to 15 year olds who will

418
00:27:31,861 --> 00:27:33,780
become into reproductive ages,

419
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,490
we'll keep the population increasing.

420
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,620
So that's certain that it will increase
a low, the rate of increase and, and,

421
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,500
and how it changes is
certainly a less certain.

422
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:48,930
So,

423
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:53,340
but it's under almost any
kind of reasonable assumption.

424
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,560
Uh, the population is going to grow, uh,

425
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,480
another several billion people.

426
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,190
And so again, you know, we're
in unprecedented territory.

427
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:09,240
Most people think the earth right
now is incredibly stressed and it is

428
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:12,540
environmental things, uh, situation.

429
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:16,510
And now add another couple of
billion people to that, uh,

430
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,410
in the near future and
see what's going on.

431
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,730
So since we don't have crystal balls,
the students usually ask me question,

432
00:28:23,731 --> 00:28:26,010
what's going to happen? And
I always have to say, oh,

433
00:28:26,011 --> 00:28:30,060
I left my crystal ball and my closet. You
know, I didn't, didn't bring it today.

434
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:33,870
I do not have have a way into the future,

435
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,470
but anybody who tells you they know
what's going to happen in the future and

436
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:39,360
especially if they're going
to be optimistic about it,

437
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:44,160
is very blind kind of person.
Okay.

438
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:49,580
So you've all heard discussions of the
population problem and it's really two

439
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:54,930
different problems.
The first problem,

440
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:59,931
which in the West we're very cognizant
of is over consumption by rich people.

441
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,680
If they're a good fraction of the world
is now what you should definitely call

442
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:05,514
rich.

443
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,890
And they consume like crazy and a
lot of what we consume is frivolous,

444
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:13,510
like hummers great big, you know, some,

445
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,450
some little person on driving this great
big SUV that they never carry anything

446
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:23,451
heavy and they certainly don't have to
drive over logs or something which an SUV

447
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:28,190
is actually good for. So
the over consumption, uh,

448
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,160
depletes the world's resources,
increases pollution,

449
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:35,100
destruction of habitat, et
Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera.

450
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:40,550
So environmental misery is largely caused
by rich people consuming profligate

451
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,310
Lee unnecessarily.
And profligately.

452
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,290
The other side of the coin is a poverty.

453
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,060
You have the world is definitely split
and the split is getting wider between

454
00:29:55,061 --> 00:29:58,750
poverty and and over
people to over consume.

455
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:04,170
And their problem of course is under
consumption and they lead to all of the

456
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,360
problems of poverty, which I've
discussed. Hong Kong and you,

457
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:11,530
I don't have to tell you very much about
what the problems in the world poor

458
00:30:11,531 --> 00:30:14,230
people are.
So we have these two opposite problems,

459
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:17,470
what I call environmental
misery and human misery.

460
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:23,010
And they're both very largely result of
two rapid population growth that that we

461
00:30:24,611 --> 00:30:28,900
might add some utopian scenario
eventually be able to cope with say the

462
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:33,460
population levels that we have now
maybe. Uh, but at the rate of growth,

463
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:37,030
it's obvious just looking around you
that our technology, our economy,

464
00:30:37,031 --> 00:30:41,050
our governments have not been
able to cope with this so far.

465
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,260
So it's very interesting as,
as a,

466
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:47,380
as a political note that there
are these two faces of the pop.

467
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:51,730
They run the environmental problem and
the, and the, the people misery problem.

468
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,000
And it's amazing how people
focus on one or the other.

469
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,340
There's people like in work,

470
00:30:57,341 --> 00:31:01,420
in planned parenthood and various
feminist and women's organizations,

471
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,310
they're instant in people misery.

472
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,710
There is talking about poverty
and the attendant problems.

473
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,290
Then there's environmentalist.

474
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,250
They worried about trees and the survival
of animals and forests and nature and

475
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,170
both have of course very important
and very, uh, good causes to work on.

476
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,670
But it is absolutely mind boggling how
rarely you find anybody that sort of is

477
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:26,710
really in any way concerned about both
problems or in any way realizes how

478
00:31:26,711 --> 00:31:31,150
population is the centerpiece,
uh, of both of these problems.

479
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,221
Okay.

480
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:38,200
So let me talk just a little
bit about over consumption and,

481
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:43,120
uh, who's the number one bad guy
and over consumption? We are,

482
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:49,000
right. So here's the story for, uh,
some of the story for the United States.

483
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:54,610
This is, um, uh, the, the, the,

484
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,210
the growth in the United States
population from 1900 to 2000.

485
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,230
We in 1900 had about 75 million.

486
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,780
And in 2006, uh, this,
yeah, that's 2000, 2007,

487
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,040
2006,

488
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:13,030
we passed 300 million people.

489
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,600
And that's a quadrupling that
our population has quadrupled in,

490
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,720
uh,
that one century.

491
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,960
We were almost like an underdeveloped
country in our population growth rate.

492
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:31,570
And that is up to the almost current.

493
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:36,490
And here is again the latest census
bureau thing from a, again, this was a,

494
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,850
just got it out of the computer last
night actually the latest numbers that

495
00:32:40,851 --> 00:32:42,170
here's the,
the,

496
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,580
and one of the standard things is
give you a hundred year of timeframe.

497
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:51,170
Currently they're using
1950 to 2050 and we are,

498
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:51,681
as you know,

499
00:32:51,681 --> 00:32:56,681
sort of right about here and here's
the u s population growth rate and just

500
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,600
almost a perfectly straight line.

501
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:05,380
There is no prediction that the u s is
going to slow down and it's a population

502
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,440
growth rate.
We're growing at about 3 million a year.

503
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:16,190
It's currently, that's
1% of the year, a year.

504
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,640
And because of of natural increase that's
births over deaths of people already

505
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,200
in America plus immigration,

506
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:29,530
we're just going up here and um,

507
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:34,830
in our population growth rate,
it's about two thirds, uh,

508
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,860
birth silver deaths of citizens already
here and about one third immigration.

509
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:45,370
And of immigration of the guesses are
that it's about two thirds legal and one

510
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,150
third illegal.

511
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,860
They obviously be illegal is an enormous
guests that the absolute number of the

512
00:33:51,861 --> 00:33:53,300
percentage of anything that it is.

513
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,120
If you look at how they
come up with these numbers,

514
00:33:56,121 --> 00:33:57,550
it's really seat of the pants.

515
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,600
We don't know very much about the
magnitude of illegal immigration,

516
00:34:03,381 --> 00:34:06,140
but it's an enormous political issue.

517
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,980
Now on the consumption side,
uh,

518
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
of course we consume so much and
again numbers very kind of wildly,

519
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:22,330
but the range of numbers are that an an
American consumes something between 20

520
00:34:22,341 --> 00:34:27,341
and 40 times what a person in a
developing country will consume.

521
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:34,810
So if you multiply the r 3
million population growth
the year by a consumption

522
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:38,870
factor of 20, that's equivalent
to the growth population.

523
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:43,340
Growth is 60 million poor people.
And so you do it that way.

524
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:47,320
It looks like that our population growth,
uh,

525
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,900
is as damaging to the resource
and environmental situation,

526
00:34:50,901 --> 00:34:54,380
the world as the whole rest of
the world, uh, put together.

527
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:58,180
And that's just considering
our population increased,

528
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:03,181
not the population base which has
also consuming at this great rate.

529
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:05,540
So we are indeed,

530
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:10,541
it is certainly correct that we are a
tremendous strain on on the environment

531
00:35:12,591 --> 00:35:17,570
and resources of the earth and as I
shared it's not getting better or our

532
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:19,250
population is just increasing.

533
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:24,690
Now you have to balance against that
that a lot of our population growth is a

534
00:35:24,691 --> 00:35:28,550
course people coming in from other
countries so that it's not in some sense

535
00:35:28,551 --> 00:35:33,551
Americans who are getting richer but
it's poor people coming in and getting

536
00:35:33,591 --> 00:35:34,400
richer.

537
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,680
But you can play these numbers in all
different ways and we'll talk about the

538
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:39,060
politics in a moment.

539
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,810
But the US Census Bureau used to say
that we will reach that the US population

540
00:35:47,551 --> 00:35:52,551
will reach 300 million by the year 2050
we reached that number 44 years earlier

541
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:59,310
than the Census Bureau thought and we
are still growing and now the census

542
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:01,740
bureau says there was no
sign of stabilization at all.

543
00:36:01,741 --> 00:36:05,220
They cannot give you a number at which
they think the u s population will

544
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:09,600
stabilize. Because as far out
as anybody can kind of project,

545
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:13,710
there's no reason to believe
that stabilization in view.

546
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,450
Now some of the argumentation

547
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:23,580
is that you again,
people,

548
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:28,440
there's very political issue and a
half the people say it's all those poor

549
00:36:28,441 --> 00:36:32,400
people that are over reproducing can't
they learn some self control and then

550
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,270
handpieces all those Americans
and Japanese that consume
like crazy can't they

551
00:36:36,271 --> 00:36:41,271
use some self control and
it's an extremely sterile
argument that goes on and

552
00:36:41,301 --> 00:36:43,380
on. People don't think beyond, you know,

553
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:47,520
two or three sentences
in into that argument.

554
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:52,450
And uh, as I tell you, if
you do it out numerically,

555
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,820
the, the increasing damage is,
is it's more or less equal.

556
00:36:57,390 --> 00:37:01,260
And it depends more critically,
as,

557
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,880
as Americans usually blame,
blame ourselves that where the problem,

558
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,860
there's a very kind of, um, do you want
to call it, use the word racist, but,

559
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,490
but a very euro Miraco
centric argument that,

560
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:16,410
because the presumption is when it says,
well,

561
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:20,700
we are the consumers and poor of the poor
people we don't have to worry about is

562
00:37:20,701 --> 00:37:21,930
that they will stay poor.

563
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:26,610
It's a western assumption that poor
people are going to stay poor and they're

564
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:30,150
not, not only did they not consumers now,
but they're never going to be consumers.

565
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,370
And that is just nonsense.

566
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,400
And we've seen now the Chinese
have come up enormously.

567
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,000
The Indians would come up enormously. The
Indonesians have come up enormously, uh,

568
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,160
everywhere in the world.

569
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:45,390
These vast numbers of poor people are
now our star now starting to be serious

570
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:49,480
consumers. And I think the, the CO2, uh,

571
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,030
production in China, I think has just in
outpaced the United States. But I didn't,

572
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,990
I didn't look that up. Uh, uh, recently.

573
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,600
And so they are an equal problem.

574
00:38:00,601 --> 00:38:03,540
So if one gets out of one's head,

575
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,230
the idea that poor people are
gonna stay poor forever. Uh,

576
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,470
which is an a pre globalization idea.

577
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,760
Now a worker in China can compete with
a worker in America and eventually

578
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:16,020
there's going to be some leveling.

579
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:20,910
So I think the proper thing is if you
think there are too many people on earth

580
00:38:20,911 --> 00:38:24,660
for either human misery issues or
environmental misery issues or both,

581
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,600
any birth, you should consider
more or less equal, uh,

582
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:32,130
preventing birth in America,
in Japan and Indonesia.

583
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,280
Everywhere that in the
not too distant future,

584
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:38,770
these people are going
to be more or less equal.

585
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,200
And we'll see.
We'll,

586
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:45,520
we'll see next lecture what the people
themselves want respect to this thing.

587
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,570
But I hope after this course that none
of you get involved in a sterile argument

588
00:38:49,571 --> 00:38:54,550
of US versus them. You know, it's,
it's, it, it doesn't get you anywhere.

589
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:01,600
Okay. What in the world
as it is today? Uh,

590
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,340
most of the popular,

591
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:08,290
almost all of the population growth is
in the poorest countries against ethics

592
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:13,120
are pretty bad to something like 95% of
population growth in the world are in

593
00:39:13,121 --> 00:39:16,300
the poorest countries.
And as you know,

594
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:20,950
new people need schools, they need
healthcare, they need a place to live,

595
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,940
they need jobs. And all of this
takes money. It takes capital.

596
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:29,380
And that's what the poor countries
are missing. They don't have, uh,

597
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,500
the capital, they usually don't
have the technological expertise,

598
00:39:32,501 --> 00:39:37,420
they don't have the often the quality
of government that can cope with these

599
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,400
enormous problems.
So it's,

600
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,180
it's the places that are least capable
of coping with the population increase

601
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,370
that are in fact salad with it.

602
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:50,920
And the magnitude of this
growth is, is incredible. Um,

603
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,880
as far as that as we can project,
uh,

604
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:00,870
the poor countries are going to have
to build a city equivalent of 1 million

605
00:40:01,781 --> 00:40:03,840
people,
1 million city,

606
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,260
to cope with a million people
every week for the next 45 years,

607
00:40:09,611 --> 00:40:13,330
which is far as we projected.
And if you look at, you know,

608
00:40:13,331 --> 00:40:15,790
you know the big cities,
Shanghai, Beijing, and China,

609
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:21,270
just pick almost any name and got
her an Almanac and you'll see the,

610
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:25,800
there's, there's so many mega million
cities in China that, you know,

611
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,660
cities even that I've never heard
of and you look up their population,

612
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,410
they're in,

613
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:33,670
in the millions and place like New
York with 7 million people is nothing.

614
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:38,410
So Sweden where I lived
in Sweden for a while, uh,

615
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:40,300
has like seven to 8 million people.

616
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:45,850
New York City has seven to 8
million people, cities in China.

617
00:40:45,851 --> 00:40:50,000
That's, that's, that's a small
town. Uh, almost. And India is not,

618
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,520
not far behind.

619
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:58,350
So people in the United States generally
don't have much of an idea of what

620
00:40:59,261 --> 00:41:00,730
poverty really looks like.

621
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:06,070
And one of the best descriptions of this
comes from a bill Ryerson who is going

622
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:07,390
to be a guest lecturer later.

623
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,370
And he describes flying into
Bombay again a few years back.

624
00:41:12,371 --> 00:41:16,150
But in this period of extreme population
explosion that we're talking about,

625
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:20,020
go to the airport and the airport
is way outside the city as,

626
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,670
as all our parts have to be.
And by the international flight schedules,

627
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:25,870
they come in early in the morning.

628
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:31,540
So he starts driving in and
almost immediately at the
airport you start seeing,

629
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:36,680
uh, poor people begging on the
street. You see a Shanti's, uh,

630
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:41,810
that, that people are living in. And
when it comes into the denser places,

631
00:41:41,811 --> 00:41:44,760
people start begging and
you'll see very common.

632
00:41:44,761 --> 00:41:46,670
Your mother holding an
infant and you can look,

633
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,540
the infants is clearly nearly
dead. And the mother, you know,

634
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:54,680
please give me something, anything so I
can keep this child alive till tomorrow.

635
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:55,730
And there's one after the other,

636
00:41:55,731 --> 00:42:00,731
after the other and it gets denser and
then the sun comes up and it gets warm

637
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:03,470
and is generally a rather warm country.

638
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:08,930
And there's all these jitneys
and motorbikes trucks,

639
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,100
small trucks putting around and they
don't have good catalytic converters.

640
00:42:13,101 --> 00:42:15,530
Those are expensive.
A lot of them have platinum in them.

641
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,920
So they produce a lot of pollution and
the air gets very thick with this black

642
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,970
smoke, very early and black, some sort,
whatever you want to call it in, in,

643
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:29,810
in the early morning. So you're not
breathing fresh air. And then of course,

644
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:32,060
they have no toilets, uh, around,

645
00:42:32,061 --> 00:42:35,750
and you're going to read some
articles about what that means.

646
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,480
And so very soon,
the stench of human waste,

647
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:43,140
you're on a main streets going into the
main city. The stench of human waste, uh,

648
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:48,160
comes up at you and the smells
terribly and the more and more beggars,

649
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:53,000
and it's just, you know, an heart
absolutely heart wrenching, uh,

650
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,970
a description of what's going on.

651
00:42:55,971 --> 00:43:00,500
And then you think that here are
millions and millions of people that,

652
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,920
uh, have, you know, we'll
never have a real house.

653
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:07,590
They live in some cardboard
shack somewhere. Uh,

654
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,050
they'll never have a real job.

655
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:14,180
They'll never probably go to the bathroom
in a toilet and they may never even

656
00:43:14,181 --> 00:43:18,230
breathe a breath of fresh air. Um, so it,

657
00:43:18,231 --> 00:43:23,000
poverty is really a very,
very serious kind of situation.

658
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:23,853
And,
uh,

659
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:29,050
you go to lots and lots of cities in
the world and see similar kinds of

660
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,200
descriptions.

661
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:34,790
And I do the numbers on this poverty.

662
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:37,550
So we compare it to the United States.

663
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:41,630
So General Motors before
its recent demise,

664
00:43:41,631 --> 00:43:46,040
these numbers are three or four years old.
They tell it.

665
00:43:46,041 --> 00:43:49,130
So they pay wages to the workers.
Then they have health benefits,

666
00:43:49,131 --> 00:43:52,250
which you've read about is very high
because they pay them for the rest of the

667
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:55,970
life and they pay pensions.
So when you add all that up,

668
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:59,780
how much lifetime they're going to pay
for worker and divided by the number of

669
00:43:59,781 --> 00:44:02,770
hours the worker works,
it comes out for,

670
00:44:02,771 --> 00:44:07,490
for General Motors was $80 an hour
at the wages, general motor worker,

671
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,270
$80 an hour.
And uh,

672
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,910
that was somewhere near a
maximum for union wages,

673
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:18,080
not counting like airline pilots.
So we get an awful lot more than that.

674
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,210
The upper middle class, uh,
that's blue collar workers at GM,

675
00:44:23,211 --> 00:44:28,010
the upper middle class people mostly
in this room are going to be earning an

676
00:44:28,011 --> 00:44:29,960
awful lot, uh, more than that.

677
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,930
On the other hand is the poverty level.
Uh,

678
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:36,930
which for a family of a mother,
father,

679
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:40,680
and three children is defined as,
uh,

680
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,360
um,
$24,000 a year.

681
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:48,750
That's the 2006 number.
Now, the official US number,

682
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:52,500
which is $13 and 35
cents a day per person,

683
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:57,470
that's the poverty level as officially
defined in the United States. [inaudible],

684
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:00,210
Walmart, uh, a worker,

685
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,400
a sales associate earn $6 and 10
cents an hour or $12,000 a year,

686
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:11,190
6,000, uh, an hour, uh, uh,

687
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:16,770
I'm sorry, is 12,000 a year.
They are below poverty level.

688
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:21,950
So the next step up for a Walmart
worker is po is official poverty level.

689
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:27,000
When you go to developing countries,

690
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:32,010
you have to cut to get any idea of a
scale, you'd have to cut the Walmart,

691
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,640
Walmart wages in at
least a factor of four.

692
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,680
So Walmart, uh, makes, uh,

693
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:43,910
pants in El Salvador and the pants sell
for this particular article on the $16

694
00:45:46,021 --> 00:45:50,970
and 95 cents in their United States
stores. And how much you think the women,

695
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:54,090
uh, in El Salvador get who
make the pants per pant?

696
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:58,470
15 cents is the wage level

697
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,380
that they,
they get for it.

698
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:08,220
The UN reported that about
half of the world's workers,

699
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:11,670
which is about 1.4 billion people,
uh,

700
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,580
earn less than $2 a day.

701
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:18,390
So the average wage,

702
00:46:18,391 --> 00:46:22,890
the median wage in the world
is something like $2 a day.

703
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:27,210
That's per wage earner, not per family,
not per person, but per wage earner.

704
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,430
And that then has to be divided among
however many dependence that person has.

705
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:38,190
You, I've told you that what the u s
sets, uh, it's official level for poverty.

706
00:46:38,191 --> 00:46:39,870
Every country in the world of course,

707
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:43,560
gets to decide its own
level of what poverty is.

708
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:47,100
And the official poverty
level in the poorest 10,

709
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,300
10 to 20 poorest 20
countries is a dollar 25.

710
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:57,080
You're only poor if you earn less than
a dollar 25 per capita per day in both

711
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,590
China and India,

712
00:46:58,591 --> 00:47:02,790
the official poverty level
is closer to $1 a day.

713
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:05,730
And this is at 2005 prices.
Again,

714
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:09,150
statistics are always a
couple of years behind things

715
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:15,230
in rich places like Latin
America and Eastern Europe. Uh,

716
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:19,320
$2 a day is the more
appropriate, uh, poverty level.

717
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,690
And that is for all the
developing countries.

718
00:47:21,691 --> 00:47:26,520
$2 a day is the median and their
own self defined poverty level.

719
00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:30,190
But within each country,
in each region, uh,

720
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,010
there's great inequality
of course in income.

721
00:47:33,011 --> 00:47:37,570
So about a third of the people in Latin
America are living on less than $2 a

722
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:41,590
day. Two thirds of the people in
Pakistan live on less than two thirds,

723
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:47,080
$2 a day, uh, more than
58% of the population.

724
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:51,670
Kenya lives on less than $1 a day.
Brazil,

725
00:47:51,671 --> 00:47:56,620
25% of the people on less than $1 a day.
The whole of sub Saharan Africa,

726
00:47:56,621 --> 00:48:01,540
44% of the people in less than $1 a day.
And so then it's not only these,

727
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:05,110
you know, traditionally poor
countries, but in Romania, uh,

728
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,540
after the Soviet block fell apart,

729
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:10,540
40% of the people live
on less than $1 a day.

730
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,690
Indonesia had a,

731
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,590
had a government work programs that
people could get some kind of work,

732
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:22,750
and Labor has got 75 cents a day
for five hours of work a day.

733
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,400
That's 15 cents an hour. And I don't know
how much it, how much time it takes to,

734
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:31,660
so Walmart pants, but maybe
an hour, probably less. So.

735
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:36,661
15 cents an hour is a wage that for
many people in places like Indonesia,

736
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:41,590
which is a lot of oil, it's not an
overall necessarily a poor place.

737
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,920
15 cents an hour for an hour's work,

738
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:53,380
75 cents a day. And that's much
more than they can get working,

739
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:58,760
you know, getting agricultural
jobs around where they live. Uh,

740
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,560
so here's a description from Zambia.

741
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,970
A nine year old boy alone,
a Banda,

742
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:12,100
his job is to beat rock fragments
into powder. He doesn't have a hammer.

743
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:16,510
He found a large steel bolt from some
construction site. He found a boat.

744
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:20,440
He grips in his bare hand and pounds
the rock with it. He takes raw rock,

745
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:22,690
takes a bolt that he found and,

746
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:27,610
and pounds with it and he can
fill it. Takes him about, uh,

747
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:28,390
uh,

748
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:33,190
in a week he can fill about a
half a bag with this powder,

749
00:49:33,191 --> 00:49:34,900
which is used for construction.

750
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:39,940
And he gets about a dollar
50 for the half bag.

751
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:44,620
And it's used for making
concrete in Kenya, for instance,

752
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,530
uh,
children and start working at five or six.

753
00:49:50,531 --> 00:49:51,221
We saw,

754
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:55,630
we talked about Charles Dickens was so
much of his writing was about children

755
00:49:55,631 --> 00:49:58,390
going to work at age seven.
Well seven is old.

756
00:49:58,391 --> 00:50:02,710
They go to five or six and they work as
prostitutes. Even at that age, miners,

757
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:03,610
construction workers,

758
00:50:03,611 --> 00:50:07,600
pesticide Strayer's and all the
kinds of dangerous and miserable job.

759
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:12,190
Uh, in sub Saharan Africa there's
something like 48 million children,

760
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:16,180
14 and younger, who, who were
working. And four years later,

761
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:19,030
these are says 2000.
By 2004,

762
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:21,730
it had increased by 1.3 million.

763
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:26,890
So the number of children working in
these poverty level jobs is increasing

764
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:30,400
because the whole population
is increasing and,

765
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,810
and so forth.
And

766
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:42,500
this is the poverty rates around
the world. Just to compare, uh,

767
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:45,180
this confirms the numbers
that I'm telling you

768
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,840
that uh,

769
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,290
these are the, the head
count, the number of millions,

770
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:55,280
a percent below poverty
line at dollar 25 a day,

771
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:58,490
less than $2 a day.

772
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:02,840
And if you take out China a China
is still one of the poorest places.

773
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:07,250
When you add in all the peasants,
it doesn't get it. Get some,

774
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,190
actually China makes it
worse than you add in China,

775
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:14,210
you have a higher percentage at,
at these poverty levels.

776
00:51:14,211 --> 00:51:17,480
Same for whatever poverty
level you want to work these,

777
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:21,230
the appropriate poverty levels
for developing countries.

778
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,390
Um,
now again,

779
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:29,000
you have the same two
ways of describing this.

780
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,620
The absolute number of people in
this kind of poverty is growing up.

781
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,300
That's the whole population grows.

782
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,450
The number of people in
these levels are growing up.

783
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:43,760
Yet there has been economic progress
in the sense that as a percentage of

784
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:47,240
people,
the poverty low numbers are going down.

785
00:51:47,570 --> 00:51:50,270
So there's more people in poverty,

786
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:54,980
but there's a lesser percentage of the
total population in poverty. So again,

787
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,590
you can,
depending on your political orientation,

788
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:01,940
you can describe this as an increasingly
bad situation where more and more

789
00:52:01,941 --> 00:52:06,470
people are in this kind of poverty or a
situation that is getting better because

790
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:10,010
the percentage of people
in poverty is going down.

791
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,430
Now the miracle. So you've all
heard of the economic miracle,

792
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:17,690
uh,

793
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:22,690
in East Asia especially and anybody
come fairly recently from China?

794
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:30,200
No, none of the students come from
time. Well, the average income,

795
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:34,160
and again upon how you define of
course the Chinese donor dollars.

796
00:52:34,161 --> 00:52:35,390
So when you express it in dollars,

797
00:52:35,391 --> 00:52:39,320
there's a translation and the best
way of doing is what's called P P P

798
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:43,280
purchasing power parody. One way is
to use the official exchange rate.

799
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:48,110
How many of you know they are in so many
won and how many dollars can they buy

800
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,170
with that one? But that exchange rate,
as you know, especially in China,

801
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:54,050
is manipulated by the government
and is not a real number.

802
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:58,550
So number that makes the Chinese income
look more favorable and is close to a

803
00:52:58,551 --> 00:53:02,450
real number is what they called
purchasing power parity. You say,

804
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:05,180
how much does a sack
of rice costs in China?

805
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:07,190
How much does it cost
in the United States?

806
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:11,690
And you try to use a basket of commodities
appropriate to what the people in

807
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:14,960
that country actually use and say,

808
00:53:14,961 --> 00:53:19,460
how much would that cost in dollars?
So you can have a parody and,

809
00:53:19,461 --> 00:53:23,510
and that kind of a level, uh,
Chinese peasant on average,

810
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:24,890
earns a dollar a day,

811
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:29,900
lives the person ever a dollar a day is
the average income in a Chinese peasant

812
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:35,370
family.
The jobs in the modern sector,

813
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:39,150
which means one of these manufacturing
jobs, and they migrate to some city,

814
00:53:39,151 --> 00:53:42,990
they live in these dorm rooms
where they're just stacked
like cordwood and they

815
00:53:42,991 --> 00:53:46,860
have basically no free time in there.
It's a miserable life,

816
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:48,810
but they doubled their income.

817
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:54,020
The economic miracle in Asia is when
people go from $1 a day to $2 a day.

818
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:00,390
And there's hundreds of millions of
people. You had up China and India,

819
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:05,660
hundreds of millions of people who
are desperate to earn $2 a day.

820
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:09,600
It's a doubling of their income.
And when you read these horrible stories,

821
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:14,580
horrible to Aureus of how, especially
women moving into the big cities, uh,

822
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,880
gone. Joe Can we old can't
Tom or any of the big cities,

823
00:54:17,881 --> 00:54:20,460
how they're living in the
conditions they're working under.

824
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,120
Remember it's a represents a doubling of
their income and it's so much that they

825
00:54:24,121 --> 00:54:24,481
send,

826
00:54:24,481 --> 00:54:27,960
they can send most of that back to their
home village and the home villages are

827
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:32,610
all living on this kind of income.

828
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:38,550
And so when we talk about Po, we will
later talking about population in China,

829
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,410
you're now must realize that basically
all of those workers who now have access

830
00:54:43,411 --> 00:54:47,640
to moderately decent
education can compete with us.

831
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,580
There's very few jobs that
we can do and they can't do.

832
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:55,350
And so we add up to $80 an hour for
blue collar worker are basically in

833
00:54:55,351 --> 00:54:58,680
competition with, with someone
who's very happy and they grumble,

834
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:02,030
people working for GM grumble
and some of their conditions,

835
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:04,770
the grumbling could be quite fair.
Uh,

836
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,570
but they're in competition with people
earning $2 a day that wish they would

837
00:55:09,571 --> 00:55:14,460
earn $2 a day.
And in places,

838
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:18,120
and this is not only our competition,
but jewelry making,

839
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:21,690
very labor intensive course, uh,
countries with low wage rates,

840
00:55:21,691 --> 00:55:26,691
attract very labor intensive jobs and
handmaking of jewelry is a very labor

841
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:27,960
intensive job.

842
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:33,150
And turned out that Bangkok was one
of the centers of jewelry making.

843
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,810
And because it was a center and
requires a fair amount of skill,

844
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:40,830
the wages actually rose in
Bangkok for these jewelry makers.

845
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:45,810
And they got up to $8 a day for
a jewelry worker in Bangkok.

846
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,033
And guess what happened?

847
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:51,150
All the factories moved to
China to back down to $2 a day,

848
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:55,170
a saving of 75% on your labor costs.
Of course they're going to do it.

849
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:00,920
And not only China, but Mexico,
all the Makia Dora's the, uh,

850
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:05,000
the border between Texas
and California and,

851
00:56:05,001 --> 00:56:08,700
and Mexico has a lot of factories.
And because of various trade laws,

852
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:13,310
they can assemble things and just ship
them across the border with, with low, uh,

853
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:15,660
low trade tariffs and everything.

854
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:21,000
And they have the nearly wiped out with
jobs moving to China. And now, of course,

855
00:56:21,001 --> 00:56:24,460
for a while anyway, the conditions that
we're getting little bit better to China.

856
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:27,700
So the jobs moved to,
I've been reading in newspapers,

857
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,980
who's now competing with China,

858
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:36,770
one India at a high level, but
Vietnam, Cambodia, you know,

859
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:41,380
places that are even poor than China
or now even taking jobs away from China

860
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:47,060
in Romania, which is one of the
poorest countries in Europe. The,

861
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:51,730
the wages average about $83
a week in your, or so 10,

862
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:55,090
10,
$12 a day.

863
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,340
When they got into the European Union,
what the Romanian workers do,

864
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:06,580
they moved out to France, Germany,
England, to get the higher wages that are,

865
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:07,840
that are available there,

866
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:13,050
which left a lot of jobs unfilled
in Romania where they get $12 a day,

867
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:17,530
as I've just said.
So what did the Romanians do?

868
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:23,500
Imported Chinese who worked for lesson
and fill the jobs as an unlimited number

869
00:57:23,830 --> 00:57:24,820
of peasants in China.

870
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:29,950
They would love to work in Romania
under almost any kind of of conditions.

871
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,890
And they leave their husbands, their
children. Everybody has left home,

872
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:37,690
usually under the care of grandparents
who were too old. Uh, themselves to work.

873
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,430
So keep that in mind.
Abject poverty is a dollar a day.

874
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:46,600
The economic miracle is $2

875
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:50,250
a day.
Okay.

876
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:57,460
What does living look like? And these
places that we've been talking about,

877
00:57:57,461 --> 00:58:01,300
Bombay and Shanghai, these are big
places that everybody knows about.

878
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:05,830
You'll never guess where this is and
you've probably never heard of it.

879
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,830
This is the Capitol of Mauritania. How
many know we're Mauritania is, Oh, good.

880
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,720
It's on the Atlantic coast of Africa.

881
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:18,250
I should remember to always make sly
grab geographies. You map slides,

882
00:58:18,251 --> 00:58:20,580
but I didn't, it's on the
Atlantic coast. It is the,

883
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:23,980
the capital is a place called
Norwalk shot. You walk.

884
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:26,500
Shot is over there somewhere.

885
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,420
And this is the suburbs of new shot.
And what it is is desert.

886
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,033
It's an,
uh,

887
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,120
all of Mauritania is basically a
desert until it rolls into the ocean,

888
00:58:37,121 --> 00:58:40,060
which case it becomes an ocean.
And so in the desert,

889
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,930
all these people live
in a Shanti's of any,

890
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:48,280
any kind of construction material
of they can, they can find,

891
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,200
uh,
the national government.

892
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,430
The city government does not have the
resources to deal with these people.

893
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:58,780
At all. So they get no
sanitation. They get no policing,

894
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:02,470
they get no water. Uh,
there, there's just,

895
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:06,490
these are called unplanned communities
and they sort of basic don't exist.

896
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,340
But what are they to the government?

897
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:12,820
They're a source of problem because it's
very poor people who have nothing to

898
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:17,410
lose revolt. Every so often they
say, you know, you've got something.

899
00:59:17,411 --> 00:59:21,380
We don't have it. We want it. Why is
the government not doing for anything?

900
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,210
So this is a source of
social discontent and the,

901
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:28,370
and the shanty towns around every big
city in the world are great sources of

902
00:59:28,371 --> 00:59:31,700
social discontent.
So what you see here is a road.

903
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,430
And I've just said they
basically don't have roads.

904
00:59:34,431 --> 00:59:39,230
What happens is that the military in each
of these countries wants to be sure to

905
00:59:39,231 --> 00:59:43,550
be able to control the people.
So every so often they send an bulldozer,

906
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:47,480
you can sort of see another
road here off to the right.

907
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,950
You get a better one of
these. Uh, they, they, uh,

908
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:55,530
they just come in one morning and
the people are asleep in there.

909
00:59:55,531 --> 00:59:59,960
Their Shanti's cause they don't have any
jobs. Uh, and very early in the morning,

910
00:59:59,961 --> 01:00:04,250
they just hear this rumble and they
walk outside to find out what it is.

911
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:08,480
And the bulldozer is two minutes away
from their house and they just go down,

912
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:11,120
knock out anything that's,
that's in the way.

913
01:00:11,121 --> 01:00:13,160
If you happen to be in
the path that the bulldog,

914
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:17,390
the military bulldozer and knocks
down now, sorry, sorry, that's gone.

915
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:22,220
And then the soldiers can, can,
uh, go into these situations.

916
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:28,060
So the point being that these
enormous dense populations,

917
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:33,110
which we associate with
Calcutta or Bombay or Shanghai,

918
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:37,700
Canton, you know, are in fact
almost everywhere in the world now,

919
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:41,540
including this, oh, sorry. This is,

920
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:44,510
this is where no shot
meets the Atlantic Ocean.

921
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,560
This is the Atlantic Ocean right here.
This is terrible.

922
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:50,900
And what do they live on?
Well,

923
01:00:50,901 --> 01:00:55,670
they live on fishing in each of these
little things here that you can see as a

924
01:00:55,671 --> 01:00:56,480
fishing boat,

925
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,310
a little boat that they roll out and
fish and look at how many boats there are

926
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,350
all trying to get the occasional fish.

927
01:01:03,351 --> 01:01:06,560
And that's not a terribly rich
fishing ground of the world.

928
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:10,130
It's very close to the equator and
there's no big upwelling of nutrients.

929
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:14,540
So it's not a great big ah, fishing
ground there. But this is how, uh, the,

930
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:19,310
the people who have competing with each
other for the few fish that are out there

931
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:23,960
now. So that's the desert.
And here's the jungle.

932
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:29,820
So this is Brazil in a place that you
may have heard of Sarah Palava peeled

933
01:01:30,801 --> 01:01:35,390
mountain or naked mountain and anybody
has heard of it or seen pictures of this

934
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:38,510
before. One couple of
people. It's very well known.

935
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,870
So if you travel in Brazil,
all the big cities,

936
01:01:41,871 --> 01:01:45,830
again have shanty towns where people
are desperate for some kind of a job.

937
01:01:46,260 --> 01:01:49,400
So every softened a truck
rolls through and says,

938
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:53,060
I have some jobs and people just pile
in and I've watched it and they sort of

939
01:01:53,061 --> 01:01:56,330
don't ask how much, where am I
going? What's the kind of work?

940
01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:01,550
A job is like a magic words like Manna
from heaven. They jump in the truck. Well,

941
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:05,830
one of the places they're taken to is
this place. And this place is way in the,

942
01:02:05,831 --> 01:02:06,710
in the middle of the jungle.

943
01:02:06,711 --> 01:02:11,300
Like a thousand miles from Rio or
South San Paolo and what it is,

944
01:02:11,301 --> 01:02:13,610
it's a mountain that they found gold in.

945
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:19,570
And normally if you've seen like mining
in the west of the United States and you

946
01:02:19,891 --> 01:02:23,370
know, they have these steam shovels which
have a bucket as big as this whole room

947
01:02:23,371 --> 01:02:28,080
probably, and they each,
each drag of the bucket, uh,

948
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,450
pulls up, you know, hundreds of tons.

949
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:35,030
I don't know the actual
numbers in Sarah Palava. Uh,

950
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,950
human labor is cheaper than,
uh,

951
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:42,570
than to buy a steam shovel.
So at each of the little dots are,

952
01:02:42,571 --> 01:02:47,550
is the person and what it is, this is a
pit and they're digging in the mud there.

953
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,350
They carried the mock up. The sluicing
is up here on the top where they have,

954
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:57,300
you know, sluicing gold is heavier than,
than soil. So they take basically mud,

955
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:02,460
dump it into a place, water runs
over, it, washes away the mud.

956
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:05,340
Anything that sticks down falls heavy.
His little flakes,

957
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:09,870
a little tiny nuggets of gold. That's the
primitive way of doing golden morning.

958
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:14,370
It just flow water over
mud and there's very,

959
01:03:14,371 --> 01:03:17,700
very low concentration.
You'd get a gold flake there.

960
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,500
So what are these people?
How do they work? This is,

961
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,790
they go down and then climb.
These are uh,

962
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:27,990
wouldn't ladders and another part,

963
01:03:27,991 --> 01:03:32,991
they climbed down the ladders and they
have a burlap sacks on their back,

964
01:03:33,421 --> 01:03:37,440
the cheapest kind of sack and they go
down and with very primitive implements or

965
01:03:37,441 --> 01:03:40,230
maybe the hands, they take the
earth from the bottom of the pit,

966
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,910
they put it in these packs,

967
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:46,920
they put the pack on their back and they
climb up the stairs and dump it into

968
01:03:46,921 --> 01:03:50,880
the sluice apparatus and then go back
down. That's there their whole life.

969
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:53,010
They're miserable wages.

970
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:55,440
They can't leave cause in the middle of
the jungle they have no way of getting

971
01:03:55,441 --> 01:03:57,510
back to any kind of civilization.

972
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:00,300
The companies do indeed
provide prostitutes for them.

973
01:04:00,301 --> 01:04:02,010
This whole villages full of prostitutes,

974
01:04:02,220 --> 01:04:06,150
which are the women that come out of
the same surgery and send a truck around

975
01:04:06,151 --> 01:04:07,200
and they have jobs for women.

976
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:12,090
They jump on with with
little or no questions asked.

977
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:17,340
And how is the whole thing kept under
control by soldiers with guns or power

978
01:04:17,341 --> 01:04:21,600
militaries with guns.
And here is uh, you know,

979
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:24,700
moderately typical.
One of the workers has,

980
01:04:24,810 --> 01:04:29,280
have not even the clothes on his back and
there's, you know, huge numbers of them.

981
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:32,250
They are kept control.
In this particular instance,

982
01:04:32,251 --> 01:04:35,820
the things were looking like they
were going to go out of control.

983
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,740
And again, uh, this, this is,

984
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:43,230
this is all around the world.

985
01:04:43,231 --> 01:04:47,460
You find situations like this.

986
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,133
Uh,

987
01:04:54,740 --> 01:04:58,720
sometimes I talk about, you know,
it's everywhere in the world. Uh,

988
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:01,440
if you go up to Mount Everest, so we've
got, what are the ends of the earth?

989
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,680
There's the deserts,

990
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:06,810
there's the jungles and this Mount
Everest and that just copy down some

991
01:05:06,811 --> 01:05:08,020
statistic of Mt.
Everest.

992
01:05:08,021 --> 01:05:11,780
Just this is how much population
there isn't in the world. Uh,

993
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,980
there's a up high and I
used to mountain climb.

994
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:20,170
Lot of single footstep can require
eight breaths. You take a step,

995
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:25,690
you pan eight times and people like me
would be a lot more than eight times on

996
01:05:25,691 --> 01:05:28,490
one particular day and standard in the
couple of months that you can climb with

997
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:33,100
his 500 climbers waiting
to, to climb up Everest. Uh,

998
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:36,850
they, the, the places are
littered with dead bodies.

999
01:05:36,851 --> 01:05:40,690
It's littered with oxygen
bottles. I mean, Mt.

1000
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:42,370
Everest is kind of a congestion zone.
It,

1001
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:47,320
it looks like grand central station that
had been sort of cleared out of people

1002
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:48,520
are on many days.

1003
01:05:48,521 --> 01:05:52,480
There's 120 dead bodies littering
the top of Mount Everest.

1004
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:56,680
So population has gotten so extreme
that it's not only the big cities,

1005
01:05:56,681 --> 01:06:01,600
it's basically everywhere that
you look, uh, uh, uh, people are.

1006
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:07,400
So let's just, uh, conclude, uh, tell
you what a little bit of future, uh,

1007
01:06:07,401 --> 01:06:12,040
guessing.
So we know that fertility,

1008
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:14,050
so now we have most of the world,

1009
01:06:14,051 --> 01:06:18,370
very high fertility rate
population going gangbusters. Now,

1010
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:22,840
can we dream up a scenario where
this gets better? May get better,

1011
01:06:22,841 --> 01:06:23,920
it may not get better.
You know,

1012
01:06:23,921 --> 01:06:28,150
things may get to worse until there's
some incredible crisis or things may stay

1013
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:32,950
as they are now, where things may cost
to a, to a soft landing. We don't know.

1014
01:06:32,951 --> 01:06:37,951
But let's draw ourselves as scenario
for the soft landing situation.

1015
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:42,460
So one of the things that we
know is that there's very,

1016
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:45,910
very poor be these dollar a day.
People don't limit their births.

1017
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,760
And the exact reason for
it we will discuss later.

1018
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:51,160
A lot has to do with education,
that they don't,

1019
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:54,580
a lot of things about how their bodies
work. They don't understand. So they're,

1020
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:58,760
they're afraid of modern contraception, a
lot of issues, which, which we will, uh,

1021
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,070
we will discuss.

1022
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:04,810
But we observe around the world that some
increase in standard of living has to

1023
01:07:04,811 --> 01:07:09,390
take place for populate for
before people start, uh,

1024
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,730
being willing and want
to limit their fertility.

1025
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:15,310
So let's take the minimum situation.

1026
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:20,610
Let's say someone gets one of these $2
a day jobs and that's then they start

1027
01:07:22,181 --> 01:07:24,250
thinking differently about
themselves in the world.

1028
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,980
There may be in a city where
they get some education,

1029
01:07:26,981 --> 01:07:28,780
some awareness of what's
going on in the world.

1030
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:30,850
They want to limit their population.

1031
01:07:30,851 --> 01:07:34,990
So let's say that we go from
a dollar a day to $2 a day.

1032
01:07:34,991 --> 01:07:39,120
That's incredibly optimistic. That $2 a
day is sufficient, but you'll see what,

1033
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:42,760
where I'm going. That's a doubling
of income of the poor people. Again,

1034
01:07:42,761 --> 01:07:46,510
something like a third of the people on
Earth or in this one to $2 a day range.

1035
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:49,610
So you doubled their income and

1036
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:55,900
all of a sudden miracles
happen. Population stops
growing, not real. Oh Way.

1037
01:07:55,901 --> 01:07:57,780
Overly optimistic.
Well,

1038
01:07:57,790 --> 01:08:02,790
another thing that we know is that when
incomes around the world rise to poor,

1039
01:08:03,881 --> 01:08:07,240
people have the smallest rise and the
rich people have the biggest fries.

1040
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:11,710
So if the small people are doubling
their income, what is the whole,

1041
01:08:11,711 --> 01:08:15,320
the average of the whole world doing?
It's going to be much more than doubling.

1042
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:18,770
And again, you can pick a, I'm
sure economists have these numbers,

1043
01:08:18,771 --> 01:08:20,540
I don't have them.
You can pick whatever number you want.

1044
01:08:20,770 --> 01:08:24,830
If in order to raise most of the
world from $1 a day to $2 a day,

1045
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:29,540
I need to double their income, then does
the whole world rises by more than two,

1046
01:08:29,541 --> 01:08:32,300
maybe three.
But we can pick any number that we want.

1047
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:37,340
So I've kind of your two facts that
the population of the world is for sure

1048
01:08:37,341 --> 01:08:42,341
going to increase by something like
50% before if and when it stabilizes.

1049
01:08:42,621 --> 01:08:47,621
We can sort of see ballpark of
50% increase coming and now,

1050
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:53,060
but this AV average standard of living
has to at least double and probably

1051
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:57,260
triple or quadruple or you know, again,
pick almost whatever number you want.

1052
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:02,180
So at the minimum of doubling the
world's, uh, per capita income,

1053
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:07,210
uh, 50% more people are doubling and
the income, it means a three that,

1054
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:09,030
that the gross,
uh,

1055
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:13,400
economy or it has to triple because you
have one and a half times as many people

1056
01:09:13,670 --> 01:09:17,540
each earning twice as much.
That's a tripling of the world economy.

1057
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:22,360
If you want to say that, uh,
the world that to double the,

1058
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:25,760
the income or poor people, you have to
triple the whole world world economy,

1059
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:29,000
then that's three times one and a
half or four and a half times as much.

1060
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:32,090
So basically we're looking at an,

1061
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:36,170
at an optimistic scenario for the
future where we come to a soft landing.

1062
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,870
And then in order to
come to a soft landing,

1063
01:09:38,871 --> 01:09:42,740
we have to have the economy of the world
increased by a factor of three by a

1064
01:09:42,741 --> 01:09:45,290
factor of four, four, and half, five, six,

1065
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:50,090
somewhere in that range of numbers.
Now,

1066
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:50,770
technology,

1067
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:55,130
the improvement of technology allows us
to grow our income without not somewhat

1068
01:09:55,131 --> 01:09:58,460
less than proportionate increase
in resources. And again,

1069
01:09:58,461 --> 01:10:02,360
you can make a wall to guests about
how much technology will improve in the

1070
01:10:02,361 --> 01:10:06,810
future so that we can double our
income without quite doubling, uh,

1071
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:07,561
the,

1072
01:10:07,561 --> 01:10:10,880
the drain on the world's resources and
the amount of pollution we put into it at

1073
01:10:10,881 --> 01:10:12,650
amount of carbon dioxide we put into it.

1074
01:10:13,190 --> 01:10:17,660
So we're looking at this enormous increase
in order to come to a soft landing.

1075
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:19,160
We're looking at this,

1076
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:24,460
at least a tripling of the world economy
and something like a tripling of the

1077
01:10:25,071 --> 01:10:29,720
pollution in the world to come knock.
So in the world, the, the, uh, uh, the,

1078
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:31,850
the,
the use of resources in the world.

1079
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:37,450
And most people believe that we're at
the limit of what the earth can cope with

1080
01:10:37,521 --> 01:10:39,290
in terms of the economy,

1081
01:10:39,291 --> 01:10:41,240
which is basically how much
we're taking out of the earth.

1082
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,500
We're at the limit right now,
but with population,

1083
01:10:44,501 --> 01:10:48,060
we're not going to have a soft landing
unless we triple that at least minimum of

1084
01:10:48,190 --> 01:10:50,240
triple that.
So that's,

1085
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:55,130
that's the significance of
this population issue that,

1086
01:10:55,700 --> 01:11:00,590
you know, can the earth cope with a
tripling of the economic activity on it.

1087
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:03,900
I left my crystal ball home,
so you're going to,

1088
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:08,090
you are definitely going to find out
the answer to that question. Okay.

1089
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:09,500
Next time we will continue.
