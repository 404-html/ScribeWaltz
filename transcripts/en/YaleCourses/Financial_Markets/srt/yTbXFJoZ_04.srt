1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:05,620
I want to talk today about
monetary policy. And, um,

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,750
first of all I wanted to just review some
thoughts about Carl Icahn who spoke on

3
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:17,280
Monday. Uh, I thought he
was very amusing. Uh, I,

4
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:18,114
um,

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,190
am again happy that you ask questions
cause that's when you bring out a speaker

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,490
really well. I thought you could
have given him more trouble.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,330
He is a controversial figure.
Uh, what he does as you know,

8
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:34,710
is it takes over a company and
shakes them up, uh, and uh,

9
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,420
and in some cases is accused
of stripping their assets,

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,170
but it's all legal and uh, uh, it, it,

11
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,600
you could make an argument that it's
in the general good of our society that

12
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:50,880
people do that if a company sell,

13
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:54,030
if it's stock sells for less
than its assets are worth,

14
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,490
then the company may be,

15
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,090
should be broken up and the assets taken
and given somewhere else because the

16
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:06,030
low, the low stock price indicates
a problem. Uh, I, you know,

17
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:09,950
I don't know how to evaluate
everything icon has done, but, uh,

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,310
some of corporate Raiders
have been unkind to employees.

19
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,650
Uh,
and maybe it's not always the radar,

20
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:21,651
it's that some employees had trusted
in an implicit contract that they were

21
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:25,650
offered by their employer.
For example,

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,270
the employer may have said verbally
or suggested to an employee that, uh,

23
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,800
you know, if you do well,
we'll promote you up and, uh,

24
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,990
you will have various
advantages in the future.

25
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:40,260
And then an outside writer comes
in and just fires the employee.

26
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,150
So naturally the employee feels wronged.
Uh,

27
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:49,260
and there are instances of
that sort of thing. Um, but,

28
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:53,040
uh, again, it's like anyone
who does important things,

29
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,360
it's hard to judge the
whole picture. And, um,

30
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:03,120
uh, on net, I f I'm sure he has
created value for the economy.

31
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,380
Um,
so yeah,

32
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:12,240
someone suggested that we should bring
in corporate regulators. It was you, uh,

33
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:15,450
as well. Uh, I think maybe
in the next year I'll,

34
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,190
I'll do that to offset and bringing
in a lot of very successful,

35
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:25,380
um, finance practitioners. And I
don't have any regulators this year.

36
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,590
Uh, also, uh, one of you asked, uh, what,

37
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,920
what literature do you read? And, uh,

38
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,460
he mentioned the Nicco Mackey and ethics,
which I have never read.

39
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:41,160
I don't know what that
is, but, uh, and he also,

40
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,360
meg mentioned a poem by Rudyard Kipling.
I call if,

41
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,480
uh, and I didn't recognize what
he was referring to immediately,

42
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:52,950
but I looked it up and it's a,
it's a famous poem that you must've seen.

43
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,810
Uh, so I, uh, written in 1910,
uh, an inspirational poem,

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,540
so I put it up on the Classes v two,
not as part of the reading list,

45
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:05,110
but it's under, uh, uh, resources.

46
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,540
So you can read Kipling. Uh, maybe
he thought of that because it,

47
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,830
uh,
it's really a poem,

48
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:16,831
which seems to be an a poem of advice
for young people because it ends up the

49
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,230
last line is, you know, the last
line, cause I want to be excited.

50
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,090
What's the last line? Yeah. If you know,

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,090
if you follow these instructions, you
will be a man, my son. And so, uh,

52
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,100
that's the motive thought he may
have been in when he talked. Um,

53
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,930
anyway, we have a, our second
midterm exam is on Monday. Uh,

54
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,330
and it will be like the first midterm,
but it will be less,

55
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,540
um,
less mathematical.

56
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,550
This part of the course had less technical
apparatus then the first part of the

57
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:58,540
course. So it will concentrate on
the middle third of the course.

58
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,850
And Up to this lecture,
uh,

59
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,690
you have to read for Bozi at
Al again carefully because I,

60
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,930
I'm free to take anything,
uh, from the, uh,

61
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,900
uh, key terms and he,
uh, concepts from, uh,

62
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,850
the chapters that were assigned
for this part of the course.

63
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,930
And of course,
every reading that is online,

64
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:27,550
I don't expect you to go to the library,
uh, is, uh, something I might ask about.

65
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:32,770
Uh,
and April 11,

66
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,400
we have Stephen Schwarzman coming
and I'm looking forward to that.

67
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,640
That will again be a Friday.
Uh,

68
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,330
but it will be at nine o'clock
and he will be here. Uh,

69
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,760
so, uh, I think that will
be a lot of fun also.

70
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,550
So I wanted to start today's talk a
lecture, which is about monetary policy.

71
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,760
Uh, and, uh,

72
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,750
it's really apropos right now.
Uh,

73
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:06,751
we are living in very unusual times and
I am sure that Ben Bernanki and other

74
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:13,651
central bank presidents are losing sleep
right now because this is a time to

75
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:18,550
challenge monetary policy makers.
Uh,

76
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,820
the thing that really emerged just in
the last week or so is that of course

77
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:28,840
monetary policy is about
setting up interest rates. Okay.

78
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,910
In the last week,

79
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,150
the treasury bill rate on the United
States four week treasury bills,

80
00:05:36,521 --> 00:05:38,710
which are the standard,
essentially three months,

81
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,930
it fell to 0.2%.
Okay.

82
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:47,560
This is shocking what,
what is happening now?

83
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,660
Interest rates have hit zero t 0.2%.

84
00:05:52,661 --> 00:05:54,850
That's 20 basis points above zero.

85
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,810
People have long thought that these
kinds of things happen only in Japan.

86
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,960
Uh, but that's not, uh, that's
not true at all. It's happened.

87
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,110
It's happening right now in the u s it
has been a total crash and in a treasury

88
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:17,790
bill rates. So, uh, uh,
it's not going to add,

89
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,720
one thing we know is that this crash
is over because the treasury building a

90
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,590
three month treasury bill rate has
crashed. It's virtually zero. Uh,

91
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:32,210
and the story is over because
it can't go any lower. Well,

92
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:36,950
it could go 20 basis points lower,
but interest rates can never be negative,

93
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,350
right? So that's it. It's
over. We've just hit zero. Uh,

94
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,130
this is the thing that worries central
bankers. When interest rates hit zero,

95
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,990
then they don't have,

96
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,450
it's a little bit like you're a steering
system on your car freezing up or a

97
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,150
hitting a, uh, your hydro
planning on the highway.

98
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,960
Your steering wheel doesn't work anymore
because once interest rates hit zero,

99
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:04,010
you can't cut them anymore.
And that's what the Fed wants to do.

100
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm talking about four weeks,
tertiary bills. The, uh,

101
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:13,000
the federal funds rate is still
at two and a quarter percent. Uh,

102
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,750
but at least the, the, uh,

103
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,580
the more prominent a three month
t bill rate is, uh, is at the,

104
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,640
at the end. So what I, um,

105
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,340
I want to do is talk about what the Fed
in this country is doing and what other

106
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:30,320
central banks are doing.
Uh,

107
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,190
but I wanted to start by putting
it in historical perspective. Uh,

108
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:37,500
and so if you'll allow me, I will, uh,

109
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,510
talk first about just what
is a central bank, uh,

110
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,870
such as the Federal Reserve, uh, and, uh,

111
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,290
and what do they do? So, uh,

112
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,530
I want as the first just go back,

113
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,570
the story I told you in a recent lecture
was a story of a Goldsmith banker.

114
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,360
Okay. This is how it
started. There were people,

115
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:04,420
Goldsmiths were people who worked in
the metal gold and made beautiful things

116
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:09,260
for people, jewelry and other things.
And they had safes in their shop.

117
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,120
And some people would say
to the Goldsmith, uh, you
know, I have some valuables.

118
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,200
I don't have a safe, can I put it in your
safe? And the Goldsmith who would say,

119
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,850
okay, and he'd write a little note,
uh, and hand it to the guy and say,

120
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,020
just keep this note. And, uh, if it
was a bearer note, if the note said,

121
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:30,530
I'll take it. If it wasn't a
unique object, which is gold,

122
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:35,830
the note would say that this Goldsmith
will pay to the bearer so many ounces of

123
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:41,210
gold. Uh, and that's how, uh,
banking and got started, uh,

124
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,440
emerged into a institution
in which banks would, uh,

125
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,500
uh, have notes, bank notes,

126
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,010
uh, that circulated widely. Uh,

127
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,270
and we began to think of them as money.

128
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,420
If you put your gold in
the care of a goldsmith,

129
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,750
initially you don't think
you think the money is there,

130
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:08,570
but eventually you have this bearer note
that you start passing around to spend

131
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,180
to other people and they start
to think of them as money. Uh,

132
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:14,310
and that's the origin of banking.

133
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,280
So if you ask someone a couple of
hundred years, because years ago,

134
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:21,120
what's the essence of a bank? They
would say, oh, they print paper money,

135
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,060
private banks,
print paper money,

136
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,260
not just a government back. Well,
there weren't government banks.

137
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,150
They were originally,
they were all private. Uh,

138
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,590
there is a institution
called the gold standard now,

139
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,910
totally and completely gone
everywhere in the world. Uh,

140
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:47,300
what was it began the first country to
adopt the gold standard officially was

141
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:51,510
the United Kingdom.
And that was in 1717.

142
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,720
Uh,
and what it meant was,

143
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,740
had the government of the UK was committed
that they're paper money would always

144
00:09:59,971 --> 00:10:04,380
end at all times, be
redeemable in gold. Uh,

145
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,830
it was gradually adopted by
other countries through time. Uh,

146
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,130
and the United States didn't
officially adopted until 1900.

147
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,990
Uh, but, uh, uh,

148
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:24,900
but, uh, let me just go back to
the, uh, the way the thing work.

149
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,980
It used to be that, uh, it was, uh,

150
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,740
the actually the gold standard kind
of came in by accident in England.

151
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:36,510
Originally, there was, in the 16 hundreds
prominent coin was called a shilling,

152
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,220
and it was a silver coin.
So the British pound was 20 shillings.

153
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,860
And so effectively the pound
was on a silver standard,

154
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:47,580
but then they started minting
new coins out of gold.

155
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:51,570
And the government was issuing
coins, they call them guineas. Uh,

156
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:56,070
and they started out as a,
they just minted the amount in one coin,

157
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:59,850
which they thought was equivalent to
20 showings. So they had a Guinea,

158
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:04,530
which they said was 20 shillings.
Uh, and then there were two coins.

159
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:08,700
You can either shillings or guineas there.
That was the money at the time.

160
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,610
Uh,
but then the problem was that the price,

161
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,450
relative price of those two was
not really fixed by the government.

162
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,900
And so it started to drift
and people started to think,

163
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:21,540
I think a Guinea is worth
more than 20 shillings,

164
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:24,750
and the market price
drifted up to 21 shillings.

165
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:28,410
And so the government was upset of the UK.

166
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,720
We wanted this to be a 20 shelling coin,

167
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,790
but now in the market it's trading at 21.

168
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:37,440
So then they implement a rule that
beginning is worth 20,000 shillings.

169
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,810
Uh, then the relative price of gold
versus silver shifted to the point that,

170
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,380
uh, the, uh, the, uh,

171
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,770
gold with the at 21
shilling exchange rate,

172
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,950
the gold showing was worth less.

173
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,270
The Gold Guinea was worth
less than 21 showing.

174
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:00,220
So all the shellings disappeared.
And the only coin left was the Guinea.

175
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,170
And so England, uh, became,
uh, my gold standard. Uh,

176
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:11,560
the Bank of England was founded in 1694,

177
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,770
and that is the world's
first central bank. Um,

178
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,900
it was granted a monopoly on
joint stock banking by parliament.

179
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,750
In return for, uh, uh,

180
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,540
giving war loans to the government.
Uh,

181
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,590
it started out as just a powerful bank.
Uh,

182
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,510
it did not have a government
monopoly on note issue,

183
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,050
but over the time it became
the prime issuer of UK notes.

184
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:43,841
Now,

185
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:48,841
what actually developed in the 17 hundreds
is that the bank of England being the

186
00:12:49,691 --> 00:12:54,691
most powerful bank in England started
to demand that other banks in the UK who

187
00:12:55,641 --> 00:13:00,520
were also issuing notes,
uh, would leave there.

188
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,470
W We keep a deposit with the Bank
of England. So the Bank of England,

189
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,120
if you were a little bank somewhere in,
in the UK, the Bank of England would say,

190
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,070
you've got to keep a deposit with us.
Uh,

191
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:19,030
otherwise we'll destroy you because the
Bank of England good then demand all the,

192
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,980
he can start accumulating notes from
some issuing bank and then demand payment

193
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:27,430
in gold. Uh, and the issuing bank, uh,

194
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,610
would be driven out of
business if it didn't,

195
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,090
if they all were using
fractional reserve banking.

196
00:13:34,091 --> 00:13:38,440
And so if you have a big player
that's demanding gold from you,

197
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,430
you're in trouble.

198
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,730
So all the banks complied and 10 and
cap deposits with the Bank of England.

199
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,260
So you see what Bank of England
emerged into was a banker's bank.

200
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:55,060
Okay. You have lots of banks. The banks
are taking and gold and issuing notes,

201
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:56,860
uh,
but there,

202
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:01,890
but they are forced by the Bank of
England to keep a deposit at the Bank of

203
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,730
England. Uh, and uh,

204
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,710
so the Bank of England then became a
kind of a regulator of these banks and it

205
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:10,870
would also loaned to them
when they're in trouble.

206
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,350
They had a relationship between
the Bank of England and so the,

207
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:18,070
the Bank of England became a
source of stability in the UK.

208
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:24,210
The problem with private banks issuing
notes is that they would periodically,

209
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,840
uh, be banking crises. Uh,

210
00:14:28,841 --> 00:14:33,841
when the banks failed to pay on their
notes and they couldn't pay up the goal

211
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:39,721
that was demanded that was required
with a fractional reserve system.

212
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:41,680
You're in an unstable equilibrium.

213
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,090
If people start to demanding
payment on their notes, then, uh,

214
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,240
then they will destroy the system.
If they did it,

215
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:54,440
if they start demanding,
uh, then we're in trouble.

216
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,010
So the Bank of England effectively
enforced that, uh, that the,

217
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:04,040
that the banks in England
cap adequate reserves. Uh,

218
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,660
and,
and they would see these,

219
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:10,340
some of these reserves in the
deposits at the Bank of England. Uh,

220
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,200
and so England's money was more
stable than in other countries.

221
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,750
Uh, and, uh, uh, in the United States,

222
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,140
we did not have a central bank until
1913 when we created the Federal Reserve

223
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,070
System.
Before that,

224
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:35,410
the United States went through
repeated banking crises, uh,

225
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:40,070
when people would start demanding
the goal for their notes. Uh,

226
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,930
and, uh, when did we have, we had a,

227
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:48,330
a severe banking crisis in the
United States in 1797 in 18,

228
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:54,431
19 in 1837 in 1857 in 1873 in 1893 and
in 1907 and we just had one after another

229
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:05,810
where the banking system kept collapsing.

230
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,030
What would happen is there'd be a panic.

231
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,870
People would say they're
not paying on the notes. Uh,

232
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:16,220
and so everyone would run to the
bank and demand their money and this,

233
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,670
and when that happened, it would
destroy the economy. So it was,

234
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:24,671
it was a subject of much discussion of
what to do to prevent these bank runs,

235
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:31,010
uh, in, uh, in the United States.

236
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,190
Uh, and, uh, uh, Massachusetts there,

237
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,590
can you hear me and I've,
I should stay over here. I,

238
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:42,050
maybe I shouldn't write
on the board. Uh, if, uh,

239
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,740
in the United States in Massachusetts,

240
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:51,080
a bank called the Suffolk
bank, that's s u f f o, l, k,

241
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,730
uh, created a Little Bank of England
in the state of Massachusetts,

242
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,830
and they created what was
called the Suffolk system, uh,

243
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:06,020
in 1819. And what the Suffolk
Bank did, is it just on its own,

244
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,700
it just declared that it was the Bank of
England for the state of Massachusetts,

245
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:16,030
and it required that all banks in the
Boston area keep deposits with them.

246
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:22,130
Uh, and so the, uh, cell phone
bank became a banker's bank.

247
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,930
Uh, and, uh, it lasted until 1860. Uh,

248
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:31,550
it then made Massachusetts
the most stable state, uh,

249
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,580
essentially the most stable state in the
country. And it was widely admired. Uh,

250
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,260
thing you have to understand is if you
could go back in a time machine to,

251
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,030
uh, before 1860, uh, in the United States,

252
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:51,430
you would have real problems
with paper money. Uh,

253
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,700
and you would be very much
aware of the paper money.

254
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:57,510
If you took out your wallet and looked
at the paper money in your wallet,

255
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:02,190
it would be issued by lots of different
banks, not any one standard bank.

256
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,530
Okay. If you went to a store to
buy something with paper and money,

257
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,570
the, the person at the, uh, would it
be a cash register? What do they have?

258
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,270
Cash box would be, it would have,
uh, something called van when it was,

259
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,500
it's called van courts.
Um,

260
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,130
banknote reporter and
counterfeit detector.

261
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:27,840
It was a magazine that would be every,
every retailer would subscribe to it.

262
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,030
And so what the guy would do is
he would say, okay, you've got it.

263
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:36,960
If it was local money, if it
was from this town, you know,

264
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:39,450
if it was new haven money
there were in new haven banks,

265
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,570
the guy would immediately
know what it's worth.

266
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:46,740
But if you were to make the mistake of
trying to spend Boston money in new haven,

267
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:51,350
they would get out van carts and then
they would read the discount. Uh,

268
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,020
and so Boston money was probably pretty
good because of the Suffolk system.

269
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,820
But if you tried spending New York money
in new haven, they would get out the, uh,

270
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:02,910
the bank note reporter and give a,
put a discount on it.

271
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:08,190
So it was a messy system. So you'd only
get like 90 cents on the dollar. Uh,

272
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,430
that's because nobody trusted these banks.
There was,

273
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,630
they could go under any day,
and so they tended to sell at a discount.

274
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,050
So, uh, uh,

275
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,640
and so though the u s did create what
sounded like central bank because they

276
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:26,610
were the first bank of the United States,
uh,

277
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,800
and the Second Bank of the United States,

278
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,700
the First Bank of the United
States was created in 1791.

279
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,020
Uh, and, uh, it had a 20 year charter,

280
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,170
which expired in 1811.
Uh,

281
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,250
and it wasn't immediately renewed because
the United States got into a war that

282
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,500
we call the war of 1812.

283
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,740
It was the u s connection
to the Napoleonic wars.

284
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:54,300
So it wasn't until after the war that we
created a new bank of the United States

285
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,580
in 18, 16, and it gave it a 20
year charter as well. Uh, so,

286
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:04,620
but those were not central banks
because they, uh, uh, these,

287
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,800
uh,
we have a correction of our

288
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:14,250
microphone problem. Lost it
again. I have my microphone on.

289
00:20:14,251 --> 00:20:16,800
It's just that it's, they say it's
not working or it's not loud enough.

290
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,570
Oh, it is working. All right.

291
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,080
Yeah,

292
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,790
but you still can't hear me when
I stand over here. All right. Um,

293
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,770
okay. There was a, in the United States,

294
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:44,771
we created the national banking
system in 1863 after a banking crisis.

295
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,180
And, uh, that worked fairly well.

296
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,790
Instead of having a central bank,

297
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,680
we decided that there would be a list
of bank called the national banks,

298
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,690
uh,
and uh,

299
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:04,350
and the national banks would be required
to help bail out any bank that was

300
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:08,680
failing. Uh, and so it was
something like a central bank,

301
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:12,340
but it was different essentially in that
the national banks really didn't have

302
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:15,670
the authority to run monetary policy.

303
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,380
They merely where they're in a term
in a time of emergency to prevent,

304
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,370
hopefully a banking crisis.
Uh, and they didn't succeed.

305
00:21:24,371 --> 00:21:28,780
We still had banking crises, so the
system didn't seem to work very well.

306
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:34,320
The 1907 banking crisis then led finally
to the creation of the system that we

307
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:38,770
have now, the Federal Reserve
System. Uh, and what it was,

308
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:43,771
was in many ways an effort to bring the
Bank of England to the United States.

309
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,240
They wouldn't have said that
because it doesn't sound,

310
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,550
we want to think that
we invented this here,

311
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,970
but it actually was a new invention
in a way because the United States,

312
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,490
uh, has a different philosophy, uh,

313
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:02,550
which is the United States has been
committed over since it's beginning to

314
00:22:03,011 --> 00:22:06,580
federalism. That is they don't
want, uh, or more broadly,

315
00:22:06,581 --> 00:22:10,760
they don't want centralization of
power in the government. And so the,

316
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:15,250
instead of setting up a central
bank in the United States,

317
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,040
as was done commonly in other countries,

318
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:22,270
the United States
instead created 12 banks.

319
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,730
They're the 12 federal reserve banks.

320
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:29,790
That was an effort to disperse
power away from the center. Uh,

321
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,660
the idea was that,
uh,

322
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,820
power to the people in rather
than the central government. Uh,

323
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,730
and, uh, this,

324
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,740
the Federal Reserve system
that was created in 1913
was different in that it was

325
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:49,530
independent or a much more independent
than central banks and other countries.

326
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:54,880
Other countries had set
up central banks, uh, uh,

327
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:59,440
following on the Bank of England.
But the U s didn't set up a central bank.

328
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,580
It's set up a system of 12
banks and they were regional.

329
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:08,260
And the idea was that this is better.
It's more democratic.

330
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,190
Each region of the United
States has its own, uh,

331
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,510
it's own bank.

332
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,620
And the banks were not technically
government institutions,

333
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:22,420
whether they're semi government.
It's kind of strange set up. The,

334
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,613
uh,

335
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:29,590
the Federal Reserve banks are
owned not by the government,

336
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,360
but by the banks in this
region where they operate.

337
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,490
They're called member banks.

338
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:41,910
So banks that become a member of the
Federal Reserve System get shares and they

339
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:46,950
become stockholders in the Federal
Reserve Bank and they get dividends should

340
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,290
work now. Okay. Does it
work now? Can I walk away?

341
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,940
Wonderful. Okay. Thank you. Um, but,

342
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:01,490
but they're not traded there no price
per share that you can observe. A,

343
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:05,480
and the banks can't do anything except
passively received the dividend,

344
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,460
but they can also participate in choosing
the directors and the president of the

345
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,990
Federal Reserve banks. Uh, okay.
So that's a very dispersed system,

346
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,770
but it still works because
member banks create,

347
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:23,300
keep deposits at the Federal
Reserve Banks, uh, and,

348
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:27,200
uh,
they're required to keep these deposits.

349
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:32,500
And moreover they can also borrow from
the Federal Reserve banks when they need,

350
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,220
when they're in trouble and need money,

351
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:38,600
and that's supposed to help
prevent a banking crises. Uh,

352
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,800
so, um, that's the Federal
Reserve system. Incidentally,

353
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:45,830
there's 12 banks and there's 12 districts.
Uh,

354
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:51,010
the districts back in 1913 are represented
the population distribution of the u

355
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,640
s at that time. So, uh,

356
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,870
there's a lot more districts in the east
coast of the u s than the west coast.

357
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:04,620
There's also to the Federal Reserve
banks in once in a state of Missouri, uh,

358
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,790
both as,
uh,

359
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,830
the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City
and the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis.

360
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,780
So you wonder why would it be that the
whole western half of the u s gets only,

361
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,590
or the western third of the U s gets
only 1 cent, one Federal Reserve Bank.

362
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,120
That's Saint San Francisco.
But Missouri gets to, well,

363
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,910
that's kind of political
history. Uh, it's kind of absurd,

364
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:30,130
but that's the way it is. Um, the,

365
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,240
the real difference,
uh,

366
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:37,270
between the Federal Reserve
Bank system of 1913,

367
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,340
the most important difference and the
Federal Reserve System of today is that we

368
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:47,780
are no longer on the gold standard.
Uh,

369
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,840
the Federal Reserve System was a gold
standard institution like the Bank of

370
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,410
England. It was supposed to, uh,

371
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:01,640
maintain the converted [inaudible]
of the currency into gold.

372
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:04,100
Okay.
So under the gold standard,

373
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,760
your dollar bill represented so many
ounces of gold and you are supposed to be

374
00:26:11,331 --> 00:26:14,120
able to always get that gold.

375
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,480
That means you could go to a bank and
demand gold and the bank then could go to

376
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:24,830
the Federal Reserve and get gold for it.

377
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,930
Uh,
that was the system.

378
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:32,890
The gold standard was at success in
the sense that the price of gold stayed

379
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:38,450
constant because that's what the
whole system was dying designed to do.

380
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:43,500
There's a famous story about
Irving Fisher, who was a
professor here at Yale, uh,

381
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,830
Hu,
uh,

382
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,990
remarking on how few people
understand the gold standard.

383
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,640
I don't know if I'm repeating this, but
he was at his dentist. They tell you,

384
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:54,474
I didn't tell you this.

385
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,220
He was at his dentist and they used
to give gold fillings in those days.

386
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:03,630
And he said to the dentist, he
said, just out of curiosity,

387
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:07,650
can you tell me what the
price of gold has? You know,
what it's been doing lately?

388
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:12,510
Uh, and the dentist said, Gee, I don't
know. I'll, I'll look at my records.

389
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:15,030
I have some old records and
I'll see what I was paying for,

390
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:17,520
for my goals for the gold
fillings 10 years ago.

391
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,530
And the dentist came back and said,
funny thing, it hasn't changed at all.

392
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:26,000
I'm paying exactly what
I did 10 years ago. Uh,

393
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,720
Irving Fisher then told that story
as an illustration of how poorly the

394
00:27:30,721 --> 00:27:34,380
understanding is of what's going on.
Of course,

395
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:39,410
the price of gold never changed in the
gold standard because that was the whole

396
00:27:39,871 --> 00:27:44,400
point of the gold standard, that the
currency was convertible in the goal.

397
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,880
But what happened in the 1930s is that
one country after another abandoned the

398
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:53,020
gold standard.
Uh,

399
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,510
and the United Kingdom was
the prominent first case.

400
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,980
Even though they had invented the gold
standard hundreds of years earlier.

401
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,630
In 1931, they dropped to
convert ability of the pound.

402
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,530
Sterling is still called pounds sterling,
even though it's not silver,

403
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:15,210
it was gold. Uh, they, they
dropped the pound comfortability.

404
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,740
Uh, the United States
dropped it in 1933. Uh,

405
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,030
and other countries did it later.

406
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,860
The reason they countries dropped
the gold standard is that under the,

407
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,240
uh,
uh,

408
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,650
effort to keep the currency
convertible into gold,

409
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,000
they were worsening the
depression of the 1930s. Uh,

410
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:41,250
in order to keep the currency convertible,

411
00:28:41,251 --> 00:28:46,251
they had to keep interest rates high to
prevent people from demand demanding the

412
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:51,120
gold and keeping interest rates.
How I was was destroying the economy.

413
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,070
Uh,

414
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:57,070
and so the gold standard ended in the
1930s and every country dropped it.

415
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:02,220
But we're left with the central banking
institutions that are now functioning

416
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,380
without convert ability
to goals. Um, and uh,

417
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,550
so, uh, there then you
start to wonder, well,

418
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:14,010
what is the system and what
does it supposed to do?

419
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,810
The old gold standard was supposed to
maintain the converter ability of gold and

420
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:22,950
currency, but now we're not even
backing it with currency anymore.

421
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:27,050
It was gold anymore. So
what does it mean? Um,

422
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,380
well, what it means is
that starting in the 1930s,

423
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:36,381
we began to think of central
banks as managing the money stock,

424
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,600
uh, to, um,

425
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,500
managing the money stock to stabilize
the economy. And that's what,

426
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:49,540
that's the view that's developed
and has been with us ever since.

427
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,170
Uh,
they still hold gold.

428
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,860
And right now the Federal Reserve
system has about $11 billion of gold.

429
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:00,880
All right?

430
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,880
They still have it when we remember
what happened in 1933 is they abandoned

431
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:09,430
convertibility with gold,
right?

432
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:13,690
So that means that you no longer
have the right to get it. Uh,

433
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,340
but uh, uh, that doesn't mean
they don't still own gold.

434
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,260
It's just sitting there in
their vaults from way back.

435
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,910
Uh, so some people ask what
is the currency backed by?

436
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,670
And it used to be backed by gold.

437
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,850
There's the question of what it means
to say something is backed by something.

438
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,870
Uh, because, uh, uh, just speak,

439
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:43,000
you could say it's backed by gold because
if the Fed has $11 billion of gold,

440
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,960
all right. And that's a lot less
than the amount of money out there,

441
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,770
but they always had fractional
reserve banking anywhere.

442
00:30:50,771 --> 00:30:54,400
They never kept all the goal for
all the dollars that they issued.

443
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,340
So you could say it's
still backed by gold.

444
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,930
The really important thing is it's
not convertible into gold. All right.

445
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,660
And so since 1933,

446
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:08,320
the Fed has been managing an inflation.

447
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,600
It used to be that there was zero
inflation if you define it with respect to

448
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:14,434
gold.

449
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,330
And they were really true to that
zero inflation in terms of gold.

450
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:24,690
Now there was inflation with regard to
a basket of the consumer price index is

451
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:30,520
not just the price of gold, it's the
price of of many things. But the,

452
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:31,870
uh, the, uh,

453
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,450
there will be inflation or deflation
as the relative price of gold changed.

454
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,440
But after 1933,
we had lost our moorings.

455
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:46,620
There was no longer any idea that
the dollar was backed by anything.

456
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,390
The concept changed.
Fundamentally,

457
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:54,690
the concept that became
the Federal Reserve or the
central banks in any country

458
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,340
are managing the economy and the, uh, the,

459
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:05,080
their management of the
money supply is, uh, is,

460
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:05,914
um,

461
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,880
is there a way of managing
how well things go?

462
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:18,340
Generally,
it has been inflationary once we,

463
00:32:18,341 --> 00:32:22,600
after 1933,
central banks have generally gradually,

464
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,170
uh,
allowed prices to rise.

465
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,080
And the general view is that if it's not,
it's not extreme.

466
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,540
Uh,
the rise is not too extreme.

467
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,660
It's good for the health of the economy
as long as we don't have inflation

468
00:32:37,661 --> 00:32:39,720
that's too high.
Uh,

469
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:44,030
and so central banks
around the world began to,

470
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,580
uh, manage, uh,

471
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,430
became managers of inflation
rather than defenders of,

472
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,260
of a gold standard. Let me just mention
a couple of other central banks.

473
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:02,480
The Bank of England has been providing
an example for the world for a long time.

474
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:03,530
Uh,

475
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:08,530
the Bank of Japan was established in
imitation of the Bank of England in 1882.

476
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:19,520
Um, the, uh, uh,

477
00:33:19,521 --> 00:33:21,560
the many central banks in Europe,

478
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:26,600
they except go back to
the 18th or 19th century.

479
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,970
Uh, some banks, however, are very
new. The European Central Bank,

480
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,520
which,
um,

481
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,920
issues the euro currency
I was founded in 1998,

482
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,790
so it's only 10 years old.
Uh,

483
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:48,020
that's because it replaced central banks
of the member countries of the European

484
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,040
Union.
The central banks still exist.

485
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:56,990
So you still have the Bank of France,
the butcher, Bundesbank, et Cetera,

486
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:01,730
but they no longer have the importance
that they once did because they no longer

487
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,830
manage a currency.

488
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,280
The currency is centralized
at the European Central Bank.

489
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,290
Uh,

490
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:14,290
one thing that's been a trend
around the world is that the,

491
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:19,520
I mentioned that the US Federal Reserve
system was different from other central

492
00:34:19,521 --> 00:34:23,780
banks in that it was designed
to have independence. Uh,

493
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:28,870
the thought was that the central bank
is guy is guarding the money stock and

494
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:34,630
governments have a tendency to sometimes
to want to raid the back when they're

495
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,983
in trouble.

496
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:40,280
Typically it happened during wars
or government gets into a war.

497
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:45,260
Okay? During the war, the
government needs resources.

498
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:49,280
It's in trouble.
It raises taxes to try to pay for the war,

499
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:52,550
but then it finds that unable
to collect taxes as well.

500
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,090
People start evading taxes.
There's a lot of discord.

501
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,340
It's just hard to raise money by taxing.

502
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,780
So what the government would do is send
someone over to the central bank and say,

503
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:07,220
Hey, expand, expand.
Give us, lend us money.

504
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:10,350
You're the central bank lenders money.
Uh,

505
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,030
and so the central bank would print up
notes and give it to the government and

506
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:18,540
the government would start spending
it on the war. Uh, and so, uh,

507
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:22,040
uh, then you'd have inflation because
they're printing all this money.

508
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:27,330
So war time periods were typically periods
of great inflation and debasement of

509
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:30,080
the currency. Uh, and so, uh,

510
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:32,780
that's why we need independence
of the central bank.

511
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:36,950
We want to have a central banker
that can say no to the government.

512
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,760
So the government comes to the bank and
says, it's a war. We needed the money.

513
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,090
And the central bank would ideally say,
no,

514
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:47,970
how can you get a central
banker to do that? Well,

515
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:50,520
they definitely have to be
independent of the government.

516
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:55,930
And that was the idea in
the u s so there's been a
trend to making central banks

517
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,840
more independent.

518
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:02,910
And there are particular
things that happened in Japan.

519
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,680
In 1997,

520
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:09,630
the government of Japan granted
the Bank of Japan independence,

521
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,890
uh, like the u s uh, uh, central bank.

522
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:19,350
And so, uh, it also happened
in the UK in the same year.

523
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:23,460
Uh, now I've been describing the Bank
of England as the model for everyone,

524
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,750
but in fact,

525
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:29,550
the Bank of England was
not independent until 1997.

526
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:34,920
Uh, and now these, these people
are the people who run these banks.

527
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,680
They, there may still be
appointed by the government,

528
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:40,440
but they have terms of office,
uh,

529
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:45,530
that are lengthy and the government
can't kick the central had head of the

530
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:51,810
Central Bank for failing to offer
them loans when they want it.

531
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:56,940
So in the United States, uh, we
have 12 federal reserve banks,

532
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,490
but we have a federal
open market committee,

533
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:05,100
the Federal Reserve Board in Washington
organizers policy for all 12 banks.

534
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,830
Uh, and the, uh,

535
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:12,750
members of the Federal Reserve
Board have 14 year terms. Uh,

536
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:17,810
plus all the presidents of the Federal
Reserve banks come and serve on something

537
00:37:18,121 --> 00:37:21,520
called the Federal Open Market Committee.
Uh,

538
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,990
and the Federal Open Market
Committee makes monetary policy.

539
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,310
So it's decentralized
and long terms. The, uh,

540
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:33,790
the board members have 14 year terms,
which is quite a long time, uh,

541
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,070
and the central.

542
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:40,160
And also there are the banks
from the regional banks that uh,

543
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,000
uh, that, uh, have,

544
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:48,863
uh,

545
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:54,140
also a role for the federal open market
committee meets about every six weeks or

546
00:37:54,271 --> 00:37:58,620
so. And they decide on
monetary policy. Uh,

547
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:03,930
in fact they decided on how
to, uh, set interest rates, uh,

548
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:06,990
and borrowing requirements
for member banks.

549
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:12,650
One of the things that the Federal Reserve
does is it sets reserve requirements

550
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:14,603
for banks.

551
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:20,190
Reserve requirements are like what the
Bank of England did or the Suffolk Bank

552
00:38:20,191 --> 00:38:21,690
did long ago.

553
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:27,050
It says that you have to keep deposits
with us here at the central bank,

554
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,750
either either that or us keep VOP cash,
uh,

555
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,350
and [inaudible] sure that you
have it as reserves for, uh,

556
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,530
uh,
for your deposit.

557
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,850
Now these banks no longer issue notes.

558
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:47,130
We've centralized the note issue in the
United States starting in 1913 with the

559
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:48,460
Federal Reserve Board.

560
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:52,580
So your notes that you see are
called Federal Reserve notes. Uh,

561
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,720
but bank still are vulnerable to bank
runs because they still have deposits.

562
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:03,750
And so the system is still vulnerable and
that therefore the Federal Reserve has

563
00:39:05,141 --> 00:39:09,300
a step up, a set of
reserve requirements. Uh,

564
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,830
now the reserve requirement,
it's progressive.

565
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,200
Small banks have lower
reserve requirements,

566
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,510
but it rapidly gets up to a standard.

567
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,830
And so the reserve requirement now is 10%,
uh,

568
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:24,950
on demand deposits. So, uh,

569
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:29,830
they're are forced to keep
those reserves. Uh, and, uh, uh,

570
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:35,310
much of that is in the form of
deposits at the Federal Reserve banks.

571
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:37,923
So one,

572
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,700
one form of monetary policy that the Fed
does is they can change these reserve

573
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:44,710
requirements.
The other,

574
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,160
but more commonly used monetary
policy is to change the rate is to,

575
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,340
uh, effectively, uh,

576
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:59,500
alter the rate of interest on deposits.
So the interest rate,

577
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,860
uh, the, the, the, the, uh,

578
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:05,500
policy tool in the United States,

579
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:10,330
the policy interest rate or key rate in
the United States is called the federal

580
00:40:10,331 --> 00:40:11,170
funds rate.

581
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:15,520
And the federal funds rate is an
overnight lending rate between banks.

582
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:21,150
The Federal Reserve conducts monetary
policy by targeting the federal funds

583
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:24,070
rate.
Uh,

584
00:40:24,071 --> 00:40:29,071
and it announces since 1994 it has been
announcing after the meetings or the

585
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:35,590
Federal Open Market Committee,
it's been announcing the,
uh, uh, federal funds rate,

586
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,680
uh, publicly. Uh,

587
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:42,690
so the federal funds rate
was recently cut to 2.25%.

588
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,560
Uh,
and it's like,

589
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:49,300
it's expected to be cut further
because of the recession that we're now

590
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:53,450
apparently in. Uh, and
so that will be the, um,

591
00:40:55,180 --> 00:41:00,180
that will be the monetary policy took
what's happening right now in the United

592
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,130
States is that the economy is collapsing.

593
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:07,480
Maybe that's overstating it's contracting.
Uh,

594
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:12,481
and so the Fed is trying to prevent a
serious recession by cutting interest

595
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:17,860
rates. And so they've been
cutting them rapidly. Uh, and, uh,

596
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:23,430
the federal funds rate is a rate that
is targeted by the Fed and it's their

597
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:25,860
principle target.
Uh,

598
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:30,780
the federal funds rate is the rate that
banks borrow and lend to each other over

599
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,890
night. Um, uh,

600
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:37,370
there's another interest rate that the
Fed sets and that's called the discount

601
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:41,850
rate. Uh, and, um, the, um,

602
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,500
um,
the discount rate

603
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:53,170
is the rate that the Fed charges
for loans to member banks.

604
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,633
The

605
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:03,700
member banks just as with the or the
Bank of England when they're in trouble,

606
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,300
they're supposed to be able to
borrow money from the central bank.

607
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,770
Okay. And the central bank
posts an interest rate that, uh,

608
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:17,000
that is the rate at which
these member banks can borrow.

609
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,550
Uh,
the,

610
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:24,350
there was an important change
in the discount rate in January,

611
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,200
uh,
of 2003.

612
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:32,800
It used to be that the Fed would
grant loans to member banks,

613
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,380
uh, in the form of discount
rate, low lending. Uh,

614
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:43,880
if the, uh, bank could certify
that it was in trouble,

615
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,430
uh,
and uh,

616
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:52,260
at that time they would give generous
loan. This is before 2003, the,

617
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:57,550
the discount rate was it policy variable
set by the Fed and it was typically 50

618
00:42:58,971 --> 00:43:02,630
basis points below the federal funds rate.
Okay.

619
00:43:02,631 --> 00:43:06,500
They're lending to banks that
were in trouble and the, uh,

620
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,500
so we'll give them a good rate.
That's what they used to do.

621
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,900
In 2003,

622
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:16,930
they decided to change that and they
decided to raise the discount rate above

623
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,700
the, uh, uh, the, uh,

624
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,820
federal funds rate. And so they do
actually, there's two discount rates.

625
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:27,530
There's primary and secondary.

626
00:43:28,570 --> 00:43:33,570
The primary discount rate is typically
a hundred basis points above the funds

627
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:36,530
rate. Um, and uh,

628
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:41,110
that's not so recently they've
been cutting it to that, but that,

629
00:43:41,111 --> 00:43:43,610
that was originally the idea.
So they,

630
00:43:43,611 --> 00:43:47,150
in what they wanted to
do in starting in 2003,

631
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,590
is to eliminate the idea that the
discount rate is only for banks who are in

632
00:43:51,591 --> 00:43:54,290
trouble.
They wanted to eliminate the stigma.

633
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:59,060
It used to be embarrassing to borrow
at the discount window because, uh,

634
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,580
the discount rate would,
uh,

635
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:05,350
because it would be s admission
that the bank is in trouble. Uh,

636
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,530
and so in order to try to eliminate that
stigma, they made it a penalty rate.

637
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:14,570
It made the discount rate higher than
the, uh, than the federal funds rate.

638
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,570
So now the federal funds rate
is at two and a quarter percent.

639
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:21,680
The discount rate is now
only 25 basis points higher.

640
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,810
It's at two and a half percent.
Uh,

641
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:27,890
they've been cutting the spread between
the discount rate and the federal funds

642
00:44:27,891 --> 00:44:32,850
rate. Again, it's an effort
to stimulate the, uh,

643
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:38,750
I think one reason why they may have
changed it in 2003 is that interest rates,

644
00:44:38,751 --> 00:44:41,540
we're getting really
close to zero in 2003.

645
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:46,460
And they were worried that if the
discount rate is 50 basis points below the

646
00:44:46,461 --> 00:44:50,450
federal funds rate, then it's going to
hit zero. And that would be embarrassing.

647
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,561
So they moved it.

648
00:44:51,561 --> 00:44:54,080
I think that might be the reason
that no one knows what they're,

649
00:44:54,081 --> 00:44:58,220
all their reasons were. Uh, so, um,

650
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,310
so the,
the,

651
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:05,500
the basic idea that's developed is that
the Fed is looking at inflation and

652
00:45:05,501 --> 00:45:08,770
unemployment as the two major
things that it looks at.

653
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:13,570
Inflation is, is the most important
thing and according to many views,

654
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,700
because the fed has to guarantee the
soundness of the, of the money supply.

655
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:24,180
And there've been so many cases in
history when the central bank allowed

656
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,200
debasement of the currency
through inflation. Uh,

657
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:31,930
and it's thought that that is a serious
error because it destroys trust in the

658
00:45:31,931 --> 00:45:34,450
currency.
On the other hand,

659
00:45:34,451 --> 00:45:39,451
the Fed is also concerned
with unemployment and the
possibility of a collapse in

660
00:45:40,061 --> 00:45:44,170
the system. So right now the
Fed is in a difficult situation.

661
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:47,110
Last year we had 4% inflation,

662
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:51,130
4% inflation is high by,
uh,

663
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,890
by traditional standards.
It's above what we'd like.

664
00:45:53,891 --> 00:45:57,010
We'd like it to be more like 2%,
4% is high.

665
00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:01,330
And so that would mean that the Fed
should be raising interest rates to try to

666
00:46:01,331 --> 00:46:04,900
tighten up the economy and
bring the inflation rate down.

667
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:09,700
But unfortunately, we are in this
collapse situation in the economy.

668
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:13,870
Uh, and so the Fed has a problem
with this. There's a name for this,

669
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:18,871
it's called stagflation stagflation was
a term that was developed in the 1970s

670
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:22,870
to refer to a time when inflation is,

671
00:46:22,871 --> 00:46:25,960
we have both high inflation
and high unemployment.

672
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,650
And so we're in that
situation apparently again.

673
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:34,860
So with interest rates
hitting zero, uh, Alan,

674
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:39,700
I said Alan Greenspan, then Bernanki
must be losing sleep at night.

675
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:42,820
This is exactly the worst
nightmare of a central banker.

676
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:47,560
You've got this policy tool of
interest rate, but once it hits zero,

677
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,360
you're, you're, you're out of business.

678
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:54,780
So he has been working on trying to
find other tools of monetary policy.

679
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,260
Yeah. Uh, uh,

680
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,690
Ben Bernanki has been
very creative in doing it.

681
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:06,380
Maybe I write some of these things down.
Uh,

682
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,050
the term auction facility,

683
00:47:12,530 --> 00:47:17,350
our TAF
was created,

684
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:21,070
uh, by the Federal Reserve, uh,

685
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:25,390
under Bernanki on December 12th.

686
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:32,590
And so, uh, it's a new
form of monetary policy,

687
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:38,110
a new invention, which we've been
doing only for a matter of months. Now,

688
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:42,160
what the term auction facility,

689
00:47:42,550 --> 00:47:47,550
it was also created in connection in
collaboration with the Bank of Canada,

690
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:53,170
the Bank of England, the European Central
Bank, and the Swiss National Bank.

691
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:57,880
So we're seeing an internationalization
of bank monetary policy.

692
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:01,630
All of these central banks
of Canada, England, Europe,

693
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:06,020
and Switzerland got together with
the Federal Reserve and said the,

694
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:10,120
obviously they were worried about the
financial crisis that was in golfing in

695
00:48:10,121 --> 00:48:10,954
the world.

696
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:16,270
And so they agreed to auction off.
Uh,

697
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:20,380
it's a little bit
different than a, um, uh,

698
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:25,080
it's a little different from an
ordinary monetary policy as a way of,

699
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:29,440
of, uh, helping troubled
financial institutions. Uh,

700
00:48:29,441 --> 00:48:33,460
so what they did,
instead of just remember the,

701
00:48:33,461 --> 00:48:38,461
the federal funds rate is a target
interest rate that the Fed attempts to hit

702
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:43,990
through buying and selling treasury
bills in the u s or in other countries,

703
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:47,080
buying and selling government
bonds to affect the market.

704
00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:51,550
If the Fed wants to push
the federal funds rate down,

705
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:54,460
it goes and buys short
term government bonds.

706
00:48:54,970 --> 00:48:59,950
Buying them tends to push up the price
that tends to influence the yield down.

707
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:03,760
And so it encourages a lower
level of interest rate. Uh,

708
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:08,620
but the term auction facility
is different in this facility.

709
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:12,760
Uh, banks are allowed to, uh,

710
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,960
the Fed announces a certain amount of
money that it wants to put out there,

711
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,170
uh, in, uh,

712
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:24,880
in the form of a collateralized loans,
uh,

713
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:29,770
with, uh, uh, other banks,
uh, w with member banks.

714
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,580
Uh,
and so what the Fed said it would do is,

715
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:36,010
is announced an auction,

716
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:40,760
a of so many billion
dollars of, uh, of, uh,

717
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:41,980
uh,

718
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:46,980
loans to a member banks and the banks
have to supply collateral to the Federal

719
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:51,003
Reserve.

720
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:56,060
The collateral could be a number of
things including a mortgage and securitize

721
00:49:56,931 --> 00:50:01,630
mortgages that are risky
and dangerous, uh, assets.

722
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:03,850
Uh,
and so in effect,

723
00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:09,090
the Fed is trying to solve the subprime
crisis by taking on as collateral,

724
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:10,630
uh,

725
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:15,630
some of these risky things in
exchange for offering a low

726
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:23,280
loans to um, uh, a member bank.

727
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:27,710
And it's different from fed policy in
that they set up an a certain amount of

728
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:31,400
money in auction that off
to the highest bidder.

729
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,670
And so troubled banks then who have this
si the problem banks have now is they

730
00:50:37,671 --> 00:50:38,504
have these,

731
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,780
these securitized mortgages that they
bought and the homeowners are defaulting

732
00:50:44,331 --> 00:50:46,610
on the is now.
Uh,

733
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,110
and so there was a panic in the
market for securitized mortgages.

734
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,150
And so the price is often very low,
or if it's there,

735
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:58,760
they're very hard to
market, hard to sell. Uh,

736
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:02,180
and so banks are in trouble.
And as you know,

737
00:51:02,181 --> 00:51:05,780
they're starting to fail because they,
they're,

738
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:09,320
the value of their assets in
the market is falling rapidly.

739
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,570
So the Fed is effectively just saying,

740
00:51:11,571 --> 00:51:15,530
we'll take those assets as
collateral for loans to,

741
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:21,440
uh, and so, uh, they've
given out, as of today,

742
00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:27,380
it's 80 billion, uh, on the term.

743
00:51:27,381 --> 00:51:28,490
So this thing is,

744
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:33,470
this new invention is three
months old at this point.

745
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:35,023
Um,

746
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:40,040
but the system continues
to look more for curious.

747
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:45,130
And so, uh, this is a very
interesting time because, uh,

748
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:48,860
the Fed is, um, is continuing to invent.

749
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,230
So then they came up with the

750
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,550
term securities

751
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,810
loan facility.
Uh,

752
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:05,810
and don't look this up in for Bozi,
uh,

753
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:10,840
because the date of
founding was march 11 2008.

754
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:18,050
That's actually the date that
they announced it. Uh, and uh, uh,

755
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:22,530
what they're going to do is
have auctions of loans of,

756
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,123
of

757
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:30,190
Treasury securities in exchange for
collateral such as mortgage securities.

758
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,480
And the first auction is
first auction is March

759
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:44,360
27,
2008,

760
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,730
which you may know is tomorrow.
Um,

761
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,920
actually I mentioned the term securities
loan facility because it's a new

762
00:52:54,981 --> 00:52:58,310
innovation,
but it hasn't started yet.

763
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,220
So in their announcement on march 11,

764
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:06,550
they said the Fed would
land up to 200 billion,

765
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:11,180
uh,
of securities to the market.

766
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,390
What they're really doing is just the,

767
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:17,220
we're facing the seize up
of our financial system.

768
00:53:17,221 --> 00:53:22,010
So we have banks that we've just
seen the failure of bear Sterns,

769
00:53:22,011 --> 00:53:26,460
which is actually a broker dealer.
But, uh, banks and broker dealers, uh,

770
00:53:26,461 --> 00:53:31,461
are in trouble because their assets are
collapsing under them and they can't

771
00:53:31,531 --> 00:53:34,740
sell them. They get
money. So the Fed is fine.

772
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,600
We'll just take those and we'll give you
a treasury bills, which are completely,

773
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,530
no, everyone trusts them. So you
had some assets that nobody trusts.

774
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:47,370
The US Federal Reserve will take it on.
Uh,

775
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:53,430
uh, and this is an effort. This is
different from most monetary policy.

776
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,350
Uh,
now it's different

777
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:02,690
in important ways because it's really
focused at preventing the collapse of the

778
00:54:04,351 --> 00:54:09,000
economy that is created by
financial system failure.

779
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,550
Uh, and, uh,

780
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:15,450
so it's looking at the problem that
certain troubled institutions have that

781
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:19,490
their assets can't be sold. Um, and, um,

782
00:54:20,870 --> 00:54:22,470
and it's just saying,
okay,

783
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:26,620
well what are we placing them with
assets that can be sold? The Fed is Tate,

784
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:31,960
he's taking on serious risk in doing this,
uh,

785
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:37,010
because these assets that it takes on in
exchange for Treasury securities could

786
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:41,460
fail. Nobody knows how bad the
mortgage crisis is going to get,

787
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:46,890
but Ben Bernanki thinks that
it's so important, uh, that we,

788
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:51,870
um, uh, that we, uh, prevented collapse,

789
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,940
that we should, uh, we
should take that risk.

790
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,370
Incidentally, both of these
things, this is called the ts

791
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:05,670
and this is called the test.

792
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,260
Both of these are joint with
the Fed in the United States,

793
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:15,390
the ECB, the Bank of England, uh,

794
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,950
and the Swiss Bank and Dental Canada.

795
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:24,640
So these are all international efforts
to s to forestall of financial crisis.

796
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:30,510
Uh, there's a third
one, uh, which, uh, uh,

797
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:36,420
is even newer. Well, it's, it
made, this one was announced.

798
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:41,850
The third innovation is called

799
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:48,300
the primary
dealers

800
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,020
credit facility.

801
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:58,510
Uh,

802
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:03,030
and that was announced March 16,

803
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:08,040
2008, so that's how many
days ago, a few days ago,

804
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:11,460
10 days ago. Uh, and that's called the p,

805
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,890
the c f. Uh, and, uh,

806
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:18,870
what the PDC of is,

807
00:56:18,990 --> 00:56:23,990
is really an extension of the
discount window beyond member backs.

808
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:30,820
Uh, and you have to know
what our primary dealers, uh,

809
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:35,650
and, uh, primary dealers
are broker dealers.

810
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,540
They are not banks.
Uh,

811
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:45,150
the critical thing that's happening is
that at a time of financial crisis with

812
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,740
which exceeds any that we've seen
perhaps since the Great Depression,

813
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:55,390
uh, but certainly bigger than
we've seen in many years,

814
00:56:56,020 --> 00:57:01,020
the Fed is worrying about
not just member banks,

815
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:05,500
but also other financial institutions.
For example,

816
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:09,940
bear Stearns, which is
a broker dealer, uh,

817
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:12,250
failed recently,
uh,

818
00:57:12,251 --> 00:57:16,210
and the Fed is worried about
it collapsing house of cards.

819
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:21,640
So what's essential about the prime
primary dealers credit facility is that

820
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:26,290
they're opening up the discount window
lending beyond the member banks to

821
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:29,260
primary dealers.
So what does a primary dealer,

822
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:35,820
when the Treasury in the United
States sells treasury bills,

823
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:38,860
notes and bonds?

824
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:43,150
They deal almost exclusively,

825
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:48,310
but I would say primarily
with broker dealers,

826
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,070
not the general public.
Okay.

827
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:56,490
So the Federal Reserve has a list which
you can find on their website of dealers

828
00:57:58,781 --> 00:58:03,130
who are eligible to participate
in treasury security auctions.

829
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:07,060
There's 20 acts that I'm
not sure there's 20 anymore.

830
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,410
One of them was bear Stearns.
Uh,

831
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,520
and so I don't know whether they're
still on the list. Maybe they are,

832
00:58:12,550 --> 00:58:14,920
maybe they're not.
We might have be down to 19,

833
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:20,020
but these are broker dealers and some
of them are international, like BNB.

834
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:24,940
Powerbar is one of them. It's,
it's French. Uh, and so, uh,

835
00:58:24,941 --> 00:58:29,230
by opening up the primary
dealers credit facility, we are,

836
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,200
we are,

837
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,200
what the government is offering to do is
to take bad investments that they made

838
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:42,230
on as collateral for loans at
two and a half percent, uh,

839
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:46,190
which is the current, uh,
uh, discount rate. Uh,

840
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:51,210
so this is quite a remarkable change
reflecting the seriousness of the crisis.

841
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:56,830
Uh, and, uh, so, um,

842
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:04,240
uh,
so I think,

843
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:09,980
and it's reflecting the fact that we're
moving into possibly a situation, uh,

844
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:13,330
of a protracted situation of,

845
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:17,840
of nearly zero interest rates
and an effort to get more, uh,

846
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:22,850
to keep the economy from a collapsing,
uh,

847
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:26,650
at a time when, um, uh,

848
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:30,560
at a time of great, uh, uh,

849
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,010
concern about the structure
of the financial system.

850
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,170
This is different than other recessions.

851
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:40,240
We've had other economic problems,
uh,

852
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:45,520
that have led to recessions, but it
hasn't seemed to be something as, uh,

853
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:50,550
as potentially global, uh, as it is
now. You know, we had the, uh, uh,

854
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:55,400
savings and loan crisis of the 1980s
and in the savings and loan crisis.

855
00:59:55,401 --> 00:59:57,830
It was a certain segment
of the banking community,

856
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:00,320
the SNLs that seem to be in trouble,

857
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:05,540
but it didn't seem to be then a house
of cards that could spread around, uh,

858
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:09,280
around the country and around the world.
Um,

859
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:14,570
in 1998, there was the Russian default
crisis and then there was a, um,

860
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:17,250
there were some seize up,
uh,

861
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,590
that maybe resembles what were happening.
It's happening now.

862
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:26,090
Long term capital management
was a big, uh, uh,

863
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:31,340
a hedge fund that failed in 1998
and got billed out by the Fed.

864
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:35,150
Um,
but I didn't see then the,

865
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:39,500
the proliferation of
these new instruments, uh,

866
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:40,993
that,
uh,

867
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,890
reflects concerns about the
current economic situation.

868
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:52,420
So I think, uh, maybe the
concluding lesson in that,

869
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:57,490
that the central banks were institutions
that emerged out of experience with

870
01:01:00,501 --> 01:01:04,880
bankers. It started not
really as a plan system, uh,

871
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:06,230
not planned by any government.

872
01:01:06,231 --> 01:01:10,760
The Bank of England was its own bank and
the Suffolk Bank was its own bank and

873
01:01:10,761 --> 01:01:14,320
they develop ways of doing business,
uh,

874
01:01:15,650 --> 01:01:19,490
without government planning,
uh,

875
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:23,150
to help try to preserve
stability of the system. Uh,

876
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:28,190
there've been fundamental changes through
time that make the role of the central

877
01:01:28,401 --> 01:01:31,250
bank, uh, evolve and change through time.

878
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:35,510
So I know I mentioned earlier that we
used to be on the gold standard and

879
01:01:35,511 --> 01:01:40,400
central banks were gold
standard institutions that
were trying to stabilize the

880
01:01:40,401 --> 01:01:43,880
economy, but subject to the
constraint that they had to maintain,

881
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:47,180
convert ability with gold. Uh, and, uh,

882
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:49,970
but those central banks,
uh,

883
01:01:50,310 --> 01:01:53,450
raw has changed a lot of the,

884
01:01:53,451 --> 01:01:58,370
it seems like the nature of
recessions is always changing. Um,

885
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,370
the, uh, the biggest risk,

886
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:06,390
the biggest recession we've had since
the Great Depression, uh, was the, um,

887
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:11,090
it was actually a pair
of recession, uh, in, um,

888
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:15,890
there was every, a short
recession in 1980. Uh,

889
01:02:15,891 --> 01:02:19,740
it's lasted just a few months. Uh,
and people once got out of that,

890
01:02:19,741 --> 01:02:22,410
people thought maybe we're
getting a brief, a respite,

891
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:25,690
but then in the u s crashed into a huge,
well,

892
01:02:25,691 --> 01:02:27,390
actually it was a worldwide recession

893
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:31,740
of 1981,
two,

894
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:39,420
and this was the biggest recession
since the great depression.

895
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:42,670
What caused that recession?
Uh,

896
01:02:42,671 --> 01:02:46,530
I think there's a simple story which is
very different from what's causing the

897
01:02:46,531 --> 01:02:47,341
current,
uh,

898
01:02:47,341 --> 01:02:52,341
apparently current recession in
19 in the 1960s and seventies.

899
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:57,810
Central banks around the world.
We're inflating the currency. Uh,

900
01:02:57,811 --> 01:03:00,240
it was getting out of proportion.

901
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:05,340
We had inflation rates in the United
Kingdom and the order of 20% a year,

902
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:10,140
and people were asking what is going on
in the UK bashed and have enlightenment?

903
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:15,210
What's going on. So they, uh, they
elected Margaret Thatcher, uh, and,

904
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:20,070
uh, uh, there was a resolve
to do something about it,
but it wasn't just the UK.

905
01:03:20,071 --> 01:03:24,330
It was all over the world. Inflation rates
had gotten very high, even in Germany,

906
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,720
uh, where anti-inflammation
sentiment was the highest.

907
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:32,760
And so central banks around this time
was,

908
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:35,430
I think it was under the
leadership of Paul Volcker,

909
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:37,290
who is Federal Reserve chairman.

910
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:42,890
They raised interest rates
to kill inflation and they
throw the world into the

911
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:49,170
huge recession. So, um, what
was, what, what caused it?

912
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:52,840
It was caused, if it, maybe
it's over simplifying, uh,

913
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:58,130
it was caused by a change in our resolve
to let this get inflation under control

914
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:05,070
and a willingness to accept the recession
to stop the advance of inflation.

915
01:04:05,310 --> 01:04:08,700
You can blame it on other things
like the oil crisis of 1979.

916
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,180
Nothing is completely
simple. But anyway, this is,

917
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:16,120
this recession has been a model
for what happens in recessions.

918
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:18,980
And the idea that emerged this,
uh,

919
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:24,180
the memory of the 81 82 recession is very
strong and our imagination because we

920
01:04:24,601 --> 01:04:28,350
think that it was caused
by lax monetary policy,

921
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:30,090
by liberal thinking,

922
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:34,290
by the soft hearted liberals who just
didn't want to create any pain and

923
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:37,530
suffering. And I'm talking about
the view that's commonplace.

924
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,570
And so we finally got tough. We
got Paul Volcker in there, uh, and,

925
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,020
uh,

926
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:47,070
central banks around the world all managed
to get tough around that time and we

927
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:50,790
killed inflation. Uh, but
it created a recession.

928
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:55,770
That's what happened in 81 82. But you
have to remember that times are different.

929
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:58,620
Subsequent recession.
We're not like that.

930
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:02,640
So we had another recession in 1990 91,

931
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:07,250
and it wasn't very big or bad.
Uh,

932
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:11,760
this recession was, I think,
just a Gulf war recession.

933
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,270
It was caused by, uh, well,

934
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:18,460
partly by an oil price spike because
by sedan, the war against it.

935
01:05:18,461 --> 01:05:23,290
I'm who's saying? Uh, but
it was also caused by just a
general lack of confidence,

936
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:28,300
right? It wasn't caused by the Fed
suddenly tightening against inflation.

937
01:05:28,970 --> 01:05:33,820
Uh, it was different. It was, um, it
was, this recession was not understood,

938
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:34,930
not anticipated.

939
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:39,370
The Fad Camian lake to cut interest
rates to try to prevent it from getting

940
01:05:39,371 --> 01:05:42,970
worse cause it just didn't seem
to have any reason for happening.

941
01:05:42,971 --> 01:05:46,330
It just surprised everyone.
So it was not a repeat of this.

942
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:49,660
And then we started 2001 recession.

943
01:05:50,590 --> 01:05:52,660
That recession again is different.

944
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:56,140
And I think the 2001 if you
want to tell a story about it,

945
01:05:56,450 --> 01:06:01,030
at the 2001 recession was caused by
the end of the stock market. Boom.

946
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:06,300
We had a bubble in the stock market in
the 1990s and it collapsed after 2000 and

947
01:06:08,201 --> 01:06:11,270
without it brought the economy down,
the Fed they,

948
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:16,290
and again cut interest rates in 2001 in
response to the very definite weakness

949
01:06:17,651 --> 01:06:18,484
of the economy.

950
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:24,120
And then that brings us
to the 2008 recession.

951
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:28,300
Now it's still hasn't been
identified as a recession and,

952
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:33,410
and some people are still hoping that
we won't have a recession in 2008.

953
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:37,420
Uh, but I think it's really
looking like we are in a recession.

954
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:39,760
Notably there's different indicators.

955
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:44,440
The one that just came out is
the consumer confidence index,

956
01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:49,770
which was a conference board publication
that indeck is now a way below the

957
01:06:50,561 --> 01:06:54,790
lowest that it got in the 2001 recession.
All right.

958
01:06:55,020 --> 01:07:00,020
And it's out the level almost down
to the lowest that we got in the 1990

959
01:07:01,051 --> 01:07:04,030
[inaudible] 91 recession. So I, you know,

960
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:07,750
that by that indicator we are in a
recession and we don't know that it's over

961
01:07:07,751 --> 01:07:10,780
yet.
It's been falling a home.

962
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:15,370
Prices are falling at the highest threat
we've ever seen. You know, I have,

963
01:07:15,371 --> 01:07:18,500
my own index is the standard
and poor case Shiller indexes.

964
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,130
And we announced our indexes yesterday.

965
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:27,300
We saw record price declines and a monthly
basis for 14 of our 20 cities that we

966
01:07:29,531 --> 01:07:33,900
reported. That means that
they've never declined, uh,

967
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,840
as much in one month
before. He said, well,

968
01:07:37,841 --> 01:07:41,020
our data started in 1987.
I have a, I don't have,

969
01:07:41,021 --> 01:07:43,330
we don't have data on
individual city basis,

970
01:07:43,331 --> 01:07:47,650
but it really looks like the housing
collapse price collapse that we're going

971
01:07:47,651 --> 01:07:50,330
through now is a,
uh,

972
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:55,350
an American to not paralleled since
the Great Depression of the 1930s.

973
01:07:56,500 --> 01:08:00,190
Uh, so, um, uh, I,

974
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:03,580
I think that we are in
a difficult situation,

975
01:08:03,581 --> 01:08:06,160
but maybe it's not a panic about the,

976
01:08:06,290 --> 01:08:10,660
the optimistic thing is I think that
we have a very good fed chairman,

977
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:11,501
uh,

978
01:08:11,501 --> 01:08:16,250
and we have coordinated efforts by
central banks around the world and we're

979
01:08:16,251 --> 01:08:18,770
doing things that, uh, uh,

980
01:08:18,771 --> 01:08:22,580
our attempts to prevent the collapse
of the financial institutions.

981
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,400
I think we're still in
a precarious situation,

982
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:30,820
but I think we do have central bankers
who are working effectively given the

983
01:08:31,821 --> 01:08:36,100
tools that they have. Now.
Incidentally, I, I'm writing a book. Uh,

984
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:41,150
the title of the book is Sub
Prime Solution. Uh, and, uh,

985
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:46,220
I just sent it off the draft
to the copy editor last Friday.

986
01:08:46,730 --> 01:08:50,510
So, um, uh, the book,

987
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:55,220
my publisher, Princeton
University Press, uh,

988
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:59,600
wants to get it out before
this crisis is over. And so

989
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:06,280
we've got them on a rush to try to get
the book out and they're thinking that,

990
01:09:06,590 --> 01:09:11,030
uh, we'll at least have
copies to reviewers by June.

991
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:16,100
And I've been worrying that my book
will be too late and that by, by June,

992
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:20,360
everything will be rosy
there, lovey over. Uh,

993
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:24,860
I guess I should hope that
that happens. Uh, but, uh,

994
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:28,120
I have a suspicion that come June,
uh,

995
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:33,020
this crisis will not be
over. Unfortunately. Some of
you are on the job market,

996
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:37,520
uh, this year. Uh, and I, I want to
give you, uh, some constellation,

997
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:40,380
uh, if, um, if you are not, uh,

998
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:44,420
had a great success so far
in finding a finance job,

999
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:48,530
the cancellation is they're
killing people at the top too.

1000
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:50,650
And so they're going to,

1001
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,500
and so when you do get a job
in a financial institution,

1002
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,940
there'll be more spaces above you
on the ladder to move up. Okay.

1003
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:03,060
Uh, that I think that kind of, uh, uh,

1004
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:06,030
jokingly, but I think, um,

1005
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:09,320
I think you are facing over rather
different if you're on the job market,

1006
01:10:09,321 --> 01:10:14,230
you are facing a difficult economy. And,
uh, but, uh, I'm sure that the ule emerge.

1007
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:15,320
All right.
In the long run.
