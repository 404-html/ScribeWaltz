1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,860
I believe that we still have
on for next, for Friday. Um,

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,770
Stephen Schwarzman,
he said he would do it.

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,780
I always worry about people who have such
important businesses because some big

4
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:20,430
deal may become an crisis.
Uh,

5
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:24,780
people like that have trouble
sometimes adhering to a schedule,

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,330
but, uh, as far as I
know, we're getting him.

7
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:30,970
So I hope that you will
all be able to come, uh,

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,230
this Friday here at the usual time.

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,520
If there's any problem with
his appearing, uh, I will, uh,

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,270
email you. Um, so as you know,

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,460
Stephen Schwarzman is a
graduate of Yale College, uh,

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,910
and he's one of the great
stories of our century. Uh,

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,480
he created a,

14
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,440
it's just about the biggest
private equity firm, uh,

15
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,710
from scratch in 1985. Uh, and, uh,

16
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,120
they, I guess they just went
public and they have a huge market.

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:11,150
Kepler comparable to one of the biggest
old line investment banks in New York,

18
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:15,020
but he just, he and Peter
Peterson just created it. Uh,

19
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,560
so I think it'd be very interesting to,
to hear him.

20
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,750
Uh, and again, uh,

21
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,040
you'll have a chance to question
him about what he's done. Um,

22
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,820
I put on the reading list, the New
Yorker article that's outright now. Well,

23
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:36,090
actually it was a, I guess it
was out of a couple of weeks ago,

24
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,130
but it's up on our a syllabus.
Uh,

25
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,180
but I think I might want to take it down
before he comes back. I ain't to turn,

26
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,480
I'm going to reflect on this,
uh,

27
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,380
because he may not be pleased
with the article. It's, it's,

28
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:57,300
it's a very hard hitting critical,
uh, article. Uh, well, you know,

29
00:01:57,301 --> 00:02:01,410
he, he had to be a tough
businessman arrive at where he is.

30
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,770
Um, so, uh, yeah,

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,920
the New Yorker article talks about the
price of his condo or co op in New York,

32
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:14,100
which a set some record.
And so they tell the things like that.

33
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,210
I was just yesterday
in London, uh, and, uh,

34
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,550
people like to gossip
about things like that,

35
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:24,780
that the limo driver is driving me to
the airport point was pointing out the

36
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:27,980
scenes in London. He said, you
know, that building some, uh,

37
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,180
Arab sheik just paid a hundred million
pounds for that part of the 10,000

38
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:36,630
apartment in that
building. Uh, and the, uh,

39
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,650
the same sheik is
ordering a Airbus for his,

40
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,920
one of these big Airbus
airplanes for his personal plane,

41
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,900
and he's having it plated with gold leaf
that you hear the story. Did anyone,

42
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,780
is this true? This is what a
limo driver told me yesterday.

43
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,400
He said it's going to cost him 500
million pounds or something like that,

44
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,270
uh, to do this. Uh, but
these are, these are gossip.

45
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,660
They're the real substance,
uh, is what the man does,

46
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,270
or a woman does a for the world.

47
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,510
And so I gleaned a here a list
of some of the charities. Uh,

48
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,110
Stephen Schwarzman is a
major philanthropist, uh,

49
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,150
and he set up something called
the Blackstone Foundation, uh,

50
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,380
from the Blackstone group.

51
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,950
And he's a major donor or
a collaborator with, uh,

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,040
the frick collection, the
Whitney Museum, Phoenix House,

53
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,700
the Red Cross,
the Inner City Scholarship Fund,

54
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,150
New York City,
outward bound,

55
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,260
and the Asia Society.
So I think that's the real thing.

56
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:45,700
We should talk about not the size
of his penthouse. And so, uh,

57
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:50,470
I might try to find a more even handed
account and put that up on the website.

58
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,223
Um,

59
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:59,380
but incidentally it's sort
of a resemblance between
him and David Swensen in the

60
00:03:59,381 --> 00:04:02,440
sem. Well, first of all, they're
both phenomenally successful,

61
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,770
but they both are emphasizing
alternative investments. They're,

62
00:04:06,771 --> 00:04:11,200
they're not straight laced,
uh, a old fashioned there.

63
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,560
They're willing to take
experiments. So, uh,

64
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,950
so I think he should be a very
interesting, uh, anywhere. That's,

65
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,130
that's Friday at nine. Now, uh,

66
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,750
I want to talk about the stock
market today and I thought, uh,

67
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,300
uh, I will keep it more or
less basic because I think,

68
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:37,210
uh,
I want to emphasize basic concept,

69
00:04:37,211 --> 00:04:41,320
but what I'm going to talk
about as Modigliani Miller
Modigliani Miller but are

70
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:42,940
not going to get too deep into it.

71
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:47,560
Maybe in your review sections you can
get more technical and I'm going to just

72
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:51,490
talk about it in a very
intuitive, uh, direct terms.

73
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:56,800
Uh, so, uh, what are stock? Okay.

74
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:57,790
Uh,

75
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,790
I think the idea of a stock must have
been invented independently at many times

76
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:04,660
in history.
Uh,

77
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,950
the word shares is the fundamental word.

78
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,750
So I suppose you are starting
a business with somebody. Uh,

79
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,490
it could be at any time in
history, uh, you know, Babylonia,

80
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,360
something this must have
happened. Okay. And so, you know,

81
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:27,300
a group of people start a business
and they say, let's divide up the, uh,

82
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:32,050
the proceeds. That's very direct, isn't
it? If we're all working together, uh,

83
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:36,430
we divide up the proceeds.
And so that means we're allocating shares.

84
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,870
Now, I don't know how far back it goes,
but it must be that in ancient times,

85
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,790
some people would say,
all right,

86
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,450
you're going to be doing more work
or you're contributing more to this

87
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:49,780
enterprise. We'll give you a bigger
share of the profits. Right? That's,

88
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,890
it's so basic. It must've happened
a million times. And that's,

89
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:58,880
that's the basic idea of,
uh, of, of the stock market.

90
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,870
All it is, is that we've
got much more, um, high,

91
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,880
high flown and much more legalized then.

92
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,810
So the, uh, the basic idea is that
you have to have shares in something.

93
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:15,470
Okay. Uh, uh, business. Uh,

94
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:20,471
and the idea goes back clearly to ancient
Rome that let's consider a business as

95
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:27,530
sort of a person who is on like a
slave who's owned by other people.

96
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,330
Uh, and in the, in law, the word person
doesn't mean what you think it means.

97
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:38,180
There's a Gnat. In Law. A
natural person is you and I, uh,

98
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,450
people, real flesh and
blood, blood, individual,

99
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:46,040
they're called natural persons.
But when we say person, it also,

100
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:50,630
that's more general. It also
includes corporation. Uh,

101
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,590
and you know, the Word Corporation comes
from the Latin Corpus, meaning body.

102
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:58,790
So it's an embodiment.
We create an entity that in,

103
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,540
in the eyes of the law
is like an individual.

104
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,300
It may be owned by other
individuals, but it is, uh,

105
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:11,330
has its own rights and responsibilities
as if it were a person. So, uh,

106
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,980
in ancient Rome, corporations were
called Public Connie. That's Latin.

107
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,230
Uh, the public Connie were, um,
were companies like we have today.

108
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,240
And, um, according to the research
of [inaudible] da, uh, Stanford,

109
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,410
uh, she thinks that, uh,

110
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,790
the stock market in ancient
Rome was done on the street, uh,

111
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,300
and the Roman forum. And she can tell you
where. So when you go to Rome, you can,

112
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,970
you can walk and see there what's
left of their stock market.

113
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:45,240
But it never flourished
really until, uh, uh,

114
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,790
relatively modern times.

115
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,523
MMM.

116
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,650
So the idea of course is
that we have a legal entity,

117
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:56,651
a corporation that issues shares that are
either given to people or purchased by

118
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:00,770
people.
Uh,

119
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,270
and the idea is that shares
represent contributions.

120
00:08:05,271 --> 00:08:09,860
You give shares to someone who is
contributing to the enterprise. Okay.

121
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,200
Now, uh, you can, uh, when
you set up a corporation,

122
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,580
there's different kinds of relationships
that people might have to the

123
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:20,414
corporation.

124
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,460
One of them is as a shareholder and the
shareholder gets a share is entitled to

125
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:29,900
a share of the profits,
but there's also employees who get wages,

126
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,150
uh, and that's very
different. Uh, they get, uh,

127
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:38,170
they have our labor contract that
specifies how much they will get. Uh,

128
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,140
and then you'll have debtors. And, uh,
other people with other relationship.

129
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,840
But the fundamental one
is the shareholder, right?

130
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:47,750
Because the shareholder
owns the corporation.

131
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,110
Uh, and, uh, uh,

132
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,800
so,
uh,

133
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,020
as it's evolved in modern times,

134
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:03,380
the corporation has a
charter or the bylaws.

135
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,070
When you create a corporation,

136
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,660
you write up a contract which
specifies the rules of the corporation.

137
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:14,661
It's like a constitution
or the corporation and also
the law of the state in

138
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:18,740
which the corporation has chartered.
Also,

139
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:22,280
it puts restrictions on what
can be in the bylaws. Uh,

140
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,210
notably is typically required
that, uh, it's one share,

141
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:30,890
one vote, uh, and that, uh, there's, uh,

142
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,090
it will be also required that there'd be
an annual meeting at least once a year,

143
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,160
a shareholder meeting.
Uh,

144
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,000
and then the shareholders
can vote on relevant issues.

145
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,290
And one of the most important issues
then is to elect a board of directors.

146
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,480
And the state law probably requires that
a corporation have a board of directors,

147
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,710
but it's also something that can be
defined at the time that you create the

148
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,280
corporation in the bylaws.
But it's not something you can do,

149
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:02,310
just whatever you want. State Law, uh,

150
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,140
has requirements for the board
of directors. Okay. And so,

151
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,910
uh, uh, but anyway,

152
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,770
I'm just going to talk
in very basic terms.

153
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:18,600
So the usual structure is one shareholder,
one vote at the board of,

154
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,860
at the annual meeting.

155
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,480
The shareholders can come
and elect a board, uh,

156
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,630
and the board then a is in charge of
the company and the board hires the

157
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:34,110
president or chief executive
officer or, and other, uh,

158
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,730
top officers of the company, uh, and
they serve as employees of the board.

159
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,420
So the theory is that the shareholders
are in control because they elect the

160
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:50,610
board and the board hires the
president, uh, and its democratic.

161
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,850
I'm going to come back to it. It
doesn't always work out as perfectly as,

162
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,210
as you want, but, uh, uh, and uh,

163
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,830
now there's basically,

164
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,590
there's an important distinction
between two kinds of corporations.

165
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,850
There's for profit and nonprofit. Uh, I'm,

166
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:13,830
I've been describing a for
profit corporation, which
is the usual variety, uh,

167
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,300
nonprofit corporations. Uh, we'll
also have a board of directors,

168
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,660
but they will not have any shareholders
is a fundamental difference in the

169
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:26,880
charter and the way the government
reacts to them. The, the,

170
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,340
the nonprofit organization,

171
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,050
the corporation is set up
to advance some cause, uh,

172
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:37,230
and it is not owned by anyone.
Uh,

173
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,860
the share price you could say
is identically zero. Actually.

174
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:45,510
You can't say what the share price is
because there are zero shares and they

175
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:46,470
have a zero price.

176
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,690
So the value of the price per
share is zero over zero and uh,

177
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:56,530
you can't define it. So yeah, the
university is a nonprofit corporation.

178
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,690
The price of a share in Yale University
is undefined. It's zero over zero.

179
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,120
Uh, it has a board that runs it,
but the board is not liable to,

180
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,620
for shareholder vote. Uh, well actually
we have some voting among alumni I guess.

181
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:17,110
But, um, uh, it's not, it's
not a for profit corporation.

182
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:21,370
So I'm going to be talking
about a for profit. Now the,

183
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,480
the critical,

184
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,160
the critical thing to understand about a
corporation is that in order to value a

185
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:34,690
share in a corporation,

186
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:40,150
you absolutely have to know the
number of shares outstanding, right?

187
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,010
If I own a thousand shares in a
company, uh, what does that mean?

188
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,760
It doesn't mean anything until you
know how many shares are outstanding,

189
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,310
right? Because, uh,

190
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,310
if I own a thousand shares and then you
look it up and find out how many shares

191
00:12:57,311 --> 00:13:02,050
are outstanding, there are a thousand.
You say, Hey, I own the whole company.

192
00:13:02,051 --> 00:13:03,040
It's mine,
right?

193
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,980
If you own a thousand shares and
there are a thousand outstanding,

194
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,360
but what if you own a thousand shares
and there are 10 million outstanding?

195
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,380
Well, uh, then that means
that you own one, uh,

196
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,720
10,000 for the company.
They divide, right? Uh,

197
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,950
and so, uh, that's a very
important lesson to keep in mind.

198
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,240
People don't usually know how many shares
are outstanding in the company that

199
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:31,570
they invest in a,
that's because in a sense,

200
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:34,420
they're trusting two analysts.
Ultimately,

201
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,960
analysts are supposed to keep track of
this when they look at the price of a

202
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:42,550
company. How do we know whether the price
at which you're buying is reasonable?

203
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,091
Well,

204
00:13:43,091 --> 00:13:47,110
they must be looking at some measure of
the value of the company and dividing by

205
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:48,280
the number of shares,

206
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,690
and then that gives them some
idea of what the shares worth. Uh,

207
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,370
but it's absolutely essential.

208
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,510
So the sheer is only mean something as a,

209
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,660
as a relation to their
total number of shares.

210
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:05,890
Their companies routinely do
what are called splits. Okay.

211
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,510
They may do a two for one
split, uh, and that means,

212
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,710
uh, if you held a thousand
shares, you get a letter saying,

213
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,220
congratulations,
you now own 2000 shares.

214
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,240
And so don't be too jubilant
because, uh, when they do a split,

215
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:27,820
they do it to every single shareholder.
Right? So you now have 2000 shares,

216
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,140
but now there's 20 million shares
outstanding in the company.

217
00:14:32,141 --> 00:14:36,820
So the ratio is unchanged. So you
might ask, well, why do they do splits?

218
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,430
Well,
it's just to keep the numbers.

219
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,040
It's actually not a very
good reason to do split.

220
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:46,120
There's no reason not to do
splits either, uh, because it,

221
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:50,190
it's just changing the units of
measurement. But typically, uh,

222
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,560
in the United States,

223
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,980
they do split to keep the price of a
share somewhere in the 20 to $40 range.

224
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,280
Uh, and there's interesting
literature on why are they do that?

225
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:06,230
Maybe it's a tradition, uh, maybe
it's to keep the value of kind of, uh,

226
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,440
in a,
in a familiar range or a small,

227
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,510
they don't want them to
get too expensive because

228
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:17,390
people can't have small investors
can't afford them anymore. Who knows?

229
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,760
But the point is,
it's different in different countries.

230
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,720
So the total number of
shares is almost, uh, the,

231
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:29,390
the tendency to do splits
a is a cultural thing.

232
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,340
It's of no real significance.

233
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,210
Warren Buffet doesn't do splits
it with his Berkshire Hathaway.

234
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,280
And there are other companies that,
I guess Google doesn't use,

235
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,420
but this isn't that right? Is
that right? Are you saying no,

236
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:46,710
actually I don't remember, but
they haven't done one yet. Uh,

237
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,740
and so what does the price
per share, you know, so,

238
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,240
so this is getting a little high,
550 price it, I don't know who shoes.

239
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,590
These are his, I'm gonna leave their
shoes. I should have removed that,

240
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,780
uh,
uh,

241
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,790
$550 a share is kind of high because
most people will buy this part of our

242
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:11,600
tradition. Most people will buy
shares in what's called round lots.

243
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,590
That's a hundred shares.
So if it's, um, five,

244
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,610
if it's 550,
that makes 50,000,

245
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,220
$55,000 for one round lot.

246
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,740
I can't multiply and I'm
standing up. But, uh,

247
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,810
uh, so, uh, so they,

248
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,020
most companies do splits
because that might close you.

249
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,800
You might've been thinking investing
in Google, uh, but you could still,

250
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,351
you could just say,

251
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:43,190
I want to buy 10 shares or five shares
and the broker will do it for you,

252
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,730
but they might charge a higher commission.
Um,

253
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:51,500
so, but anyway, that's, that's
the, the, the, the lesson.

254
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,590
So there's a term I should
write some of my terms down,

255
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:57,170
very important term in finance.

256
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:02,490
And that's solution.
Um,

257
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,310
if the company increases the
number of shares through a split,

258
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:12,050
that is not delusion because it
doesn't really mean anything.

259
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,160
When you do a split, you're changing
the number of shares for everybody.

260
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,790
So it can have no effect
on the ratio for anybody.

261
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,830
So it's just purely appearance.

262
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:27,430
But delusion occurs when the
company changes the number
of shares asymmetrically

263
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:31,390
not changing it for everybody. So, um,

264
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,470
the typical example of dilution
is the board of directors, uh,

265
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,780
has hired a CEO for the company and
they wanted to motivate the CEO.

266
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:42,973
Uh,

267
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,140
they can pay the CEO or salary or
they can give shares to the CEO.

268
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,680
Uh, and that's quite
standard, uh, because, uh,

269
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,010
they feel that that makes
the CEO a shareholder.

270
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,170
It's like another form of compensation,
uh,

271
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,840
and that compensation might
have different attractiveness.

272
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,610
So they'll give the person a package,
both the salary and some shares,

273
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,290
but you see,
if they give that,

274
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:15,310
if they merely give shares to the CEO
or without increasing your shares,

275
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,460
then you are being diluted because it's
raising the total and it's reducing the

276
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,690
ratio. Uh, uh,

277
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:30,000
now if a company sells shares,
it issues new shares,

278
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:34,350
they can do that at any time. When you
start a company, you might have had like,

279
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,890
uh, you know, maybe when,
uh, Peter Peterson and, uh,

280
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,400
Stephen Schwarzman founded
the Blackstone group,

281
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,080
they gave each of them 500 shares.
It could be, I'm just making that up.

282
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,820
Uh, but obviously there's going to be more
shareholders as, as, as time comes in.

283
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:55,780
Uh, one thing that people can do
to get in is to buy shares. Uh,

284
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:57,150
uh,
if they,

285
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:02,150
if the company issues new shares
by selling them to the public,

286
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:05,910
it's not a obviously dilution,
right?

287
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:11,160
It of course it's lowering
your share of the company.

288
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,820
But off setting this is that the company
is taking in money from the person who

289
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:21,280
bought the shares. And so
it doesn't dilute you. Well,

290
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,290
you could say it dilutes your,
but it doesn't lower the price of your,

291
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:30,510
of your investment in general.
It could depending on a lot of factors.

292
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:35,490
But, um, uh, so, uh, dilution occurs,

293
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,280
uh,

294
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,280
the term specifically refers to changes
in a number of shares that affect

295
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,480
adversely existing shareholders.

296
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:52,460
Another common term is a
stock dividend versus license.

297
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,440
Talking about dividends,
sorry.

298
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:03,030
Uh, as the stock market. Okay. Let me see.

299
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,770
I was going to talk about stock dividend,

300
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:09,771
but I better talk about dividends
first in for profit companies,

301
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,730
people are investing in the
company for profit. Okay.

302
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,170
And how do they get the
profit? Well, the company,

303
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:23,110
the board of directors decides when,
uh,

304
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,000
if and when to pay dividends
to the shareholders.

305
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,740
And then the law of the state would say
that they must treat them all equally.

306
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,880
So they've made some money and now
they want to take it out and spend it.

307
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,670
They have to do it equally
to all shareholders.

308
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,770
And that's called paying a dividend.

309
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:46,780
They can do it on rare occasions or they
can do it whenever they feel like it or

310
00:20:48,911 --> 00:20:51,700
they can do it regularly.
That's often done quarterly.

311
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,320
When I set up a company case,
Shiller Weiss Incorporated, um,

312
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:01,170
typical of young startup companies,
we didn't pay a dividend. A,

313
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:04,430
we gave shares to,
uh,

314
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,740
almost all of our employees as
part of their compensation. Uh,

315
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:11,020
and uh,
um,

316
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:14,670
we hope that would motivate them and
make them feel a part of the company. Uh,

317
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,240
but we never paid them a dividend.

318
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,350
I remember one time I was talking
to our CEO and he said, you know,

319
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,100
maybe we should pay at least one dividend
because our employees are forgetting

320
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:29,020
that they own these shares. And
so, so we paid one dividend. Uh,

321
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,940
and uh, I don't know how much excitement
at generated, but that's the thing. Yeah.

322
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,700
Does this mean that say if this stop

323
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:42,550
dividend
immediately hang up,

324
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,500
the price per share should go down?

325
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,730
Yes. Yeah. It is asking
after I firm pays a dividend,

326
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,940
uh,
that should lower the,

327
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:57,240
you're asking whether it should
lower the price of a share. And yes,

328
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,720
you are absolutely right.
Uh,

329
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,300
if the company pays out money that the
value of the company should have just

330
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:10,380
gone down by the amount they paid out,
but the number of shares hasn't changed.

331
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:15,890
So that means that the price of each
share should decline by the amount they

332
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:20,930
paid out, divided by the number of shares.
Uh, and there's a term for that. Uh,

333
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:24,060
they call it [inaudible]
x dividend. So, uh,

334
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,950
the company, uh, if you look, I
used to be, you could look on the,

335
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,960
we can still see this, some of
these are still listed on the stock,

336
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:36,600
New York stocking smart change page on
the day that a stock goes ex dividend,

337
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,970
they'll have a little x by its price.

338
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,170
And the reason they put that there
is so that people don't get alarmed.

339
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,100
So people, a lot of people watch
the price of their share every day.

340
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,140
Some people get neurotic about it,
right?

341
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,000
And then suddenly it drops by $2
a share and they say, Oh my God,

342
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:57,210
I'm worried. They call up their
broker and say what's wrong?

343
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,080
And then the broker has to explain, no,
no, you didn't just see the x there.

344
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:05,910
It just went x dividend. So
it doesn't mean anything. X
dividend date is the date,

345
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,130
not the date that you actually
received the dividend,

346
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,580
but it's called the ex dividend
date, which the company, uh,

347
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,680
decides on that day. Anyone who, uh,

348
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,630
was a stock holder of record gets
the dividend. And then the guy,

349
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,280
uh, after that, the, the, the, you
don't get that dividend. And so,

350
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:30,520
uh, that's a, that's an
important, uh, uh, and,

351
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,220
and this really does happen. Socks really
do drop in price on x dividend date.

352
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,070
Now the, uh, nine said no,

353
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,280
that's an interesting question that
you bring up because should I pay any

354
00:23:41,281 --> 00:23:45,470
attention to dividend
dates as an investor? Uh,

355
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:50,530
the answer is generally not because
if you buy the stock before it goes ex

356
00:23:52,161 --> 00:23:56,810
dividend, you get, you
have to pay a higher price,

357
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,950
but you get the dividend. If you,
if you wait till the next day,

358
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,800
you pay a lower price, but you don't
give a dividend, get the dividend.

359
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,970
And unless there are some tax effects,
which might matter,

360
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,960
the tax is always complicate things.
But unless disregarding tax effects,

361
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:16,520
it doesn't matter, uh,
which, uh, which you do.

362
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,830
So in fact, there's a
rule Finra, which, uh,

363
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,940
licenses stockbrokers tells their people
you must not sell dividends and they're

364
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:31,050
referring to a bad practice that
some unscrupulous stock brokers, uh,

365
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,360
occasionally do.

366
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,770
They'll tell someone a hurry up and buy
the stock because it's going to go x

367
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:41,660
dividend. If you buy it today, don't. If
you wait, you won't get the dividend. Uh,

368
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,610
uh, that's misleading because it really
doesn't matter when you buy the stock so

369
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:50,370
that you're not supposed to as
a broker sell dividends. Um,

370
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:55,190
that doesn't mean dividends don't matter.
Ultimately they're the reason why you,

371
00:24:55,191 --> 00:25:00,080
uh, why you own a stock. Well,
let's gets back. This is so,

372
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:05,410
so people are accustomed to getting
dividend checks in the mail.

373
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,010
If you own stock,

374
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,190
we don't get them in the mail anymore
because you own it through some brokerage

375
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:13,220
account and you get a con,
you get on a website,

376
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,900
you used to get checks in the mail.

377
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,490
Now you go on our website and you'll
see that your dividends are credited to

378
00:25:19,491 --> 00:25:23,240
your account with money is
growing in your account.

379
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,010
As companies pay out dividends.

380
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:30,380
I was going to talk about a stock
dividend and starting to do that.

381
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,840
Sometimes companies will announce that
they are paying not a cash dividend.

382
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,230
They're paying a stock dividend.
Uh,

383
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:45,950
and it does say we are pleased
to announce that we have,

384
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:51,130
are paying a dividend a in new shares
issued today by the company equal to 5% of

385
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:57,110
your existing share. So it's a
5% dividend. Congratulations.

386
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,360
Uh,
is that a good thing?

387
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,860
How excited we should you be to get the
letter saying your company has paid you

388
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:08,090
a stock dividend? Any idea on that? Well,

389
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,850
you should be absolutely unexcited
because it doesn't mean anything,

390
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:18,320
right? Because if they were giving
you extra shares and just you alone,

391
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,200
that would mean a great,
that would be good.

392
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:26,950
But when the whole essence of a stock
dividend is that they're paying it to

393
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,990
every shareholder in the same proportion,

394
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,470
so every 100 shares becomes 105 shared.

395
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,340
So you know that that has
no meaning to me, right? It,

396
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,860
because all that matters is the ratio.

397
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:43,650
How many shares I own divided by
the number of shares outstanding.

398
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,470
So if they both go up
by the same for portion,

399
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:50,130
then numerator and denominator go buy
the same amount. And so there's no,

400
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,570
there's no change. Uh, so
then you might ask, well,

401
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:59,440
why in the world do companies issue stock
dividends anyway? What's the point? Uh,

402
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,000
are they trying to confuse
or fool somebody? Uh, well,

403
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,850
there's different views on that.
One of them is yes,

404
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:08,070
they are trying to
confuse and for somebody,

405
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,050
if they don't have money
to pay the dividend,

406
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:14,850
they can always do a stock dividend. On
the other hand, some people say, well,

407
00:27:14,851 --> 00:27:16,290
that would backfire, right? If,

408
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,230
if they're going to take stock
dividends and try to fool us,

409
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,250
what's going to happen? The price of a
share is going to fall on that day, right?

410
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,880
When you pay a stock dividend, you would
think that now there's more shares.

411
00:27:26,881 --> 00:27:30,030
Everyone divides by the larger number
of shares in the value of the company.

412
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:33,450
He goes down. So it's not going
to work to pay a stock activity.

413
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:38,660
So the more enlightened view
is corporations only pay
a stock dividend when they

414
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:43,080
have some good news to announce. And so
typically they'll write a letter saying,

415
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,290
congratulation,
we have great news.

416
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:50,310
We have some new breakthrough
and in celebration of this,

417
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:54,110
we're going to pay everyone
a 5% stock dividend. Now, uh,

418
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,740
they are hoping that the price doesn't
fall because they're announcing it with

419
00:27:58,741 --> 00:28:03,030
news and incense issuing this doc div.
And it's just a way to make it dramatic.

420
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,330
Um,
okay.

421
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,393
Um,

422
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:14,710
now, incidentally, in a for profit
corporation, this has to understand this,

423
00:28:14,711 --> 00:28:17,590
this is a concept which
is enshrined in law.

424
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,020
In a for profit corporation,

425
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:25,470
the purpose of the entity is defined
as profit for the shareholders.

426
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,990
Now in some countries and
in some jurisdictions,

427
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,260
the law might not be
entirely clear on that.

428
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:37,060
They might say there are other
stakeholders, uh, but in the purest form,

429
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:39,250
and this is the form that we
have in the United States,

430
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:44,590
the company exists for the
shareholders. Uh, they're the ones,

431
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:49,030
there are other people who have contracts
with a company like the employees,

432
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,880
but the employees are not shareholders.

433
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,870
They are receiving salary
or something else. Uh,

434
00:28:55,871 --> 00:28:59,740
and the important thing
for the corporation is to
live up to any promises it

435
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:02,050
made.
It has to live up to its promises.

436
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:06,880
But the purpose of the corporation
is the shareholders. Okay?

437
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,800
And this is a capitalist idea that
might sometimes sound wrong. Uh,

438
00:29:11,801 --> 00:29:15,700
you might say, why should a company
exist for the shareholders a while?

439
00:29:15,701 --> 00:29:18,730
The concept here is that
it's a good business model.

440
00:29:18,731 --> 00:29:22,300
People do need money and they
go into business to make money.

441
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,380
And so let's make, make it clear
that's what the company is going to do.

442
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:30,580
It has to behave in an honorable way
for everyone to have to live up to its

443
00:29:30,581 --> 00:29:35,150
contract. But the company generally
doesn't give to charity. It doesn't, uh,

444
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,320
contribute to political campaigns.
It doesn't,

445
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:40,390
it shouldn't be ideally
doing any of those things.

446
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,260
It should be to get money
back to the shareholders.

447
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,690
So if you ever serve on
a board of directors,

448
00:29:46,691 --> 00:29:49,000
this is the thing that
I want you to remember.

449
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:53,410
Cause many of you will serve on
boards of directors, your you,

450
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,100
when you sign on to a job on the board,
okay,

451
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,240
you are signing on to a
solemn responsibility.

452
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:06,750
And that responsibility is to treat all
shareholders equally and fairly and make

453
00:30:08,201 --> 00:30:12,670
money for them. And then you're, you're
not supposed to ever do anything that's,

454
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,200
that's not honest or not
living up to contract,

455
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,400
but your purpose has, there's only
one purpose. It's the shareholder.

456
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:26,650
When you serve on a board,
you are in a fiduciary role.

457
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:31,390
You are there to protect shareholders.
Uh, and that's the concept.

458
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:32,530
So it's for profit.

459
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:37,690
And the theory that we have in capitalist
countries is that this is a good

460
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:41,140
model. There are nonprofits
fine, but we, the, the,

461
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:44,350
a lot of the stuff that has
to be done for an economy,

462
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,340
it's only going to get done through
for profit corporations. Uh,

463
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:52,690
and so let's, let's make it
clear. That's make it unambiguous.

464
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,860
People who are on boards or our
managers of these companies,

465
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,530
they can give their
personal money to charities,

466
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,120
but they themselves are obligated
to make money. It's not,

467
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,590
it's not a vice.
This is the concept that is in the law.

468
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:13,510
And the reason we have it in the law is
that it works to produce prosperity and

469
00:31:13,511 --> 00:31:18,310
to produce the things we need, like
clothes, medical service, home, whatever.

470
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,050
So that's why we do it.

471
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:25,110
And there's no shame in pursuing
profits and getting it out to your

472
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:28,460
shareholders. Now ultimately, uh,

473
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:33,340
the purpose of investing in a
share is to get the dividends.

474
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,560
That's the whole named purpose
of the corporation. Uh,

475
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,580
so,
uh,

476
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,840
I might add though that there are other
ways that I may have said that too

477
00:31:46,301 --> 00:31:50,800
narrowly. Traditionally you
buy stocks to get dividends.

478
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,180
That's the reason.
Uh,

479
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,660
but I want to be careful about
qualifying that. Uh, first of all,

480
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:04,510
a lot of people don't seem to even grasp
that basic point that you buy stocks

481
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:09,540
for the dividends. A lot of people
think, well, I, I will buy stocks.

482
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:10,930
Well,
why do people buy stocks?

483
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:14,710
They'll buy snacks because they think
the price is going to go up and make them

484
00:32:14,711 --> 00:32:17,920
a lot of money. They can sell
it at an advantage, right?

485
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:21,790
That's what most people think,
right? Do I buy stocks for dividends?

486
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,550
Some people don't even
know what a dividend is.

487
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,480
They just think of stock is something
whose price goes up, but you know,

488
00:32:28,481 --> 00:32:31,560
it doesn't make sense to think that the
price of anything would go up if it's

489
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,190
all,
if that's all there is to it.

490
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,960
Why would people pay any price for stocks
if there wasn't some way to get money

491
00:32:37,961 --> 00:32:42,440
out. So the ultimate thing is
the dividends that the dividends,

492
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:46,100
even though a lot of people
forget the dividends, uh,

493
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:51,080
and don't realize how important they are.
Uh, they are actually the driving force.

494
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,340
Now I wanted to just show you a
plot that you already saw, uh, in,

495
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,840
uh, your, uh, if you look down
on a spreadsheet that I had, uh,

496
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:06,000
uh, this is the stock market
for the United States.

497
00:33:06,001 --> 00:33:10,190
It's the standard and poor
composite. They, uh, in 1957,

498
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:15,500
they re formulated it and they call
it the standard and poor 500. Uh,

499
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,730
but,
uh,

500
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:21,020
I'm using their long
theories back to 1871.

501
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:26,330
And so I can't call it the 500 are
calling it to come. How's it? Uh,

502
00:33:26,331 --> 00:33:30,520
and, uh, what this is,
is the price of, uh,

503
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,480
a portfolio of shares in US companies.

504
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,500
Uh, so it's kind of like the
average price of a share,

505
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:45,050
a adjusted for splits because,
uh, you don't, you don't want to,

506
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,680
obviously when they do
a two for one split,

507
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:50,750
the price falls in half
and that's meaningless.

508
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,550
So you want to correct for splits.

509
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,320
So SNP corrects for splits and
follows the price of a share. Now,

510
00:33:57,321 --> 00:34:00,730
unfortunately the same
companies are not around, uh,

511
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,580
the companies that we had in 1871,

512
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,020
hardly any of them are even exist anymore.
So what they do is our pricing,

513
00:34:09,021 --> 00:34:13,970
a portfolio of shares and w they
keep substituting in new ones. Uh,

514
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,790
there's an index committee that
keeps bringing in new shares.

515
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:18,320
When new companies become important,

516
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,150
they try to get the 500 representative
of the most important companies in the

517
00:34:23,151 --> 00:34:27,500
world and the u s and you can see
that's what the price is done.

518
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,740
Uh,
there's also the earnings

519
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:35,600
per share,
what our earnings per share it,

520
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:40,850
it earnings are something that accountants
have generated and they've been doing

521
00:34:41,211 --> 00:34:45,080
it all the way back to 1871.
It's a venerable concept.

522
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:49,220
It's how much money did
the company make this year?

523
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:52,830
If it's annual earnings, okay. Uh,

524
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,760
the price of a,

525
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:59,750
of a share is a price of the ownership
of that earnings stream forever.

526
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:04,760
If I buy a share, I'm in with everyone
else who owns the company. Uh,

527
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,400
and I have a claim on the earning stream,

528
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:10,880
but the earning stream
is a year by year thing.

529
00:35:10,881 --> 00:35:15,530
It just tells you how well they
did in that given year. Uh,

530
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,550
so you can see that the,
uh,

531
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,260
the stock market has been more
volatile than the earnings. Uh,

532
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:27,200
and the price of a share is many times
higher than the earnings per share.

533
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:32,120
So typically the, the ratio of
price to earnings has been about 15.

534
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,040
So that means that people will pay
up front for about 15 years earnings.

535
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,640
Okay. But, uh,

536
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,600
the company does it. Okay. Earnings
and dividends are different.

537
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:52,410
Okay. Earnings is the money that
the company made in a given year.

538
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:55,500
Okay.
How do they know what they made?

539
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:59,730
That's a complicated thing that
accountants figure out. Alright?

540
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,930
And accountants find it difficult
to define the earnings of a company,

541
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:07,230
but they do something and they
come up with a number. Uh,

542
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,910
it may surprise the company directors
how much we made or how little we made

543
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:17,010
according to the accountants. But the
dividend is something much more concrete.

544
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,510
This is what they actually send out.
This is cash send out to shareholders.

545
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:22,501
All right?

546
00:36:22,501 --> 00:36:27,501
So earnings has kind of a theoretical
concept that accountants work on and it

547
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:31,980
can go up and down depending
on adjustments they make.
They might decide that,

548
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,570
you know, you, we, we, uh, uh,

549
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:38,070
we have some investment over there that
we just lost money on and we should take

550
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:42,510
a write off for that. Uh, and the,
uh, management might say, well,

551
00:36:42,511 --> 00:36:44,370
what do you mean we didn't
lose any money this year?

552
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:48,210
But the accountants thought we
did. So, uh, that's earnings,

553
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:52,770
but dividends is very concrete.
It's what they send out. Um,

554
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:56,290
here is the price earnings ratio,
uh,

555
00:36:56,370 --> 00:37:00,160
for the u s stock market from 1881,
uh,

556
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:03,370
to the present. Uh, and uh,

557
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,570
this was also on that spreadsheet
that you have on the website.

558
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,940
You can see that I'm saying
it about 15, 15. This is 50,

559
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,020
15 times earnings. It's typical, uh,

560
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:17,100
but we're in a high price earnings,

561
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:22,150
a scenario now it goes up and down
depending on your outlook for earnings and

562
00:37:22,861 --> 00:37:26,250
maybe other factors.
The Red Lion as longterm interest rates,

563
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,560
but I want to talk more
about that right now.

564
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:32,880
But the earnings is a measure
of the value of a company.

565
00:37:32,881 --> 00:37:35,970
And typically they've been valued
at something like 15 times earnings.

566
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,420
When the price earnings ratio gets high.
I did in 1929,

567
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:44,610
people get antsy and they thought, oh
my God, the price earnings ratio was 35.

568
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,990
Uh, again, this is price divided by 10
year earnings, not one year earnings.

569
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:52,830
So what I do is that we had an
extraordinarily high price earnings ratio

570
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:57,050
representing a lot of optimism in
the 20s for the stock market. Uh,

571
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:01,290
and then it corrupted him abruptly down
where that was the great depression and

572
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:06,291
we had a similar even higher price
earnings ratio of about 46 at the peak in

573
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:08,730
2000 and it corrected way down.

574
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:13,890
So the price reflects you really,
when you buy a share of a company,

575
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:17,310
you own it forever. You, you will be, uh,

576
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:21,530
you are entitled to receiving
the dividends that are
paid out of earnings, uh,

577
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,900
for the rest of your life. And you can
give it to your children. And you know,

578
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:29,100
maybe in 200 years from now it'll be
worth it. Probably not. But it might be,

579
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,630
it probably won't even
exist in 50 years, but, uh,

580
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,700
it will be bought by some other company
and it will still value and will still

581
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:40,300
be going up. Uh, so, uh,

582
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,030
that's the price of things.
Now the earnings,

583
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,380
you understand where I kind
of theoretical concept,

584
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,190
but dividend is the money
that we send out. Uh,

585
00:38:51,191 --> 00:38:55,930
and so how does the company decide
on dividends? Well that's again,

586
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,960
up to the board to decide a or they can
set up a committee on the board that

587
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:04,830
would decide,
but ultimately that's a major decision to,

588
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:08,650
to send out dividends.
And typically,

589
00:39:08,651 --> 00:39:13,210
young companies do not send out dividends.
If you've set up a company,

590
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:14,950
uh, like, uh,

591
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:18,190
you don't want to pay a dividend for
awhile because you need the money and

592
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:21,610
you're reinvesting it in the
company and people will understand,

593
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,760
they don't expect to get their money
out of an investment right away.

594
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,640
But as a company matures, then
they typically feel that, uh,

595
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,450
it's a time to pay a dividend.

596
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,300
The S and p 500 is 500 companies
who are major companies.

597
00:39:37,301 --> 00:39:41,790
So these tend to be mature companies
and they tend to be in the, uh,

598
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:46,660
dividend paying stage. So
the question then is, uh,

599
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:50,620
the payout ratio, uh, pay payout ratio

600
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,350
is dividends over earnings.

601
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,230
I say div over,

602
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:05,260
he and I have the payout
ratio for the United States.

603
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,650
Um, that's the payout ratio. Uh,

604
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:14,470
going back to 1871, uh,
there are some spikes up,

605
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:19,600
like for example, in, um, that's
what you're here. I'm not sure what,

606
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,510
but yeah,
that was 1921 maybe now this year,

607
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:27,540
this is 1932 or 33 companies were paying
out 160% of their earnings as dividends

608
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:37,300
and that you might say, well, what's going
on here? It was the depression, right?

609
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,160
So what was actually happening is the
depression was killing these companies.

610
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:44,980
They weren't making any money.
Uh,

611
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,600
but they didn't want to cut their dividend
because they were afraid that if they

612
00:40:49,601 --> 00:40:54,070
cut the dividend, uh, people will
be upset. So they're trying to keep,

613
00:40:54,071 --> 00:40:56,020
maybe they did cut it,
they didn't cut it too much.

614
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,750
So that means that they were paying
out more than they were earning.

615
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,320
That's what typically happens in
these spike. There was a crisis. Uh,

616
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:08,550
but now there's also a trend down where
they used to pay out typically like 80%

617
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:09,514
of their earnings,

618
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:14,470
but it's been gradually going downward
and now it's down to like 40%. It's a,

619
00:41:14,471 --> 00:41:16,450
that's a cultural thing I would say.

620
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:19,810
But it's that companies now
are wanting to keep the money,

621
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:24,811
and it may have to do with the fact
that people today don't seem to be as

622
00:41:25,181 --> 00:41:26,380
focused on dividends.

623
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,660
And so that means that companies
are more able to reinvest earnings,

624
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,800
uh,
and a fake.

625
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,510
This is the dividend
price ratio back to 1871.

626
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,680
Uh, so back in the late 19th century, uh,

627
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:47,400
the dividend price ratio
is typically a 5%. Uh,

628
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:50,330
I think it was clearer in those days,
uh,

629
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:54,680
in terms of just general investing culture
and were behavioral and her attitude,

630
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,530
it was clearer that you bought
a stock to get a dividend.

631
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,350
Stocks were kinda different in those days.
They were more like,

632
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:04,400
railroads are steel companies. And
it was just understood. I'm, if,

633
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:07,310
if someone were at recommending
you a stock, you'd first say,

634
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:11,060
what does its dividend? And if
someone said it's 4%, you'd say, well,

635
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:15,980
that's kind of meager. You know, I, I
want a better dividend in that. Now.

636
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,400
People don't seem to be focused on
them. They're there. In another sense,

637
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:23,920
they're more willing to entrust the money
back to the board of directors to, uh,

638
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,190
to decide on m
and a,

639
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,940
whether to, uh, uh,

640
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:38,210
whether to pay when and whether
to pay the evidence. Uh,

641
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:42,080
now the other thing is there's another
other ways to get money out of a company

642
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,880
without paying a dividend.
And one of them is stock repurchase.

643
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,850
Uh,
well there's also a liquidation,

644
00:42:53,851 --> 00:42:57,530
let you mentioned liquidation of
liquidation or sale of companies.

645
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,110
I'll talk about this for

646
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,080
a company doesn't ever
have to pay a dividend.

647
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:11,250
All I can do is keep piling into money
and accumulating it and then someone will

648
00:43:11,251 --> 00:43:14,850
buy the whole company and then all of
the shareholders will be bought out at a

649
00:43:14,851 --> 00:43:18,280
termination date. Uh, uh,

650
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:21,810
that's one way that I, uh, a, uh,

651
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,920
but often when companies are bought
out the, they don't give them cash,

652
00:43:25,921 --> 00:43:29,280
they give them shares in
the acquiring company. Uh,

653
00:43:29,281 --> 00:43:33,390
and so then you would be
relying on getting dividends
from the acquiring company.

654
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:38,580
Uh, so I don't emphasize this
a cash sale of a company,

655
00:43:38,581 --> 00:43:41,130
but it does happen sometimes.
Um,

656
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:45,960
the other thing that a company can do
to get money out is Sherry purchase,

657
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:51,270
uh, and uh, uh, uh, stock
repurchase or share repurchase.

658
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:55,880
And it's perfectly, this sometimes
surprises people and they've delayed,

659
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:57,030
when I first think about it,

660
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:00,570
you as an individual can
call up your broker and say,

661
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,320
I want to buy Google
shares, right? Uh, but, uh,

662
00:44:05,690 --> 00:44:10,230
uh, but, uh, Larry Page at
Google can call up a broker.

663
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,010
He better get the board's
permission. Uh, uh,

664
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,640
somebody at Google can call up your
broker and make the same statement.

665
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:21,480
We want to buy Google shares.
And so you might say, well,

666
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:26,220
how can Google by Google,
uh, why not the answer?

667
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:30,690
Why shouldn't Google by Google shares?
Then you it up. Well, let me ask you this.

668
00:44:30,691 --> 00:44:35,550
What would, if if Google decided
to buy up all of it shares, okay.

669
00:44:35,970 --> 00:44:36,803
Did that happen?

670
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,521
All right.
I'm I,

671
00:44:42,521 --> 00:44:46,980
I'm the CEO of Google and
ice called the broker.

672
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:52,390
I say there is how many shares
are outstanding? Like 100
million or something? No,

673
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,810
it wouldn't be a hundred. Now we
know the price is $500. $500 a share.

674
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:00,400
I can figure it out more or less fit.
Well,

675
00:45:00,401 --> 00:45:04,150
the answer is you. Uh, well
let me put it this way.

676
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:08,880
Let me see if this will help
you under suppose, uh, uh,

677
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:13,690
very page calls up and says,
I'd like to buy all of the Google shares.

678
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:17,520
And the broker says, all right,
I'll get them for you. Um,

679
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,120
and then he comes back and says,

680
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:22,480
I managed to get all about a hundred
shares and there's this one guy,

681
00:45:22,481 --> 00:45:23,380
this Yale student,

682
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:28,710
a who owns a hundred shares of Google
stock and I'm having trouble getting him

683
00:45:30,101 --> 00:45:33,580
to a cell. All right? So the
broker calls you up and says,

684
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:35,400
Google wants to buy back all of it.
Shit,

685
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,920
I'm being silly here in a few
am I can be silly like this.

686
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:43,120
What do you say to the broker then?
Okay,

687
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:44,490
so the broker calls you up and said,

688
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:49,491
you're the last guy you had the last 100
shares and Google and Google wants to

689
00:45:51,071 --> 00:45:54,670
buy them and we'll give you $500 a share.
So what do you say

690
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,913
what?

691
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,210
Well, yes. You say, no, actually I
have a better thing you say. Right.

692
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:04,570
Call Larry Page and tell him he's fired.

693
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:08,740
Because I realize I own the company,
right?

694
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:11,620
If I own the last a hundred shares,
it's all mine.

695
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:16,300
I don't have to take any or do
whatever I want the last chair holder.

696
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,690
So a company can't buy all of it shares.
Uh,

697
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:24,340
but I can buy some of its shares and
that's another way to get money out of the

698
00:46:24,341 --> 00:46:25,174
company.

699
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,273
MMM.

700
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:31,900
And so, uh, it's a little different
if they see, if they buy, if they pee,

701
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:35,670
suppose you own a hundred shares and
they declare a 5% cash dividends,

702
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:37,820
then you get $5.
Okay.

703
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:43,340
But what if the company buys
back 5% of its shares? Okay.

704
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:46,820
What happens then? Uh, well,

705
00:46:47,270 --> 00:46:52,190
the company is still paying out
money in the same amount total.

706
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:57,470
Uh, but uh, uh,

707
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:01,160
it's coming out in a different form.
It's coming out as,

708
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,020
as a share repurchase is,

709
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:08,720
it's changing the number
of shares outstanding. Uh,

710
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:12,980
so the, the, the value of the
company declines by the same amount.

711
00:47:12,981 --> 00:47:17,750
It has to as if they had just paid a
dividend. If they're sending out money,

712
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,450
the value of the company has to
go down by whatever they send out.

713
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,290
But with Sherri purchase,
the number of shares goes down,

714
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:28,340
and if they don't do share repurchase,
the number of shares doesn't go down.

715
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:31,840
So a sense,
it's all the same to me as a shareholder,

716
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,580
whether they pay

717
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:40,690
dividends or they repurchase shares. Now
I don't know how clear that all. Well,

718
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,010
let me just write this down. The
names. This has, this idea has a name.

719
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:48,910
Uh,
two authors,

720
00:47:48,911 --> 00:47:52,670
both who won the Nobel Prize in finance,
Franco,

721
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,770
and I knew I was his advisee and my phd,

722
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,980
so I learned how to pronounce
his name, uh, motor Yanni. Uh,

723
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:06,650
because in Italian you
don't pronounce the g other,

724
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:11,650
I tend to say Modigliani just
to be understood. Uh, and, uh,

725
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,440
Merton Miller,
uh,

726
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:18,580
Marianna is one of the
authors of your textbook.

727
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:24,240
Uh, uh, along with full Bozi, uh,

728
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:29,650
Mariani and Miller wrote a famous
article arguing that what I just said,

729
00:48:31,131 --> 00:48:35,010
I just tried to say it in a
very intuitive terms that, uh,

730
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,610
very nascent,
it's dividend policy

731
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:46,720
is irrelevant, although
they do put in a, uh,

732
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:52,570
a qualifier that it could matter for
tax reasons that you have to put that

733
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:58,110
qualifier on just about anything you
say in finance because the tax system is

734
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:02,660
infinitely complex and every
country has different taxes, states,

735
00:49:02,661 --> 00:49:06,640
different states have different taxes.
There's nothing you can say, uh,

736
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:11,540
boldly and finance if you allow taxes.
But this just disregard taxes,

737
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,630
uh, when, when, when,

738
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:19,730
when Modi on this sounds like a very
strong proposition about dividend

739
00:49:19,731 --> 00:49:22,130
irrelevance. And, um,

740
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:30,130
what they are saying is that of course a
lot of things that a board of directors

741
00:49:30,441 --> 00:49:32,480
decides to do is not irrelevant.

742
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:37,820
It's highly relevant to the future of
the company. But real things matter.

743
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,540
Like if a company decides to
build that new plant in Akron,

744
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:44,000
that matters for the company.
I mean,

745
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,610
because if the plant
works out to be a success,

746
00:49:46,611 --> 00:49:49,880
then the company will do well
and they're spending money on,

747
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:53,300
on concrete and bricks
and machinery and uh,

748
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,850
they could be doing
that wisely or unwisely.

749
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,950
And that's beyond finance to evaluate.
But when Modigliani and Miller said,

750
00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:04,160
if,
if it's pure dividend policy,

751
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,370
then it is totally irrelevant.
It means nothing.

752
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:11,600
So companies can do whatever they please,
I don't care.

753
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,810
And you as a stockholder,
I don't care what they do.

754
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:19,910
And the reason Modigliani and Miller said
that is they were thinking that if the

755
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:24,940
dividend policy is going to be changed
without changing any of the activities of

756
00:50:26,331 --> 00:50:30,420
the firm that is keeping it
a purely financial chain,

757
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:35,750
then it must be that they're switching
from dividends to stock repurchase or

758
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:38,540
stock repurchase to
dividends because you see,

759
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:42,230
you can keep the operations the same,
uh,

760
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,150
whether or not you pay a dividend,
if you saw,

761
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:49,700
if choosing not to pay a dividend
mean substituting stock repurchase for

762
00:50:49,701 --> 00:50:52,590
dividend. So, uh, yeah,

763
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,570
I'm going to build that plant in Akron
whether I've had a dividend or not

764
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,970
because uh,
uh,

765
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:03,740
if I need to cut my dividend in
order to get the money to, uh, uh,

766
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,960
uh, to build the plant, uh,

767
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:12,530
and I would also be cutting my stock
repurchase or one way or the other,

768
00:51:12,531 --> 00:51:14,960
it doesn't,
it all comes out to the same thing then.

769
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,310
Let me put it in the simplest way.

770
00:51:16,311 --> 00:51:20,390
I think the simplest way to understand
Modigliani Miller proposition is the

771
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:21,224
following.

772
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:26,120
Imagine that we as a board decided
to pay a dividend of $5 a share.

773
00:51:26,121 --> 00:51:30,220
Okay? And let's talk in the old days I
bought sending checks are, all right,

774
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,460
we're going to send a letter to
all our shareholders and say,

775
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,760
we have decided to pay
$5 dividend. Okay. Um,

776
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:42,110
and so you're about to approve this.
At the meeting we approve a letter.

777
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:45,740
The letter's going to say we're making
money, here's your dividend check.

778
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:49,010
And then someone says, hey,
why don't we just change it?

779
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:53,630
Why don't we say same $5 check is include,

780
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,420
but in the letter,
let's say something different.

781
00:51:56,421 --> 00:51:59,990
Let's say this is a repurchase of,
uh,

782
00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:05,150
of some of your shares at market
price saying the same check.

783
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:10,000
Right? Uh, and so what's
the difference? Uh, well,

784
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,720
I'll ask you what difference does it make?

785
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:15,080
Suppose you get a letter from your
company saying, congratulations,

786
00:52:15,081 --> 00:52:18,920
here's a $5 dividend and here's
a check for $5. If you're,

787
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:22,970
if you own one share or the company says,
congratulations,

788
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:27,800
we're repurchasing, uh, 2%
of your shares, uh, and uh,

789
00:52:27,801 --> 00:52:32,390
and here's a check for $5 to pay you
for those shares. Okay? And by the way,

790
00:52:32,391 --> 00:52:35,900
we're doing that with all shares,
but if you think about it,

791
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:37,970
it doesn't make any difference to me,
right?

792
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,310
It doesn't matter what that letter says.

793
00:52:40,311 --> 00:52:44,300
I can crumple it up and throw it in the
wastebasket. I don't, I want the $5 check.

794
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:48,680
If they're paying me by sending
money and calling it a dividend,

795
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:54,380
it's the same as if they say they're
repurchasing my shares because it's

796
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:57,770
repurchasing my shares. If they do it
for everybody, it doesn't mean anything,

797
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:01,310
right? I'm getting,
uh, we're all lowering.

798
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,890
All of our shares are going
down by the same amount.

799
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:09,430
So that's the basic insight and
a Modigliani and Miller that um,

800
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,750
that share repurchases and dividends
are really interchangeable.

801
00:53:14,751 --> 00:53:18,160
It's just all a conceptual
difference. So, uh,

802
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,680
this kind of took people by surprise.
It's kind of odd. It should be obvious.

803
00:53:21,681 --> 00:53:25,010
I'm making it so simple.
I can write some mathematics to try and,

804
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:29,370
but I think it's so simple
and obvious that uh, uh,

805
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:33,390
you just have to keep remembering
that all that matters for a company,

806
00:53:33,391 --> 00:53:34,224
for you as a,

807
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:39,440
your interest in a company depends on
your share is divided by the total number

808
00:53:39,721 --> 00:53:42,630
of shares and a stock repurchase.
If they repurchase,

809
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:46,650
everybody shares the same proportion.
It doesn't affect that ratio.

810
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:49,140
So you don't care what the letter says,

811
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:54,330
whether it says a dividend
or stock repurchase. Okay.

812
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:57,860
So why would a company want
to do one or the other? Well,

813
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:00,060
what are yawn and Miller
are leaving the room.

814
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:05,510
They say it doesn't matter if you asked
them why a dividend payout policy has

815
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:09,640
changed. Uh, there's a
famous, uh, Miller quote,

816
00:54:09,990 --> 00:54:11,730
he calls a neutral mutation.

817
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,190
Um,

818
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,680
a and as a reference to evolutionary
biology that sometimes mutations are

819
00:54:22,681 --> 00:54:27,210
neither advantageous nor
deleterious. And so, uh, the,

820
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:32,010
the genome starts piling on mutations that
mean nothing. Uh, that's how they date,

821
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:33,000
uh,
uh,

822
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:37,260
ranches of the genome by looking
at the number of neutral mutation.

823
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,620
And he said all this, this
thing that I have up here, well,

824
00:54:40,621 --> 00:54:44,130
the previous slide showing
the dividend earnings ratio,

825
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:49,070
it's just cultural. It means
nothing, uh, because, uh,

826
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:54,390
uh, to some extent what was not shown
in that diagram is the stock repurchase.

827
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:59,490
Uh,
I wanted then finally to talk about Modi,

828
00:54:59,491 --> 00:55:04,380
Yani Miller and debt. Now, I didn't
talk too much about debt yet,

829
00:55:04,381 --> 00:55:06,140
but um, Oh, before I tell you,

830
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:11,160
I just want to say one more thing about
Modigliani Miller dividend irrelevance

831
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:13,074
of dividends.

832
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,500
There is a possible correction
to be made due to taxes when,

833
00:55:20,071 --> 00:55:22,440
what are Yani and Miller road?

834
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:28,370
There was a differential tax rate
between dividends and capital gains.

835
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:33,030
And so, uh, it was muddy
Yanyah Miller said back then,

836
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:38,060
this is like 30 or 40 years ago that
companies should really not pay dividends

837
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:44,270
because dividends were then taxed
at a higher rate than capital gains.

838
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:48,060
And so you don't want
to give your employees,

839
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:50,790
your shareholders taxes.

840
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:56,210
You should in your fiduciary duties as
a board member be trying to help them

841
00:55:56,341 --> 00:55:59,310
lower their taxes.
It doesn't say that on the state law,

842
00:55:59,311 --> 00:56:03,240
but that would be an inferred
as the, uh, as the duty.

843
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:08,370
So you would avoid paying
dividends, uh, and uh,

844
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:13,050
and therefore switch to share
repurchase as your method. This,

845
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:17,840
it took decades for Modigliani
Miller to kind of sink in. But, uh,

846
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:22,410
as you can see it, part of the reason
why the dividend earnings ratio,

847
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:27,370
especially in more recent years since
1990 has been declining as corporations

848
00:56:27,371 --> 00:56:32,371
were trying to somewhat ease the tax
burden on their shareholders by doing

849
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,140
repurchase instead of dividends.

850
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:38,313
However,

851
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:43,350
that all changed in 2003 with the jobs
and growth tax reconciliation act of

852
00:56:44,891 --> 00:56:45,850
2003,

853
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:50,440
which cut the rate of
taxation of dividends to 15%.

854
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:53,200
The same rate that
capital gains are taxed.

855
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:57,020
So there is now no preference
and whether it could be,

856
00:56:57,340 --> 00:56:59,170
there's a lot of
complexities in the tax law,

857
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:04,410
but basically a dividend policy really
is irrelevant now because if we,

858
00:57:05,441 --> 00:57:09,790
if, if there's no tax advantage to one
over the other, it is completely neutral.

859
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,640
The, um, the other thing that
I wanted to say about, um,

860
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:20,740
Modigliani and Miller is
about corporate debt. Uh,

861
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,680
and um, so, uh,

862
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,560
I have to bring one of these.

863
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:31,783
So the,

864
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:36,710
I talked about a company as
having only shares outstanding,

865
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:40,010
but they also have debt outstanding.
Okay.

866
00:57:40,011 --> 00:57:43,310
So a company can borrow money.
Uh,

867
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:48,170
if a company borrows a lot of money,
it's called, it's be called leveraged,

868
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:51,560
uh,

869
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:56,090
and it's leverage is measured
by the debt equity ratio.

870
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:58,940
Now d here,
r stands for debt.

871
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,880
A minute ago I was using Dev
Div to stay on for dividends.

872
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,330
They've all started with the letter d.
Okay.

873
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:11,270
About very different concepts.

874
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:17,110
The debt of a company is the amount of
money it goes either to banks or to bond

875
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:21,290
holders or to note holders
or commercial paper holders.

876
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:25,070
These are our fixed incomes.
In other words,

877
00:58:25,071 --> 00:58:29,630
they are not shares in the company.
When a company becomes leveraged,

878
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,640
uh, it, uh,

879
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:36,770
it then becomes riskier.

880
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:40,520
The company becomes riskier because,
uh,

881
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:45,410
the earnings they have available,
uh,

882
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:50,830
after paying interest on the debt or
repayment of principal of the debt is what

883
00:58:53,691 --> 00:58:57,530
they have available for dividends.

884
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:03,400
And if that becomes high
relative to their revenue stream,

885
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,980
then they, the company is,
is in a riskier situation.

886
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,980
Uh, so there's another
Meridiani Miller theorem

887
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:14,260
about debt,

888
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:20,580
uh,

889
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,370
which is about

890
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:27,280
debt irrelevance as well. That's,

891
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:32,660
uh, that sounds funny, but
uh, in a sense that is,

892
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:37,530
we have to define the sense
in which it's irrelevant. Uh,

893
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:41,750
it certainly isn't irrelevant
to the price of a share.

894
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:45,720
The more money I company borrows a,

895
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:50,330
the more risky the share
becomes. Uh, and so,

896
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:54,900
uh, it's just like a few,
if you buy a house, uh,

897
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:59,510
and you buy,
a lot of people are very leveraged now.

898
00:59:59,511 --> 01:00:02,660
They might put a only 10% down on a house.

899
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:07,430
So you buy a house for $300,000,
and you put $30,000 down.

900
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:11,690
Okay.
That's a sort of investment of $30,000.

901
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:17,110
But it's highly risky because you are
very leveraged when you only put 10% down,

902
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:22,960
uh, because, because the home price falls
by only 10% that could eat. In fact,

903
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:24,230
that's what's been happening lately.

904
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:28,970
You're a $30,000 down payment
is completely wiped out, right?

905
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,270
Cause you were leveraged.
You bought the house for 300,000.

906
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:37,190
You sell it for 270,000. Uh,
that's exactly what you owe.

907
01:00:37,191 --> 01:00:42,170
So you have nothing left,
right? So leverage brings risk.

908
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:48,070
So boards of directors have long
agonize over how much to borrow.

909
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,600
Uh, and uh, different companies
seem to have different cultures.

910
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:58,730
So for example,
Microsoft has

911
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:05,060
avoided borrowing any
money. Uh, and they, uh,

912
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:09,110
they uh,
don't believe in debt has,

913
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,410
so they are not leveraged.
Uh,

914
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:17,530
but other companies get heavily indebted
and then they can go through big

915
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:20,990
problems. Uh, so, uh, it's a,

916
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,730
it's a very common item of discussion
at board meetings about how much should

917
01:01:25,731 --> 01:01:27,890
our company bow.
All right?

918
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:32,620
And so they seek advice
from financial experts, uh,

919
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,980
so they call it muddy Yani
and Miller and ask, uh,

920
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:41,870
how much should we borrow? What
do finance theorists say? Uh,

921
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:46,640
and in the extreme case
where we disregard taxes and,

922
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:50,570
uh,
we have to disregard some other problems,

923
01:01:50,690 --> 01:01:55,070
we get the same answer. A Modigliani and
Miller says, we don't care what you do,

924
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:59,860
do whatever you want, it
doesn't matter. Uh, and so, uh,

925
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:00,781
this,

926
01:02:00,781 --> 01:02:05,781
this is what I want you to think about
on the problems and maybe thinking about

927
01:02:06,081 --> 01:02:10,610
the answer to the questions on the
problem set. Number four will, uh,

928
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:14,530
help you to think this through.
But the simplest way to see woody,

929
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:18,380
Yani Miller debt irrelevance
is the following.

930
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:23,940
What is a company?
If you wanted to buy a company,

931
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:27,690
you could buy only the stock,

932
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:31,800
the shares or equity incident.
Did I ever equity equal shares?

933
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,410
All right, uh, our stock.

934
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,840
So, uh, when I talk
about debt equity ratio,

935
01:02:42,841 --> 01:02:46,830
I'm talking about the ratio of the value
of the company's debt to the value of

936
01:02:46,831 --> 01:02:48,330
all of its stock.
Okay?

937
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:51,600
Um, so, um,

938
01:02:55,740 --> 01:02:59,640
if you wanted to buy a company up
and own it yourself completely,

939
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,240
you could conceive of buy all
the shares in the company, right?

940
01:03:03,241 --> 01:03:06,930
There's a 10 million shares outstanding.
I'm going to buy 10 million shares.

941
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:07,861
But in a sense,

942
01:03:07,861 --> 01:03:11,640
I don't really own the whole company
yet because the company owes money.

943
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:15,750
So what if I wanted to buy the whole
kitten caboodle, the whole operation?

944
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:20,460
I should be buying all the equity
and all the debt as well. Right?

945
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:24,900
So if the company issued by, if I really
want to own it and I have no, you know,

946
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:29,630
I really wanted to be the tycoon who this
is my baby and nobody else can get in

947
01:03:29,631 --> 01:03:33,000
my backyard. Uh, I can do whatever I want.

948
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:37,530
You'd have to buy all the equity
and all the debt. Right? And, uh,

949
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:39,810
otherwise if you don't buy all the debt,

950
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:43,560
you still have problem because those
debtors can go after you because they are,

951
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:48,390
they're not shareholders, but they have
rights. And they could come in and say,

952
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:49,500
we don't like what you're doing.

953
01:03:49,501 --> 01:03:53,400
We're going to sue you because we think
that you are doing something contrary to

954
01:03:53,401 --> 01:03:56,850
our interest as debtors. So if you're
really worried about the company,

955
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:00,150
you buy up all its equity,
all of its shares and all of its debt.

956
01:04:01,110 --> 01:04:04,650
So the basic insight about, uh, uh,

957
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:09,180
what are the Yani and Miller
debt irrelevance is that, uh,

958
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:13,740
in the absence of taxes or
any other special thing there,

959
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:18,840
the real value of the company is going
to be unaffected by whether they financed

960
01:04:21,151 --> 01:04:22,560
by debt or buy equity.

961
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:27,660
Because the real value of a company is
determined by the cash flow that they

962
01:04:27,661 --> 01:04:31,400
generate by the business they're doing.
And so they,

963
01:04:31,401 --> 01:04:34,950
they are selling widgets or
whatever and making money.

964
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:38,730
The value of the company is the
present value of that cashflow.

965
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:43,380
And if you want to buy the company,
you have to buy up all the debt.

966
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:45,060
And all of the equity.
All right.

967
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:48,390
So from the standpoint of a
buyer of the whole company,

968
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:53,610
what do I care how the ownership of the
company is divided up between debt and

969
01:04:53,611 --> 01:04:58,200
equity? I have to buy
them all anyway. So, uh,

970
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:02,640
I don't care whether three quarters of
my money goes to deck with debt or one

971
01:05:02,641 --> 01:05:06,120
quarter of the money goes to debt.
I just want to know the bottom line.

972
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,670
How much do I have to pay
for the whole company?

973
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:12,090
So the debt irrelevance theory says,

974
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:13,480
yeah,
uh,

975
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:19,420
it matters for the price
of a share what a company,

976
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:23,620
uh, issues, uh, how much
it debt it takes on.

977
01:05:23,621 --> 01:05:28,600
But it doesn't matter for the
value of the company. Uh, and so,

978
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:33,520
uh, there's almost an
arithmetic relationship theory
that they put forth and that

979
01:05:33,521 --> 01:05:36,520
kind of go see their numbers, but, um,

980
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:41,110
but the value of the company as a
whole is really determined by something

981
01:05:41,111 --> 01:05:43,930
outside of finance. So, um,

982
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,010
uh,
there again,

983
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:53,011
we have to qualify the debt irrelevant
for tech irrelevance for characters.

984
01:05:53,770 --> 01:05:58,420
Um, and uh, and so,

985
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:03,140
uh, companies, um, uh, might, uh,

986
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:08,840
um, they might be concerned with, uh,

987
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:14,340
the fact that debt is tax deductible for
corporations on their corporate profits

988
01:06:18,161 --> 01:06:22,540
tax. Uh, uh, but, uh,

989
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:26,020
dividends are not. So, uh,

990
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:28,240
according to [inaudible] and Miller,

991
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:32,860
if you add taxes to their
debt irrelevance proposition,

992
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:38,280
it means that companies will want to
bow a lot and that the real advice they

993
01:06:39,521 --> 01:06:43,090
would be giving to Bill Gates is,
uh, what's the matter with you?

994
01:06:43,630 --> 01:06:48,430
Why aren't you borrowing money?
It's tax deductible. Uh, whereas,

995
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:51,640
uh, uh, dividends are not.

996
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:56,920
And so that would mean that companies
should try to push their debt equity ratio

997
01:06:56,921 --> 01:07:00,130
up as high as possible,
um,

998
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:05,620
given that, um, uh, that
theory on the other hand,

999
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:09,670
um, if they do so, they
may be cording bankruptcy.

1000
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:11,980
If a company gets to leveraged,

1001
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:16,390
then there's too high a probability
that the company will fail.

1002
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:20,140
And, uh, and there's costs to bankruptcy.

1003
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:24,250
So the other qualification
is bankruptcy costs.

1004
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,790
So a company,
uh,

1005
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:33,120
according to Modigliani and Miller has
to weigh their tax considerations against

1006
01:07:33,611 --> 01:07:38,030
their bankruptcy costs and get an optimal,
uh,

1007
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,420
debt equity ratio out of that. So it, uh,

1008
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:45,610
it is some insights that Meridiani and
Miller are offering the corporations that

1009
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:50,640
I think they often don't see that the
real issue in the dividend and the

1010
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:56,140
dividend and the debt policies are
really taxes, uh, and nothing else.

1011
01:07:57,270 --> 01:08:02,010
Uh, the last thing I just wanted to
say, uh, Amanda mentioned the, um,

1012
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:06,210
uh, the, uh, theory of, uh,

1013
01:08:07,780 --> 01:08:08,613
of a

1014
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:14,540
dividend payout given by John Lintner,
uh,

1015
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,910
and it's called the
Lindner model of dividends.

1016
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:23,110
So I'm saying that,
uh,

1017
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:26,360
unless tax considerations intervene,

1018
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:31,160
dividend policy is really
irrelevant for a firm.

1019
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:35,840
Uh, so what, and so, um,
maybe Merton Miller is right,

1020
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:40,790
these things are neutral mutations
and changes in dividend policy are

1021
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:45,060
meaningless, but how do they
actually do it? Uh, how do,

1022
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:49,220
how do boards and their committees
decide how much to pay out in dividends?

1023
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:53,570
So John Linton, her was a professor
at the Harvard Business School,

1024
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:58,900
who decades ago did a survey of people
who decide on dividends and asked them

1025
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:04,610
what goes on in your mind and what
do you think about when you decide on

1026
01:09:04,611 --> 01:09:06,020
dividends?
Uh,

1027
01:09:06,021 --> 01:09:10,070
and he had a long discussion of they
said millions of different things.

1028
01:09:10,071 --> 01:09:13,880
It's very hard. People who
decide on dividends, uh,

1029
01:09:13,881 --> 01:09:16,070
are facing a complicated issue.

1030
01:09:16,430 --> 01:09:21,430
But one thing that Merton Miller distilled
from him was that people on boards

1031
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:26,360
who decide on dividend payout are
very focused on the price of a share.

1032
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:30,230
And they're worried about
investor reaction. Uh,

1033
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:35,000
boards always want to keep their price
of a share up because if it starts to

1034
01:09:35,001 --> 01:09:39,320
decline, the company could become a
takeover target. It's viewed as a failure,

1035
01:09:39,321 --> 01:09:40,400
et Cetera,
et cetera.

1036
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:44,990
So they talked a lot to him
about investor psychology.

1037
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:49,010
And so in a sense that I'm
terminating this lecture with a,

1038
01:09:49,070 --> 01:09:52,130
another triumph for behavioral economics.

1039
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:57,370
When we think about the theory of dividend
or that we ended up with irrelevance,

1040
01:09:57,471 --> 01:09:58,460
it doesn't mean anything.

1041
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:03,500
But the companies boards talk about it
incessantly and it seems to matter a lot

1042
01:10:03,501 --> 01:10:08,060
to them. And if you ask them
why it matters, they say,
well, it's pretty obvious.

1043
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:11,060
It's all their investors psychology
that we have to deal with.

1044
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:15,500
And they say things like this.
If we said if we pay a dividend,

1045
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:19,360
then they're going to start expecting
that. And if we don't pay a dividend once,

1046
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:20,870
then they're going to say,
what's wrong?

1047
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,920
As long as we never
start paying a dividend,

1048
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:26,710
then we're just a young company
and nobody asked any question. Uh,

1049
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:30,920
then we start paying a dividend and
then, uh, if we ever have to cut it,

1050
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:34,130
we're in big trouble in the newspaper.
Reporters will start calling,

1051
01:10:34,131 --> 01:10:36,440
why did you cut the dividend?
And he said,

1052
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:39,080
you didn't call us up when we
weren't paying any dividends.

1053
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:42,470
And now we're still paying more than
we used to. Why, why all this alarm?

1054
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:44,660
And so they said one of the lessons,

1055
01:10:44,661 --> 01:10:48,770
they were told to never cut a dividend
unless you do it as you could do a

1056
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:50,570
onetime only dividend's safe.

1057
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,180
We're just doing this once
and don't expect it again.

1058
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:55,400
But if you start paying regular dividends,

1059
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:58,640
then you'd better keep doing them where
people are going to conclude something

1060
01:10:58,641 --> 01:11:02,990
is really wrong.
So they told him that if earnings go up,

1061
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:06,590
we try to keep a target payout ratio,

1062
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,420
but if earning suddenly shoot out,

1063
01:11:08,421 --> 01:11:11,870
we're not going to increase our dividends
right away because that would set too

1064
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:15,840
high an expectation. We don't want to have
to cut it. So if earnings go up a lot,

1065
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:19,050
we will raise our dividends
but only part of the way up.

1066
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,300
And so the um, the model
that I'm, well, I better

1067
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,400
get it right. The letting her
model, uh, says that, um, uh,

1068
01:11:32,550 --> 01:11:34,410
there's a target payout ratio

1069
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,230
that's the Greek planner tau and
that's the target payout ratio.

1070
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:45,360
That ratio may have been
higher in the 19th century.

1071
01:11:45,361 --> 01:11:48,210
It's gradually trending down,
but it's a slowly moving thing.

1072
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:52,980
So they want to pay out something like
40% of their earnings as dividends and

1073
01:11:52,981 --> 01:11:55,920
plow the rest back into
investing inside the company.

1074
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:01,140
And then there's another parameter raw,
which is the adjustment.

1075
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:05,740
Uh, so, uh,

1076
01:12:05,741 --> 01:12:10,680
and roe was between zero and one.
It's how far,

1077
01:12:10,681 --> 01:12:14,730
how fast they adjust to the target.
And so the Lenten,

1078
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:18,210
her model then says the
change in dividends,

1079
01:12:18,390 --> 01:12:23,390
dividend at time t minus dividend at
time t minus one a is equal to roe times

1080
01:12:29,370 --> 01:12:30,203
earnings

1081
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:36,780
at time t minus dividend t minus one.

1082
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:39,413
Okay.

1083
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:44,340
So that means that if your
row is some positive number,

1084
01:12:44,341 --> 01:12:48,900
like a half, uh, and so if
earnings is above dividends,

1085
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:54,440
you increase your dividends but only buy
half as much as we'd bring it up to the

1086
01:12:56,191 --> 01:13:00,930
target if roe is a half. Uh,
and so that means there's,

1087
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:06,080
and then there's a gradual adjustment
of earnings of dividends to earning.

1088
01:13:06,831 --> 01:13:11,380
So for example, I don't have
any more space to write if, uh,

1089
01:13:12,190 --> 01:13:15,720
if, uh, this is time and this is earnings.

1090
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:19,740
If your earnings were say flat
and suddenly increased like that,

1091
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,740
they wouldn't believe
this increase at first.

1092
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:26,340
So the board would decide to adjust,
only say halfway up.

1093
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:31,860
Now I'm flooding dividends. The dividends
were down here at half the earnings,

1094
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:36,630
and then you would gradually adjust
them up to half earnings. Again,

1095
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:42,110
that's because they don't want to ever
be caught cutting their dividends. Uh,

1096
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,760
and also if the earnings drop,

1097
01:13:44,820 --> 01:13:48,180
they don't want to suddenly do a
crash cutting their dividends either.

1098
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:53,280
So they're always sluggishly adjusting
towards the target payout rate, uh,

1099
01:13:53,281 --> 01:13:56,580
and, uh, letting her show
that this simple model, the d,

1100
01:13:56,820 --> 01:13:59,900
The Lintner model explains,
uh,

1101
01:14:00,900 --> 01:14:05,040
the behavior of companies
pretty well. Okay. So, uh,

1102
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,760
next session is Friday and
with Stephen Schwarzman,

1103
01:14:11,810 --> 01:14:13,410
uh,
and I'll see you then.
