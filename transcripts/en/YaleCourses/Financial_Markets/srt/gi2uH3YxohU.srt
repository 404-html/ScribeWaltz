1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:05,490
I want to start out by talking
about real estate as an asset class.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,630
It's actually the biggest and
most important asset class. Uh,

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,770
the value of real estate in the United
States today is a of real estate owned by

4
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:20,730
households directly is about $20 trillion,

5
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,240
which makes it a comparable,
uh,

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,890
or maybe a little bit bigger than
that. Then the stock market. Uh,

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,870
and so, uh, stocks owned
directly by households are only,

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,060
uh, about 6 trillion. So
for a typical household,

9
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,010
the home is the, is the major source
of wealth that they've accumulated.

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,290
Uh,
Chris,

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,540
other stocks are held by institutions
on their behalf, but, uh,

12
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,930
in terms of direct ownership, homes
are, are the main thing that people own.

13
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,733
MMM.

14
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,790
So, uh, there's also
commercial real estate,

15
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:03,510
which is smaller than
owner occupied homes, uh,

16
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,250
but we own that indirectly to,

17
00:01:05,251 --> 00:01:09,270
as the people through the stocks that
we own and through the institutions we

18
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:13,710
participate in. Uh, so
it's very important,

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:18,150
uh, and it has some
important, uh, financial.

20
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,733
Uh,

21
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,270
there's a lot of financial institutions
built around dealing with the

22
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:26,070
fundamental problems of real estate.

23
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,790
So I wanted to talk first
about institutions, uh,

24
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,720
and then move to what I think
is myself more interesting,

25
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,870
which is the real estate boom. Uh, and,

26
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,580
and the kind of s fluctuations we've
seen in real estate over the years.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,470
So I'm going to start out by talking
about commercial real estate and the kind

28
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:50,010
of vehicles that, uh, um, uh,

29
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,320
we used to invest in
commercial real estate. Uh,

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,990
and then I want to talk about mortgages,

31
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,040
which is the way that we
finance both commercial and, uh,

32
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:04,560
owner occupied real estate. And then
finally, I want to come to the, uh,

33
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,470
real estate boom that we are recently in.
Uh,

34
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:10,723
so,

35
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,013
uh,

36
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,490
so let me start by,

37
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,770
uh,
uh,

38
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,570
the way that the kind of institution
that you probably know relatively little

39
00:02:27,571 --> 00:02:28,404
about

40
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,950
for commercial real estate,
commercial real estate,

41
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:35,320
that means real estate owned

42
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,260
not by individual households,
but by businesses. Okay. Uh,

43
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,200
and, uh, the, the, uh,

44
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,520
institution I wanted to talk to
you about, first one, it's called

45
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,530
a DPP,

46
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,120
a direct participation

47
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,973
program,

48
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,990
which has been traditionally,
uh,

49
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,260
the single most important form of
holding of commercial real estate.

50
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,550
So when you drive along and you
see all these commercial buildings,

51
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,350
you might wonder who owns
them. Well, sometimes they're
owned by corporations, but,

52
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,820
uh, I think the more important
institution is the DPP,

53
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:28,700
uh, which is, um, uh, uh,

54
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,903
a,
uh,

55
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,870
a financial vehicle that owns commercial
real estate on behalf of investors.

56
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,240
Uh, and so, uh, the,
uh, most important DPP,

57
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,460
uh,
it's called a limited partnership

58
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,600
or LP.
Uh,

59
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,950
there's a very simple reason why real
estate tends to be held in limited

60
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:01,860
partnerships rather than corporations.

61
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:07,020
And that reason is the corporate profits
tax corporations are taxed on their

62
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:10,080
profits, uh, and, uh,

63
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:15,450
DPPS are not. Uh, and so you want,

64
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:19,590
if you are setting up an
organization to hold real estate,

65
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:24,460
you want to do it if
you can, as a DPP, uh,

66
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,040
because you don't want to
pay those taxes. And so, uh,

67
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:33,050
whenever possible, uh, uh, a, um,

68
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,530
uh, ownership, uh,

69
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,900
vehicle for commercial real estate
will have the form of a DPP.

70
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,880
Um,
and a limited partner is a ship,

71
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:48,450
is one kind of DPP, uh, and it has,

72
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,540
it's not a corporation.
So it's a partnership. Uh,

73
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,240
at the simplest kind of partnership would
be if several of you got together and

74
00:04:57,241 --> 00:05:01,800
formed the business. Uh, and in a
normal and a simple partnership,

75
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,690
the partnership would not be taxed
because it's you doing business just as

76
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:10,590
partners. Uh, and so you are
taxed but not the partnership.

77
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,600
But the problem with partnerships
generally has been that they don't have

78
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:16,620
limited liability.

79
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:22,020
A corporation is an entity
that could be sued, uh,

80
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,810
for uh,
or could lose more money than it's worth.

81
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,420
But the value of a corporation can
never fall below zero because to the

82
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:30,961
investors,

83
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:34,380
because the investors are not liable
for the mistakes of the corporation.

84
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,270
If you buy stock in a company, the most
you can lose is the money you put up.

85
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,920
So that's called limited liability.
But if you take part in a partnership,

86
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,900
uh, you are individually liable
for the debts of the corporation.

87
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,470
And that's a problem with the partnership
structure because you could join a

88
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:57,090
partnership, uh, and uh, the partnership
does something awful and loses,

89
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:01,370
uh, more than you put into it and they
can come after you for those losses.

90
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,901
There is something,

91
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:07,901
however called a limited partnership
that has a two kinds of partners,

92
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,440
the general partner

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,800
and the limited partner or and
usually many limited partners. Uh,

94
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:19,740
and so the general partner
takes on the liability. Uh,

95
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:23,300
the limited partners,
uh, don't have liability.

96
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,790
So typically real estate is held in a
limited partnership. It's limited because,

97
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,990
uh, well they want to put it in a
limited partnership because they don't,

98
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,850
it's not easy to sell other people on
joining the partnership if they could get

99
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:39,860
unlimited liability for doing so.

100
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,480
So there is a general partner who
takes on the liability and the, uh,

101
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,110
the limited partners who are many are,
uh,

102
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,420
are the participants who
do not share the liability.

103
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,610
So the general partner is typically the
organizer of the, of the partnership.

104
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,260
Someone who buys a 50 story
building downtown and then,

105
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,770
uh,
well ranges Tobiah and gets partners,

106
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,970
limited partners to join in financing it.
And so that's the arrangement.

107
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:15,920
You have a general partner and
limited partners, uh, and um,

108
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,590
you don't hear about,
uh,

109
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:23,710
dpps I'm telling you something that
you probably haven't heard a lot about.

110
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,940
Uh, this is not commonly
advertised or described,

111
00:07:28,941 --> 00:07:33,920
just like hedge funds are not commonly
advertised in describe because it is

112
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:38,921
thought that dpps are suitable only for
wealthy and sophisticated investors.

113
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,260
They're complicated.
Uh,

114
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,480
so the general rule has been that,
um,

115
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,200
only accredited investors, uh,
should participate in them.

116
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,900
And so, uh, accredited,

117
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,460
I mentioned this before in the u
s and in other countries as well,

118
00:08:01,461 --> 00:08:06,461
there are estimate similar thing we define
an accredited investor is someone who

119
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:13,190
can participate in a DPP or
other sophisticated programs.

120
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,080
And that definition

121
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:21,250
is in regulation d,
which defines a,

122
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,670
an accredited investor. Uh,
and, uh, for many years now,

123
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,790
uh,
to be qualified as an accredited investor,

124
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:34,150
you have to have $1 million in wealth
or income in excess of $200,000.

125
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,020
Or if you're married $300,000
for the couple, uh, in, uh,

126
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,420
2000 and I mentioned this before in 2006,

127
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:49,421
the sec proposed raising the definition
to make it harder to be an accredited

128
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:54,260
investor, but they haven't
done that yet. Uh, so,

129
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,280
uh, it remains that $1 million
to do it. But nonetheless,

130
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:04,140
a DPP is don't advertise. So you see
mutual fund advertisements everywhere.

131
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,850
You don't see advertisements
for participation in
commercial real estate like

132
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:12,990
this because, uh, the government would
be on their backs if they did it.

133
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,780
Since it's available only
to accredited investors,

134
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,840
you can't be advertising because
everyone would see it. Uh, so, um,

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,600
that, uh, that's why, uh,

136
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:27,960
the financing of a lot of this real
estate is something of a mystery could

137
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,820
because they can't talk
openly about it. Uh, sorry.

138
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,530
Uh, these DPP is go back a long time. Uh,

139
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,720
but there began to be complaints about
though because people said, well,

140
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,110
why is it that because I'm
not an accredited investor,

141
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,520
I can't get into real estate like these
other people do. Why is it, you know,

142
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,730
why isn't there something
offered to me that's like a,

143
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:57,870
a DPP that's available to everyone?
Or another way of putting it,

144
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,820
the government is effectively saying
that unaccredited investors are free to

145
00:10:02,821 --> 00:10:07,200
invest in corporations that invest in
real estate and they're subject to the

146
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:09,360
corporate profits tax.
All right?

147
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,470
Wealthy people have the choice of
getting around the corporate profits tax.

148
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,320
So in a sense the tax
structure was regressive.

149
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,790
It was saying we're going to have lower
taxes on rich people then on ordinary

150
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:25,560
people. And that didn't seem fair at
all. So there was a complaint, uh,

151
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,520
aired about how about DPPS,
uh,

152
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,140
in the late 1950s, uh, and people said,

153
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,521
let's change it.

154
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:40,020
Let's make it so that everybody
can have something like a DPP.

155
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,010
So Congress finally acted,
um,

156
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,810
and uh,

157
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,500
it was in the year 1960 that Congress
defined a new investment vehicle called a

158
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:56,304
real estate

159
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,860
investment trust.

160
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,040
And this is for everyone.
Uh,

161
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,900
real estate investment trust
is for smaller investors,

162
00:11:10,901 --> 00:11:15,310
although wealthy big investors
can invest in it also. Uh,

163
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,140
and so, um, the, um,

164
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,020
they had to make a distinction.
So these are called routes. Um,

165
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,980
r E.

166
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:32,240
I t a real estate investment trust
congress had to make a distinction between

167
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,540
these and corporations.

168
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,290
And it's kind of a subtle distinction
because there's a lot of corporations that

169
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:42,700
own real estate. Like for example,
Walmart. All right, Walmart,

170
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,880
why they pay corporate profits tax?
So after ninth,

171
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,930
I don't know if Walmart was it
around in 1960, I don't know. Uh,

172
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,010
let's say it was all Walmart
after the 1960 [inaudible],

173
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,010
uh, act of Congress, it would say, hey,
we're a real estate investment trusts.

174
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,890
We are real estate. All
these, how these stores,

175
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,260
but that's not what the
intent of this bill was.

176
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:09,120
They wanted to reach to be companies
that just own real estate. Uh,

177
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,970
and Walmart is primarily a retailer.
Uh,

178
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:16,030
okay.
So they specified

179
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,520
that 75% of assets must be real estate

180
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,290
and 75%
of income,

181
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,830
the real estate income. So that would, uh,

182
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,610
that would be ruling out Walmart.
Um,

183
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,260
uh,
and 95% of income must be paid out.

184
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,570
They can't read it.

185
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,410
Pain earnings

186
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,650
that limits

187
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,470
further. They're supposed to be
like a pass through a vehicle. They,

188
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,570
they're owning real estate on your behalf,

189
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,100
so they shouldn't be
retaining earnings. Uh, uh,

190
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:06,280
also they had to be longterm holders.
Uh,

191
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,450
it had to be less than 30%

192
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,263
of,
um,

193
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:19,330
income from sales of properties
for less than four years.

194
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,280
Less than no more than 30% of their
income from sale of properties had to be,

195
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,700
uh, from properties held less than
four years. They didn't want flippers.

196
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,220
They didn't want a company
that that's speculating.

197
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,320
They want it to be a
holder of real estate.

198
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,630
So real estate investment
trusts became very important.

199
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,040
Uh, and uh, actually in three waves,

200
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,360
the first wave of rate,
um,

201
00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:00,010
growth occurred in right after
Congress passed the 1960 bill.

202
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,260
So, uh, the, the first
wave was in the 1960s.

203
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,450
At that time,
Congress had limit or governments,

204
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:15,410
state governments had limits
on the interest that, uh,

205
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,870
savings banks could pay
people on their accounts.

206
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,790
So a lot of people switched
from savings accounts.

207
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,410
Uh, two, two, uh, reads,

208
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,660
and that's called disintermediation.

209
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:33,430
Uh, an intermediary is a bank. Uh,
and so when they pull out of banks,

210
00:14:33,431 --> 00:14:38,431
they were disinter mediating and
going from banks into reads a,

211
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:41,920
although in some sense it wasn't really
disintermediation because you could say

212
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:45,700
a rate is a different kind of intermediary
between the individual and the

213
00:14:45,701 --> 00:14:50,000
investment.
The second boom and rates

214
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,160
occurred

215
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,140
after 1986.

216
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,440
The tax reform act of 1986 made DPP
is much less valuable to investors.

217
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,750
And so a lot of wealthy people switched
from dpps to reads before 1986,

218
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:13,930
the tax law allowed use of DPPS as a tax
loss device and people would invest in

219
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:22,751
buildings solely for tax purposes because
you could write off the depreciation

220
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,620
on the building.
Uh,

221
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:29,570
and so people were cynically setting
up dpps as tax shelters only.

222
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,490
And Congress said,
finally,

223
00:15:31,491 --> 00:15:36,491
I think wisely in 1986 that we don't want
to create rules that encourage people

224
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:41,420
to do a different sort of business
just to evade taxes. So they, they,

225
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,510
they made, uh, uh, they,

226
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:47,360
they said that losses
depreciation that in 1986,

227
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:52,361
the tax reform act of 1986 said that
depreciation on structures in dpps can,

228
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,570
uh,

229
00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:00,140
is called a passive loss and can be
used to offset only passive income,

230
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:03,950
which comes from, uh, uh,
something like another DPP.

231
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,710
And so it eliminated the tax advantage.

232
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,730
So if they didn't have a
particular tax advantage to DPPS,

233
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,970
they went into, um, into rates.

234
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:19,550
And then the third greet
boom, uh, was in the 1990s.

235
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,470
Uh, and I think that this third rate boom
is different from the others because it

236
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:28,910
didn't, uh, arise from any
government regulation change.

237
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:33,830
It arose from, uh, the beginnings
of the, of the housing bubble,

238
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,050
the real estate bubble that we're now in.

239
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,760
So they're just became a lot of enthusiasm
for rates. It's not just a bubble.

240
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:44,370
It's also that rates began
to be more diversified. They,

241
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:48,410
they had many different kinds of rates
for different kinds of real estate.

242
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:53,150
It became a more interesting
and diverse, uh, uh,

243
00:16:53,151 --> 00:16:54,110
asset class.

244
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,000
Uh,
so,

245
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,170
so that's what I wanted to say
about commercial real estate.

246
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:03,800
So the two principal ways that commercial,
whether it's three ways,

247
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:08,000
one is commercial real estate is held
by corporations in the line of business,

248
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,240
but after that it would be dpps and reads.

249
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,780
And we have democratized.

250
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:19,670
Now rates are a rapidly growing
force in, uh, in investing.

251
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:23,290
And now, uh, we have substantially
democratized real estate holdings.

252
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:28,040
So it's not exclusively
DPPS, uh, that are holding,

253
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,230
are not primarily,
we have a lot of rates now.

254
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,133
Okay.

255
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,520
So then the next topic I wanted
to talk about, mortgages.

256
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,160
Mortgages are,
uh,

257
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:45,860
debts secured by property as collateral.

258
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,860
Uh,
so that when you mortgage property,

259
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:55,310
that means that you offer the
property as collateral for a loan.

260
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,110
And that means that if you
fail to pay on the loan,

261
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:06,870
the property is taken
by the lender, uh, to,

262
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,330
uh,
satisfy your debts.

263
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,070
It makes it possible for people to
borrow who otherwise couldn't borrow. Uh,

264
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,190
if you,
if you put a property up as collateral,

265
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,350
then the lender knows that they can
get the money back from you. So the,

266
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,543
uh,

267
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,900
the critical thing is
the loan to value ratio

268
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,380
lenders or Ltv,

269
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:41,570
a mortgage lender doesn't want to lend
more than the property is worth because

270
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,240
that would be a loan to
value ratio of over one. Uh,

271
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:50,880
because then if you fail to pay
on the mortgage, pay off the debt,

272
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,210
the lender can seize the
property and sell it.

273
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,140
But if the loan devalue ratio is,
is greater than one,

274
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:02,130
they won't be able to get all the
money back. Right. Um, moreover,

275
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,830
whenever they seize the
property and try to sell it,

276
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,060
it usually loses value anyway
in the process. So for example,

277
00:19:09,061 --> 00:19:13,260
if there's a homeowner who have you
lent money to and have homeowner is

278
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,650
defaulting on the mortgage, the
homeowner might wreck the house, uh,

279
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,840
that happens all the time. Or they
might steal things from it. Who knows?

280
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:24,030
They're angry and they're
living in this house,

281
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,060
and then they can stall you for a year.
You're trying to sell the,

282
00:19:27,061 --> 00:19:29,970
how they hire lawyers and sue you,
and you've got to hire lawyers.

283
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,990
So there's a lot of costs.
So you want to have a loan devalue ratio,

284
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:38,730
which is sufficiently low
that you the collateral,

285
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:41,970
we'll cover the value of the loan.
Okay.

286
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,010
Now the history of
mortgages, uh, is that, uh,

287
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,940
they have generally over time,

288
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:56,270
gotten more easy on
loan to value ratio and,

289
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,250
uh,
also on maturity.

290
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:04,470
The maturity of a mortgage is
the date when it's paid off.

291
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,840
Okay? So if we go back to the 1920s, okay,

292
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,700
uh,
and I compare that with now 1920s,

293
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:20,930
the typical mortgage had in
loan to value ratio of 60%.

294
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,080
Uh,
and a maturity

295
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:33,590
of five years, often
even less than that. Uh,

296
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,890
and so, um, they also had,
they were back then in the 20s,

297
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:39,750
they were called balloon payment.

298
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:45,440
What that means is,
uh,

299
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,910
you would borrow $5,000 to buy a house,
uh,

300
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,680
and in five years and
every year along the way,

301
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:53,410
you'd be paying interest on your mortgage.

302
00:20:53,411 --> 00:20:57,760
And then in five years you had
to come up with $5,000. Okay.

303
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:02,290
So it was interest, interest, interest
until the end. And then it was the 5,000.

304
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:02,891
Of course,

305
00:21:02,891 --> 00:21:07,120
five years is too short because most
people live in a house for more than five

306
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:10,780
years. But the assumption was,
well, when five years comes up,

307
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,330
you refinance the mortgage,
you get a new one.

308
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,590
The banks weren't willing to lend more
than five years because they didn't trust

309
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:20,620
you. They thought things
would change and whatever. Um,

310
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,760
after 1929 real estate prices fell
dramatically and people became unemployed,

311
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:34,471
the unemployment rate in the
United States rose to 25%.

312
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:38,280
Lots of people could not refi,

313
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,910
refinance their mortgages
because they were unemployed.

314
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:46,540
And you go to a bank and say,
I want a bow to refinance my mortgage,

315
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:52,030
which is due now they're asking me
to pay $5,000. I don't have $5,000.

316
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,640
But the bank would say,
hey, you're unemployed.

317
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,070
We can't give you a mortgage anyway.

318
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,670
Your loan to value ratio is getting pretty
precarious because your house is now

319
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:04,050
down 30% in value.
You're a loan devalue ratio.

320
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:08,470
If we are to give you a $5,000 would be
something like 90% and they would say,

321
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,820
no way are we going to do that.

322
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:13,420
Our rule says we can't lend
on a LTV of higher than 60%.

323
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,400
So people would be turned down for the
refinancing of their mortgage and what

324
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:21,370
happened? They would lose the house. Uh,

325
00:22:21,371 --> 00:22:25,060
and so that happened in
huge numbers in the 1930s.

326
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,730
The 1930s was the, uh,
the biggest housing crisis

327
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,400
in US history.

328
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,140
So,
uh,

329
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,710
you see what the problem was?
The mortgages were too short, uh,

330
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,030
the loan to value ratio, well,
it's not so much the loan.

331
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,530
It was the maturity was short a and the
balloon payment at the end that they

332
00:22:50,531 --> 00:22:55,510
change. So, uh, in 1933

333
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,003
MMM.

334
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,810
Under the Roosevelt Administration,
uh,

335
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,850
Congress created something called
the home owners I mentioning this it,

336
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:11,990
it's actually relevant to right now,
homeowners loan corporation.

337
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,133
Okay.

338
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,460
R H, O, l, z.

339
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:27,060
That was financed by the u s congress
and it started offering indirectly,

340
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:31,060
but I started offering mortgages to all
these people who couldn't refinance.

341
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,360
Okay. It did it through
banks. They, they, they,

342
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,480
they gave the money to banks to make
loans to people who were in trouble. Uh,

343
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,410
and they, they created a very important
change. They said five years is too short.

344
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,130
It's gotta be longer.
They said 15 years. Okay.

345
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:53,810
And get rid of this balloon payment
thing at the end. That was a dumb idea.

346
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,450
People can't pay that if
they're in any trouble.

347
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,650
They can't come up with the whole
value of the, of the loan all at once.

348
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,060
And so they made it,

349
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,410
they demanded that the
mortgage is be self amortizing.

350
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,140
This is what came in in 33.

351
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,380
It was a very important
change in mortgage finance.

352
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:17,590
Self Amortizing means that you're not
just paying the interest every year or

353
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:18,860
every month,

354
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:23,450
you're paying interest plus principle
so that when the mortgage ends,

355
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,150
you're just clear and free.
You don't have to pay anything.

356
00:24:26,151 --> 00:24:29,030
Nothing comes at the end. And, and so the,

357
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,750
the HLLC said that's a lot more sensible.

358
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,080
And so they demanded that that'd be done.
And of course,

359
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:38,180
banks would be reluctant
to do it by themselves,

360
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:41,450
but when the government is coming with
a checkbook to write the money so that

361
00:24:41,451 --> 00:24:45,620
they can make the Lavar grudge
and guarantees it, the hosc said,

362
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:50,150
don't worry if they don't
pay, we'll look. We'll, okay.

363
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,600
So, uh, the banks said,
of course we'll do that.

364
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,860
And that created a major
change in mortgage lending.

365
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,250
It's especially relevant because,
I don't know if you saw,

366
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:04,640
maybe you did in the New York
Times yesterday. Alan blinder,

367
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,900
who is a former vice chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board under Greenspan,

368
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:13,220
is now a professor at Princeton,
had an article saying,

369
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:18,290
we need to bring back the
HLLC now. Uh, and in fact,

370
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:23,560
our own Senator Christopher Dodd has a
bill in Congress right now to bring back

371
00:25:24,201 --> 00:25:28,940
the hosc basically. Uh, he wants
it. He has a new name for it. Uh,

372
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,690
uh, I think it's called Home
Equity Protection Corporation.

373
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,310
The almost the same idea.

374
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:39,490
So ideas that were common that were new
in the 1930s are being brought back,

375
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,310
but we don't have to make the change.
We're well in a sense.

376
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:48,280
The other thing that happened is in 1934,
uh,

377
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,680
Congress set up the federal
housing administration,

378
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,990
Fha and the Fha is specifically aimed at,

379
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:00,980
at guaranteeing loans,
mortgages for low income people.

380
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:06,290
And it was a vision that Roosevelt had
to bring more and more people into owning

381
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,880
homes in this country.

382
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:12,950
The FHA went further
than the HLC and they,

383
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,250
they demanded that mortgages be 20 years

384
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:21,890
also self amortizing. Okay. So this was,

385
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,130
maybe it's more of a paternalistic
role of government that came in.

386
00:26:25,131 --> 00:26:29,210
Then the government said that the private
sector with these kinds of mortgages

387
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,860
is not doing things right.

388
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:35,720
It's not planning for our
future in the right way. Uh,

389
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,130
and so they made the switch.

390
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:41,150
It was really the government that made
the switch from five year mortgages to

391
00:26:41,151 --> 00:26:44,220
the longterm mortgages. Now
as today, the Standard Mormon,

392
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,840
which would you would probably get when
you buy your first house is not 15 or

393
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:52,170
20. It's 30 years. Well
they just kept going up.

394
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,870
The 30 year mortgage came
in in the early 1950s,

395
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:58,860
but it seems to have gotten stuck
at 30 years. That's because, well,

396
00:26:58,861 --> 00:27:00,210
when you buy your first house,

397
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,080
you might be 25 30 years
brings you to age 55.

398
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,030
That's close enough to retirement.

399
00:27:06,031 --> 00:27:08,700
I guess most people think
30 years is long enough.

400
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:12,990
But that's the way
mortgages go ever since.

401
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:17,550
But we have to,
what we've seen recently,

402
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:22,440
we had more government intervention back
then in the mortgage industry since the

403
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,460
1990s.

404
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,110
We've seen a proliferation of
new kinds of mortgages that uh,

405
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:32,400
especially are offered to low
income people buy certain lenders.

406
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,370
Uh, so, um,

407
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,053
okay.

408
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,390
We've had a growth in popularity of arms,

409
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,880
which are adjustable rate mortgages,

410
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,860
adjustable rate mortgages have a long
term. They might last for 30 years,

411
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,830
but the interest rate is not fixed
for the whole 30 years. So, uh,

412
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,900
a typical arm is two and 28,

413
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:11,170
which means that it has a low
teaser rate for two years.

414
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,880
A teaser

415
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,580
when they call it a and then rates that
go up after two years and then tied to

416
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:26,310
some other benchmark rate of interest,
like the treasury bill rate. Uh,

417
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,280
and so, uh, the, the
problem is then that, uh,

418
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:35,970
these were sold to low income people in
many cases who didn't understand what

419
00:28:35,971 --> 00:28:40,650
they were getting and that the, after two
years, the interest rate would reset up.

420
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,210
Uh,

421
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:47,100
so we would see resets after two
years to a much higher level.

422
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:51,540
And some of these people will discover
that they can't afford them. Uh, and so

423
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:57,540
we need, uh, and there's a lot of
talk in Congress right now. Uh,

424
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,950
we need to,
uh,

425
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:05,250
think about new regulations that protect
individuals much like the regulations

426
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,090
that the h o l c, uh, and the Fha made.

427
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,110
But we have to do it again because
the mortgage institutions, uh,

428
00:29:13,111 --> 00:29:17,790
have deteriorated somewhat. There's a lot
of anger about it. I know on Thursday,

429
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:21,480
um, Angelo Mozilo who is
a head of countrywide,

430
00:29:21,481 --> 00:29:24,780
which is one of the biggest mortgage
lenders to low income people,

431
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:29,440
it made a lot of subprime loans is being
called before a house committee, uh,

432
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,780
to testify. Uh, I want to
try to watch it faster,

433
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,420
but it's going to be interesting because
there's a lot of anger about what's

434
00:29:36,421 --> 00:29:40,650
happened similar to the anger
that we saw in the 1930s,

435
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,260
uh,
Ho hos see is no longer with us.

436
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:49,040
It was actually set up as
a temporary camp, uh, uh,

437
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,560
corporation by the
government. But, uh, it's, uh,

438
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,340
the Fha is still with us and you know,

439
00:29:57,341 --> 00:29:59,590
we just had an Fha modernization act.

440
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,690
Congress is starting to propel
that forward, so it'll be
a bigger part of our, uh,

441
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:11,280
I wanted to say it a little bit
about the math of, um, of, uh,

442
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,200
mortgages. The, uh, uh,

443
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,170
typical the convention.

444
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,620
I'm going to talk about the
conventional 30 year mortgage,

445
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:25,270
which has been a standard,
uh, in the United States, uh,

446
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,590
ever since the early 1950s.
Uh,

447
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,520
it's not a standard in most countries.
Actually.

448
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,500
I think it was partly the
new deal legislation that
made it very strong in the

449
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:41,470
United States. In Canada. Uh,

450
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,010
the mortgages tend to be shorter term.

451
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,230
It's something like
what we had in the 30s,

452
00:30:47,231 --> 00:30:49,710
although they have other institutions
that protect home buyers,

453
00:30:49,711 --> 00:30:54,670
so they don't see, they
don't see the, uh, the, um,

454
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,190
the turmoil that we saw in the 1930s.
But a typical home,

455
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,280
um, uh, probably about it

456
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,270
30 year

457
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:15,370
mark. This is what most people
get today. Uh, and that's,

458
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,530
except for subprime,

459
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:21,760
subprime borrowers seem to be the ones
who are being really hit with new,

460
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:26,290
new ideas.
But if most people who are good Bowers,

461
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,480
who know what they're doing,
what these,

462
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,470
they want a conventional 30 year mortgage
because it will fix a mortgage payment

463
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,320
for the rest of the 30 years.
And you have nothing to worry about.

464
00:31:35,321 --> 00:31:38,910
If you can afford the mortgage
payment, uh, then, uh,

465
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,730
then you're, you're all set. You don't,

466
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:45,250
you just pay it every month and then
you just start paying at the end of 30

467
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:49,030
years. So, uh, if they quote
the rate on the mortgage,

468
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,710
uh, call that are, uh,

469
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,890
traditionally you would
be paid paying monthly.

470
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:03,040
So if you do it in monthly terms,
your interest rate is our over 12,

471
00:32:03,041 --> 00:32:05,260
because there's 12 months in a year.
Okay.

472
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:10,730
How did they figure out what the
mortgage payment is? Uh, well,

473
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:14,700
the, the mortgage balance, uh,

474
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:20,420
mortgage
balance

475
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,070
is equal to the mortgage payment

476
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:32,203
times.

477
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:36,920
And now we just use the annuity
formula, which is the formula that, uh,

478
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:41,000
we've learned. Uh, again, I think
we've seen it again and again,

479
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,600
one all over the interest rate because
are over 12 times one minus one over

480
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:58,720
one plus r over 12 to the 12
t power where t is the term,

481
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,320
uh,
in years of the mortgage.

482
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,900
Okay.
Uh,

483
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,980
[inaudible], uh, I should
maybe make this the same

484
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:24,950
to get my brackets right. All right.
This is just the annuity formula.

485
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:26,740
Remember, uh, what,

486
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:31,840
what this equation merely says is that
the present value of your remaining

487
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:37,420
payments is always equal to
the mortgage balance. Uh,

488
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,500
and so this is how they actually
compute the payments. Because,

489
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:47,000
uh, you can take, if you want, if someone
is borrowing, let's bring it up to today,

490
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:48,770
they're borrowing $200,000.

491
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:54,130
The median price of a home today is
just over 200,000 in the u s so if,

492
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:56,000
if it's an 80% mortgage,

493
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:00,290
you would be borrowing a 160,000.
Okay?

494
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:04,880
So you'd have a 160 k here.
Uh,

495
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:07,580
and you know what this is whatever
the mortgage rate is coated,

496
00:34:07,581 --> 00:34:11,210
you substituted into this formula and you
find out what the square bracket thing

497
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:13,730
is.
And then to get the monthly payment,

498
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,440
you take the square bracket and
thing and you divide by, uh,

499
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:22,160
the mortgage balance. And
that's the monthly payment.
That's how it's calculated.

500
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:27,500
Um, so one peculiar property
of this, incidentally,

501
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:31,730
at every point of time this thing holds,

502
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,890
this is time to maturity.
This is, this is, um,

503
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:37,280
years to go.

504
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:44,820
All right? And so 12 t would be the
number of months to go before it ends.

505
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:50,040
So at every point of time your mortgage
balance is equal to your mortgage

506
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:54,360
payment times that square bracket of
thing where t is the amount of time you

507
00:34:54,361 --> 00:34:58,800
have left. So I suppose, um, you are uh,

508
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,390
moving after five years,

509
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:03,780
he took out a 30 year mortgage and
you're moving after five years.

510
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,460
When you first bought the house,

511
00:35:05,461 --> 00:35:09,570
they told you what the mortgage payment
was and they're fixing that forever and

512
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:13,980
ever for 30 years. So when you get, when
you sell the house, what do they do?

513
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,670
They go back to this formula.
If you sold it after five years,

514
00:35:18,671 --> 00:35:22,980
then there's 25 years left.
So 25 times 12 is a number of months left.

515
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:26,760
They plugged that into this formula.
The mortgage payment is,

516
00:35:26,761 --> 00:35:29,670
this was decided when you took out
the mortgage. So that never changes.

517
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,240
They then figure out what your
mortgage balance is. Okay.

518
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,230
And then the deal is that when
you sell the house, they subtract,

519
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,290
you've got to pay this, they subtract
this from the purchase price of the house,

520
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,470
and then you've got the cash
to go and buy another house.

521
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,540
But that's how it works.
Okay.

522
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:50,090
It's very important to understand
that the mortgage balance is, um,

523
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:53,730
is recomputed according to
this formula every month.

524
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,020
And they will send you a statement showing
how your mortgage balance is falling.

525
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:03,620
Peculiar property of this is that the
mortgage balance fall slowly at first and

526
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:07,320
then it gradually picks up.
It's just a property of this formula.

527
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,460
When you first buy a house, most of
your payment is going to interest, uh,

528
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,110
your payment. Your mortgage
payment is constant through time,

529
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:21,000
but the fraction of it that goes to paying
off principal versus interest changes

530
00:36:21,001 --> 00:36:24,090
through time and it just changes
as dictated by this formula.

531
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,550
And that's because at the end,

532
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:31,020
if suppose you're one month or two months
away from the payoff of the mortgage,

533
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:32,820
you don't have any balance left.

534
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:37,200
And so the interest that you're paying
is hardly any balance left is very low.

535
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:41,790
And so your payment is paying
off principle. Uh, mostly,

536
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,010
whereas at the beginning
you're the, uh, the, the,

537
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,160
the mortgage balance is dropping only
very slowly because you've got a lot of

538
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:54,930
interest to pay and your mortgage
payment is constant. So, uh,

539
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:59,430
that's funny. Property of, of
conventional mortgages that the,

540
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,880
the mortgage balance declines
very slowly at fast first,

541
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:07,980
and then it falls rapidly
when it comes to maturity.

542
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:09,560
Okay.

543
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,870
Okay.
Um,

544
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:18,310
okay. So I wanted to, um,

545
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,090
but just mentioned,

546
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:25,580
I wanted to mention a couple of other
institutions that are very important in

547
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:30,450
real estate and that is,
uh, fanny and Freddy, uh,

548
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,360
in 1938 as part of the new deal,
uh,

549
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:37,290
I'll just write Fannie Mae,
uh,

550
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,440
1938 under the Roosevelt administration
in order to further work on the problem

551
00:37:46,071 --> 00:37:48,140
and housing,
which was still troubling them,

552
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:52,970
they created a government
institution called federal,

553
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,870
National Mortgage
Corporation. Uh, and, uh,

554
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:02,120
people on Wall Street found that
difficult to say Federal National Mortgage

555
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:06,230
Corporation. So they nicknamed at Fannie
Mae, uh, it sounds like a woman's name.

556
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,830
Uh, and so the idea was
that they would help, uh,

557
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:15,320
advanced the mortgage market by
buying up mortgages from our mortgage

558
00:38:15,321 --> 00:38:17,180
originators,
uh,

559
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:21,560
and therefore allowing them
to make more mortgages. Okay.

560
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,120
So you would buy mortgages
from originators.

561
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:34,750
What does an originator and originator
is a company that lends money to hustled.

562
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,570
Okay. So they, they raised money and
then they landed artists, mortgages,

563
00:38:39,571 --> 00:38:40,211
the households,

564
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:44,070
and then they deal with the households
by having a local office and, uh,

565
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,960
telling people, uh,
what their balances and,

566
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,800
and calling them up if they're not
paying. And that sort of thing. Uh,

567
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:53,140
where they were,

568
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:57,970
that's a servicer is someone who might
make a distinction between originator and

569
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:00,340
service or the originator is
the one who makes the loan.

570
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:04,470
The servicer is someone who
manages the paying of the loan.

571
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:10,300
And Congress thought that these people
could be given more money to operate if

572
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,180
they, if someone would buy
the mortgages from them.

573
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,470
So Fannie Mae started doing that in 1938.
Uh,

574
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:22,330
and then the government
created a second such, uh,

575
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,460
uh, institution called, and they gave
it a boy's name, some of the nickname,

576
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:32,470
a boy's name, uh, with Freddie Mac. Uh,

577
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:35,740
so the government created competitors,
uh,

578
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:40,950
and it privatized them so that both
Fannie and Freddie became what are called

579
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:43,780
GSEs.
Uh,

580
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,430
these are government
sponsored enterprises.

581
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,700
Technically,
Fannie and Freddie are private companies.

582
00:40:00,701 --> 00:40:04,210
They're traded stocks.
You can buy shares in Fannie and Freddie.

583
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,130
They're not part of the government,

584
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:11,590
but they were created by the
government and they are massive,

585
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,680
uh,
supporters of the housing market.

586
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:19,630
So the general market assumes, and also
the government still regulates them.

587
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:20,830
Uh,

588
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:25,830
it tells how there's a conforming loan
limit that is a limit on how much fanny

589
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:30,940
and Freddy, uh, how big a mortgage
they can make to one homeowner.

590
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:35,680
And it was just part of the new President
Bush has planned to increase the

591
00:40:35,681 --> 00:40:40,390
conforming loan limits on Fannie and
Freddie to allow them to lend at a higher

592
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:43,990
price. So you can see the government
is still involved in them while they're

593
00:40:43,991 --> 00:40:46,810
technically private companies.

594
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,680
Now there are still thought to
be related to the u s government.

595
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:55,990
And so people are willing to lend to
these organizations at low interest rates

596
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,780
because they think there's an
implicit government guarantee.

597
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:04,080
There are critics of Fannie and Freddie
who say the government guarantee it

598
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:08,500
doesn't sound right because why is the
government guaranteeing a private company?

599
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,590
On the other hand, the government
says it's not guaranteeing them,

600
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,370
but then nobody believes the government
when they say, because people say,

601
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:19,450
surely the u s government is not going
to allow Fannie and Freddie to fail.

602
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,990
This is very important.
Suddenly now with the housing crisis,

603
00:41:22,991 --> 00:41:25,090
and if you just saw the news yesterday,

604
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:29,770
Fannie Mae is predicting where they are
predicting that Fannie Mae is going to

605
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:34,370
make huge losses, uh, in their
latest earnings statement.

606
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,380
Uh, and so, uh, it, it's still, they
can make losses for a long time, uh,

607
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,500
before they're in trouble.
So presumably there won't be a problem,

608
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,480
but in principle there could be.

609
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,270
And so that's the kind of
issue that we have now. Um,

610
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,220
okay.
I want her to talk about the current boom,

611
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:55,890
and I have so much to say
about this. Uh, but, uh,

612
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,810
uh,
let me see if I can.

613
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:06,943
MMM.

614
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,133
MMM.

615
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,640
So,
um,

616
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:31,140
this is a plot that I created for
the second edition of my book,

617
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,310
uh,

618
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:37,310
irrational exuberance that shows the
real estate market and the United States

619
00:42:37,361 --> 00:42:39,900
since 1890.
Uh,

620
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:44,950
and what is really significant.
I created this plot,

621
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:49,840
uh, just a couple of
years ago in 2005. Uh,

622
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,860
and uh, to my surprise,
nobody had it before,

623
00:42:53,861 --> 00:42:56,380
created a 100 year long home price index,

624
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:59,980
which seems surprising to me because a,

625
00:42:59,981 --> 00:43:03,840
the long history of home prices
seems like a relevant fact. Uh,

626
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,590
we want to know what markets do.

627
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:09,670
A lot of people have the impression
that home prices only go up, uh,

628
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,170
and that there are a wonderful investment.

629
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,530
So I thought we should try to find
out what home prices have done.

630
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:18,460
So I constructed a series of
home price that's the red line.

631
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,160
And the red line is,
um,

632
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,390
you can see how it's a
move through history.

633
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,350
It has suddenly shot up in the,
uh,

634
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:34,670
in the latest year is this is
since the late 1990s. So this, um,

635
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,650
this behavior recently,
uh,

636
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:43,070
I think confirms that we are living
in a very unusual time in the housing

637
00:43:43,071 --> 00:43:46,400
market. Uh, and it's going
to put a lot of stress on us.

638
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:51,720
The only other time we've seen a boom,
like this was right after World War II,

639
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:56,180
and that's this shown by this line
here. Uh, but that wasn't as big.

640
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,050
So after World War II,
uh,

641
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:04,310
there were two things that
I think contributed to the
huge housing boom at that

642
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:04,970
time.

643
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:08,870
One of them was that the US government
had shut down the construction industry

644
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:13,100
during the war. Uh, and so, uh,

645
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,760
they didn't build any houses
for close to five years.

646
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,950
So obviously we had a shortage of housing.

647
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,200
The other thing was the soldiers came
back from World War II and they wanted

648
00:44:24,201 --> 00:44:28,010
families. They started something that you
may have heard of called the baby boom.

649
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:32,250
Uh, and so the birth rate shot way up, uh,

650
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,930
and so everyone wanted a home with one
bedroom wasn't good enough anymore.

651
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:40,100
They wanted, you don't want the baby
in the same room with you, right?

652
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:45,050
You want to have two bedrooms, um, you
might even want two bathrooms. So, uh,

653
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,350
uh, the demand for
housing went up, but the,

654
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,260
but the current boom is different because
there was nothing like that happening.

655
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,060
Uh,
and so,

656
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,423
uh,

657
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:59,840
it's strange. Uh, the question
is what caused the current boom.

658
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,940
I have some other data has shown here.

659
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,280
The Green Line is the building costs.
Uh,

660
00:45:07,281 --> 00:45:11,570
and uh, you can see that building
costs since 1890 in realtor,

661
00:45:11,571 --> 00:45:13,010
everything is corrected for inflation.

662
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:18,230
Building costs have gone up a little
bit since 1890, but not a whole lot.

663
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,030
And in fact,
for the last step,

664
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,820
this is the engineering news
record building costs index.

665
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:28,270
It's an index used by people in the
construction industry since around 1980.

666
00:45:28,471 --> 00:45:31,110
The building costs have been falling.
Uh,

667
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:35,750
that I think is partly because the biggest
single component of building costs is

668
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:40,670
labor. And, uh, as you know,
income inequality is getting worse.

669
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,480
Uh, low income wages are not
going up. Uh, and so, uh,

670
00:45:45,481 --> 00:45:48,710
that component of housing has
been declining in real terms.

671
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:51,710
The other components are not doing much.

672
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:54,410
Uh, so, uh,

673
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,200
the other thing I have down is population
or the population of the u s has been

674
00:45:59,201 --> 00:46:00,820
pretty steady, right? That pink line,

675
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,610
it looks awfully steady
and I have interest rates.

676
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:05,710
Now are a lot of people
talk about interest rates.

677
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:09,340
I was just reading Alan Greenspan's
new book, the age of turbulence,

678
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,301
and if you saw this,

679
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:14,530
it came out last year and he said
he didn't think there was a bubble.

680
00:46:14,531 --> 00:46:19,060
I don't know how he can think, not think
there was above him. He didn't see it.

681
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:23,740
Uh, and is honest. He's, he said
maybe froth in the real estate market,

682
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:26,740
but not a bubble. Uh, but
anyway, I was reading, well,

683
00:46:26,741 --> 00:46:29,170
why didn't you think there's
a bubble? And he said, well,

684
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,440
part of the reason is interest rates were
coming down and if interest rates are

685
00:46:32,441 --> 00:46:34,180
coming down, as you can see, they are,

686
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:37,870
that means the rate of discount is going
down and the present value formula.

687
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:40,000
So ash asset prices should go up.

688
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:41,913
MMM.

689
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:45,670
I guess that's plaza.
It doesn't match up very well though,

690
00:46:45,671 --> 00:46:49,110
because interest rates have been
going down since 1980 and the,

691
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:50,680
and the room is very sudden.

692
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,470
So it seems to me that Greenspan
should have seen this bubble coming.

693
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,500
Uh, uh, so

694
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,590
what causes that? That's the, um, uh,

695
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,470
I wanted to show you one city that,
that I actually do it.

696
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,750
There's a short comparison
between a couple of cities, uh,

697
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:12,450
Los Angeles and Milwaukee.
Who is there anyone here from Los Angeles?

698
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:15,660
How are we got a good number.
What about Milwaukee?

699
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,180
Nobody from Milwaukee.
Um,

700
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,610
I might be insulting Milwaukeeans
when I talk about the,

701
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,400
not really no walkie.
Is there someone up there?

702
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,610
Yeah. Huh. Um, so,

703
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:37,600
uh, Milwaukeeans are, um, uh,

704
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:42,880
much more stable than this is actually
prays for loss ever for Milwaukee.

705
00:47:42,881 --> 00:47:45,360
It's not, not the, um,

706
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,770
Milwaukee ends are much more stable than
Angelenos I guess you call them, right?

707
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:52,990
Los Angeles resident.
Look what the housing,

708
00:47:52,991 --> 00:47:57,130
the Blue Line shows what home prices in
real terms have done two in Los Angeles,

709
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:02,680
uh, uh, over the last 30 years. When
you compare Norwalk, you look at that.

710
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:07,360
Isn't that amazing? Milwaukee has been
extremely steady over this period.

711
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,940
Uh, so one theory is that, well,

712
00:48:09,941 --> 00:48:12,220
it's because people say I'm
going back to Los Angeles.

713
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:17,140
The problem with Los Angeles is that
they've had a unsteady employment and

714
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:20,800
unemployment. Uh, if, if they,
if the economy is sagging,

715
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:25,060
then the Los Angeles housing
prices will respond. Well.

716
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:29,190
You can see the pink line shows
the employment in Los Angeles. Uh,

717
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,200
and indeed it did move
around corresponding to the
booms and busts in the Los

718
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:37,060
Angeles market,
but not so dramatically.

719
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:40,720
And if you look at Milwaukee,
the unemployment,

720
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:45,130
the employment figures don't look that
much different than Los Angeles. Uh,

721
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,233
what's different?

722
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:49,450
There's something about Los Angeles
that's different from Milwaukee,

723
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:54,750
and that is that in Los Angeles there's
just a history of volatile markets.

724
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,990
Uh, and, um, I wanted to try and
figure out why, what, you know,

725
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:03,640
Milwaukee, the reason we picked
these two, these two cities,

726
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:08,020
we asked realtors or Carl
Case is my colleague, he
teaches at Wellesley College.

727
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,870
Uh, it, back in 1988 when
we started this study,

728
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:12,520
we asked realtors around the country,

729
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:16,840
what is the hottest market in the
United States? Uh, and they say, oh,

730
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:21,580
that's Los Angeles. Uh, or maybe
Anaheim, which is where it right outside.

731
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,020
Um, and then we say, what's the, the
dentist market and United States,

732
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,730
there wasn't as much agreement on that,

733
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:30,190
but one of the names
suggested was Milwaukee.

734
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:34,000
Nothing has ever happened there
in terms of real estate. Uh,

735
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,530
now I think that ultimately, uh,
you know, interestingly enough,

736
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:43,950
Los Angeles had a real estate
boom and bust in the 1880s.

737
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:49,240
Uh, that's hard to believe. There was a
huge boom in real estate prices in La,

738
00:49:49,241 --> 00:49:52,930
in it peaked in 1886 and then a crash.

739
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:58,030
Now you might think, uh,
that's a long time ago. 1886.

740
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:02,980
Isn't that when the cowboys and Indians
were out there in the old west and the

741
00:50:02,981 --> 00:50:07,930
covered wagons and uh, well that's
right. But there was a real estate boom,

742
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,400
uh, in Los Angeles. And so I
went back and studied this. Boom.

743
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:16,320
It rather extensively, uh, by, uh,
there's one book written about,

744
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:18,280
there's also the La Times,

745
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:21,370
which you can get now online
with no problem from the pier.

746
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:23,020
You can read every day's newspaper.

747
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:28,880
And it turns out I was talking
about what in La and the 1880s,

748
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:34,770
they're a view arose that Los Angeles
was just the most wonderful place on

749
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:38,090
earth.
The climate out there is beautiful,

750
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,730
especially feel that on a
winter's day like today,

751
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:45,100
you might wish you were in some of
you, you might wish you were there. Uh,

752
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:50,330
but it wasn't just California because
California was a huge state, right,

753
00:50:50,331 --> 00:50:52,730
with all kinds of,
but mostly empty land.

754
00:50:53,060 --> 00:50:58,060
People somehow got the idea that Los
Angeles is just this wonderful city and so

755
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:03,140
they started built bidding up real estate
prices. You can explain that to me.

756
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:05,960
Some of it from Los Angeles.
Uh,

757
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:11,510
it turned out to be kind of wrong because
in the 1880s they started building so

758
00:51:11,511 --> 00:51:15,800
many houses in response to the demand
that there was eventually a crash.

759
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:19,490
But somehow people get
this idea at some time.

760
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:23,210
So we compared loss and we couldn't
go back in a time machine and do

761
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:27,200
questionnaires, surveys, and the
1880s but we could do it in the 1980s.

762
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,640
So a case,

763
00:51:28,641 --> 00:51:33,440
and I did identical questionnaire
is in Los Angeles and Milwaukee.

764
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:38,810
Uh, and these are median
price expectations in 1988
when there was a boom in

765
00:51:38,811 --> 00:51:41,480
California,
but of course not in Milwaukee,

766
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:47,140
the average person in Los Angeles thought
home prices would go up 10% a year for

767
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:52,410
the next 10 years. That's
the median, I'm sorry. Uh,

768
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:57,080
10% a year is a pretty fast appreciation
and if it goes on for 10 years,

769
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:00,830
that means that the oil
double in seven years.

770
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:04,290
So it'd be going up like
two and a half fold. Um,

771
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,630
that was quite an a nice expectation.
If you compare that with Milwaukee,

772
00:52:08,631 --> 00:52:11,270
they thought only 4%,
which is about the inflation rate.

773
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,290
So there was something different
between Los Angeles and Milwaukee.

774
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,490
The Los Angeles people had
extravagantly high expectations.

775
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:23,060
We saw it again in 2003,
uh,

776
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:27,560
when people in Los Angeles expected
8% appreciation every year,

777
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:32,990
uh, it's coming down now in 2006
they're gradually coming down as the,

778
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,800
as the boom unwind.
But you notice no walkie is going up.

779
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:41,420
I think what's happening is that we're
becoming more national and Milwaukeeans

780
00:52:41,421 --> 00:52:44,180
are starting to think more like Angelenos,
uh,

781
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:49,100
that it's one boom. And so they start
to expect it to happen in Milwaukee.

782
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:54,020
So Las Angeles in Milwaukee, we're
tied in 2006 where their expectations,

783
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:56,590
this is the boom.
Uh,

784
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,830
people had great fear of being
left out of the real estate market.

785
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,790
I think the boom was driven by fear.
So in 1988,

786
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:08,600
we asked people in Los Angeles, uh,
are you worried? Unless I buy now,

787
00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:10,700
I won't be able to afford
a house in the future.

788
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:14,690
We had 80% agreement
with that in Los Angeles.

789
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,690
So people were really worried.
Uh,

790
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:21,410
in Milwaukee it was only 27%.
Uh,

791
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:24,860
you kind of wonder how can it be
that the people had such different,

792
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,420
depending on which city they lived in.
Well,

793
00:53:27,421 --> 00:53:32,310
I can kind of explain it that there's
a couple of factors. One is in 1988,

794
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:37,110
home prices were rising rapidly in
Los Angeles, not so in Milwaukee.

795
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,500
So people were just
extrapolating the price increase.

796
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:45,920
But the other thing is that Los Angeles
just has this sense of its own glamor

797
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:51,780
and excitement that, uh, you know,
it is the home of movie stars. What,

798
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:56,670
what city is more glamorous, or Beverly
Hills is part of Los Angeles, right?

799
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:00,450
And it's the most expensive
city in the u s uh,

800
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:02,250
so this sense,

801
00:54:02,251 --> 00:54:07,251
this glamour thinking along with price
increases because the Los Angeles to

802
00:54:07,351 --> 00:54:09,690
boom, so it's the boom. He asked us city,

803
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:14,760
we ask people whether they had a
perception of excitement, uh, directly.

804
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:17,550
And in Los Angeles in 1988,

805
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:21,660
54% said yes.
Whereas in Milwaukee,

806
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:25,830
only 21% said yes. Um, but as you know,

807
00:54:25,831 --> 00:54:26,700
as the years go by,

808
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:31,230
you notice that Milwaukee is starting to
look more and more like Los Angeles. Uh,

809
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,310
uh,

810
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:37,310
Alan Greenspan in his book says that he
thinks housing markets are all local.

811
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,410
And there is no,
he says this firmly in his book,

812
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,980
there is no national housing
market. Uh, but in fact,

813
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:49,040
it's becoming more national because
Milwaukeeans no longer think that they are

814
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:54,480
some kind of outpost. It's unrelated to
the excitement of a glamorous cities.

815
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:58,210
They see it happening
at home as well. So, um,

816
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:02,380
now I wanted to compare it
with another question that, uh,

817
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,310
people have this simple idea
that there's a best investment.

818
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,810
This is about the stock market,
but I asked a number of, uh, uh,

819
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:13,950
this I've been doing since 1996.
Do you agree with the following statement?

820
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:18,840
The stock market is the best investment
for longterm holders who can just buy

821
00:55:18,841 --> 00:55:22,010
and hold through the ups
and downs of the market. Uh,

822
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:26,970
I only started asking this in 1996 when
the stock market boom was well underway,

823
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:32,330
but already 69% of my respondents
who were high income investors,

824
00:55:32,970 --> 00:55:37,380
uh, strongly agreed. That percent
grew to the peak of the market.

825
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,940
In 1,999, after the peak
in 2000, it began to fall.

826
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,440
So we see what happens is that when the
markets, people are chasing past returns,

827
00:55:46,441 --> 00:55:48,030
when the stock market is going up,

828
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:52,800
they think that they increasingly think
that the stock market is just the best

829
00:55:52,801 --> 00:55:57,060
investment until when it starts falling,
then they start retracting from that.

830
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:02,430
Uh, or I didn't have what
happened? I lost it. Uh, the, um,

831
00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:06,390
what is going on here?
Oh,

832
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:14,250
uh, okay. Where were we? So,

833
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,330
um, uh, we see the same
thing in real estate. Uh,

834
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:23,140
and the percent who think it's the best
investment is higher in Los Angeles then

835
00:56:23,141 --> 00:56:27,010
in Milwaukee.
And since the peak of the bubble in 2003,

836
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:31,750
it's been declining in Los Angeles,
but surprisingly rising in Milwaukee.

837
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:36,820
Uh, and so they've almost come, well,
they pretty much converged in 2006.

838
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:41,860
So the lesson is that I think that we
have a glamorous city phenomenon that

839
00:56:41,861 --> 00:56:46,690
excitement about real estate prices,
uh, centered in places like Los Angeles,

840
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:50,080
but it's spreading and becoming more
and more of a national phenomenon.

841
00:56:50,081 --> 00:56:54,690
And that's the bubble.
Uh, part of this is the,

842
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,420
uh, uh, it's not loan to value ratio.

843
00:56:58,421 --> 00:57:02,800
This is the ratio of mortgage debt to
personal consumption expenditure. Uh,

844
00:57:02,801 --> 00:57:04,480
over the boom period,

845
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:09,900
we've been seeing a gradual uptrend just
as loan to value ratios were only 60%

846
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:15,690
in the 1920s. Now they're
up to 90% of our 100%. Um,

847
00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:18,670
we were much more willing
to take risks on mortgages.

848
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,800
People are also borrowing much more.

849
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:24,040
So you can see that in the early 1950s,

850
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:29,250
mortgage debt was only something like 25%
of a personal consumption expenditure,

851
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,440
but now it's up to about 100%.

852
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:36,670
So we're much more expansive in
mortgage financing. And we were,

853
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:42,720
I put this chart out to just show the
international aspect of home prices. Uh,

854
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,300
they're here.

855
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:47,590
The Blue Line is the case Shiller
home price index for a Greater Boston.

856
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:48,610
Uh,

857
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:53,610
and the red line is the Halifax a
home price index for greater London.

858
00:57:53,831 --> 00:57:57,860
We're talking UK now and
they're both deflated by, uh,

859
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:00,460
a consumer price index
or in the case of the UK,

860
00:58:00,461 --> 00:58:03,880
the retail price index to
give us a real home price.

861
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:07,360
Isn't it striking how similar
London and Boston are?

862
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,730
They both had dramatic booms. Uh, the,

863
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:14,980
the London boom of the late 19 days
is really something. Look at that.

864
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:18,970
It went up.
Peak suddenly turned around,

865
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:23,420
came all the way back down.
I don't know what the, uh,

866
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,620
and then it kind of
waffled around in London.

867
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:30,430
And then it shot up even higher.
And now look what's happened.

868
00:58:30,431 --> 00:58:34,390
This is the latest quarter. It's
starting to fall rapidly. Uh,

869
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,410
so just a couple of months ago,
London seemed to be sorry.

870
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,910
And now suddenly there's
this pessimistic atmos. Well,

871
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,770
cause we don't know what's going
to happen in London. Look how it,

872
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,320
it fell in 2004,

873
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:52,330
there was this sharp drop and most people
thought that the housing boom was over.

874
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:57,070
But then it went up again.
Uh, and so, uh, to a new peak,

875
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:58,840
uh,
in 2007

876
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,790
we have an international crisis.
This is another couple of countries.

877
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:08,791
I managed to find a price indexes for
Norway and Netherlands going back to 1890.

878
00:59:10,241 --> 00:59:14,110
And compared that with the u s we're
seeing a similar pattern in all three of

879
00:59:14,111 --> 00:59:14,890
these countries.

880
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:18,190
These are the only countries that I've
been able to find that have high quality,

881
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:22,310
uh, repeat sales price index
is going back a hundred years.

882
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:25,210
You can see that in all these countries,

883
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:28,940
real estate prices didn't show
much trend until recently.

884
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,070
And now they all have real estate booms.

885
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:34,670
So we have an international
real estate book. Why is that?

886
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:38,960
Why would we have an international boom?
Uh, I talked about this in the book.

887
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:41,700
You have irrational exuberance,
uh,

888
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:45,230
and I let you read that and
that, uh, summarize it here.

889
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:49,880
But a part of the reason I think is
globalization is creating a global culture

890
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:55,360
and the excitement and enthusiasm that
we once saw in isolated cities like Los

891
00:59:55,610 --> 01:00:00,170
Angeles, uh, are spreading out and they're
seeing more and more around the world.

892
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,500
And it's tied in with our
sense of rapid economic growth.

893
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:08,000
We're living in an era of
excited economic optimism.

894
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:11,000
And so it's feeding into home prices,
uh,

895
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:15,530
in the U S in Europe, in China, in Korea,

896
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:20,470
in India, in South Africa, uh, uh,

897
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:24,860
Australia and New Zealand. Lots and lots
of places have seen home price boom.

898
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:26,440
And I think it's,
it's the,

899
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:29,870
it's not anything unique to any
one country that explains it. It's,

900
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,190
it's the psychology.

901
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:38,110
I think this is a residential investment
in the United States as a fraction of

902
01:00:39,231 --> 01:00:44,060
GDP. A, and I have it
shown with, um, the, uh,

903
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:45,860
uh,

904
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:50,860
the vertical lines on this
chart are recession's indicate
recession's a and this

905
01:00:51,831 --> 01:00:54,830
shows, okay, this is from 1948 to 2007.

906
01:00:55,160 --> 01:01:00,110
And every recession that we've had
since 1948 is shown. For example,

907
01:01:00,350 --> 01:01:04,130
we had a recession that started here.
Uh,

908
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:09,560
I believe that was 48
and then it ended in 49.

909
01:01:10,190 --> 01:01:14,360
And then we had another recession
that began in 1953. That's that line.

910
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:18,440
And it ended in 54. Uh, and so on.

911
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:23,500
The most recent recession we've had is
a 2001 it began and ended in the same

912
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:29,150
year. 2001 we may be in a recession.
Now, a lot of people are saying that.

913
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,081
So I,

914
01:01:30,081 --> 01:01:35,081
I would be tempted to draw a new
line here somewhere around here,

915
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:39,860
maybe December of 2007.
Uh,

916
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:44,480
but the National Bureau of economic
research who announces recession dates

917
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:47,600
hasn't announced yet
whether there's a recession.

918
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:51,530
So we'll probably find out in a few
more months whether we're already in a

919
01:01:51,531 --> 01:01:56,170
recession. I suspect we are. Now,
the interesting thing is the,

920
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,710
the Green Line here is the
expenditure on real estate,

921
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:04,400
uh, investment. What does that
mean? There's three main components.

922
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:06,770
One is building new houses,

923
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:12,510
another one is building new
apartment buildings. That's
commercial instead of, oh,

924
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:14,360
but it's still adding
to the housing stock.

925
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:18,080
And the third one is improvements
of existing houses people,

926
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:22,980
but new additions are, are they redo the
kitchen and bathroom and whatever. Uh,

927
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:25,800
so we add all that up and
that's residential investment.

928
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:31,430
You can see that residential investment
as a fraction of GDP has been very

929
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:36,630
variable through history, uh,
of the United States since,
uh, since World War II.

930
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:41,280
Uh, and that it has had a strong
relationship with recession's.

931
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,510
Uh, so, um,

932
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:48,580
you can see what a residential
investment has done recently. Uh,

933
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:53,300
we had a huge peak in
residential investment, uh,

934
01:02:53,310 --> 01:02:57,990
and the peak was a, a couple
of years ago, uh, I believe,

935
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:02,680
uh, 2006, uh,

936
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:05,580
or there abouts,
uh,

937
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:09,150
and at the level of residential
investment was the highest.

938
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:13,230
It has been since 1951.

939
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:14,490
And that's over here.

940
01:03:14,940 --> 01:03:19,200
That's the only time since World War
II that we've had a higher level of

941
01:03:19,201 --> 01:03:20,250
residential investment.

942
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:25,220
Even 1951 was a very unusual year.
Uh,

943
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:30,320
I'll tell you why because we were
getting into the Korean War and,

944
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:36,090
uh, the people remembered
that during World War II,

945
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,850
the u s government shutdown
the housing market.

946
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:43,800
They said no more new houses to be built.
So everyone thought are in fact,

947
01:03:43,801 --> 01:03:46,700
they were talking about world war three.
There were really scared.

948
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:51,720
You don't remember how awful it looked
because the US was proposing to invade

949
01:03:51,721 --> 01:03:56,721
Korea and then the Soviet Union and China
were being very angry and we thought

950
01:03:57,721 --> 01:04:02,070
we'd be in some war with communist
China. Ours, some awful war.

951
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:06,080
People got really scared. Uh, but
one thing they did is they want,

952
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,330
this was the baby boom.
They just got back from World War II.

953
01:04:09,331 --> 01:04:12,270
They didn't want another,
they wanted to live a normal life.

954
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:17,070
They wanted to have kids, and then this
terrible war was coming. They thought,

955
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:19,860
uh, and so they, they
rushed and bought houses.

956
01:04:19,861 --> 01:04:24,660
So everyone was scrambling to get a
house before they shut down the housing

957
01:04:24,661 --> 01:04:28,980
market. It turns out that it didn't
turn into world war three. Uh, and,

958
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:34,280
uh, maybe they did shut down the house.
They must've curtailed it. Uh, but it,

959
01:04:34,281 --> 01:04:37,200
it created that book.
But what's causing this boom here?

960
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:42,410
It's almost as big as the 1951.
Boom. Well, the answer is, uh,

961
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:43,560
high prices.

962
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:48,620
I believe we had this huge bubble in
home prices and it pushed prices up to

963
01:04:49,381 --> 01:04:52,920
extraordinary levels. What
does that do to builders? Well,

964
01:04:52,921 --> 01:04:55,290
builders can sell for a really high price,

965
01:04:55,590 --> 01:05:00,020
and so they start building a lot
of houses. They will do it, uh, as,

966
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:03,210
as long as the home prices high
relative to their construction costs.

967
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:09,080
So we've seen a boom in building in the
United States that is at a record level,

968
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:14,530
uh, except for that one
Korean War, a blip. Uh,

969
01:05:14,540 --> 01:05:16,200
and so I think it's,
it's an APP.

970
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:20,110
It's a highly abnormal situation
that we've been in. Um,

971
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:25,180
and uh, but now look how suddenly
in sharply it's correcting downward.

972
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,220
Why is it correcting downward?
Well,

973
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:31,100
that's because the housing
market is now in decline. And,

974
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:33,340
and so when the housing
market is in decline,

975
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:37,840
the ability to sell houses
drops dramatically. So builders,

976
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:42,580
we're doing extremely well. Until a couple
of years ago, their stock was soaring.

977
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,560
Now all of a sudden they're in crisis.
Uh, and well, it's no surprise.

978
01:05:47,561 --> 01:05:52,150
This is what a housing bubble does.
And I have, I think, uh, maybe,

979
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:56,110
uh, you can see various side, this is
the growth rate of home prices. Actually,

980
01:05:56,111 --> 01:05:59,860
I should update this. This is
now tip negative. Uh, the peak.

981
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:04,540
This is the case Shiller 10 city index.
Uh,

982
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:07,360
housing permits have dropped way off,
uh,

983
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:10,430
because of course they're not building
homes anyway, this shows a law,

984
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:14,860
a strong seasonality. And then
a dropoff, uh, since the 2006,

985
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:19,900
and his, my last slide, uh, the
National Association of Home Builders,

986
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:25,200
uh, surveys its membership to ask them
what is the traffic of homebuyers,

987
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:29,170
uh, w what they mean by that is if
you're a builder and you have this,

988
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:31,990
a place where you show
off your model homes,

989
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:36,010
how many people are coming by to
look at your model homes today, uh,

990
01:06:36,011 --> 01:06:40,130
as put potential buyers. The Blue
Line is the traffic of home buyers.

991
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:44,410
You can see that it has
reached the lowest level ever.

992
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:49,320
It has dropped precipitously and you note
that the pink line, which shows the, uh,

993
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:51,190
the rate of growth of home prices,

994
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:55,270
the rate of growth of home prices has
fallen just right along with the traffic

995
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:58,300
of home buyers. So I think it's
pretty clear what's happening.

996
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:02,830
People saw the rising home prices,
they thought they would rise forever.

997
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:07,750
They were flocking in trying to get into
the homeless housing market before it w

998
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:10,900
it out, priced them, and now suddenly
the word is out. It's falling.

999
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:12,640
So suddenly they don't want these homes.

1000
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,640
So the inventory of
unsold homes has shot up.

1001
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:19,330
Builders can't sell them
and prices are falling.

1002
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:20,900
That's a situation where,

1003
01:07:20,901 --> 01:07:23,660
and we'll talk more about this very
interesting situation because it,

1004
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,250
it ties in with so many other
aspects of financial markets.
