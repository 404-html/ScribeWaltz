1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:05,550
I'd say today's lecture is
about behavioral finance.

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,910
Um, and, uh,

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,020
this is a term that emerged into public
con consciousness around the mid 1990s.

4
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,390
Before that,
it was unknown.

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,700
The term efficient markets is much older.
I mentioned the idea,

6
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:34,680
it goes back to the 19th century.
The term goes back to the 1960s.

7
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,670
Uh,
but behavioral finance is a newer,

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,370
a revolution in finance.
Uh,

9
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:44,610
and it's something that I had
been very involved with. Um,

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,440
I have an organizing workshops in
behavioral finance ever since 1991 working

11
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:54,450
with a professor Richard Thaler
at University of Chicago.

12
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,250
So we've been doing that for
18 years. Amazing. That's a
long time for you, right?

13
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,070
Uh, when we started, we
were a total outcast.

14
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:09,000
We thought nobody appreciated us.
Uh,

15
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,240
I had tenure so I could
do it. But, uh, you know,

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,780
the problem is you don't want to do
things that are too out of fashion. Uh,

17
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,650
fortunately we have a system
that allows it to happen.

18
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,810
I'm very happy to have that. But, uh,

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,570
what behavioral finance is,
is a reaction against extreme,

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,280
some extreme,
uh,

21
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,310
that we see in efficient markets
theory or also in mathematical finance.

22
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,070
Mathematical finance is a beautiful
structure and I admire what they've people

23
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:45,210
have done and I've worked in it
myself. Um, but, uh, it has its limits.

24
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,370
And, uh, eventually, uh, you know,

25
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:51,690
the way of paradigm develops,
it goes through a certain phase.

26
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,500
When mathematical was finance was new,
say in the 1960s,

27
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:59,730
it was all the exciting thing and nobody
wanted to work on anything else you

28
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:02,190
wanted to be doing.
The exciting thing, uh,

29
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,350
as the 70s and eighties wore on,
it got to be a little bit over done.

30
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:10,200
You know,
people run with it too far and they think,

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,410
they think that's all we want to do and
we don't want to think about anything

32
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:18,090
else. And then they start to get
sometimes a little crazy. Uh, and uh,

33
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,450
and so then we had to
reflect that, well, you know,

34
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,330
things aren't perfect and the world isn't,

35
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,400
isn't perfect and we have real
people in the world. Uh, so, uh,

36
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,270
uh, that led to the behavioral finance.
So behavioral finance really means,

37
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,530
what does it mean? Uh, it's
not like behavioral psychology.

38
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:43,410
It doesn't mean behavioral
psychology applied to finance.

39
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,720
It really means something
much more broad than that.

40
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,030
It means all of the other social
sciences applied to finance. So,

41
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,670
uh, the, um, uh,

42
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,090
the economics department is just one of
many departments in the university that,

43
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,260
uh, uh, uh, teaches us something
about how people behave.

44
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,230
And so if we want to
understand how people behave,

45
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,560
we can't rely only on
economics department.

46
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,790
So I think that it's coming around to
a, a unifying of our understanding. Uh,

47
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:22,300
and, uh, since then, uh, since
the beginnings in the 90s,

48
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:25,550
I behavioral finance workshops have
grown and grown. And of course,

49
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,740
so many people are involved in it now.
It's now very well established.

50
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,710
So before I get into that,

51
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,200
I wanted to give some additional
reflections on the last lecture. Uh,

52
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:40,610
and I have this chart which
you saw last time. Uh,

53
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,930
actually it's an excel spreadsheet that I,
uh,

54
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:49,660
I also put it up already
on the, uh, on the,

55
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,460
um, classes vitu website
and so you can play with it.

56
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,600
Uh,
but I just wanted to reflect again.

57
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,800
I know I'm repeating myself a little bit,
but it's very important and I'll, uh,

58
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:03,940
uh,

59
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,940
what we have in this chart is the Blue
Line is the standard and poor come out of

60
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,390
the Stock Price Index.
Uh,

61
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:17,880
going back to 1871 from 1871,
two,

62
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:22,420
uh, 2008 right now. So that's a,

63
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:27,580
uh, like 130 years of data.
And that's the Blue Line.

64
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,770
You can see the,
you know what that is there.

65
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,950
That's 1929 and that,

66
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,810
that is the crash of 1929. Well,
actually it extended it to 1932.

67
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,500
Uh,
and you can see other historic movements.

68
00:04:41,501 --> 00:04:44,320
There's the bull market of the 1990s.

69
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,590
Very big upswing.

70
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:51,910
And then here's the
crash from 2000 to 2003.

71
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,190
I don't know if you remember these things.
They were a big news,

72
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,770
not as big as the 1929 crash,

73
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,760
but the upswing was just as big
as the 1920s. Upswing, wasn't it?

74
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:05,560
Here's the 1920s upswing. And
here's that. In 1990s, upswing.

75
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,760
Huge upswing and stock prices.
Um,

76
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:14,410
this is enlarged by the way. So
that means that, uh, everything, uh,

77
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,610
uh, the same vertical distance, uh,

78
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,370
it refers to the same
percentage change in the price.

79
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:28,120
And then I had, as I said last year,
I have a random walk, uh, shown.

80
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,560
So that's the pink line
and the random walk is, um,

81
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,890
is generated by the
random number generator.

82
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,750
I fixed the random number generators,

83
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:41,560
so I made it truly normal this time
and it slows it down a little bit.

84
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:44,980
But if you press f nine,
we get another,

85
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,740
a random walk,
but it's always the same stock price.

86
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:52,483
Uh,

87
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,100
this is the random walk with a trend that
matches the uptrend of the stock price.

88
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:01,620
So, uh, I can press it.

89
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:04,160
So it kind of looks similar,
doesn't it?

90
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,710
It kind of shows that in some basic sense,

91
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,240
the stock market and the random
walk are, are, are the same.

92
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,680
Uh,
here we have the crash of [inaudible].

93
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:18,350
Here we have the market peak of 1929.
Right.

94
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,670
He said it turned out in this simulation
to have occurred in 1910 or thereabout.

95
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,630
And then we have the, uh, that's
the depression of the 30s,

96
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,060
except it's not the 30 days.

97
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,950
And I can just push a button and we get
something else. I find this amusing.

98
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:38,810
I don't know. Um, so, uh,

99
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,970
unfortunately we lived through only
one of these in our lifetime. Um,

100
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,040
there's a TV show about
parallel universes, right?
What's the name of that show?

101
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,650
I can't remember. It isn't
there. You don't, you know,

102
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:54,920
this show where they go in some kind
of a time machine and they emerge in

103
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,930
another parallel universe where history
took another course. Well, anyway,

104
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,550
these are parallel
universes that we're seeing

105
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,900
in some of these universes.

106
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:10,430
Jeremy Siegel would write his book stacks
with alarm run and in some of them he

107
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,800
wouldn't, not because, uh,

108
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,510
well this one he might not because in
this case the stock market was just

109
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:22,400
declining for the better
part of a century. Uh,

110
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,270
and, uh, the, the thing I
don't see in these charts,

111
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:29,780
and I think we haven't
captured it perfectly with
just the standard random walk

112
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,810
is I don't see any crash as big as the
29 crash. I mean, it's hard to get them.

113
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:40,580
I keep pushing f nine, uh,
this just seems to dominate,

114
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,530
right? There's nothing as big
here. Uh, press f nine. Again,

115
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,540
I mean, you can keep pushing and pushing
and maybe you'll get one, but you have,

116
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:55,130
you get the idea that there's something
anomalous about that crash from the

117
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:59,000
standpoint of this random walk
theory. I'm not getting one. Right?

118
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,420
Uh, and that's something we'll
talk about it I would attribute,

119
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,990
I'm not, I can push for a
long time and I don't see,

120
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:13,400
well there is a pretty big one.
Isn't that just about a shirt?

121
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,050
Not Quite as sharp as 19, uh, 19,

122
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:22,300
29 crash. But it's hard to get them. Uh,

123
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,620
so I think that one thing, there's a
couple of things that we'll come back to.

124
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,950
One is I think I've already mentioned it.
Fat Tails that uh,

125
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,100
stock price movements have a tendency to,
uh,

126
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,130
show some extreme outliers that are not
represented by the normal distribution.

127
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:41,150
But also, um, there's
variations in the variance.

128
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,210
So in this period here in
the twenties and thirties,

129
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,780
the stock market was extremely
variable on a day to day basis.

130
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,920
It was way beyond anything
we've observed since. Uh,

131
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:56,460
and so that's why it seems to be more
volatile in that period because cumulation

132
00:08:56,461 --> 00:09:00,830
of bigger random shocks. So, uh,

133
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,360
anywhere we can play this
game for a while. But, uh,

134
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,750
now I wanted to then go and talk about,

135
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,270
remember that the,
the,

136
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,890
the random walk that we see in stock
price is not the behavior of a drunk,

137
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,460
even though you can describe a
random walk is drunk and behavior.

138
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,630
But the idea in the theory is that this,

139
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,700
these movements only appear random
because they're news and news is always

140
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:33,330
unpredictable as the market
is doing the best job.

141
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:37,350
This is efficient markets in
predicting the future. And so,

142
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,270
uh, that, uh, that means then that
anytime the stock market moves,

143
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,640
it's because something
surprising happened.

144
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,170
Like there might be a new
breakthrough in science or a,

145
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,880
there could be a war or something outside.

146
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,680
This is the story outside of the
economic system that disrupts thing. So,

147
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:59,850
uh, the next question then, and
now I've added something to it.

148
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:04,310
It's on this little tab here,
I've added something which is a,

149
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,050
a plot of present values.

150
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,950
And this is something that
I published in 1981. Well,

151
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,200
it's a long time ago,
isn't it?

152
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:19,050
It was my first big success.
Not everyone liked this article,

153
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,730
but what I, I got into a lot of
trouble for it. Uh, I learned, uh,

154
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:27,780
some people, uh, react to
hostility when you, uh,

155
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,250
offender cherished beliefs. So I was on
the outs for a while with this article,

156
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,450
but I said,
well,

157
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,540
it's kind of interesting to think that
all these apparently random movements are

158
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:44,181
really resulting in news about
something that is fundamental,

159
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:44,881
right?

160
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:48,780
That's the efficient markets every time
the stock market moves is because there

161
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:52,770
was some news about, about what, well,

162
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:53,940
it's about present value.

163
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:58,590
The efficient market theory
in its simplest incarnation
says that the price is

164
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,140
the expected present
value of future dividends.

165
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,910
So what I did in a paper that I
published in 1981, as I said, well,

166
00:11:05,911 --> 00:11:09,120
let's just plot the present
value of dividends through time.

167
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,220
And that's how I constructed this long
time series back to 1871 nobody else was

168
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:16,350
looking at it. Uh, you know,

169
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,780
typically researchers want the best data,
the high quality data.

170
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,730
And so they would look at recent data,

171
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:28,731
which is the best data and they would
think going back to 1871 is is crazy

172
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:35,010
because that's so long ago and we have
daily or minute by minute data by now we

173
00:11:35,011 --> 00:11:38,700
can't get it for that remote period.
But on the other hand, as I argued,

174
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,100
the stock market is pricing things
that occur over long periods of time.

175
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,200
The present value formula is
pricing dividends into the future,

176
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:52,020
decades into the future?
Well actually to the infinite future,

177
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:54,580
but most of the weight is
on the next few decades.

178
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,720
So we can't evaluate the theory, right?
Just looking at 10 years of data,

179
00:11:58,721 --> 00:11:59,890
we've got to get a lot of data.

180
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,400
So what I did then and that paper is
I computed the actual present value of

181
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:10,651
subsequent dividends or each year and
that's on this tab and compared it with

182
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,440
the stock price. Okay.
So that's what I did.

183
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,480
This is an update of an arm of the
plot that I showed in my 1981 American

184
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:26,170
economic review paper. So the Blue
Line, because when I published it,

185
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:28,840
I was right here. It's amazing
how time goes by, right?

186
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,300
1979 I was right here.

187
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:36,700
We had just come off from a big
stock market dropped, but the um,

188
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,900
the, well it was the 70, uh,

189
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,800
73 75 drop and it was a
couple of years later.

190
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:46,660
So we were kind of
bumbling around down here.

191
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,190
We didn't have any idea whether
this was coming at that time, but,

192
00:12:51,191 --> 00:12:55,330
so what I did is I just for each year
I computed the present value of the

193
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:58,080
dividend. I have a dividend series
for every year. In fact, it's,

194
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,080
it's right over here. Um, I have two, uh,

195
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,750
this is the data. So, um,

196
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:15,220
I have the, this is the s and p
price index monthly back to 1871.

197
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,220
And here's the dividends they paid
per share every year since 1871.

198
00:13:21,851 --> 00:13:26,740
So I just, for each year I took
all subsequent dividends and I, um,

199
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:32,350
I um, price them out at uh, uh,

200
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:37,480
uh, the present value formula. And I use
a constant discount rate of 6% a year.

201
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,670
Uh, and so you see how we get
what the present value was.

202
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:47,770
I of course there's a problem is we
don't know dividends at the after 2007,

203
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:50,740
because we don't have data
on dividends pass them,

204
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,630
but I just made some assumption.

205
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,330
So the value at the end is
maybe a little bit arbitrary.

206
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:58,930
It could be dragged up or down if I made
a different assumption about dividends

207
00:13:58,931 --> 00:14:01,210
at the end,
but more or less,

208
00:14:01,211 --> 00:14:05,740
this is going to be what actually the
present value of dividends was over this

209
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:07,670
whole period.
And so,

210
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,210
so here's the dilemma and this
is what I said in 1981 article.

211
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,840
This is the thing that is
supposed to be forecasted, right?

212
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,580
That's the present value. And the Blue
Line is the forecast of that thing.

213
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,470
So then you ask,

214
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,840
does this look like a good forecast where
people doing a good job of forecasting

215
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,170
the red line with the Blue Line?
Uh,

216
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,010
now that may be a loaded
question. How about, uh,

217
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,120
I think that you get the impression that
there's something possibly wrong here

218
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:44,770
with efficient markets because the red
line is just a smooth growth path and

219
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:47,320
like nothing happens to it.
Uh,

220
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,920
and yet the stock market is going
up and down all over the place. Uh,

221
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,830
sorry. It's a little bit
like a, if you had a weather
forecaster. Alright. And, uh,

222
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,430
this morning he says,

223
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:02,750
I predict today that the low
today will be minus 100 degrees.

224
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,080
Okay.
And then two days later he said,

225
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:10,510
I predict that the load today
will be plus 150 degrees. Uh,

226
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,820
you would eventually start concluding
that this weather forecast or can't be

227
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:16,790
trusted because we never
get to those temperatures.

228
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,690
And that's sort of what the
stock market is doing. It's,

229
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:23,900
it's fluctuating much more than a thing
that's forecasted unless you gotta be

230
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:26,510
careful.
I ended up with so many critics,

231
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,770
there's a lot of issues here
that, uh, some people said, well,

232
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:34,830
but of course people don't know where
the red line was last period. Uh,

233
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,980
and other people said,
well,

234
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:42,310
you just are showing one reality
for the realization you're showing.

235
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:46,760
They kind of get back to
this parallel universe story.

236
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,750
There must be another universe where
there's another earth and where everything

237
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:55,520
looks the same except that the red line
did something very different. Okay.

238
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,180
And that could be, so people
are saying, you never know.

239
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:02,620
There could have been a communist
revolution in America, uh,

240
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:07,010
in the 1930s and they
could have nationalized the
whole stock market and then

241
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:10,370
the red line would be down at zero. Right.
They would have taken the whole thing,

242
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,730
uh, or there could've been
some good news, I dunno,

243
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,860
some great breakthrough that
we haven't discovered yet, but,

244
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,040
and another reality they could have.

245
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:22,490
And so all this noise in the stock
market could have somehow been new

246
00:16:22,491 --> 00:16:26,120
information about things
that didn't happen. Um,

247
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,120
and so, uh, well,

248
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:32,120
I mean I think we're getting kind of
philosophical when we'd go to that.

249
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:36,620
The point is that we've never seen
any movement in the present value of

250
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,050
dividends that would justify the movement.

251
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,020
And if we knew the future with
certainty according to this model,

252
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:46,430
then the stock market would behave like
the red line, not like the Blue Line.

253
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,710
So, um, uh,

254
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:54,410
well, anyway, I, for example,

255
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,160
let's look at the Great Depression of
the 1930 [inaudible] at least at the very

256
00:16:58,161 --> 00:16:58,461
least,

257
00:16:58,461 --> 00:17:03,110
I think this chart will show a reveal
some misconceptions that some people have.

258
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:08,460
The Great Depression of the
1930s was awful, right? I
mean, you hear these stories,

259
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,590
I assume you hear these stories.
We had 25% unemployment at the peak.

260
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,390
Uh, right. It sounds really bad. You
had people selling apples on the street.

261
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:20,510
You must know these images,
right? So it sounds awful.

262
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:23,540
But look what happened to Pete
Starr in the Great Depression.

263
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,670
I can't hardly see anything,

264
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:30,590
but what actually happened was businesses
continued paying their dividends right

265
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,700
through the whole depression and
some of them cut their dividends.

266
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,120
Uh, but it was only for
a few years, you know,

267
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:43,540
and so the present value of the value of
stock depends on what it pays out over

268
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:47,590
decades, not just next year. So the
stock market, if people knew the,

269
00:17:47,591 --> 00:17:49,980
that even if they knew
the depression was coming,

270
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,910
they shouldn't have marked down
in the stock market so much, uh,

271
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,660
according to the simple efficient market
story according to the present value

272
00:17:57,661 --> 00:17:59,790
story. So I, you know, it's very least,

273
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:04,770
I think that this diagram helps
you to see what, uh, what is,

274
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,490
what is wrong or what
simple theories are wrong.

275
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,210
And so it must be that if the stock
market is reacting to new information

276
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,760
overall,
this century of history,

277
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:19,100
it must have been new information about
things that just didn't happen. You know,

278
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:24,350
it could be that an asteroid almost
struck the earth and then it just missed.

279
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,590
And so, uh, the stock market
crashed and then when it missed,

280
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,370
it came back up again. Right. And so we
don't see any interruption in dividends,

281
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,060
but it has to be something
like that, uh, that, uh,

282
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,260
that the, the problem has. I
can't think of anything like that.

283
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,870
I don't think that any asteroid
came close to the earth,

284
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,150
not fast enough to be worried about.

285
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:49,680
And I can't think that the communist
revolution had much chance of taking place

286
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:54,550
in the United States. So, uh, but you
can imagine. And so we don't know, uh,

287
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:59,160
behavioral finance kind of tends to
reach the opposite conclusion that this

288
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:02,340
volatility in the stock market
is the sign of something else.

289
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,220
It's some social forces,
some speculative bubbles,

290
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:10,170
some activity that is not
related to anything fundamental.

291
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,460
And so the reason that I got so much
hostility when I wrote these papers is I

292
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:16,470
was,
I was striking a nerve,

293
00:19:16,471 --> 00:19:20,220
I guess because many people have developed
these beautiful mathematical theories

294
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:24,030
that said that the stock market was
the optimal predictor of everything.

295
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,450
And I was, uh, saying the
emperor has no clothes.

296
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:32,670
So there are others like the,
um, so what is happening?

297
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,700
You know what, I'm coming around to
think, maybe it's my cynical view.

298
00:19:35,701 --> 00:19:38,680
I've always been a cynic.
I don't know if you are cynics are now,

299
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,840
I think people convince
themselves of things. They, they,

300
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,940
people think they understand things
better than they are. And so, you know,

301
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,950
you spend your whole life looking at
this one picture of the stock market and

302
00:19:49,951 --> 00:19:53,370
you think you have an explanation
for all of it, all rational and good,

303
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,660
but you know, it's just overconfidence
that's doing that. It's an illusion. Uh,

304
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,890
so I wanted to talk about
over confidence. Uh, and uh,

305
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:06,450
I thought I'd try others. There's
also no eraser. I forgot to ask.

306
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:12,190
Uh, somebody is stealing things here. Um,

307
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,640
uh, can you find any racer for
meanwhile I can switch blackboards.

308
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:18,990
There's a little trick here.

309
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,750
It was probably just in this closet
or something. No, it's a lot.

310
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,303
Uh,

311
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,490
so I wanted to try an experiment of
asking you a series of a few short

312
00:20:35,491 --> 00:20:39,930
questions, uh, and uh,
it's a game we'll play,

313
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:42,910
which I'll need your
cooperation with. Uh, so, uh,

314
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,800
these are questions about over confidence.
Actually,

315
00:20:47,801 --> 00:20:48,634
I just want you to,

316
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,790
I want you to try to give me
a 90% confidence intervals
for the answers to these

317
00:20:56,621 --> 00:21:01,330
questions. Um, do you know what a
90% confidence interval? It's, uh,

318
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:05,210
it's, uh, for example,
if I were to ask you, uh,

319
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,750
uh, what, um, how, how many,
how many people are there,

320
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,950
uh, in new haven? And, uh,

321
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:16,420
I want you to not just give me a number,

322
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:20,830
I want you to give me a range such
that you're 90% sure that you're right.

323
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,600
All right? So I could say, well,

324
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:27,601
it's between a 90,000 and 100,000
people and I'm 90% sure I'm right.

325
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,810
So if you give me a true
90% confidence interval,

326
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:35,200
then you should be right 90% of the time,
right?

327
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,520
So what I'm going to do is
give you a few questions and,

328
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,210
and ask you for a [inaudible]
ask you to write down,

329
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,700
you have a piece of paper there
and 90% confidence interval. Okay?

330
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,730
And I have five questions. This
is just an experiment. All right?

331
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,860
Uh, the first one is about
the statue of Liberty.

332
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,933
Okay.

333
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:06,540
What does it weigh in?
Pounds. Okay. No, and in tons.

334
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,120
Okay. So I'm good. Thank you. Uh,

335
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,140
so wait,

336
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:22,680
uh, incident, just to remind you a
ton is a u s town is 2000 pounds,

337
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:26,930
not a British tonne, which
is 2000, 240 pounds. Uh,

338
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,060
and a ton is 907 kilograms.
Okay.

339
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:34,050
So what can you write down on your paper?

340
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,940
Your 90% confidence interval?
Alright, so for example,

341
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,520
I won't use realistic numbers
if you thought it was,

342
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:45,060
you might write down it's between
one pound and three pounds. Okay.

343
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,980
And that you're 90% sure it falls
in that interval. Um, and um,

344
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:54,420
I didn't say it. It's tons. Tons. I'm
asking you. It's more than a pound.

345
00:22:54,421 --> 00:22:58,020
I'll give you a hint. It's
in tons. And I want, now,

346
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,400
we also said we're not weighing the base.
The Statue of Liberty stands on a tall,

347
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,210
um, on a tall edifice.
We're not counting that,

348
00:23:06,211 --> 00:23:10,650
but we're counting also the
steel reinforcing that they
put in. A few years ago,

349
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,190
you remember the statue of Liberty was
getting weak and they were worried that

350
00:23:14,191 --> 00:23:17,160
something might topple down. So
they, they reinforced it on you.

351
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,540
We're counting that. So it's a
copper structure with um, uh,

352
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,740
steel reinforcement.

353
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,980
So can you write down on your notes
a range within which you're 90% sure.

354
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,160
Uh, that the statue ways. Okay.

355
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,760
In tons.

356
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,320
All right. If you could do that
and I'm going to come back,

357
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:42,230
what am I going to do is come back
and see how often you were right.

358
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,020
So we'll go back through this.
Have you all written down?

359
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,150
I wait for the Statue of Liberty.

360
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,830
Uh, okay. Population of the country.

361
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,203
Turkey.

362
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,080
Uh, but since I don't have
the current population,

363
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,960
I want it in the year 2000.

364
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:11,200
I didn't get the current latest estimate.

365
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:16,390
So how many people were there in Turkey?
In 2000.

366
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:20,680
Okay. And again, put down
a range. A low and a high.

367
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,150
90% sure.

368
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,713
MMM.

369
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,690
Sarah is Sahara desert.

370
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,990
How many square miles

371
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,380
in the Sahara desert? Okay. Uh,

372
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:46,210
and I remember that a square
mile is 2.6 square kilometer.

373
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:48,460
It was just in case you
think in terms of kilometers.

374
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:52,750
So you can devise your answer in
kilometers and then multiply by 2.6.

375
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,440
Um, you can write down a range. Okay.

376
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,190
Uh, enrollment. Yeah.

377
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,360
By the way, I should have asked, you
didn't have to be honest with it.

378
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,130
You could gain me by,

379
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,990
by writing really wide intervals for,
uh,

380
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,980
nine of the 10 questions and then an
extremely narrow interval for the 10th and

381
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,250
I'm expecting some sincerely
sincere cooperation here.

382
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,730
Then you would guarantee that you are
right. Exactly. 90% of the time. Right.

383
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,340
So I mean, you could say the Statue of
Liberty weighs between zero and a hundred

384
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,610
quintillion tons and you
know, you're right. Right.

385
00:25:35,611 --> 00:25:39,750
And then you could deliberately say the
population of Turkey is one between one

386
00:25:39,751 --> 00:25:42,140
and two people and then you know,
you're wrong and you could do it.

387
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:44,840
You're not supposed to do that. Okay. Uh,

388
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:48,840
so then I want the enrollment in Yale
and I don't have the latest number.

389
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,090
2005.
Okay.

390
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:56,091
That's the total number of students
at Yale University in 2005,

391
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,450
including Yale College. And
all the graduate schools. Okay.

392
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,230
Uh, and then the sixth, fifth question,

393
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,310
it's about the Pulitzer Prize.

394
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,630
You know this prize,

395
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,790
it's a prize that journalist win
for writing great articles or books.

396
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,980
I want to know what is that?

397
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:26,270
How much do you get in cash if you
win the Pulitzer Prize? All right.

398
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,000
And I have it for last year,

399
00:26:29,001 --> 00:26:32,390
2007 it might be different in 2008.

400
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:35,750
So I'm asking for the 2007 in dollars,

401
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:41,440
okay. In dollars. Okay.

402
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,020
I hope you were feeling confidence
intervals if you've gotten them.

403
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:51,480
Now what I'm going to do, uh, and if
you've answered all five questions,

404
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,540
I'm going to tell you the answers,

405
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:59,820
the correct answer and then ask
for a show of hands of how many,

406
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:02,410
if you please be honest
and don't be embarrassed.

407
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:05,630
Raise your hand if uh,

408
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,920
if you were right men.

409
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:12,970
Meaning that if my answer falls
within your 90% confidence interval,

410
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,980
okay? So, okay, let's go
to the Statue of Liberty.

411
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,990
The Statue of Liberty weighs 252 tons.

412
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,080
Okay.
So can I have a show of hands?

413
00:27:25,081 --> 00:27:29,460
How many people here had
it has 252 in the interval.

414
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,470
Okay. Okay. You're doing fairly well.
What fraction? Keep your hands up.

415
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:37,620
It looks like it's about,
uh, what, what would you say?

416
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:42,621
Like 20% and 25 so I thank you for
being honest and not gaming me.

417
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:50,790
It should have been 90%
right? Who were right. Okay.

418
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:54,780
What does the 2000 population of Turkey,
uh,

419
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:59,700
I'll give you the exact number, uh,
that I got from their statistic.

420
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,730
65 million.

421
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:07,860
666,677.
Okay,

422
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,100
so that's a little over 65 million.

423
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:16,380
So how many people have that
in their interval? Okay,

424
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:20,910
that's better. It's like 40%.
50, 40 or 50. You're doing,

425
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,490
you're doing better,
but it's still not 90.

426
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,710
How many square miles in the
Sahara desert? 3.5 million.

427
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:34,050
Okay. Can I get a show of hands?
How many were right on that? Well,

428
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,130
this one really got you.

429
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,950
There was like 5% right then.

430
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,620
You right on all of them so far.
Um,

431
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,060
enrollment in Yale fall 2005,

432
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:53,040
11,483 students. Okay.
How many were right? Uh,

433
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:58,310
okay, that's about a 40. It might
cost to fit 40, 40%. I said,

434
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,860
and finally, how much do you win? If you,

435
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:06,270
how much do you receive if you
win the Pulitzer Prize? $10,000.

436
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:11,220
Can I have a show of hands? That
was it. Okay. That was really low.

437
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:14,880
That's like 5%. I knew that was a trick.
If you've heard about the Nobel prize,

438
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,110
because those are both prestigious,
right?

439
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,290
Nobel prize gives you something on the
order of $1 million and the pilots are

440
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:26,100
prize gives you something like you only
gives you $10,000. How can that be? Uh,

441
00:29:26,101 --> 00:29:29,070
so I sort of picked something
that I thought you might be wrong.

442
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,730
This is what that reveal something
about human behavior. You know,

443
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,180
it's a choice in life.
You go into different walks of life.

444
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,460
This is something that is
fundamental to economic.

445
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:42,010
There's just different expectations
of how much money you're gonna make.

446
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:46,870
And if you go into the news media,
and I think that's a wonderful career,

447
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,840
but you're not going to
make much money profitably.

448
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,340
And the whole thing is just scaled
down. Uh, and I think this, uh,

449
00:29:55,060 --> 00:30:00,060
there's something revealing about this
that we just have social norms for how

450
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:01,300
much someone is to be paid.

451
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:05,590
So if you were to give Stephen
Schwarzman at $10,000 prize,

452
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,220
it would be more like an
insult or anything. Uh,

453
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,710
but if you are working for the new haven
register and you get this prize, it's,

454
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:17,520
it's a life changing event,
not because of the 10,000.

455
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:21,820
Maybe even they get more money than that.
But anyway,

456
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:26,710
the point was that, uh, people tend to
be overconfident. Uh, and incidentally,

457
00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:31,270
it's not just males. Females are
well known to be overconfident too.

458
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:34,890
So there is this thing about macho males,
Norco,

459
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,640
but experiments prove that women
have the same problem. And so,

460
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,140
um, so that's why I think that when
we look at charts of the stock market,

461
00:30:44,141 --> 00:30:48,100
we see things that we think we understand,
especially young people.

462
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,660
They get diluted into thinking. They
understand, uh, more than they really do.

463
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:58,020
So, uh, I wanted to talk about,
um, uh, some authors that, uh,

464
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,010
uh,
I admire who

465
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:05,640
written about this. Um, and, uh,

466
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,170
these are books that I don't have on the
reading list, but they're fun to read

467
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,500
is a professor at the Harvard
Business School of rock, cash corona.

468
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,710
Uh, he has a book, uh,

469
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,430
on a search for charismatic CEOs.

470
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,130
That is companies, uh, it's not
just overconfidence in your cell.

471
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,780
We tend to also to put overconfidence
in leaders. And so we have the,

472
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:45,610
uh, this is an a at the end we have a
sense that some people are just natural

473
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:50,200
geniuses and know everything.
And so we, we, we, we, uh,

474
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:54,220
we think that they can transform
our lives or our companies.

475
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:59,410
And so our boards of directors
are constantly looking
for a CEO who is a genius

476
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,340
and it keeps getting fooled and this
disappointed they bring some money.

477
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:08,260
And this person often messes things
up more than helps because this person

478
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:11,710
realizes he or she has to
live up to this genius role.

479
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,550
So they better do something.
So they do something in a flailing way,

480
00:32:15,551 --> 00:32:20,080
not understanding what they're doing and
they mess up the whole company. Really.

481
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:25,330
A lot of what happens in good things that
happen in human society are the result

482
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:28,900
of lots of people doing their own
special things and all working together.

483
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,380
And there's no great genius a underneath.

484
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:36,840
But there's this idea in our
mind that one, we are, uh,

485
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,560
we're going to be such a thing. Um, um,

486
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:44,770
related to that I want to dimension
and it's on the reading list. Um,

487
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,250
and article by, um,
one of my students, uh,

488
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:53,810
in this class who is now at Mit,
he took this class,

489
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,980
uh,
about 10 years ago.

490
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:03,560
How far the cannon, uh, and
coauthor with another MIT professor,

491
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:09,310
uh, gender, uh, and the
guests looking at, uh,

492
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,020
over confidence in our judgements.
Again, they look at Ceos,

493
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:19,160
chief executive officers of
companies, and they found that, um,

494
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,740
companies, uh, the,

495
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:26,670
in industries that fail tend
to fire their CEOs. This is an,

496
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,850
this is unjust.
This is an overreaction.

497
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:32,960
You bring in a CEO who was
supposed to be brilliant, okay.

498
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:37,740
And then the business fails. So you
fire the guy right after that. So it,

499
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:41,130
you know, we're kind of manic
depressive about these guys when,

500
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:43,970
when the business fails,
we think we were such a mistake.

501
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:47,330
This guy had such promise and it just
didn't live up so we get rid of them.

502
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,840
But in fact they found that the CEO gets
fired even if the whole industry went

503
00:33:53,841 --> 00:33:58,670
down. So I mean, you can't blame
the CEO for the fact, you know,

504
00:33:58,671 --> 00:34:02,840
if you're one company in an industry and
the whole industry goes down, uh, or the,

505
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,620
the remaining industry even not including
that for, it's not the CEOs fault.

506
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,460
So we tend to be kind of wild
and extreme in our judgments.

507
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:11,601
You've seen that a lot.

508
00:34:11,601 --> 00:34:15,620
A lot of CEOs lost their jobs
recently in the subprime crisis. Uh,

509
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,970
was it their fault? Probably not.
You know, but they get fired anyway.

510
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:23,720
Uh, so we go through this
manic depressive, uh,

511
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,600
we try to hire charismatic CEOs,

512
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:30,320
then we get disappointed and we
keep going through musical chairs,

513
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:34,940
a one after another. Um, and then, uh,

514
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:40,490
Nassim Taleb,
uh,

515
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,250
lives here in Connecticut
and I know him well.

516
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:48,830
He has a book called fooled by randomness,
which was a best seller.

517
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:55,310
Uh, and it's very fun
to read. It's a story.

518
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:57,400
He's a Wall Street. He had a, um,

519
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,600
an investment management firm, uh,
and he observed a lot of people,

520
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,410
and it's a book about how
people, uh, over interpreted,

521
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,480
they tend to blame themselves for
failures and congratulate themselves for

522
00:35:11,481 --> 00:35:15,050
success is too much. And they don't
realize that it's just random.

523
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,790
So some guy who's in a business,
what the business is succeeding,

524
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:20,870
why is it succeeding?

525
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,650
Because the guy came in dumb luck
at the right time and everything is,

526
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:29,610
is supporting. That concludes
that he's a genius. Uh,

527
00:35:29,611 --> 00:35:34,340
and then, uh, Taleb observes
them later after, after, uh,

528
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:40,290
things don't go so well and then suddenly
they're, uh, they are depressed. And,

529
00:35:40,291 --> 00:35:43,150
uh, uh, you know, I talked to, uh,

530
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,760
a stockbroker's before and after the 87
stock market crash and one of them told

531
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:50,610
me,
or maybe more than one of them told me,

532
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,930
I can tell that the crash occurred from
the tone of Voice of the people when

533
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:55,920
they call up the phone.

534
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,060
So when the market was soaring
just before the 87 peak,

535
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:03,330
he said they would call up and
they were brash and rude to me,

536
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:06,040
and they would say, let's
trade this, get this done.

537
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:10,950
Kind of a dis disparaging slit.
Suddenly the, uh, the stockbroker,

538
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,490
and then after the crash,
when these people were sort
of, many of them wiped out,

539
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:16,950
they'd answered the
phone in a sheepish way.

540
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,710
You can just tell in the tone of
their voice that they were crushed.

541
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:25,060
And so that's what happens.
I also have down on the, um,

542
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,440
on this part of the reading
list, Irving Fisher, uh,

543
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:35,260
who was a professor at Yale, uh, who, uh,

544
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,500
was a very prominent economist
in the first half of the century.

545
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,420
He, another year I'll graduate.
Yeah. A class of 1895. I think he,

546
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:49,870
I'm sure he lectured on this stage because
this building was with his office was

547
00:36:49,871 --> 00:36:54,150
in this building, I believe.
Uh, he died around mid 1940s,

548
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,230
but he's famous for overconfidence,
uh,

549
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:01,410
in 1929,
he was interviewed just before,

550
00:37:01,411 --> 00:37:05,490
two weeks before the 1929 peak.
And do you know what I'm referring to?

551
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:10,590
Uh, he said he thought the stock market
was on a permanently high plateau.

552
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:15,610
Uh, and he wrote a book
in 1929. I actually,

553
00:37:15,611 --> 00:37:17,700
it came out in 1930 about the,

554
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:22,890
with this extremely optimistic
outlook for the market. Uh, and,

555
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,280
uh, he had a beautiful mansion.
He was a wealthy man for a while,

556
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,490
but he lost everything in the stock
market crash. In fact, he had this,

557
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,620
he had borrowed against his
home and he lost his house. Uh,

558
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:38,820
and so Yale University bought his
house for him and rented it out to him,

559
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:43,380
otherwise he would be on the
street. Um, so, uh, so I have him,

560
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:48,300
I have an article written by him
in 19, uh, 30, I think it's 1930,

561
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,720
or at the end of 29 discussing
the stock market trash.

562
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,850
And he still is unrepentant and this
was our most brilliant professor here at

563
00:37:56,851 --> 00:38:00,430
Yale, but he just totally
misjudged the market. Uh,

564
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,420
so he's just totally unrepentant.
He just went back over his book.

565
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,350
There's so many good reasons.
the 20s where a spectacular era.

566
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,000
It's so many good reasons to stock
market will keep going up and he just

567
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:13,860
wouldn't back down.
In fact,

568
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:16,380
what he actually did is he started
borrowing from his relatives.

569
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:20,670
He had wealthy relatives
and he lost all of it. Um,

570
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,960
you just couldn't have imagined
that the stock market would go down.

571
00:38:23,961 --> 00:38:28,260
It was just no reason that he could
think of it as that's what he says in the

572
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:31,230
article. So anyway, um,

573
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:36,760
I wanted to talk more precisely
about, um, how people behave.

574
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:41,110
This is all general about overconfidence,
but there are some other factors that,

575
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,380
uh, I want to, uh,

576
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,020
start with and that the most,

577
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:52,290
the most important theory in
behavioral finance is the,

578
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,913
um,

579
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:58,840
Kahneman and Tversky prospect theory.

580
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,500
So Danny Conoman,

581
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:08,670
who is now I professor of psychology
at Princeton and Amos Tversky,

582
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:15,100
uh, who, uh, is a died a few years ago.

583
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:20,010
They wrote the, I think the
most famous article on, um,

584
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:25,090
uh, on behavioral economics.
Uh, it goes beyond just finance.

585
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,690
Uh, and the title of the
article was prospect theory.

586
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:39,220
Okay. And that was 1979. Uh,
this is, I think the most,

587
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:43,300
actually I think there is a
ranking of economics articles,

588
00:39:43,301 --> 00:39:45,910
scholarly articles by
numbers of quotations.

589
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:50,920
And this was number two out of all
articles written in the last 50 years. Um,

590
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,610
number one, I was quoted
for some other reason. I,

591
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,820
I'm not sure it was some statistical
method that everyone quoted,

592
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,040
but in terms of an
intellectual contribution,

593
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:04,660
this is the most important economics
article in the last 50 years,

594
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:08,560
at least judge by how
many times it's cited. Uh,

595
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,250
and so common and diversity are not
really talking about overconfidence,

596
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,210
but something about perhaps related to it,
something more general.

597
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:18,940
It's how people make choices.

598
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:21,670
And there's two elements to this theory.

599
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,210
It's a re it replaces expected utility.

600
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,103
Okay.

601
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:38,600
Uh, and it, uh, it has, uh,

602
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:42,560
when it does that replaces the
utility function with a value function

603
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:54,850
with value function and it
replaces the probabilities

604
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,390
with what they call wait.

605
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,970
So I'm going to explain what that
is and we'll move on. But, um,

606
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,240
let me give it a little story
that leads up to it. Uh,

607
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:18,350
and it's the story that Paul Samuelson
is a professor at Mit to all Paul

608
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:24,740
Samuelson, uh, highly esteemed ps.

609
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,350
I think he's 92 or 90,

610
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:32,680
about 92 years old now and still
writing, still working. Uh,

611
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,590
he was a math, he is a mathematical
economist, retired now,

612
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:41,591
but he told the story that illustrates
some of the beginnings of prospect.

613
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,300
In fact,
he kind of anticipated prospect theory.

614
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,010
This goes back to an article
that he wrote, uh, in 1963.

615
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,380
So, uh, in 1963,

616
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,040
he was having lunch with one of
his colleagues, another economist.

617
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,890
He doesn't name this other person
because it would be embarrassing,

618
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:05,030
but everyone knows it.
Was He Carrie brown professor at Mit.

619
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:08,330
And so Samuelson, uh, in a playful mood,

620
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:12,950
he was orange was sort of a playful
person. He said, I'm at lunch.

621
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:17,750
He said, hey, let's toss a coin. Let's
make a bet just for the fun of it. Okay.

622
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,550
And if it comes up, heads are
give you $200, but if it comes up,

623
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:27,110
tails you give me $100. And he
said, let's do it. I'm ready.

624
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,280
Okay. And this can I took
he Carrie brown by surprise.

625
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,910
That's that. That sounds like a lot
of mine. Especially in 1963. Right?

626
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,620
The prices were much
lower. That's like, uh, uh,

627
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,090
what was like $1,000 in 2000 something.
It was big money,

628
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:45,860
but of course these professors could
afford it. Uh, it's not that much money.

629
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,620
So let's just say it's 102 hundred.
Right. Do you feel like taking,

630
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,320
if I were to offer that to you right now,

631
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:54,540
let's do it because you
don't have cash on you now,

632
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,980
but you'd have to promise to pay
me if it came out wrong. All right.

633
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:02,960
Do you feel like doing that? If someone
is telling you, answering me honestly,

634
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:08,570
uh, interest back and think
about it. Well, this is suddenly
thrust on you. Um, yeah.

635
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:12,470
So Eat Carrie Brown said, oh, come on. I
don't, you know, I don't want to do this.

636
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,410
Sanderson was being annoying,
right?

637
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:20,690
Then Samuelson thought it had another
idea. He said, what if I offered,

638
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,760
he didn't actually offer this.
What if I offered to,

639
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,710
let's do this a hundred times.

640
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:29,240
We'll toss a coin a hundred times
and each time it comes up heads,

641
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:34,370
I give you $200 and each time it comes
up, tails you give me a $100 well, he,

642
00:43:34,371 --> 00:43:38,630
Carrie Brown, knowing mathematics of
statistics and the law of probabilities,

643
00:43:38,631 --> 00:43:43,460
he said, well, if we do it a hundred
times by the binomial Theorem,

644
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,720
I'm sure to when I couldn't pass it,
this is the elementary a hundred times.

645
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:52,070
A lot of times, in fact, I'll make
thousands of dollars. And so he,

646
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:55,970
Carrie von said, I'll do it. I would
do it. They didn't actually do it.

647
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:01,010
And Samuelson then said he went back to
his office and he wrote a paper that's

648
00:44:01,011 --> 00:44:05,540
this 1963 paper proving that
he carry wrong was irrational.

649
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:10,400
You cannot possibly say,
I will take a hundred of them,

650
00:44:10,401 --> 00:44:13,810
but I won't take one of them.
That's not rational. Uh,

651
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,630
and so that was one of the motivating
things in Kahneman and Tversky.

652
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:21,530
So what kind of an intro,
first Persky said is that people behave.

653
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:25,970
If you could introspect and imagine why
some of you didn't feel like taking this.

654
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,920
Beth people behave as if they,
they have a kink in their,

655
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:33,510
this may sound abstract way of putting it,

656
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:38,100
but I expected utility theory.
Uh,

657
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:41,100
the traditional theory says that everybody

658
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:47,870
has a utility function that
they consistently refer to
when making calculations.

659
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,660
So I'm going to put the
condom and diversity over
here and I'm going to put, um,

660
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:57,150
expected utility theory over here.

661
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:06,870
And so expected utility theory
says that I want wealth.

662
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:12,060
I called w wealth and I
get utility from wealth.

663
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:17,010
That's you and my utility curve.
And it has maybe any number of shapes,

664
00:45:17,011 --> 00:45:19,830
but it's concave downward and smooth.

665
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:24,600
So you have what's called
diminishing marginal utility.

666
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,070
That's expected utility theory.

667
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:40,350
So what expected utility theory means
that the slope is always decreased.

668
00:45:40,351 --> 00:45:43,910
Every extra dollar a wealth gives
me less happiness. Uh, but it's,

669
00:45:43,911 --> 00:45:46,440
it always gives me a little bit more.
So I always want more,

670
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:50,820
but expected utility theory would
say that that's a two for one. Beth,

671
00:45:50,821 --> 00:45:55,260
let's say Amazon is offering, uh, and
it's small compared to my lifetime. Well,

672
00:45:55,261 --> 00:46:00,261
so my utilities essentially linear over
the relevant range plus or minus plus

673
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:04,050
200 and minus 100. And so, um,

674
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:08,880
and so I don't, uh, I don't
really concern myself about risk.

675
00:46:08,881 --> 00:46:12,410
I should just take every bet
like that all the time. Uh,

676
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,660
and so you should always be looking,
if you, if you are behaving this way,

677
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:19,590
you should always be looking. Anyone
who works in make a bet with me anytime,

678
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:23,250
I'll always take it if
it's in my advantage even a
little bit in my advantage.

679
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:28,580
Um, now people seem to like to gamble,
but they don't like to do it consistently.

680
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:32,220
They like to go to the,
they ended up going to gambling casinos,

681
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:35,970
whether it's stacked against them, that
for them, but it somehow as a range,

682
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:39,390
as an infant, as a entertainment. Well,

683
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:41,830
Carmen and first he said that,
uh,

684
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:48,710
people don't behave this way and it's
as if they have a value function as a

685
00:46:50,401 --> 00:46:53,990
function of their money. And, uh,

686
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,570
let's put in the middle of the
value from the reference point.

687
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,970
I can't write down that route.

688
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:04,590
Reference Point means where
you are today and your value,

689
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:06,840
that's V,
which is like utility,

690
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,920
but now we're talking in psychological
terms and so we give it a different name.

691
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,760
The value function has a,
uh,

692
00:47:13,830 --> 00:47:18,390
a kink is something like
that at the reference point.

693
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:23,430
So, and then I'm trying to
draw it. It's not necessarily,

694
00:47:23,431 --> 00:47:25,890
I have it mixed.
It looks here like two straight lines.

695
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:31,300
And that's not quite the way they do it.
Let me try and do this again. Um, it's,

696
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:36,220
it's curve downward a little bit,
but it becomes much less.

697
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,400
I don't want her, I'm having trouble
drawing this on the board. Well,

698
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,650
I don't want to ever
current keep wind down it.

699
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:46,570
If there's a kink here where the slope,

700
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:50,860
I think I've got it sort of there.
It's concave down everywhere.

701
00:47:50,861 --> 00:47:52,510
It just like the utility function is,

702
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,050
but there's a discontinuity
of slope right here.

703
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:02,860
And where is that? That's where I
am now. And so what it means is,

704
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:08,010
is that I value loss as much more
than I value gains from wherever I am.

705
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,100
There's a big difference between
losing and winning. So when I,

706
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:15,910
when I reflect on this bed,
I'm thinking of I could lose $100,

707
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:19,960
and that scares me. It feels bad.
The idea that I would, I would,

708
00:48:19,961 --> 00:48:22,090
I would just feel bad.
Um,

709
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,060
and so gaining $200 is positive for me,

710
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:27,910
but it doesn't offset the
loss that I might make.

711
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,780
So if I have equal
probabilities, uh, what,

712
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:35,781
what do you want to do is wait [inaudible]
the gains and losses and the losses

713
00:48:36,311 --> 00:48:38,320
tend to dominate.
So you don't want to take the bet.

714
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:44,020
So the weighting function in incorporates
the Samuelson's lunch colleague

715
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,770
problem,
uh,

716
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:49,600
that people don't want to
take that to their advantage.

717
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,430
And it goes back to a kink in
the utility fund. Now incident,

718
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:57,160
this is fundamentally different
from in economic theory.

719
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:00,520
Economists would say, well, you can
put a kink in the utility function.

720
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:04,990
There could be some wealth level that
specialty you. But if theory economists,

721
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:09,670
that kink has to stay at a certain
wealth level with Carmen and diversity,

722
00:49:09,671 --> 00:49:13,210
this kink moves around with you.
And so whatever, it's whatever,

723
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:17,980
you're always at the kink. So, uh,
because it's, it's not rational.

724
00:49:17,981 --> 00:49:20,650
This is not rational expected
utility theory. This is,

725
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:26,110
I'm always looking at where I am now and
exaggerating in my mind the importance

726
00:49:26,111 --> 00:49:31,060
of deviations from that. So people
are very concerned with small losses,

727
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:34,860
uh, and that that's what the
kink in the value function.

728
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,060
Now I want to talk to them about
another [inaudible] and diversity,

729
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:44,140
uh, saying the called
the waiting function. Uh,

730
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:48,260
so the weighting function,
uh,

731
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:55,030
it refers to the fact that people
distort probabilities in their mind.

732
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,770
And what
did

733
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:06,093
it,

734
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,630
it's not that they don't
know what probabilities,

735
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:11,120
but they distort them in their thinking.

736
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:19,580
So I'll give an example that illustrates
the continent risky waiting function

737
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:24,670
and it goes back years before
kind of an [inaudible]. Uh,

738
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,410
it's a famous example from
French economist Maurice La,

739
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:37,660
and it's called the La Paradox.
Uh,

740
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,600
and it illustrates,
uh,

741
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,330
thinking that violates expected
utility theory. So, uh,

742
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:46,431
I,
uh,

743
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:50,500
I'm going to give you a choice between
two prospects as kind of into risky call

744
00:50:50,501 --> 00:50:51,334
them.

745
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:55,820
Suppose I offered you a 25% chance,

746
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,950
uh, to, to win

747
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:02,810
$3,000

748
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:12,500
or uh,
uh,

749
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:18,200
alternatively
a 20% chance

750
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,880
to win $4,000.

751
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:32,150
Okay.
Maybe I can get your show of hands.

752
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:35,960
All right. This is like saying listen,
lunch Kali again, but a little different.

753
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:38,740
I suppose I'm offering
and not offering this,

754
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:43,520
but suppose I have heard that you have a
choice between prospect one or prospect

755
00:51:43,521 --> 00:51:45,500
to prospect one.

756
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:51,040
I'm going to toss a foresighted corn
and if it comes up with a probability of

757
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:52,790
one fourth in a certain way,

758
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,650
you will win $3,000 and prospect to,
uh,

759
00:51:57,651 --> 00:52:02,030
I'm going to give you a
chance of 20% to win $4,000.

760
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,900
Can you tell me which of these you pick?
If you had to pick only one of these,

761
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:09,410
did you understand the question?
Okay.

762
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:12,440
How many would pick a number one?

763
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:18,830
Okay. It seems like it's about 20%.
How many would pick number two?

764
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:22,680
So most of you would pick number two.
Uh,

765
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:26,150
but then let's do a variation
on this question here.

766
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:30,650
It's a very simple variation.
Um, which would you prefer?

767
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:36,200
So this is one that you
picked most people pay. Okay.

768
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:37,910
Another prospect,

769
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:42,020
100% chance of winning

770
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:49,610
3000 or two uh,

771
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,830
that would be an 80% chance

772
00:52:54,830 --> 00:52:58,310
of winning $4,000.

773
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,650
Okay. Did you see that? Okay.
If you pick prospect one,

774
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:11,240
you're going to just get $3,000 for sure.
If you big prospect to you,

775
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:15,740
you'll probably get 4,000 but at 80%
chance of it. How many would pick one?

776
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:17,091
Okay.

777
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:22,091
That looks like how many would pick two
or very few or even take two and every

778
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:27,870
so, so we take one this time. So now
you might want to reflect on that.

779
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,130
Why was it such a
different, uh, well, why,

780
00:53:31,131 --> 00:53:33,810
why did you pick one in this
case and pick two in this case?

781
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:38,610
The thing I wanted to point out is that
the number that the cash amounts are the

782
00:53:38,611 --> 00:53:43,500
same and the two examples, but the
probabilities are just multiplied by four,

783
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:44,843
right?

784
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:50,250
So the expected utility of the
two is just four times as great.

785
00:53:51,110 --> 00:53:53,730
No matter what problem they were.
Yeah.

786
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:59,520
So they're the same. The utilities
are the same with the same numbers.

787
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:04,590
All I've done is multiply your
expected utility by four in this case.

788
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:10,100
So you can't make a different choice if
you pick too in over here when comparing

789
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:12,720
these two prospects,

790
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:17,340
you should also have picked two
when you compare these two prospect.

791
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,970
So why didn't you write
most of you switched? Uh,

792
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:25,800
can you tell me why?
Yes.

793
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:39,360
You would choose not to gamble.
Does this mean it's like a moral judgment?

794
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:46,040
Okay. You got it. Exactly. That's,
yeah. You got, you prefer certainty.

795
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,930
There's some anxiety about
maybe about, uh, about,

796
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,990
uh, you, you got it. Exactly right.

797
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:58,340
I think people like certainty,
uh, and, and ambiguity,

798
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:03,410
uh, is, uh, is difficult
for them to adjust to. So,

799
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:04,000
um,

800
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,540
but [inaudible] put it in this following
way that it's a little bit like we're

801
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:09,410
cavemen,
you know,

802
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:14,330
then it turns out we've all taught
to count and to do arithmetic,

803
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:18,050
but primitive people actually
have difficulty counting.

804
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:23,210
And there's an old story that cave had
only three numbers. One, two, and many.

805
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:26,720
Uh, I used to disbelieve this
story, but I've not actually,

806
00:55:26,721 --> 00:55:31,460
it was a psychologist at Princeton told
me that as a matter of fact is proven

807
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:36,320
that there are some people whose languages
have only those numbers. One, two,

808
00:55:36,321 --> 00:55:40,510
and many. Uh, and, uh, for example, the,

809
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,730
they're called in, um, Laos and Thailand.

810
00:55:43,731 --> 00:55:47,750
There's a very primitive group of people
with primitive technology. I mean,

811
00:55:47,751 --> 00:55:51,470
if they're primitive people, but
they only have one, two, and many.

812
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:56,330
And there's others have been discovered.
Uh, so emotionally were like that.

813
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,450
I used to wonder how could, how could
they have only those numbers? One, two,

814
00:55:59,451 --> 00:56:03,290
and many. Like, could you ask her
mother, how many children do you have?

815
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:06,620
And she couldn't answer.
She didn't have a word three.

816
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,020
But it's a matter of fact they didn't.

817
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:12,860
And so I guess if you asked the
mother how many children you have,

818
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:17,150
she would probably just name them, right?
She couldn't say, I have three children.

819
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:22,130
Um, but anyway, we are all kind of like
that. When we think about probabilities,

820
00:56:22,131 --> 00:56:22,731
that's condiment.

821
00:56:22,731 --> 00:56:27,731
And so at carbon and diversity say that
we do is that in our minds we weight the

822
00:56:28,961 --> 00:56:33,370
probabilities in a distorted way.
And this is the waiting function.

823
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,460
So we have the wait,
let's wait.

824
00:56:36,461 --> 00:56:39,880
Not Wealth here against the probability.

825
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,160
I'm going to exaggerate a little bit.

826
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:47,970
This is zero and this is one whose
probabilities range from zero to one.

827
00:56:49,630 --> 00:56:51,400
The whaling function looks like this,

828
00:56:51,401 --> 00:56:53,290
I'm exaggerating a little
bit so you can see, but,

829
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:58,210
and then it jumps up or jumps down here.

830
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:04,950
This is the idea what kind of an first
he said in their original 79 article is

831
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:07,210
that we act as he goes.

832
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:12,520
There's a wide range of probabilities
here that are all kind of blurred and put

833
00:57:12,521 --> 00:57:14,810
together. So, uh, we, we,

834
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:18,520
we minimize emotionally the
difference between probabilities.

835
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:22,030
They're all kind of in the middle.
So when I said 20 or 25,

836
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:25,450
in your mind you said,
here's 20 and here's 25.

837
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,300
But I don't think they're much different.
To me emotionally,

838
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,960
the money sounds different, but they've
set probabilities sounds the same.

839
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:36,520
So it's like I have only three
probabilities can't happen.

840
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,850
Might happen. And it's
certain to happen. Okay.

841
00:57:39,851 --> 00:57:43,690
And so you tend to be pulled into these
certainty story that you give them much

842
00:57:43,691 --> 00:57:44,524
more weight.

843
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:50,040
So the weight of what people do then and
summing up and expected utility theory.

844
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,360
In expected utility theory,

845
00:57:55,630 --> 00:58:00,630
you maximize the probability
weighted sum of utilities

846
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,680
expected utility,

847
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:15,170
you maximize summation of
the probability of the,

848
00:58:15,851 --> 00:58:19,120
I thought come times the
utility in the outcome.

849
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:22,390
But in prospect theory,

850
00:58:27,910 --> 00:58:31,630
you maximize the, the,

851
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:36,520
some of the wait times the value function,

852
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:39,430
the values. Okay. And that's,

853
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:42,070
that's this is the condiment and risky,

854
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:48,850
a variation on expected utility theory.
So,

855
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,053
uh,

856
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:55,120
there's something related to it that
psychologist talk about how regret theory,

857
00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:01,670
but it's, it's a little bit different,
but it's essentially the same as uh, uh,

858
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:05,060
it's consistent with a prospect theory.
Uh,

859
00:59:05,070 --> 00:59:09,310
and that is that people are experienced
pain of regret and they do a lot of

860
00:59:09,311 --> 00:59:12,730
things to try to avoid, uh, the
pain of regret. For example,

861
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:17,310
when the stock price stock
market goes up, uh, they, uh,

862
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:20,830
they tried to sell it and lock in the
game because they, they, they, they're,

863
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:24,560
they were worried that if it goes down
again, I will regret not having sold it.

864
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:28,070
And so that's not a rational calculation.
Uh,

865
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:30,140
if you come to some [inaudible]
coming to something that you,

866
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:33,050
you just have it and that escapes you,
you feel pain.

867
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,690
I guess that's what happened at
the Superbowl last night, right?

868
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:41,060
When the New England patriots had a
winning streak and they messed up at the

869
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:45,350
very end. That's exceptionally painful.
Uh, and that's part of regret theory.

870
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,940
I know how pain any of you are. Right?
It must've been painful to them. Anyway.

871
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,410
Uh, so, uh, um,

872
00:59:56,330 --> 01:00:01,010
so I just mentioned some other things
that are related to prospect theory.

873
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:05,150
Uh, there's something
called mental compartments

874
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:10,040
that, uh, people, uh,

875
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:20,490
expected utility theory says your utility
depends on your whole lifetime wealth.

876
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:23,680
And so you should be always walked,

877
01:00:23,681 --> 01:00:28,180
always thinking that everything happens
today is just part of a bigger story.

878
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:32,920
And I'm always thinking about my
lifetime and, and you know, I,

879
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:35,860
I had to do an exercise at the beginning
where I asked you to estimate the

880
01:00:35,861 --> 01:00:38,140
present value of your lifetime income.

881
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:41,140
And it probably came out
to several million dollars.

882
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:44,230
And so if you were behaving rationally,

883
01:00:44,770 --> 01:00:47,410
you would always be weighing
things against that big,

884
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:51,850
some of several million dollars.
That's why plus $100 plus minus 200,

885
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,880
who cares, right? That's the way
you should be thinking, right?

886
01:00:55,450 --> 01:00:58,330
You don't think that way because
it's because you are human.

887
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,540
And so people put things
in mental compartments,

888
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:06,500
all different compartments in your mind
and you have separate values for thing

889
01:01:06,550 --> 01:01:10,750
depending on which compartment
area. So for example, uh,

890
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:12,490
when you go to the gambling casino,

891
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:14,920
the winnings and losses
are completely different.

892
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,110
You just put them into a game
compartment and you think,

893
01:01:17,260 --> 01:01:21,610
I can accept these and it doesn't matter.
Investors are that way too.

894
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:25,180
They sometimes put part of their
portfolio and I can play with this,

895
01:01:25,270 --> 01:01:29,140
a mental compartment and others
in another mental compartment.

896
01:01:30,130 --> 01:01:34,930
Um, so, uh, anyway, I just
wanted to come back and,

897
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:40,120
uh, I have, uh, maybe a little
bit more to say about this,

898
01:01:40,121 --> 01:01:42,820
but let me come back
and talk just about the,

899
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:47,630
the problems that we talked about last
period. Um, problem set number three.

900
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,540
You've got your second problem set here.

901
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:53,740
Problem set number three is a
stock market forecasting exercise.

902
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:59,050
And the spreadsheet that I have up here
is one spreadsheet that you could use

903
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:01,490
to, uh, to do that. And
it's illustrated, I,

904
01:02:01,491 --> 01:02:04,180
I clarified it a little bit
in the version I put up.

905
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:09,190
So you run a regression like that,
uh, to predict the stock market.

906
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:09,910
Uh,

907
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:14,830
and this is actually a hands on experience
that's supposed to help you eliminate

908
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:19,620
your overconfidence if I trying to
predict the market. Uh, but, um,

909
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:23,820
this is, uh, the example
where I tried to use time, uh,

910
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,100
as a predictor of the,
uh,

911
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:29,760
of the stock market and failed,
uh,

912
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:35,100
pretty decisively to do so. But
what I want to say is that, uh,

913
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:38,610
I have this spreadsheet up here which
has some data. It has monthly day.

914
01:02:38,611 --> 01:02:40,890
This is my, um, hundred,

915
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,040
730 year long stock price series.

916
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:48,630
But you could add other
data, uh, and whatever.

917
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:52,860
If you can find data series somewhere,
it might be, it would be more fun, uh,

918
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,820
to try to predict, uh, using other data.

919
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:00,270
And so this is just for
you to really try to do it.

920
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:05,240
Some people do did sports things,
so if somebody wins the Superbowl,

921
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:09,540
maybe I don't know what the story is.
This is a famous story actually. Uh,

922
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:14,610
the stock market goes up or go, do you
know that? I don't know this exact,

923
01:03:14,611 --> 01:03:16,260
a repeated store.

924
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:19,870
So you could create other variables
like a dummy variable for winning the,

925
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:23,880
somebody winning the Superbowl and
put that in. There's a famous story.

926
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:28,830
It goes back to the 1930s about skirt
lengths and the stock market. You know,

927
01:03:28,831 --> 01:03:32,150
this story, uh, in the 1920s, uh,

928
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:35,100
an unprecedented thing
happened in women's fashion.

929
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:38,340
Never been seen before in a United States.

930
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:43,740
Women started wearing short
skirts and it was scandalous.

931
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:45,120
They weren't quite mini skirts,

932
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:50,121
but they were scandals and the women's
hemlines rose and peaked in 1929 and then

933
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:56,220
the skirt lengths came down in
the 30s right, with the market.

934
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:58,920
And so that was noticed and
some people thought, you know,

935
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:03,210
there was some euphoria that was
driving women crazy or something,

936
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,680
something about the twenties. The
optimism, the sense, uh, you know,

937
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:12,240
it sort of happened again in the 70s in
remember the miniskirts came in in the

938
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:16,380
70s. Right? And then the
70s, 74 crash didn't exactly,

939
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:20,520
I don't know if hemlines came down, but,
so anyway, I had one student who thought,

940
01:04:20,521 --> 01:04:23,520
well, maybe there's other fashion
things that explained the market.

941
01:04:23,521 --> 01:04:28,521
And she went back to microfilm newspapers
and measured the width of men's ties

942
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:34,820
in fashion advertisement. And she
thought, why ties are assigned,

943
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:39,270
it's like a short skirt, I guess it's
a sign of optimism and excitement.

944
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:42,990
And so she collected data on widths
of ties. She had a times here.

945
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,510
This was a very good answer.
Uh, great. Good problems.

946
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:52,070
And she collected 50 years of data on
the width of men's ties and correlate and

947
01:04:52,561 --> 01:04:57,230
see if it predicted the market.
And unfortunately, it did not. Uh,

948
01:04:57,300 --> 01:04:58,440
it was a wonderful tries.

949
01:04:58,450 --> 01:05:02,190
I'm hoping that some of you can think
of interesting things to do, uh,

950
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:05,910
to try to predict the stock market.
All right,

951
01:05:05,911 --> 01:05:08,640
so I'll see you again in two days.
