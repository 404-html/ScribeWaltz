1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,360
So I wanted to talk today
about investment banking, uh,

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,280
which is, uh, a subject of
some interest around here.

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,950
Um, but first, I, I, uh,
I thought I would, uh,

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,450
there's been so much news.

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,870
I wanted to just briefly comment about
what's going on in the world today with

6
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:29,340
our, um, financial crisis. Uh,

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,400
notably I think that this is the,
uh,

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,670
it could be the biggest financial
crisis since the great depression. Uh,

9
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,840
and,
uh,

10
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,760
as evidence of that we're seeing a lot of
talk about what changes should be made.

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,190
And I think it reminds me of the very
basic fact that we live in a financial

12
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:54,420
world that was created in the
wake of the Great Depression.

13
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:55,560
Uh,

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,560
so many of our financial institutions
were created in the 1930s,

15
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,030
uh, because that was a time when
everything was being shaken up. And,

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,380
uh, it was a time when people were
willing to consider it something really

17
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:12,300
different.
Uh,

18
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,780
if you just look at back where various
of our institutions when they were

19
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:19,680
created,
it's most likely to be in the 1930s.

20
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,750
Uh,
we are not yet at such a crossroads.

21
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,800
The financial situation is not
as bad as it was in the 1930s,

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,540
but it's getting bad. And as a
result, we're starting to see,

23
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:39,090
um, proposals for big change.
Notably, uh, on Monday,

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,810
the Treasury Department Under
Secretary Henry Paulson, uh,

25
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,610
announced a proposal for fundamental
change in our financial markets.

26
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,390
Uh,
and this proposal if implemented,

27
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,720
might be the biggest change
since the great depression.

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,150
Uh, however, uh,

29
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,570
the news are calling it dead on arrival.
Uh,

30
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:11,370
it's unlikely that the Paulson
proposal will be implemented,

31
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,650
uh,
partly because it's,

32
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,450
it's being proposed by the
Republican administration,

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,250
but not just Republican eight,

34
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:24,390
just an administration that's coming
to an end and we're having an election.

35
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,010
So this,
uh,

36
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,110
Paulson proposal probably has very
little chance of being implemented as is,

37
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,940
but it's puts,
it's put in a to change the discussion.

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,770
Uh, and it's, it's going to
be talked about a lot and I,

39
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:43,950
I suppose it will influence what happens
that the interesting thing is that the

40
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:48,951
next president of the United States will
likely have a mandate for big changes.

41
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,280
Uh,

42
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,280
so maybe it's just as well that for Bozi
and Al are slow to do a second edition

43
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:58,710
of their book because if
they got it out this year,

44
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:02,650
it would be a bad year to get it out
because everything is changing. Uh,

45
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,210
I studied the Paulson proposal
carefully since I'm writing,

46
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,220
I'm writing a New York Times column
about it, which will appear Sunday. Uh,

47
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,420
and reading the various
commentaries about the proposal. Uh,

48
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,760
I had the impression that not many of
them are very thinking very deeply about

49
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:25,770
it. They're typically, they'd like
to talk about the politics of it,

50
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:29,670
uh, and this thing that it's
dead on arrival or it's, uh,

51
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,430
someone said it's an
amateur amateurish proposal.

52
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,080
All the groups that stand a win or lose
from it are all figuring out what it

53
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:41,590
does to them and they're taking
their positions out of self interest.

54
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,390
So I wanted to write
something that was more, um,

55
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,920
perspicacious if I could manage that.
Um,

56
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,670
the interesting thing is actually we,
everyone calls it the pulse and proposal,

57
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,970
but it was apparently mostly written
by a young man who was in his early

58
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,630
thirties. You may not consider that
young, but I think that as young,

59
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,710
he could have taken this course from me
10 years. Actually, he didn't go to Yale.

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,660
I looked it up. He went to American
University, both undergraduate and is,

61
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,290
his name is David nascent,
uh, undergraduate.

62
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:21,130
And then he got a law degree
at American University. Uh,

63
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,650
and then he just went to work for
the government. As far as I know,

64
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:27,010
he doesn't publish, uh,
is not in the newspaper,

65
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,400
but he's gotten the ear of the treasury
secretary and they spent many weekends

66
00:04:32,951 --> 00:04:37,680
together figuring out what should
be done about the, uh, system. Uh,

67
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,400
and they wrote up a proposal, uh, which I,

68
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,610
I like many aspects of it actually a,
it's an interesting proposal.

69
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,760
Uh, but, uh,

70
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,960
but it's not so much what's in the
proposal as it is that this is a time, uh,

71
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,310
for reconsideration.
Um,

72
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,300
w the w one interesting thing that they
proposed is that we should have what

73
00:05:04,031 --> 00:05:08,840
they call objectives based regulation
of, all right. I can find a piece of

74
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,100
charge. So, uh,

75
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,220
so okay.

76
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,820
So we have, uh, this is David Mason

77
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,410
and Henry Paulson,
although it's not signed by them,

78
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:33,310
it's signed by the treasury.
Uh,

79
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,520
so the treasury,
it's called a blueprint,

80
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,460
a blueprint for reform of our

81
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,760
financial regulation. Uh, and, um,

82
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,860
it's, it's built around, uh,
what they call objectives

83
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,783
regulation.

84
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,730
That means that,
uh,

85
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,720
the different regulators should
each have their own objective.

86
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,140
And so they have a three part proposal.

87
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,640
There'd be a market stability regulator,
uh,

88
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:15,520
which would,
uh,

89
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,780
make sure that the markets
don't freeze up on us.

90
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,460
We don't have the systemic crisis.

91
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,950
There'd be a prudential
financial regulator,

92
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:36,100
and then three, there would be
a business conduct regulator.

93
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,780
So that's the, uh, the main part of the
proposal. And so what they're doing is

94
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,490
emphasizing the different,
uh,

95
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,760
objectives of,
of regulators.

96
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,390
Market stability is going to be the Fed.

97
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,540
Uh, but, uh, but it's not just
banking. They want it to be, uh,

98
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:11,370
the feds role would be broadened so
that it's not just a banking regulator,

99
00:07:11,501 --> 00:07:13,750
it's the whole financial system.

100
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,380
It's supposed to be maintaining
the stability of the system.

101
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,563
Uh,

102
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:23,490
and then the prudential
financial regulator is, uh,

103
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,300
supposed to regulate, uh,
it's supposed to a mat.

104
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,790
Uh, I, uh,

105
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,820
protecting the u s interest in various
institutions that are guaranteed by the

106
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:41,260
government, such as, uh, banks
that are federally insured,

107
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,710
uh, are, uh, uh,

108
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,280
enterprises that have government
guarantees are apparent,

109
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,550
government guarantees like
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

110
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:57,220
And then the business conduct
regulator is supposed to regulate.

111
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,280
Uh,
uh,

112
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,130
well, when I saw it was, it was,

113
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,460
it would be aimed at consumer protection

114
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,050
okay.

115
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,030
That it would, um, make sure
that businesses are, uh,

116
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,850
are protecting individuals.

117
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,893
Uh,

118
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,030
so I found this,
uh,

119
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:26,320
interesting because it calls to mind
some of the problems we had with the

120
00:08:26,321 --> 00:08:27,340
subprime crisis.

121
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,700
One very important problem was in the u
s we have regulation divided up in crazy

122
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:40,870
are archaic ways. Different agencies
were formed at different times,

123
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:44,740
and they have specific
missions. Uh, and for example,

124
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,180
we have the office of the Office
of the comptroller of the currency.

125
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:55,410
The OCC was founded in
1863 to national banks,

126
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,000
but it only supervises national banks.
Well,

127
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:03,960
why not state chartered banks or why
not credit unions or other things?

128
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,640
Um, well it's just an
accident of history. So, um,

129
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,550
what, um, uh,

130
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,500
what these people are proposing is
that we merge various agencies so that,

131
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,471
uh,
and,

132
00:09:17,471 --> 00:09:22,471
and define new agencies of the government
that are separated by these different

133
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,760
objectives. Uh, so an
objective defines an, uh,

134
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,230
an agency or regulatory agency.
Uh,

135
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,670
so, uh, so what, uh,

136
00:09:38,671 --> 00:09:43,671
they want to do is merge
the SI c and the ots merger.

137
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,410
That's one of the proposal, but I
wonder why they don't carry it further,

138
00:09:49,411 --> 00:09:51,650
but that that's,
that's the thing they emphasized.

139
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:57,020
The OCC is office of the comptroller of
the currency regulates national banks.

140
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,180
The Ot ots is the office
of thrift supervision.

141
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,470
It regulates savings banks.
So we put the two together.

142
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:11,200
That sounds sensible. I guess.
Why are they separate? Um,

143
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,150
and various other things that
they talked about had that for,

144
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,310
they weren't to merge,
uh,

145
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:22,311
the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the Commodity Futures Trading

146
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,320
Commission.
All right.

147
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:30,410
The Securities and Exchange Commission
is the principle government regulator for

148
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,250
securities. They make sure that everything
is on the level and working right.

149
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:39,480
They pretend they help prevent fraud,
misrepresentation,

150
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,290
manipulation of information
in stocks and bonds.

151
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,040
The CFTC is the commodity futures
trading commission and it regulates our

152
00:10:50,971 --> 00:10:53,570
futures markets.
Um,

153
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:59,090
there has been over the years a lot of
turf battles between the SEC and the CFTC

154
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,190
because it's sometimes unclear whether
something is a security or a future.

155
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:10,380
For example, when they started
trading stock index futures, these,

156
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:14,640
both these agencies thought it was in
their turf because it involved both stock

157
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:17,430
indexes and futures.
Anyway,

158
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,750
false in is proposing merging these,
uh,

159
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,610
that makes sense. And it seems like, uh,

160
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,820
getting rid of some of this division of
regulatory agencies is very beneficial.

161
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,170
Uh, and it, the division is
what hampered regulators from,

162
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,440
from dealing with the
financial subprime crisis.

163
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:42,300
So people knew that a lot of bad loans
were being made or loans were being made

164
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:47,390
to people who couldn't be getting them
low income people were being given

165
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,600
adjustable rate mortgages with very low
starter rates called teaser rates that

166
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:55,330
would be raised in the future.

167
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:01,230
And they were given them with in such
a way that after the rates were raised,

168
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,010
they likely couldn't afford to pay the
mortgage anymore or they'd be under great

169
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:09,880
stress and trying to do so.
So a family that bought a house,

170
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,000
low income family buys a house,
they can barely afford it.

171
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:15,250
Then the rates go up on them.

172
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,140
The parents would have to take out
second jobs to try to, you know,

173
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,150
they're just going to, they're just
going to go bankrupt when that happens.

174
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,570
So it was a,

175
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,760
in some cases unethical and
it was plainly a problem,

176
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,300
and yet the regulatory agencies
in the U s weren't stopping it.

177
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,510
Uh,

178
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:39,190
another reason why the regulatory agencies
weren't stopping these problems was

179
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,520
because they often saw their
mission in different terms.

180
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,390
So when I gave a talk at the occ in 2005,

181
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:54,100
I was asking them about,
why aren't you policing these mortgages?

182
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,180
And their first answer was,
well, you have to remember,

183
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:02,810
we were set up in Abe Lincoln's Day
to manage the national banks. Uh,

184
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,840
we're, that's our mission. W W W I,
I may be overstating their answer,

185
00:13:07,841 --> 00:13:12,520
but I got that flavor from them that you
want us to go out and protect consumers.

186
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,870
Well, of course that's a nice mission,
but that's not our mandate. So,

187
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,260
uh, uh, so, uh,

188
00:13:20,261 --> 00:13:25,261
I think that what Paulson and nascent
want to do is to create a separate

189
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:31,861
business conduct agency that is
aimed at consumer protection.

190
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,780
And so it would be working parallel
with these other agencies too, uh, too.

191
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,480
But their job would be to
represent the consumer.

192
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:44,940
And that sounds like a good idea to me.
Um,

193
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,880
the thing I stressed in my column
was the market stability regulator,

194
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,680
which is the Fed.

195
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,070
What they want to do is expand the
actions of the feds that they're not just,

196
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:59,560
you can describe the Federal
Reserve or any central bank.

197
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,090
Traditionally as a banker's bank, remember
I told you the story of how the first,

198
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,480
the Bank of England was the first central
bank and it made banks keep deposits

199
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,910
at the Bank of England.
So in other words,

200
00:14:12,911 --> 00:14:15,520
the banks were like customers
of the Bank of England.

201
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,900
They had to keep deposits there.

202
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,950
And the Bank of England watched them
to make sure that they were behaving

203
00:14:20,951 --> 00:14:24,660
responsibly and had authority
over them because it, um,

204
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,980
it had a market power.

205
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:31,510
Well the Fed is like that now.
Um,

206
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,730
but what,
uh,

207
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:38,650
Paulson and Mason wanted to do is make
it more than a banker's bank didn't want

208
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:40,990
it to be a bank for the
whole financial system.

209
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:44,410
And that's what's already
happening. Uh, in fact,

210
00:14:44,411 --> 00:14:49,390
it's just happening rapidly as we
speak. I mean, in this last month,

211
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:50,500
things have changed.

212
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:56,050
The Fed has never given loans to anyone
other than a depository institution that

213
00:14:57,741 --> 00:15:02,660
is a bank until last month. And
except they did. So on the depression,

214
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:04,730
there was this long gap in the 1930s,

215
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:09,680
the Fed was making loans to private
companies that were not banks.

216
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,900
And then they stopped doing that until
last month. Uh, and they created the,

217
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,040
I mentioned that last time,

218
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:21,041
that term securities lending facility
and the primary dealers credit facility,

219
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:27,650
which are lending outside
the banking system. And so,

220
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,053
uh,

221
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:34,270
what Paulson wants to do is make that
official that the Fed is no longer just a

222
00:15:35,991 --> 00:15:38,630
central bank.
It's a market stability regulator.

223
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,430
This is going to be very controversial,
but I think it's a good thing to raise,

224
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,310
uh, in my opinion. Uh,

225
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,670
this is the trend anyway, and I
think we're going that way. Uh,

226
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:55,610
the problem is that in a
modern financial economy,

227
00:15:55,611 --> 00:16:00,200
we have so much instability,
which is already built into the system

228
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:05,030
that, uh, that, uh, we have to,

229
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,210
we rely on something like a central
bank, uh, to do things that,

230
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,030
uh,
that helps stabilize markets.

231
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,180
Uh, and so

232
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,350
I think that we're probably
going that way anyway.

233
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,890
And I think that in the next
presidential administration,

234
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:29,960
we'll see an expansion of the role,

235
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,670
uh, of the Fed. Uh,

236
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,260
I wish the Fed had behave better
in the recent crisis in a sense.

237
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:42,210
They didn't seem to recognize the bubbles
that we had in the stock market in the

238
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,010
90s and the housing market
and the two thousands.

239
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,230
And if there are market
stability regulator,

240
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:50,910
you'd hope that they could
do a better job. Uh, but,

241
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,430
uh, there what we have, and I think
that, that we should probably, uh,

242
00:16:55,890 --> 00:17:00,750
uh, give them the
authority to do that job.

243
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,670
And I think that's what we need to do.

244
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,920
So I was generally positive about their,
the treasury proposal,

245
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:10,440
but, um, another thing
that they want to do,

246
00:17:10,441 --> 00:17:13,440
which has been talked about for some time.
Yes.

247
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,783
Okay.

248
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,730
Yeah. So he asked why,
why did the news media,

249
00:17:33,731 --> 00:17:38,440
I think that the crisis is
already over. Uh, and secondly,

250
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:43,200
why do they think we can prevent,
right. Is that, I'm paraphrasing. Uh,

251
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:48,160
I don't know if the news media are
concluding anything, but you do see,

252
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:53,280
we have seen over recent
years we've seen a lot of, um,

253
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:58,410
uh, suggestions that the turning
point is just around the corner.

254
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,270
And so,
uh,

255
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:04,710
in the news media report that I think
there's a bias towards optimism, uh,

256
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,280
buy in among business economists
generally are business people in general.

257
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,210
You know,
it's not considered good form to say,

258
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,260
I think we're about to have the crisis
of confidence and the whole house of

259
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,910
cards is going to collapse.
So it's also not a, you know,

260
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:23,670
if generally not in a business
person's interest to suggest that.

261
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,360
So we're all instinctively trying
to promote each other's confidence.

262
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,980
And that's what business people do. They
carry it a little further than that. Uh,

263
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,270
I was, uh, I was asked to be on, uh, uh,

264
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,740
it could and Kramer I could
load and company show. Um,

265
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,800
uh, I guess it was two nights
ago I turned them down,

266
00:18:43,801 --> 00:18:46,420
but they wanted to put me on opposite the,

267
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,330
the CEO of Coldwell banker.
Uh,

268
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:55,850
and uh, who is, uh, who is claiming
that the crisis is just about to end.

269
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,400
So I did a little research.
I would be thinking,

270
00:18:59,401 --> 00:19:03,270
I have still might go on
the show, but, uh, I, um,

271
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,030
I looked up a CEO of Coldwell banker,
but I found that there was another CEO,

272
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,460
this is a broker,
a real estate brokers for,

273
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,640
there was another CEO a year ago who was
on TV just exactly a year ago saying,

274
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,980
I think this is the best time ever,

275
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,750
or the best time in at least 10 years
to buy a house. And he said, uh,

276
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,640
the, uh, inventory is high. Uh,
the market is bottoming out.

277
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,590
Uh, and so, uh, he was
spectacularly wrong,

278
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:39,060
but I notice he's also no longer CEO.
So these things happen.

279
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,540
So, uh, there is a general
bias. On the other hand,

280
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:47,541
I have to respect these people that
usually financial crises and okay,

281
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,540
there's, there, there are repeated
scares and usually it's all right.

282
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,620
Like we had a big scare in 1998,
uh,

283
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:59,660
it started with the Asian financial
crisis and then it spread to Russia and

284
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,540
there was this terrible
collapse in Russia in 1,998, uh,

285
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,900
when the government couldn't pay its
debts and then that spread to the u s and

286
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:08,130
people were very fearful.

287
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,720
But the Fed under Alan Greenspan was
very quick to respond and the whole thing

288
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,270
didn't turn out to be anything so bad.
The,

289
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:20,320
the Fed again did like what it's doing
now at rescued a company called long term

290
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:25,200
capital management. Uh, but your,

291
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:29,070
your question about whether we can prevent
this kind of thing in the future is a

292
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:30,150
deep question.

293
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,540
And I think that the problem is that
our financial markets are inherently

294
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,130
somewhat unstable.

295
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,940
When we start thinking up really important
new ways of doing financial business,

296
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:49,120
they start to grow and they get huge, get
bigger and bigger before you know, it,

297
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,410
it, it's amazing how things can suddenly
grow and then nobody understands them.

298
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,210
So there's a vulnerability.
I was just the got the latest number.

299
00:20:58,211 --> 00:21:01,510
Do you know how much credit default
swaps there are? Outstanding.

300
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,600
According to the bank for
international settlements,

301
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:09,280
there are now $52
trillion worth of credit.

302
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:11,410
Default swaps,
outstanding.

303
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:17,100
$52 trillion with a GDP of the
United States is only 14 trillion.

304
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,620
So how can that be $52 trillion and
these things all I came in in the last 10

305
00:21:23,621 --> 00:21:28,390
years or so. Um, and so I called the
bank and economist at the vis and said,

306
00:21:28,391 --> 00:21:32,680
can you please explain it to me?
Where is this 52 trillion coming from?

307
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,600
Uh, and, uh, I got a note from him
and still trying to figure it all out.

308
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,860
But that's what happens.

309
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:43,950
The system performs very well
and then it becomes vulnerable.

310
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:49,960
Nobody understands all of it. So
that's, that's the problem. Uh, and,

311
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:51,723
uh,

312
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:57,070
the other side of it though is there was
a recent study that looked at financial

313
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:03,180
crises and compared countries that have
had financial crises with countries that

314
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:04,504
haven't.

315
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,520
And the conclusion was that countries
that have experienced financial crises are

316
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:14,521
generally more successful on average
over the long haul than countries that

317
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:18,070
haven't. Uh, and so in that sense,

318
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:22,960
a financial crisis is assign just
that you're moving with the times, uh,

319
00:22:22,961 --> 00:22:24,490
and you know,
you,

320
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:29,510
you're making a lot of money and so then
things suddenly blow up on you, but hey,

321
00:22:29,511 --> 00:22:31,900
you're, you'll recover and
you'll figure something out.

322
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,360
And then you have moved from there.
Uh, so I don't know that, uh,

323
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:40,210
Paulson's proposed Parsons proposals.
I kind of like them.

324
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,320
Uh, but I think that they're not enough.
That's why I'm writing a book about this.

325
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,420
I think there's a lot more to be done,

326
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,300
but even if you did
everything that I would do,

327
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,600
we would still have a vulnerability.
The financial crises.

328
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,340
And part of the reason why I'm endorsing
this market stability regulator,

329
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:58,121
uh,

330
00:22:58,121 --> 00:23:02,170
is that I think that there's no way that
we can just guarantee there's no way we

331
00:23:02,171 --> 00:23:07,171
can set up a system that is both very
effective in allocating resources.

332
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:12,580
And that is also,
that is also a very stable,

333
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,830
uh, so, you know,

334
00:23:14,831 --> 00:23:18,340
just like when we went to the moon
and we sent people up into space,

335
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:22,540
one of those space shuttles blew
up. Well that's what happens. Uh,

336
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,280
but most of them made it
all right. So, um, uh,

337
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:31,840
that's the way it is in, in
finance as well. So anyway,

338
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,460
I'm here to talk today about
investment banking, uh,

339
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:40,180
which of course is relevant to this is
all part of this general thing. But, uh,

340
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,490
let me,
uh,

341
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:48,170
I said earlier that investment banking
seems to be a great interest of students

342
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,120
at Yale.
Uh,

343
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:55,190
that's because they get some
really great jobs there. Uh,

344
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,990
it's a,
uh,

345
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,020
investment banking is a very important
economic institution and its fundamental,

346
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:07,750
what they do is fundamental to what
happens in our economy. And so, uh,

347
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,160
as a result,
uh,

348
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,880
people who work for them have a chance,
uh,

349
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,030
for great economic success.

350
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:22,250
And I'm not saying you want a job at
an investment bank because it's also a

351
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,560
demanding and difficult. And, uh, I,

352
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,320
I've talked to some of our students who
have been taken jobs at investment banks

353
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:34,580
and, uh, sometimes I think
they're probably too demanding.

354
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,600
As a young person,

355
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,850
you should be enjoying your youth and
not getting dragged in to some huge

356
00:24:40,851 --> 00:24:45,350
investment bank. And some, there are some
terrible stories. Young people who took,

357
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:48,560
uh,
who left the college five,

358
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:53,000
10 years ago and they got
a job at bear Stearns, uh,

359
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:56,000
and bear Stearns demand.
I'm just making this story up,

360
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:59,570
but it must be something like this
for somebody demanded 80 hour,

361
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,540
a hundred hour week devotion to the job,

362
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,660
but they kept paying in bear Stearns stock
and the extent the student was making

363
00:25:09,111 --> 00:25:12,870
millions every year, uh,
meanwhile, uh, was, uh,

364
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,880
his youth was going
away. And, uh, now, uh,

365
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,740
this imaginary student
is now 33 years old.

366
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,910
Never had time to marry or
have you started a normal life.

367
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:29,750
And then the whole thing blows up and all
the various during stock is worth just

368
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:34,130
about nothing. Um, so that's the kind
of mistake you don't want to make.

369
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,550
Uh, I, I find the
industry very interesting.

370
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:42,770
You have to form some kind of balance
in your life and not let anyone demand a

371
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,860
hundred hours a week of your
time. Uh, and if they do,

372
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,970
you should sell the stock they give
you as soon as you can diversify.

373
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:55,820
Uh, but I also like investment
banking because I've created one.

374
00:25:55,821 --> 00:25:57,470
We have, um, uh,

375
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:02,290
my colleagues and I founded a investment
bank called macro markets. Uh,

376
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,110
and I'm not actually running it.
I'm a coffee.

377
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:09,070
It's named after a book I
wrote called macro markets. Uh,

378
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,160
and we're not a very
big important bank yet,

379
00:26:13,161 --> 00:26:17,550
but it makes me interested
in the whole field. Uh, uh,

380
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:23,390
we have only hired one Yale students so
far because we're too tiny a to if there

381
00:26:24,591 --> 00:26:28,750
were not hiring in case
you wonder. Uh, uh,

382
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,830
uh, so yeah, it was a student in this
class that we hired, but again, that's,

383
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,920
that's all history. So, um,

384
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:43,850
so anyway, uh, what does investment
banking, which is the subject of, uh,

385
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,920
investment banking,
uh,

386
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,490
means the underwriting of securities.

387
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,213
There's a,

388
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:00,700
that is arranging for the issuance
by corporations of stocks and bonds.

389
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:07,170
So the, the term bank is
misleading because, uh,

390
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,890
we often use it,
I'm writing over here,

391
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,560
a depository institution,

392
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:20,620
uh,
is an institution that accepts deposits

393
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,660
and make loans or invest
the money from the deposit.

394
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,390
Do you know what I mean by it depends.

395
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,990
If you go to a savings bank or a savings
and loan or a commercial bank and you

396
00:27:34,991 --> 00:27:38,200
say, I want to open up a checking
account that's a deposit,

397
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,340
or I want to open up a savings
account, that's a deposit. Okay?

398
00:27:42,341 --> 00:27:47,140
The thing about a deposit is you deposit
your money as an individual and there

399
00:27:47,141 --> 00:27:50,200
are millions of people that all deposit,
uh,

400
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,900
in, in a depository
institution. And then, uh,

401
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,290
later on whenever you want, you
can take your money out. Meanwhile,

402
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:04,380
they invest the deposit
somewhere or another at a
higher interest rate than they

403
00:28:04,991 --> 00:28:07,030
pay on the deposits and
they make the difference.

404
00:28:07,031 --> 00:28:08,290
And that's how they make a profit.

405
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,030
So I often use the word bank to refer.

406
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,510
And so does everyone do
a depository institution.

407
00:28:16,511 --> 00:28:19,150
But if you look at what the law says,

408
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:23,170
they tend to use the word depository
institution and Investment Bank.

409
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:28,300
If it's doing our pure investment
banking business is not a depository

410
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:31,330
institution. So if you go into
an investment bank and say,

411
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,100
I want to open up a deposit,

412
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,510
they'll say you should go next door
to the credit union or something.

413
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,190
We don't do that. Uh, so the
word bank is somewhat misleading.

414
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,830
Uh, on the other hand,
historically, most institutions,

415
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:52,780
uh, uh, do both. If you
go around the world,

416
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,520
uh,
most banks,

417
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:59,080
most depository institutions are
also involved in investment banking.

418
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,850
But let me just get right under here.

419
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:05,470
And investment banking does
underwriting of securities.

420
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,000
Okay.

421
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,960
And what does that mean?
That means they, they,

422
00:29:11,961 --> 00:29:12,770
uh,

423
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:17,770
arrange for the issuance by
other institutions of securities.

424
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,170
So, for example, if Ford
Motor Company wants to, uh,

425
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,600
issue corporate bonds or they
want to issue new shares,

426
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,460
they would go to an investment bank and
the investment bank, we'd say, okay,

427
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,720
we can underwrite for you, but
we'll do it for you. So, um,

428
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,483
uh,

429
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,520
so a pure investment bank a is
not a depository institution
and it's also a pure

430
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:46,210
investment bank is not
a broker dealer either.

431
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:49,000
They're not trading and securities there,
although they would,

432
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,420
they would deal insecurities as a
part of the underwriting process,

433
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,630
but they're not. Uh, you
wouldn't go to an investment,

434
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,790
a pure investment bank either and say,

435
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,740
I want to buy a hundred shares of Ford
Motor Company. Where's your stockbroker?

436
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,350
They wouldn't be dealing with
that. They would, they deal,

437
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,620
their customers are companies. Uh, and uh,

438
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,000
they wouldn't do that either now,

439
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,770
but in many cases, firms do a
mixture of different activities,

440
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:21,810
one of which is investment banking.
But there's a peculiar, um,

441
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,370
it's a story that refers particularly
do America, United States.

442
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,880
And that is the glass steagall act

443
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:37,720
of 1933.
Again,

444
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,720
you see everything happened in the 30s.
Uh,

445
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:45,750
the stock market crash in 1929 cause
tremendous chaos in the financial markets.

446
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,990
And, uh, Carter Glass, uh,

447
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,550
was a senator from Virginia and he,
and I think it's Henry Stegal,

448
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,910
uh,
put together a bill,

449
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,800
which passed congress and was
signed by President Roosevelt. Uh,

450
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:07,480
that said that, uh, we want to, um,

451
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:12,360
make a law saying that investment banks,
uh,

452
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:17,580
cannot be combined with commercial banks
or insurance investment banking had to

453
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:20,950
be a separate from,
okay,

454
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,500
this was what they said in 1933.

455
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,980
You could not be both a depository
institution and an investment bank.

456
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,780
So they said,
after this act,

457
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,160
every bank has to choose one or the other.

458
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:39,760
Do you want to be investment bank
or Commercial Bank? So for example,

459
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:44,761
then JP Morgan in the United States was
founded by a man named James Pierpont

460
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:48,310
Morgan.
Uh,

461
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:53,260
and it was one of the biggest
banks in the U S uh, in 1933,

462
00:31:53,261 --> 00:31:56,400
it was told you gotta make a choice.
Uh,

463
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,330
are you an investment bank
or a commercial bank? Uh,

464
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,780
and so JP Morgan made a
choice, a and said, well,

465
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:06,490
we'll go to be commercial bank.

466
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:12,250
And so they stopped their
investment banking business, uh,

467
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:17,660
in 1933 they've since gotten
back into it, but, uh, that,

468
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,420
that's the, but for a long
time they became a commercial
bank. So what happened?

469
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:26,830
They had a lot of people at JP Morgan
who were doing investment banking, uh,

470
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:30,580
and they, um, uh,

471
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,720
they, uh, uh,

472
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,480
were upset because Davey Morgan
was shutting them down. So, uh,

473
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,180
there was a Mr. Stanley, I forget
his first name now, uh, who has,

474
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,970
I've mentioned him cause he
was a Yale graduate and, uh,

475
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:52,130
he got the guys together from JP
Morgan who did investment banking.

476
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:57,380
Um, and JP Morgan was dead
already, but, uh, his son,

477
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:01,490
the young Morgan, uh, and
he created Morgan Stanley.

478
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,313
Okay.

479
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:08,700
I have the suspicion that Mr. Stanley put,
uh,

480
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,780
the son of JP Morgan on just
for the prestige of the name.

481
00:33:12,781 --> 00:33:15,930
It sounds a lot better.
Right. Morgan Stanley, uh,

482
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,220
and so this became an investment bank.

483
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,533
Okay.

484
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:27,590
And now JP Morgan and
Morgan Stanley are over 70,

485
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:29,720
75 years later.
Our competitors.

486
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,733
[inaudible]

487
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:36,550
so, uh, so that, that is the
important history of glass.

488
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:41,410
Steagall um, but the problem
is that as the years went on,

489
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,613
uh,

490
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:46,810
in the U s we had a division between
investment banking and commercial banking,

491
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:50,230
but in Europe, uh, and in
other places of the world,

492
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:55,120
their banks were under no such restriction
is there was a lot of complaints that

493
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,160
are laws in the U s we're
handicapping the, uh, u s banks.

494
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,090
Uh, and, uh, so, uh,

495
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,610
finally glass steagall was repealed,

496
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,990
uh, and, uh,

497
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,250
that didn't happen until 1999.

498
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,300
So we have the gram,

499
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:23,740
oops Leach Bliley if I'm the AF spelling
this right act of 1999 which repealed,

500
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,030
uh, glass steagall. Uh,

501
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:40,100
and so that led then to a whole
wave of mergers of investment banks.

502
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,530
Uh, so JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley
could presumably have merged,

503
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:51,710
but they didn't, uh, they become
too much competitors. Uh, and,

504
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,880
and, uh, they, they just developed
their own, uh, they just,

505
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:02,580
uh, internally adopted more broad
a definition of their business.

506
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:07,110
Um, so, uh,

507
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,510
but there's lots of mergers that
we can talk about that came, uh,

508
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:15,180
either sometimes they
occur just before 1999.

509
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,030
Uh, but, um,

510
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,290
uh, which, uh, uh,

511
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,500
uh, so for example, um,

512
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,293
travelers,

513
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,280
and this is the, the new, uh,

514
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:41,380
Gramm Leach bill also allowed insurance
companies to merge with commercial bank.

515
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:44,370
So travelers insurance,
uh,

516
00:35:44,371 --> 00:35:48,960
and Citi Group marriaged,
uh,

517
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:52,230
in 1998.
I know that's before the bill.

518
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:57,180
That was as the bill was just
about to happen. Um, and then, uh,

519
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,650
JP Morgan

520
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:05,780
and chase a merged in,
um,

521
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:10,950
how 2000, uh, and then,

522
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:16,790
uh, UBS, uh, and, um, uh,

523
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,663
Paine Webber,

524
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,630
um, merged in 2000, um, and, uh,

525
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,920
Credit Suisse,
a Swiss bank

526
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:38,080
and Donaldson,
Lufkin and Jenrette.

527
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:39,703
Yeah.

528
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:49,840
Donaldson was the dean of our
business school here at Som,

529
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,690
but that merger occurred in 2000.

530
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,270
So,
uh,

531
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:02,050
so there's some examples. So now we're,
we're seeing a movement back toward a,

532
00:37:02,051 --> 00:37:07,051
so that a bank has an investment
banking business within it,

533
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:11,560
but it's not just an investment
back. Uh, and so, uh,

534
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,450
sometimes hard to define
what something he has.

535
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,540
There's been a lot of news just in
the last year or even more recently,

536
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:26,590
like yesterday, or like tomorrow, this
morning's paper about an investment banks,

537
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:31,240
because under the
current financial crisis,

538
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:36,540
uh, they are buckling there. A
lot of them are in trouble. Uh,

539
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,490
and that's why it's big news.
Uh,

540
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:44,740
so I give you some
examples. Um, I mentioned,

541
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:49,300
I mentioned bear Stearns. Um, so, uh,

542
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,810
bear Sterns,

543
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,413
uh,

544
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:02,880
was founded in 1923 by,
uh,

545
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,170
uh, Joseph Bear and Robert Stern's. Uh,

546
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,950
I just try to find something out about
them and they don't seem to be very well

547
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,390
known. I couldn't tell you, but not
on the web. There's no bear stern.

548
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,100
There's no Joseph Bear is
my work club on the web,

549
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:23,370
but whatever they set up was
really big for awhile. So, uh,

550
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,470
I'm gonna say from 1923
to 2008 when it went bust,

551
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:32,760
so it lasted a 85 years.
Uh,

552
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,370
so, uh, it's, uh,

553
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,070
it has investment banking business,

554
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:44,830
but it also has private equity
business and private banking. Uh,

555
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:49,810
and, uh, it started to get in
trouble during the current, in fact,

556
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:54,811
it was maybe the first a US investment
bank to get in trouble in the current

557
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,750
financial crisis because
it was in, um, uh,

558
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,320
June of 2007,

559
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,870
uh, they had, uh, some of
their funds collapsed. They,

560
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:14,070
they had funds that we're investing
in subprime mortgages. Uh,

561
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,410
and this is a sign of something wrong.

562
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,860
The names of these funds were,
uh,

563
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:23,590
the bear Stearns high grade
structured credit fund.

564
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,310
You have to say high grade,

565
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:29,560
high grade is supposed to mean and finance
that it's not going to fail on your

566
00:39:29,561 --> 00:39:32,800
right. Well, uh, and they had, uh,

567
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:37,120
they had another one called the bear
Stearns high grade structured structured

568
00:39:37,121 --> 00:39:42,060
credit enhanced leverage fund.
That sounds a little bit contradictory.

569
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,500
You should,
as a consumer of financial products,

570
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:49,720
wonder when they put both high grade
and leveraged in the same name. Right?

571
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,980
High grade is supposed to mean safe,
but leverage sounds like the opposite,

572
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:54,700
doesn't it?

573
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:59,650
If you leverage means that they borrowed
a lot of money to buy risky subprime

574
00:39:59,651 --> 00:40:02,830
securities.
So if they borrowed 80% of the money,

575
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:07,450
the security is only half to lose 20%
of the value for you to be wiped out.

576
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:11,410
Right? So that shouldn't be high
grade if it's so leveraged. So anyway,

577
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:14,950
these two funds were
wiped out. Uh, and uh,

578
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:20,000
bear Stearns had to
give, uh, uh, deal, uh,

579
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:24,550
three point $2 billion. That
was last summer, but they,

580
00:40:24,551 --> 00:40:26,980
the news kept getting worse and worse.

581
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,930
Apparently bears had invested a
lot in securities that were, uh,

582
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,793
unstable.

583
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:38,340
And so it finally became where rumors
started developing that bear was,

584
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:45,910
it was really rumors that killed there.
The rumors started going,

585
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:48,970
now you know, bear is in trouble.
And so there you're going to be,

586
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,680
they're going to be in
bankrupt before long.

587
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:55,690
This is exactly the market stability
problem that Paulson is talking about.

588
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:59,560
Once the rumors get started,
everybody is saying, don't,

589
00:40:59,561 --> 00:41:02,230
don't do anything with bear.
Don't, don't lend them any money.

590
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,510
Don't just stay away from them.

591
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,890
Even young people who are getting jobs
and they were right to right to think

592
00:41:08,891 --> 00:41:09,670
this,

593
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,850
don't even take a job with them because
you're going to be on the street again

594
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:17,980
shortly. So it's that kind of
rumor that kills bear Stearns.

595
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,790
Uh, and so they couldn't, they
couldn't pay their bills and, and they,

596
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:28,510
they were finding it difficult to sell
their assets to come up with money. Uh,

597
00:41:28,511 --> 00:41:30,490
and so,
uh,

598
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,770
the Fed decided to bail them out.

599
00:41:33,771 --> 00:41:38,300
This was a huge fed bailout.
Well, they didn't want,

600
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,510
uh,
the Fed didn't want to

601
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,730
bail out the stockholders.

602
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,300
They didn't want to just give money to
people who didn't invest because the

603
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:52,190
firms are supposed to be allowed to fail.

604
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,640
So what the Fed did is it gave a line
of credit to JP Morgan and non-recourse

605
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,090
line of credit to buy bear Stearns.

606
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,040
And what it amounted to was that
the Fed would take a troubled,

607
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,760
a securities that bear
Stearns couldn't sell.

608
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:16,030
It would take that as collateral for
eight $29 billion loan to JP Morgan,

609
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:21,260
uh, under the condition that JP
Morgan would buy bear Stearns.

610
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:25,190
And it was supposed to be at $2 a share.
Uh,

611
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:30,191
and so that left the total value of bear
Stearns at a little over 200 million,

612
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,730
which is pretty tiny compared
to what they were worth. Um,

613
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:39,650
which was in the tens of billions
short while ago. Uh, but the,

614
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,660
the Fed didn't want a
disorderly collapse. So, uh,

615
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:46,370
so it was a,
uh,

616
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:51,320
a $29 billion loan to JP Morgan.

617
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,260
This is highly controversial
these days because, uh,

618
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,150
uh,
uh,

619
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,000
the Fed isn't normally
doing this sort of thing.

620
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:06,560
Why would it be lending money to JP
Morgan to buy another company? You know,

621
00:43:06,561 --> 00:43:10,760
you say, how is that benefiting the,
the average person in this country?

622
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,480
Uh, but it does benefit them
because if they didn't do this,

623
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:19,580
bear Stearns would have dumped
its assets on the mock market. Uh,

624
00:43:19,581 --> 00:43:23,970
it would go down in flames. Uh,
lots of its debts would become, uh,

625
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,630
lots of people who had, uh, you know,

626
00:43:26,631 --> 00:43:30,920
accounts with bear Stearns and find
that their accounts were destroyed. Uh,

627
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,440
and, uh, and then what would it do?

628
00:43:33,441 --> 00:43:36,800
It might lead to contagion
to other financial institute.
People would say, well,

629
00:43:36,801 --> 00:43:39,230
it happened to bear who's next?

630
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,120
And so there'd be this huge pulling back.
So the Fed decided to bail,

631
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:47,060
bail them out.
And that's what they did.

632
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,530
Now it's not clear that it's over.
If you read this morning's paper,

633
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,530
Lehman Brothers is another,
uh,

634
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:01,130
another, uh, investment bank that, uh, uh,

635
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,000
is rumored to be in
trouble. And so, um, it's,

636
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:09,770
it's got to do something about these
rumors, uh, because it can kill them,

637
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,040
kill them, just the rumors, no one what
we'll want to do anything with them.

638
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:18,460
So it was in this morning's
paper or yesterday's news
that they have arranged to

639
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,100
raise capital,
uh,

640
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:28,120
on the, on the markets, uh, and it was not
entirely clear. That means that they're,

641
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:32,120
they're getting people who are
willing to invest, give them, uh,

642
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:34,080
invest in the company.
Uh,

643
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:37,830
and it's a sign of confidence in Lehman
brothers that someone would do that at

644
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:39,610
this critical time.
Um,

645
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:44,310
so another story that
came in yesterday was UBS.

646
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,200
I mentioned before it was a Swiss bank,

647
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,700
but it's not Swiss and it's
international. I started out, uh,

648
00:44:50,701 --> 00:44:54,540
as the Union Bank of Switzerland.
That's what it stands for.

649
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:58,020
Union Bank of Switzerland, which was, uh,

650
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:00,983
uh,

651
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,660
the result of a merger between
two Swiss banks around 1900.

652
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:10,060
Uh, but then it had, uh,
I mentioned merged, uh,

653
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,860
with Paine Webber and it's become an
international corporation. So they,

654
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,600
they just call themselves UBS. But
in, in this morning's newspaper,

655
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:23,670
uh, it said that UBS
announced that it has lost,

656
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:27,420
um, what was it? The same way?
Remember what the numbers were?

657
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:29,473
What's that?

658
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:33,010
They've lost 19 billion.
Yeah.

659
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,473
Right.

660
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,730
So, uh, yeah, so that's
a huge loss. $19 billion.

661
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:44,280
It's a substantial part
of their market cap,

662
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:50,180
but they are also announcing that they
are arranging to raise capital as well.

663
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:56,610
So, uh, the news that these firms
which are rumored to be in trouble,

664
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:00,510
are managing to raise
capital. Uh, Boyd markets.

665
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:04,970
Yesterday we had a big upsurge
in the stock market. Uh, it was,

666
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:07,303
uh,

667
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:12,320
well yesterday was the first day of the
second quarter and the newspapers were

668
00:46:12,331 --> 00:46:15,210
reporting that it was the biggest,
uh,

669
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:19,650
upsurge on the mark on the first
day of a new quarter since 1938.

670
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:24,960
Um, I looked at that with some curiosity
because 1938 was not such a great year

671
00:46:24,961 --> 00:46:28,590
after all who were still on the
depression. Uh, I think, uh,

672
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,280
I have to look up the market didn't do
great after that then. So it doesn't,

673
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,670
this doesn't predict much
one way or the other.

674
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,630
Uh, but, uh, uh,

675
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:44,310
so anyway, this is where we are
now. It's an interesting situation.

676
00:46:45,090 --> 00:46:48,210
If you are thinking of taking a
job at one of these companies,

677
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,970
you might consider the,
uh,

678
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:54,180
look out there a situation because
some of these companies could, uh,

679
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,840
follow the way of, of bear Stearns. Um,

680
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:02,730
at this point, uh, we have
the Fed aggressively landing.

681
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:05,610
I'm trying to prevent another thing,
but you know,

682
00:47:05,611 --> 00:47:09,900
the Fed is not in the business of making
sure that your career is a success

683
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:14,940
there in the business of preventing
a systemic failure. So while the Fed,

684
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:19,740
uh, arranged for an orderly
dissolution of bear Stearns,

685
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,160
it didn't do a whole lot of
good to their employees who,

686
00:47:25,681 --> 00:47:30,430
uh, we'll see what happens to all of them.
I don't know the whole story, but, um, uh,

687
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,850
it's a tumultuous world out there.
It's not a,

688
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,510
it's not like you live in an academic
environment where Yale University has been

689
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:42,100
in business for over 300 years
and it looks so stable here. Well,

690
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:46,600
this is a very stable business and these
other businesses are not so stable.

691
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,920
But anyway, I wanted to talk about
the underwriting process and um,

692
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:56,890
uh, what it's done. So, uh,

693
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:02,560
I think underwriting of
securities, uh, is, um,

694
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,770
uh,
it's analogous.

695
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:11,050
The investment banking business is
analogous to the business done by, um,

696
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:16,120
by ordinary commercial banks in the
sense that it deals with the moral hazard

697
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:20,200
problem and an asymmetric
information problem.

698
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:26,170
We were talking about,
uh, about what banks do,

699
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,240
commercial banks. Remember I
was telling the story that, uh,

700
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:35,340
the big problem with lending to companies
is that it's hard to tell whether they

701
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:38,590
are really deserving of the loan or not.

702
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:43,980
And so a commercial banker is someone
who spent lives in a business community

703
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:48,100
and keeps abreast of everything that's
going on and plays golf with all the

704
00:48:48,101 --> 00:48:51,550
local business people and has a sense,
here's the gossip,

705
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:55,270
has a sense of who's responsible,
who will pay back alone,

706
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,100
who's got a business that's really going,

707
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:01,050
who's got a business that's
sick and on the way out. Uh,

708
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:02,980
and so that's what a bank does.

709
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:07,330
So everyone else who wants
to invest doesn't know this,

710
00:49:07,331 --> 00:49:11,020
but they put their money in the bank.
And then that's the idea.

711
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:15,220
So the moral hazard is that moral
hazard that the company, uh, which,

712
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:18,460
which receives a loan from the
bank would take the money and run.

713
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,140
And the asymmetric information
problem is that, uh,

714
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:27,220
you as a investor, if you were to
make loans directly to a company,

715
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:32,110
you would be suffering at a
disadvantage because you know,

716
00:49:32,111 --> 00:49:34,700
less than other people.
Uh,

717
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,540
you don't play golf with these people.

718
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:42,340
And so you would end up
taking on the worst loans,

719
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,620
loans that would fail. Well, the same
thing applies to underwriting because, uh,

720
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,210
but they do it in a different way.

721
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:53,080
Instead of a certifying,

722
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:57,280
instead of creating deposits
at a bank, they, uh,

723
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,710
they underwrite securities and
they are not taking the money.

724
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:04,660
They're just an intermediary between you,

725
00:50:04,661 --> 00:50:08,890
the public and the issuer of the security.
But it's much the same thing.

726
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:13,480
It's the reputation of
the, uh, of the bank that,

727
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:17,530
uh, makes it possible for firms to, uh,

728
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:20,650
uh,
uh,

729
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:25,840
it makes it possible for firms
to issue securities. So, so the,

730
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,740
the underwriting, uh, is
very important to understand,

731
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:35,330
uh, because, uh, it's
a process that allows,

732
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:40,160
uh, issuers of securities to, uh,

733
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:44,000
take advantage of the
reputation of the underwriters.

734
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:49,220
The issuer of the security may not be
so well known or not so well understood.

735
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:53,630
Uh, and so the, the, what happens is, uh,

736
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:57,290
the underwriter, it's a little w
w what's a good analogy? I was,

737
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:00,180
I was going to say it's like
a dating service, but that,

738
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,980
I guess dating services don't
do this. Right? They don't call,

739
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:08,810
they don't testify to the moral
character. They should. It would be nice.

740
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,850
Did they do that? Does anyone do that?
Uh, they probably can't. Right? That's an,

741
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:17,120
that's an even bigger moral hazard
problem. When you're looking for a spouse,

742
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,650
you have a huge moral hazard problem and
there's nobody there to help you as far

743
00:51:21,651 --> 00:51:25,430
as I know. But at least in the
business world, we have professionals.

744
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:28,810
So there are matchmakers in a sense,
they're trying to match up, uh,

745
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,770
a company that's issuing securities
to buyers of the securities. Uh, and,

746
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:34,963
uh,

747
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:39,230
this is an important reason for a
difference between investment banking and

748
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:43,160
other aspects of, um,
of finance. Investment.

749
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:47,540
Bankers will compare it particularly
to traders. Investment bankers

750
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:54,100
like to cultivate an image of sober
responsibility and good citizenship,

751
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:00,080
uh, because, uh,

752
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:04,820
they thrive on their reputation.
And so they,

753
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,970
to be successful as an investment banker,

754
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:11,920
you have to be so impressive.
Uh,

755
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:16,930
and so it's such high
character that companies like
Ford and GM will come to you

756
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:23,450
to represent them in the sale of
their securities. So as a result,

757
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,000
investment bankers tend to be
well dressed. They tend to be, uh,

758
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,920
a patrician in their
appearances and manner. And, uh,

759
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,510
in contrast, traders, uh,

760
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:38,210
tend to have a vulgar accents.

761
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,590
They shout on the phone and they slam the
phone down, they roll up their sleeves,

762
00:52:42,591 --> 00:52:47,330
they dribble food on their shirt and
maybe putting them down too much.

763
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:50,630
Uh, so, uh, uh,

764
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,130
I personally think that we have a
strength at Yale because of our patrician

765
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,870
image, uh, in providing
people to work for this field.

766
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,093
So,
uh,

767
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:05,990
typically investment bankers go
to the symphony on Saturday night.

768
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,050
But beyond that, if you open
up the program at the symphony,

769
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:13,430
you'll see their name under
platinum sponsor of the program.

770
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:17,540
And so that's the kind of people that
go into investment bank and they do it

771
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:21,140
because they have to manage
this underwriting process well.

772
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:27,430
So what does the underwriting
process? Uh, okay. Well, uh,

773
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:31,990
what happens is a company that
is thinking of issue, it's at,

774
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,630
say you're at any company, a big
company. It doesn't matter. Uh,

775
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:38,850
people don't trust big companies even
if had been around a hundred years.

776
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:42,310
So if Ford Motor Company, it's
been around since when, uh,

777
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,820
something that like around 1900,

778
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:48,780
but people sure don't trust it anymore
because it's had a history of trouble.

779
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:50,880
This is not a question just
of morality or the thing.

780
00:53:50,881 --> 00:53:54,330
It's a question of are you
willing to buy their securities?

781
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:59,460
So they would go to an investment
banker and a, and say we need money.

782
00:53:59,461 --> 00:54:03,810
We'd like to raise it by say,
issuing shares and in our company,

783
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:08,820
and then, uh, the, uh, they would probably
contact a number of investment banks,

784
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:13,350
uh, and try to make a
deal. Now that there's, um,

785
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,220
there's two kinds of deals.
There's a bought deal

786
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:24,870
and a best efforts.
Uh,

787
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:29,550
the difference is, uh, some investment
bankers will tell the company,

788
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,740
uh, we will, um, we will, you
want to issue these shares?

789
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,750
Fine. Sell them to us, we'll, we'll take
it, we'll give you a price. Of course,

790
00:54:39,751 --> 00:54:41,880
the Investment Bank doesn't
want to hold these shares,

791
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:47,040
but the investment bank knows the public
well enough to know which shares it can

792
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:49,380
sell. So in a, in a bought deal,

793
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:54,240
the investment bank is taking the risk
that they might not be able to sell the

794
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:59,130
shares at a, at a decent price,
they might lose on it. Uh,

795
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:03,960
but, uh, also there's a different
kind of offering, uh, which, uh,

796
00:55:04,470 --> 00:55:08,310
uh, maybe the best you could get, it's
called a best efforts are offering.

797
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:13,200
And here the, uh, investment
banker will not buy the deal,

798
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:18,150
but it will say that we will use
our best efforts to place this. Uh,

799
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,440
and uh, if you have a minimum price,
uh, we hope we can get above there.

800
00:55:22,441 --> 00:55:26,070
Otherwise the dealer will
fall through. Uh, and so, uh,

801
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:31,020
the underwriting process, um, uh,

802
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:36,750
is, uh, it takes the form of, uh, uh,

803
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:41,010
it's actually very much regulated by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

804
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:45,180
So the process, uh, is formalized. Uh,

805
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:50,610
so, uh, in order to issue securities,

806
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:53,760
you were talking about
public securities here,

807
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,610
you have to register them with the SEC.

808
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:01,020
And so the sec then becomes
a partner in a partner, her,

809
00:56:01,021 --> 00:56:03,990
an adversary in your effort
to issue these securities.

810
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,500
So the SEC securities
and Exchange Commission,

811
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,330
all of this might be changed next year.
Who knows?

812
00:56:12,331 --> 00:56:16,920
But this is the way it is
right now. Uh, so, uh, the,

813
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:20,220
the law says there's a pre filing period.

814
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:25,840
You have to file with the
SEC, uh, to get, uh, um, your,

815
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:27,880
your security is effective.

816
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:32,230
So the idea of I'll say Ford Motor
Company wants to issue new shares,

817
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:33,850
they go to the investment bank.

818
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:38,660
A then the investment bank
negotiates with the, uh,

819
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:44,120
affirm with Ford about what kind of a
securities that wants the issue and what

820
00:56:44,621 --> 00:56:47,740
price is reasonable. Uh,
and during this period,

821
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:52,020
the sec says there's no talk,
uh,

822
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:56,100
to the public about the shares, uh, uh,

823
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:00,520
at during this period,
uh, no talk publicly,

824
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:05,063
uh,

825
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:05,480
the fee,

826
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,020
the sec wants to manage the process so
that everything is done appropriately.

827
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,890
Um, at this point during the
pre filing period, the, uh,

828
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:20,190
the investment bank forms a
syndicate of other end of other

829
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:27,560
underwriters and they have,
they sign an agreement among underwriters.

830
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:33,910
Usually one investment bank is not big
enough to handle a big issue and it wants

831
00:57:35,931 --> 00:57:38,120
to get help of other investment banks.

832
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:43,540
And so they form a syndicate of
underwriters during the pre filing period.

833
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:51,230
Uh, so, uh, the underwriter,
there's a lead underwriter,

834
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:56,530
which of Ford Motor Company approached
first and the lead underwriter promised

835
00:57:56,531 --> 00:57:58,880
to take on the issue.
Uh,

836
00:57:58,881 --> 00:58:01,790
but the lead underwriter
doesn't want to do it itself.

837
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,200
And the reason it doesn't want to do it
just itself is that in order to sell an

838
00:58:06,201 --> 00:58:08,000
issue to a broad public,

839
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:12,800
you have to make use of a broad
network of contacts with the public.

840
00:58:13,310 --> 00:58:17,540
And, uh, no one underwriter,
no one investment bank has,

841
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:18,590
has them all.

842
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:23,840
So they formed a syndicate or a
group of investment banks that, um,

843
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:28,430
that are all participating
in the issue of the security.

844
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:32,900
Uh, and then they, uh,

845
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:37,400
then they file and then there's
what's called a cooling off period.

846
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:42,500
Uh, when the, uh,

847
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:45,590
security is in registration.

848
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:50,210
So they file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, uh, a,

849
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:53,960
a prospectus for the
preliminary prospectus.

850
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,793
Uh,

851
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:02,540
this goes to the federal,

852
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:06,530
to the Securities and Exchange
Commission for approval.

853
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:10,520
It's not really approval of the
issue, but it's, it's, um, uh,

854
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:13,790
registration of the issue. Uh, and, uh,

855
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:19,310
the preliminary prospectus,
uh, is called the red herring.

856
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:30,410
And, uh, the red herring,
it's lost in history,

857
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:34,930
why they call it that. There's
different theories about it. It, uh, uh,

858
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,830
herring of course, is a type of fish. Uh,

859
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:43,150
and the best explanation that I can
get for this name for the preliminary

860
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:46,970
perspectives is that it was,
uh,

861
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:51,620
referring to an activity that
hunters used to do with dogs.

862
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,530
Uh, and if I should tell
you this story is about,

863
00:59:54,531 --> 00:59:59,000
I'd like to know why they call it a red
herring. Uh, if you have hunting dogs,

864
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:03,830
they're supposed to track down a
fox by their sense of smell. Uh,

865
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:08,870
and so at one pace you can put your
dogs through is to try to try to confuse

866
01:00:09,951 --> 01:00:13,940
them. And they would
take a, a red herring,

867
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:15,950
which is a very smelly kind of fish,

868
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:19,490
and they would drag it around
and over the trail of the Fox.

869
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:25,300
And it's very difficult for dogs to
still smell the fax over that smell.

870
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:31,330
And so the word red herring became known
as a euphemism for something trying to

871
01:00:32,691 --> 01:00:35,870
distract and confused.
And so it was a joke,

872
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:40,310
I think it was a joke on Wall Street that
the prospectus is really just there to

873
01:00:40,311 --> 01:00:44,540
try to confuse you. And so they
called it the red herring. Um,

874
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:49,870
but the preliminary prospectus is now
often printed with red borders on it to

875
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:55,010
indicate that it's the red herring
and it's only preliminary. Uh,

876
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,170
and so,
uh,

877
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:03,040
finally it is the Fed evaluates the
prospectus and make sure that it accords

878
01:01:03,231 --> 01:01:07,790
with all regulations. It puts
it up on its website, uh,

879
01:01:07,791 --> 01:01:11,670
at the sec while it's in registration.
Uh,

880
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:15,350
and again, during the
cooling off period, uh,

881
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:19,280
firms are allowed to circulate
the preliminary prospectus.

882
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:24,310
Underwriters are allowed to circulate
the preliminary prospectus with a

883
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:27,440
potential buyers,
uh,

884
01:01:27,441 --> 01:01:32,300
but they're not supposed to say anything
besides what's in the preliminary

885
01:01:32,301 --> 01:01:33,134
perspectives.

886
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:38,130
There with are concerned about the SDC
is concerned about people overselling

887
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:39,920
securities.
Uh,

888
01:01:39,921 --> 01:01:43,880
and so they might point out advantages
of it and not the disadvantages.

889
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:47,300
The idea of it perspective.
What's in a prospectus.

890
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:52,430
A prospectus is a document that completely
tells everything about a security.

891
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:57,290
The whole idea of the sec is that we're
not letting anyone pull the wool over

892
01:01:57,291 --> 01:02:00,080
your eyes. That's why it really
shouldn't be called a red herring.

893
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:01,760
It's not supposed to deceive you.

894
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:04,610
It's supposed to pour out
everything about the security.

895
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:09,200
One thing that's in a prospectus,
a preliminary or final prospectus,

896
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:13,370
is the company thinks of everything
bad that could ever happen.

897
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:17,090
If you read prospectuses, they'll
say awful things. If you read them,

898
01:02:17,091 --> 01:02:21,720
care for them. Let's say this company
could lose everything. We could be sued,

899
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:26,100
we could be going to jail, we might have
done all sorts of, I may be exaggerating,

900
01:02:26,101 --> 01:02:27,730
but uh,
the,

901
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:32,040
the lawyers put everything imaginable
that could go wrong with US investment in

902
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:35,010
there. And they do it. Of course,
it's in kind of fine print,

903
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:38,400
but it's all in there so that
it's disclosed. And so later,

904
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:42,390
if someone loses money in the
investment and wants to sue them,

905
01:02:42,780 --> 01:02:45,630
then they'll say, well, look,
you know, it's in our prospectus.

906
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:50,340
And the reason that the SCC doesn't want
them to talk about securities at this

907
01:02:50,341 --> 01:02:55,341
point except to give the prospectus is
so that they can't conceal and hide these

908
01:02:56,401 --> 01:02:59,550
things.
So this is the sec process.

909
01:02:59,551 --> 01:03:04,551
This process says that the underwriters
have to give out the prospectus,

910
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:09,270
and that's all they can do. They can't
have a separate brochure. They can't,

911
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:14,430
your broker can't say, well, we're,
we're thinking of a issuing a security,

912
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:18,090
uh, we've got this perspectives, but I'm
going to send you a brochure instead.

913
01:03:18,091 --> 01:03:20,830
That's easier. Okay. Sec says,

914
01:03:20,850 --> 01:03:25,650
no way because that brochure will be a
sales job and it won't have all of this

915
01:03:25,651 --> 01:03:30,650
in there. So anyway, then
eventually the SCC approves it, uh,

916
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:35,640
and when it's approved, then
it's effective. Uh, and then, uh,

917
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:36,600
then the,
uh,

918
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:41,910
then the underwriters can
start selling the security. Uh,

919
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:44,340
and at that point, uh, they actually,

920
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,470
it depends on say it's
a best efforts offering.

921
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:48,660
Then they go around and they try to,

922
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:53,070
they get a buyers of
the security lined up.

923
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:58,230
Now you have to understand that there's
a problem issuing a new security

924
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,020
securities that are already
out there and trading.

925
01:04:01,021 --> 01:04:04,560
Everybody knows about them and, and
there's, there's a market for them.

926
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:09,050
But if you're issuing a new
security, uh, especially there's a,

927
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:14,420
if it's a company that is issuing shares
for the first time an IPO is an initial

928
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:17,070
public offering,

929
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:21,300
an IPO is the first time
that a company issues shares.

930
01:04:21,301 --> 01:04:24,780
So the company is not known to the public.
Uh,

931
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:29,781
and so it's very hard to get IPOs started
because the company is just not known.

932
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:38,120
So it's very important that
the underwriters are able
to get attention and get a

933
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:45,090
market going for the IPO. Um, during the,

934
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:49,980
uh, cooling off period, uh, uh,

935
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:55,050
firms also are allowed to place
according to the a sec something called a

936
01:04:55,261 --> 01:04:59,670
tombstone.
And that is an ad in the newspaper,

937
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:05,580
which we'll announce the, the, uh,

938
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:10,610
security and what it's very dignified ad
cause it has to meet with the approval

939
01:05:11,461 --> 01:05:15,060
of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
But a tombstone will say,

940
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:18,730
Ford Motor Company, uh, uh, you know,

941
01:05:18,731 --> 01:05:22,600
1 million shares, uh, offered, uh,

942
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:27,400
and then it will, um, it will list
all of the underwriting syndicate.

943
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:32,580
So it'd be a list of all the investment
banks that participated in the issue.

944
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:37,960
Um, and, uh, so, um,

945
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:45,310
so that's the basic process
that underwriters go
through to issue securities.

946
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:50,200
Now part of the thing is I
just wanted to close with,

947
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:55,270
uh,
basically I think that,

948
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:56,223
uh,

949
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:01,920
investment banks are very similar
to impresarios in what they do.

950
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:04,330
They,

951
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:09,330
but there's what I mean by an Impresario
is someone who manages a singer or a

952
01:06:09,821 --> 01:06:14,710
musician, uh, in concerts, uh, a,

953
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,440
uh, but it's a little different, but, uh,

954
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:22,500
a underwriter is managing the career of
a security just like somebody else would

955
01:06:23,501 --> 01:06:25,840
be managing the career of a singer.

956
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:31,650
And they're very concerned
about the reputation and
they're very concerned about

957
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:35,140
getting sold out performances
all the time. Now,

958
01:06:35,141 --> 01:06:38,560
one thing about Ipos is that,
uh,

959
01:06:38,570 --> 01:06:43,270
they are very hard to get a new security
for a new company going because nobody

960
01:06:43,271 --> 01:06:46,180
knows this company. And so, uh,

961
01:06:46,330 --> 01:06:50,590
the price movements of an
IPO tend to be very volatile.

962
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:51,791
Uh,

963
01:06:51,791 --> 01:06:56,791
and it's because of the difficulty
in getting IPO is going.

964
01:06:58,030 --> 01:07:02,380
Underwriters have peculiar practices,
uh,

965
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:06,640
in issuing them.
And it tends to go like this.

966
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:09,470
Underwriters tend,

967
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:14,510
and there's been a lot of documentation
of this to underprice Ipos that is,

968
01:07:16,421 --> 01:07:20,110
they sell them for less
than they could get.

969
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:21,693
Uh,

970
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:26,050
and that means that Ipos
tend to be oversubscribed.

971
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:31,390
Okay. Uh, and this sounds strange.
Why would it work this way?

972
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:36,190
So you, you, you can try this. Call
your broker if you have a broker.

973
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:41,750
Does anyone here have a
broker? Maybe somebody does,
but think about this anyway.

974
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,730
You could call a broker and fire and say,
Hey,

975
01:07:45,731 --> 01:07:49,900
I hear about IPO as I'd like
to get in on some. Okay.

976
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:54,250
What do you think the broker will
say? Well, the broker will say,

977
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:58,540
okay, let me see what I can do for
you. And he doesn't call you back.

978
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:04,130
And You wonder, well, why does this
person not want my business? Uh, well,

979
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,810
the reason is that you haven't
been a good guy yet. You know,

980
01:08:06,811 --> 01:08:09,970
you haven't been giving the
broker other business, uh,

981
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:15,070
and you hear stories about IPO
is that did spectacularly well.

982
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:21,060
Uh, yeah, jumped 30% on the first day
and you say, Hey, I want that. Um,

983
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:25,700
but um,
it becomes sort of a game they're playing.

984
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:30,430
It's a little bit like
trying to get tickets to some
rare concert. Okay. I mean,

985
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:35,030
people will sometimes, or there's a,
someone coming to a toads who's, I don't,

986
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:35,811
I don't go there,

987
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:40,520
but if you know about someone who's
very famous is coming to toads, right?

988
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:42,860
And you have trouble getting tickets,
is that right?

989
01:08:42,861 --> 01:08:45,920
Does anything like this happen here?
It happened somewhere anyway.

990
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:50,240
And so you might end up standing in line
for hours and the first time the ticket

991
01:08:50,241 --> 01:08:55,130
office opens, right? And then it
sets up rumors going that, wow,

992
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:59,270
you know, this is a difficult
concert to get into. Uh,

993
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:04,280
and then people start trading the tickets
afterwards or someone out there asking

994
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:06,800
more money than it says on the ticket.

995
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:11,810
We have to understand that that whole
event was staged by an Impresario.

996
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:16,670
Right? So there's someone who responsible
for the reputation of this performer.

997
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:18,770
Okay.
And this guy says,

998
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:22,040
there's no way that our performance is
going to go in and perform to a half

999
01:09:22,041 --> 01:09:22,874
empty house.

1000
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:26,450
We've got to pack them in and we
want people lining up on the streets.

1001
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:30,800
Cause it sense, it gives a sense of
excitement that this person is a star.

1002
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:32,300
But you know this,
right?

1003
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:37,610
The stars are managed and they're
not just spectacularly good singers.

1004
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:38,161
They're,

1005
01:09:38,161 --> 01:09:43,161
the Impresario is critically important
in maintaining the career of a singer and

1006
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:46,760
the [inaudible].
I was very concerned about appearances.

1007
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:52,190
And so you don't want to charge a really
high price to get into toads because

1008
01:09:52,191 --> 01:09:55,680
then it would only be wealthy people
from the suburbs would becoming,

1009
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:58,970
and it would destroy the whole
atmosphere of the place, right?

1010
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:02,900
So you've got to charge
reasonably low price tickets. Uh,

1011
01:10:02,901 --> 01:10:06,470
and then a lot of people will
come flocking to you. Uh,

1012
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:07,970
and then that would create the excitement.

1013
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:11,180
The underwriters do the
same thing with Ipos.

1014
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:15,550
So they under priced them typically,
and it creates this huge, uh,

1015
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:20,270
excitement about, can I get
in on this IPO? Uh, and,

1016
01:10:20,271 --> 01:10:25,250
um, and that excitement
generates more business.

1017
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:28,820
So, uh, and it also generates a
reputation for the underwriter.

1018
01:10:28,821 --> 01:10:31,970
People see the tombstone
and they know that this,

1019
01:10:32,210 --> 01:10:36,530
this IPO did extremely well.
It jumped up, you know,

1020
01:10:36,531 --> 01:10:40,850
a high amount in the first day and
people think this underwriter is really

1021
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:44,090
something I want to get in and
other offerings of that underwriter.

1022
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,150
And so the reputation of
the underwriter grows.

1023
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:52,310
So it's really a reputation business
and these people know something about

1024
01:10:52,311 --> 01:10:54,890
investor psychology and uh,
you,

1025
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,590
you might consider it some
kind of market manipulation,

1026
01:10:57,950 --> 01:11:02,420
but it's all perfectly legal because
the sec allows this kind of thing. But,

1027
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:05,090
uh,
so anyway,

1028
01:11:05,091 --> 01:11:10,091
coming back to the problem that we're
having now is that I'm emphasizing that

1029
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,280
investment bankers need reputation there.

1030
01:11:14,281 --> 01:11:17,310
Their whole business is
a reputation business.

1031
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:20,010
And so when something
happens to bear Stearns,

1032
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:22,110
it's critical for the whole industry.

1033
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:27,210
And now when it's happening repeatedly
to various other banks, uh, it becomes a,

1034
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:30,900
uh, a critical turning
point. Uh, so the market,

1035
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:35,190
the stock market went up a lot yesterday
because of the encouraging news that

1036
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:39,060
some of these investment banks were
able to raise more capital. Uh,

1037
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,820
and it's an ongoing saga,

1038
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:45,220
but it's all Kusamba that's
played out in terms of investment.

1039
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:50,290
And so I find it difficult to predict
what's going to happen next. Uh,

1040
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:54,660
it's very hard to know.
Um, right now, yes,

1041
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:57,240
as of yesterday,
we had some encouraging news,

1042
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:59,580
but this is something that we'll
just have to keep watching.

1043
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,560
I think this will play out over a years.

1044
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:04,140
This thing is not going
to be over tomorrow,

1045
01:12:04,141 --> 01:12:08,630
so we'll have more interesting things to
talk about later this semester. And, uh,

1046
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:13,770
there'll be things to watch, uh, to
follow up on over the years. Okay.

1047
01:12:13,771 --> 01:12:17,100
So we're going to talk next period
about investment management.
