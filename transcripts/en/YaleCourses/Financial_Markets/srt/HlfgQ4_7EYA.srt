1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,210
Okay. Uh, if we can begin today,

2
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:08,070
we have a very special lecture.

3
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:12,810
I'm very pleased to introduce
Carl Icahn as our lecturer. Uh,

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,920
Mr icon has a career that is really,
uh,

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,230
relevant to some of the topics we've
talked about in this course. Uh,

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,190
one theme we've talked about in
this course is corporate democracy.

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,110
And we've talked about a book written
by Burl and means who said that

8
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:36,111
shareholders are so dispersed that they
have really no control over a company.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,130
And boards of directors are
self perpetuating. Well,

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,550
Carl Icahn has made a career of,
uh,

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,050
of really opposing that tendency
in American business. Uh,

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,320
Carl Icahn graduated from Princeton
University premed in 1957,

13
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,600
a in 1968, he founded
icon and company. Uh,

14
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:05,601
and this company icon and company has
taken substantial shareholder positions in

15
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:10,410
a number of major corporations
including Rjr, Nabisco,

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,280
Twa, Texaco, Phillips
Petroleum, Time Warner,

17
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,900
a Motorola, uh, and when, uh,

18
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,930
icon and company takes
a position in a company,

19
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:26,931
it then becomes active in the management
of this company and in changing the way

20
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:31,680
they do business. And they've
done this with enormous success.

21
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,900
So, uh, Carl, I'm very pleased that
you could come and do this today.

22
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,443
See you,
Bob.

23
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,350
Uh, it would be really nice if you could
give some clues to our students here who

24
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:46,550
are themselves launching
out on careers of, uh,

25
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,460
how you got started in this and what
your philosophy is and what you would

26
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:51,470
recommend to them.
The

27
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,130
recovery or you're asking about.

28
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,510
I went down to Wall Street
back in way back in the 60s,

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,460
and I thought I was really,
uh, I had gone to Princeton,

30
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,430
a really good school and um, and uh, uh,

31
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,330
I had gotten in there
from a top high school.

32
00:02:09,331 --> 00:02:13,620
I was the first to go for my high school.
Nobody believed I right.

33
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,000
They never took an ivy league.

34
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,290
The Ivy League never took anybody from
this school I went to. But, uh, anyway,

35
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,550
I went,
got in and uh,

36
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:24,560
left there and I thought I was
real smart guy caught a shot,

37
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,970
went down to Wall Street and a,

38
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,990
worked with Jack Dryfus and I was playing
the market and 1961 and shows how old.

39
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:37,230
And, uh, in a, in a bull market,

40
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:40,080
you make a great deal of
money by doing leverage.

41
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:44,040
It's a little bit like today with all
the leverage that we had and now might be

42
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:48,750
coming to fruition. But, uh, I was,

43
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,910
I was borrowing money
and bought all these,

44
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:54,540
could have hurdle of those and I thought
I was a genius and Jack Drivers said,

45
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,560
you're going to lose all your money.

46
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:59,560
I had made a few bucks playing poker
and that's how I started about eight,

47
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,580
$10,000.

48
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,900
And I made all this
money by borrowing at 90%

49
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:11,180
and I would go out and make
it a lot more in until weeks.

50
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,730
So my father made it and two years and,
uh,

51
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,160
I saw father said, well, you know,
put some money away. I said, no, Dad,

52
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,480
I'm going to really make a fortune here.
But I went out.

53
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:26,590
I remember once I bought a Galaxie
convertible, then it was a beautiful car.

54
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:31,840
I had a beautiful girlfriend. It
was a model. It was pretty nice.

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,160
But uh, but uh, uh,

56
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,390
what happened,
the crash came in 1962.

57
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,170
I was wiped out in one day.
I didn't even have the poker winnings lap.

58
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,700
And I tell you, I can't recall, that's a
call left first. So the girl left first,

59
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:52,930
but it was pretty, it was pretty
close. Maybe just think day,

60
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,750
maybe the same day actually.
And um,

61
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,690
after that I learned and you
have to learn something and uh,

62
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,510
I became an expert in options and um,

63
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,110
after that I built a
following and built a big, uh,

64
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,230
a big following and a big
commission base by yeah,

65
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,750
just learning one area very well.

66
00:04:13,751 --> 00:04:17,300
Probably I knew that area better
than almost anyone on Wall Street to,

67
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,810
not to sound too presumptuous,
but very few people knew it,

68
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:22,510
so it doesn't mean very much.
But in any event,

69
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,000
I will build up a big
following in 68 boards,

70
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,360
the seat on the stock
exchange with the help of, uh,

71
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,780
one of my uncles and I time I saved a
pretty big amount of money for those days.

72
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,600
And then, uh, I got into
arbitrage but not merger.

73
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:43,960
Botified and that's something else
you could learn where you can,

74
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,540
where you can do it.
You still do it today,

75
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:48,370
but it's much tougher
with all these computers.

76
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:52,550
So I don't do it because I
don't understand the computers
they'd beyond me. So,

77
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:56,470
uh, I don't, I don't work with them to,

78
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:59,740
well like being a little
facetious but not too fussy.

79
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,160
So you could buy different convertible
bonds and short the stocks against them.

80
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:08,170
You had no risk but you
could make a lot of money.

81
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:11,110
And eventually we did real well
with that and what I do today.

82
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:13,840
So it's pretty much the same idea.

83
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:18,040
You buy stocks in a
company that is cheap and,

84
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,070
and you look at the asset value of the
companies that you buy the stocks in and

85
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:25,750
it becomes a little more complex.

86
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,130
But basically you look for the reason
that they're there. They're really cheap.

87
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:34,870
And the major reason is often and
usually a very poor management.

88
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,260
So in a sense it's like
an arbitrage can go in,

89
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,770
you buy a lot of stock in a company
and you then try to make changes at the

90
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:47,160
company. Today. If you read the
newspapers tomorrow, you'll read them.

91
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,510
We're trying to do the
same thing at Motorola.

92
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,370
And if you bothered to read
the Wall Street Journal
tomorrow, or maybe the times,

93
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:57,890
I don't know, you'll see a little
bit of what we're to do there.

94
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,860
We're trying to get them to change
the structure of the company.

95
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:05,260
We think the board is very, is
very poor board there. And uh,

96
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:07,910
we're trying to change what happens.

97
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,950
The other thing about corporate America,

98
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:17,540
a few people that go to college
where you are now and, and,

99
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,800
and most people in
America don't realize how,

100
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,560
how poorly most of our companies
are run in this country. Uh,

101
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,540
with many exceptions. There's,
they're really very poor.

102
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:36,350
And when you get inside the
companies, you realize that. And,

103
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,790
and the real reason is
there's no accountability.

104
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,390
There's no corporate democracy. And I've
been staying in that, proselytizing it,

105
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:45,224
writing about it.

106
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,900
And the reason that we can make so much
money when we go into one of these is,

107
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,920
I'm not even a manager. I never took
a course in management. And, uh, uh,

108
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,820
I wouldn't profess to really know much,
but I don't micromanage.

109
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:02,810
I put in a very good manager,
they cut the heck out of a cost,

110
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,020
but they changed the
structure of the companies.

111
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,650
And this is the problem in
American today in my opinion,

112
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:12,830
that we are basically under managed.

113
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:17,890
We can't compete because the best and
the brightest don't get to be at the top

114
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,070
of the corporate ladder.
And I,

115
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:24,920
I was sort of a metaphor
that's a little facetious,

116
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:29,600
but not completely about it.
I call it anti Darwinian.

117
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:35,130
It's anti Darwinian in
American's corporations and
that means the guy goes to

118
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:39,640
college and did this and this,

119
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:44,660
the guy that gets to be the CEO and
he's in college and he's the kind of guy

120
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:48,800
that, you know, was the
president of the fraternity.

121
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,590
Now all these presidents of
fraternities aren't bad guys,

122
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:56,390
but basically the normal guy
that I remembered it college was,

123
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,410
he's always there at the fraternity or
the Ed club and he's always had to be

124
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:05,050
there. If you have a bad day, you walk
over to the club and get feeling bad,

125
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,110
your girlfriend left,

126
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,700
you did bad on a test score or
whatever and you go over there.

127
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:14,060
He's always there, buys you a
drag and you sit around with him.

128
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,270
He commiserates with,
yeah,

129
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,940
you play a little pool or whatever
and he tells you whatever it is.

130
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:23,090
Yeah, by girl left me
all, they're all no good.

131
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,280
Usual conversation back and forth.

132
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:29,840
And what would happen would be your life
again. You can't help it. Like if you do,

133
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,020
just to wonder a little bit when the hell
did he ever do any work. But you know,

134
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,940
he was always there for him
and he never made money waves.

135
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:42,941
He was never said anything too obtrusive
or we never show too much intelligence.

136
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:46,730
But he was a good guy.
He goes,

137
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:51,330
that same guy goes out into
corporate America and he,

138
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,010
he politically, he's a student. He
knows how to get along with you.

139
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,660
And
he never really rocks the boat.

140
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,670
He never comes up with any great ideas.

141
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:09,900
He's not a threat to a superior.
And as a result,

142
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:11,860
he moves up the ladder because we,

143
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:15,030
because they're really
in corporate America,

144
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:17,190
there's really very little accountability.

145
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,630
And what happens in corporate America,
he moves up that ladder.

146
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,710
There's a good show how to succeed in
business. That was ag many years ago.

147
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:29,400
That sort of sums it
up. You know, if you say

148
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,470
if a genius has an idea or in corporate
America that junior has an idea,

149
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,250
the next idea is to give
them an idea to resign.

150
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,680
And so he moves along the ladder and he
gets to it and he gets up slowly up to

151
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,580
the top,
I guess too.

152
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:51,320
He has to a attribute fees likable,

153
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,830
he's politically astute and he used
this survivor and he knows when he's

154
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:59,040
threatened and it gets to the top.

155
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:03,270
And this is the attributes of today's
CEOs for the most part with exceptions.

156
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,240
So you know, he doesn't ruffle feathers,
he doesn't get the board of upset.

157
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,160
And as he moves up the ladder,

158
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,730
he finally gets to be
number two to the CEO.

159
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,790
Now the CEO is the same as the same
attributes where he doesn't want to be

160
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:21,360
threatened and it's violent.

161
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,640
So the CEO will never let anybody be
number two who's smarter than he is.

162
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:31,770
So by definition,
this the assistant of the CEO,

163
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,520
there's a little dumber than the CEO.

164
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,090
Now there's this guy now is the assistant.

165
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:43,500
The board likes the CEO eventually
retires and they make this guy,

166
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,860
the CEO, the fraternity president
would talk in a bit. Now he's the,

167
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,940
he's now the head guy to see him and
he'll bring in a number two guy that's a

168
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:56,490
little dumber than he is because
he doesn't want to be threatened.

169
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,750
So by definition will be run by morons.
I wouldn't pretty soon,

170
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:05,310
and we're not too far from that right
now, but I'm not from that point in, in,

171
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,610
in our economic history.
And so

172
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,900
this is a problem that we have now.

173
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,950
We've been able to do okay in
this country in pretty well,

174
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:21,951
even with the fact that were badly managed
because over the last 20 years we've

175
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:27,270
had a pretty free prewrite we've
gotten from all over the world.

176
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:31,560
The whole global economy has been booming
and we've been able to get cheap goods.

177
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,420
And these cheap goods kept us from
having inflation. So very simply put,

178
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,980
if you don't have inflation,

179
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:43,050
it's easy for the Federal Reserve to
keep pumping money into an economy.

180
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:48,450
So they, so money kept flowing you and
he was throwing up at a punch ball.

181
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:53,451
The country was at a party and we kept
drinking from this punchbowl enjoying and

182
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:55,220
the rest of the world
would take out dollars.

183
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:59,020
They would take our dollars cause
everybody thought, oh America, you know,

184
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:03,520
it's great. It's a little bit like it
came from some town, you know, and,

185
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,080
and, and there's one family
in the town that, you know,

186
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:12,040
doesn't do much work, sort of probably
goods, raw wire around the pool,

187
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:17,041
how fun party and a lot of
the big cars and have the,

188
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:19,930
the good times and the rest of
the time works hard, you know,

189
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:23,860
and the farms or wherever they are
and they keep bringing stuff to this.

190
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,090
Rich families have stayed, you know,
they give them whatever they want.

191
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:31,270
They give him food, they give
them slowly. But you know,

192
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,990
anything in the Bloomberg family just
gives him IOUs and they keep taking the

193
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:36,880
[inaudible]. So the rich
family, does it do anything,

194
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:41,470
just lie around the pool and have fun
and travel or whatever and they're,

195
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:44,500
everybody's working well. One day,
a few of these people are gonna say,

196
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:46,300
I don't want your IOUs anymore.
You know,

197
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:49,020
what the hell am I going to take your
eye on users? Worthless cause you to go,

198
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,470
you know you lost all your money.

199
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:55,330
Well I country think about it is a bit
of not situation we've been given our

200
00:12:55,331 --> 00:12:55,841
audio use,

201
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:59,910
which are dollar bills to the rest of
the world and taking that cheap goods.

202
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,413
However,

203
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:06,300
we're reaching a point now where the
dollar as you've been reading, if you're,

204
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:10,210
if you're, if you're attuned to it,
the dollar's devaluating as we speak.

205
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,990
And we got a, I believe a real
problem on our hands and the economy.

206
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,650
The other thing we've done
in the last five, 10 years,

207
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:21,220
and I know Bob I'm sure has been talking
to you about this, there's housing.

208
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,580
Housing is like tulip bulbs off they,
they got,

209
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,281
you know,

210
00:13:27,281 --> 00:13:32,050
there was a big crisis in Holland
in the 16 hundreds on tool of bows.

211
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:33,460
And I like reading about these crises.

212
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,850
It cause everybody bought or what
tool of us, one of the greatest.

213
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:39,640
The one guy looks and says, Hey, what
the hell am I doing with is to have both.

214
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:43,210
And all of a sudden he got a crisis.
Well,

215
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:48,130
and I'm not going to get into
the depth of it, but banks,

216
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:51,790
because they wanted to make more and
more money and our investment banks,

217
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:56,791
Wall Street kept issuing
different paper against mortgages.

218
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,680
So it made it simple to give a mortgage.

219
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,990
So these mortgages were given out
to people that couldn't afford them.

220
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:10,360
And today you have what you call
subprime mortgages, subprime paper.

221
00:14:10,361 --> 00:14:13,730
They issued against his favorite stuff,
go a mortgage back security.

222
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,920
They securitize them.

223
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,870
And these things are all floating around
out and there's maybe about $3 trillion

224
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:24,040
worth of stuff I'm in all day mortgage
out there. Well, as you've seen,

225
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,370
these haven't produced
prices of confidence and I
don't think we've heard the

226
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:33,550
last of, and the government sort
of bailed out of the situation.

227
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,780
But I have a JP Morgan takeover,
bear Stearns,

228
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,980
and when I'm not going to
get an a depth of it here,

229
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:42,160
but it's a real fascinating story.
In any event,

230
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,520
we have a problem of,
of,

231
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:50,390
of problems in our economy. And, uh,

232
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,470
I think that,
uh,

233
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,560
we are going to see more of these
problems and the next year or so I think,

234
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:04,220
uh, Bob and talk to you more about
what's going to happen in housing.

235
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:08,720
But a lot of it depends
on that because if,

236
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:12,770
if you can't have your
housing prices go back up,

237
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,200
a lot of these pay,

238
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,680
a lot of the people that bought them
can't afford to pay the mortgages,

239
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,370
nor would they want to.
If they see the homes go down in value,

240
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:26,120
they are going to just say, oh, they're
going to walk away. Now if that happens,

241
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,853
these homes,

242
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,960
other collaterals and the banks for all
these mortgages and we're going to have

243
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,150
and probably do have already a recession.

244
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,510
And that recession could become
a lot more cute because today,

245
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,930
uh, and I'm not going to go, I'm just
gonna open it for questions soon.

246
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,260
But today there is fixed trillion dollars
more of debt in this economy that I

247
00:15:56,391 --> 00:16:00,560
believe that can sustain
because everyone in the middle,

248
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,910
the middle class and
the went on a borrowed,

249
00:16:03,911 --> 00:16:07,540
we'd been shoulder the last few years
to buy these homes. It's a buy for any,

250
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,240
you know, with the credit cards and
go buy anything they felt like buying.

251
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:16,460
And as a result, I'm not certain that
they can pay that 6 trillion back,

252
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:20,960
but even if they can,
they're not going to be willing to go buy,

253
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,630
uh, they're not going to
be willing to go buy uh,

254
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,070
more things. So as you, as you have that
happening and you have an inflation,

255
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:35,840
the earnings of our corporations
will go down and they estimate,

256
00:16:35,841 --> 00:16:40,580
I've talked to one or two very,
a good economist in the last few weeks.

257
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,950
They estimate that earnings of the s
and p averages will go down about 20% of

258
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:47,240
the next year.
With that,

259
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,660
the stock market is at a,
I would say a precipice.

260
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:56,090
You don't know which way it's going
to go. So, with all that said,

261
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,780
you have to worry about
about all these things.

262
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,150
And I know you're studying this
and you're learning about it,

263
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,100
but I think there'll be great
opportunities ahead for it. It did.

264
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:12,130
And the ability for Wall Street who
again to girl dies and buy a lot of,

265
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:15,980
uh, a lot of these companies,
if you have capitals,

266
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,240
you'll be able to buy these vibes.

267
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:21,200
So I do tell you that I think
Wall Street is certainly

268
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:28,040
a good area. If you thinking
about a career, I still
think it's a very good area,

269
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:31,500
but I, you know, I'm not going to
tell you if you love to writer,

270
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:36,020
you'll love to play the cello to
go and come to Wall Street. But,

271
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:39,740
but I do think it's a good career.
I think it makes sense.

272
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,810
I think that corporate
America is learnings from this
and I think we're going to

273
00:17:49,591 --> 00:17:52,950
make our top management much more
accountable in the years ahead.

274
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,130
There were tremendous abuses of
corporate America. Today, a year CEO,

275
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,100
I'll make school a hundred times the what?
The average worker mate.

276
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,040
And he's just simply not worth it.

277
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,210
And the reason you have this is that you,

278
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:14,360
you have no accountability.
That shell,

279
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,920
the simply don't vote.
They don't care about voting.

280
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:18,360
And as the whole reason for that,

281
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:22,410
you like you'll have an incident as dean
relation with the owners of a lot about

282
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:22,890
stocks,

283
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,880
which are the mutual funds
and institutions that
don't like to vote against

284
00:18:26,881 --> 00:18:28,410
these managers.
However,

285
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,150
someone like myself and a
few other activists do get
a vote now and we do get a

286
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:35,580
proxy fight going and we'll see,
for instance,

287
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,130
what happens in Motorola's
that we're doing as we speak.

288
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,320
And I think that that will
give an opportunity for
young people like yourselves

289
00:18:43,321 --> 00:18:47,400
to get into corporations in our country.
And

290
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:55,020
while I think Princeton is the,
might be a little better than Yale,

291
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:59,370
I think yellow is a good school. And
I think that all of you are, are, uh,

292
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,430
are really, uh, probably
the top, top, top of, of,

293
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:07,470
of the, of the, uh, of the, uh,

294
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,370
student body in this country
and going ahead in your lives.

295
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:19,040
I think that the corporations might
be a good blood place to look what,

296
00:19:19,361 --> 00:19:20,760
or Wall Street for that matter,

297
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:25,290
because I think there's going to
be a need for bright people and,

298
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,440
and I think that you'll be able to be
rewarded for it in the fact that there

299
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:36,660
will be accountability again.
Well that, well, when I say again,

300
00:19:36,661 --> 00:19:41,210
it never really was accountability.
So I think there will be, uh,

301
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:42,930
too,
like food,

302
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,580
corporate democracy will have to evolve
so that we can become competitive with

303
00:19:47,581 --> 00:19:52,110
the rest of the world again. So with that,
I'll just basically, I think Bob this,

304
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:56,220
leave it open to questions and
see if anybody has any comments.

305
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,390
ECON, you were mentioned in, uh, 1962,

306
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:06,160
you kind of blew up, uh, after that, uh,

307
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,970
entire tobacco and sued. Uh, did. Uh,

308
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:13,600
how did you regain your confidence?
And I guess most importantly,

309
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:18,610
how did you regain or gain the
confidence of a future investors?

310
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,960
Well, you're asking a few questions.
I mean, how did gain competence?

311
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:29,190
I don't think I have a lot of confidence
in my ability to understand what was

312
00:20:29,191 --> 00:20:33,990
going on.
I just learned that you have to really,

313
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,120
really work at something and
understand it. And little by little,

314
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:39,941
I mean it,

315
00:20:39,941 --> 00:20:44,941
what sort of interest and I'm a sort of
obsessive guy and I work real hard all

316
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:46,164
my life.

317
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:51,280
I really get it just topping
and I really delve into it.

318
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:56,080
And what I came up with was,
uh, a letter there at that time,

319
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,710
the people who stole these options that
were wealthy people across the country.

320
00:20:59,711 --> 00:21:01,750
And it's sort of interesting
that it's not around today,

321
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:06,520
but they would sell options, calls on
the stock. So if you, so if the, if,

322
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:11,200
if you're, uh, uh, uh,
someone who traded the market,

323
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:16,230
you'd like to buy an option on Xyz stock
and wealthier people across the country

324
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,570
would spell these options. We give you
the right today, you have the CPOA,

325
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,710
you know, it's much more computerized.
But then he would do it in the,

326
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,940
over the counter transactions.
And

327
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,790
I was really one of the first to come
in and say to people across the country

328
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:37,340
rather than to do it with your broker
who doesn't really understand this

329
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,100
business, rather than sell it, sell
it with my teammates. I was a broker,

330
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:45,000
is telling me, and little by little
people actually answered my ads,

331
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:46,420
I would put it out of an ad and say,

332
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,990
get to get to see what the true prices
are and what the real value should be for

333
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:56,240
that option that you're selling through
Merrill Lynch who sell them with nation

334
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,600
those days or whoever.
And we,

335
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,230
I get letters from all over the country
and literally I'd stay down at Wall

336
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,860
Street till midnight calling people in
California that would write in for this,

337
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,720
uh, for this letter. And we built up
a big following because I was really,

338
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,940
uh,
the risk of being modest,

339
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:16,960
the only real honest guy in that
business because everybody, I mean,

340
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,080
not that they were dishonest,
but you know,

341
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,450
the brokers didn't care and they get
business back from who you sell it to.

342
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:25,330
I'm not saying that we did anything,
you know, criminal or I'd say,

343
00:22:25,331 --> 00:22:30,210
but nobody really cares to get the
right price for these people. And, and,

344
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,950
and so by getting them the right price,

345
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,780
they would stay with me as customers
for years and years. So we, we, uh, uh,

346
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:40,930
you know, built it up and built it
up. And then I got one assistant,

347
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,760
then I got another assistant and I,
and I kept,

348
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,830
and I kept moving up the ladder,

349
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,360
but it took a lot of hard
work and perseverance and
that's really where it went

350
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:55,210
to from there was arbitrage.
And now what I do.

351
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,000
What was the second part of your question?
I forgot.

352
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,560
How did you regain confidence
in your investors and people
who gave money to you?

353
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,540
Uh, did you feel confident
that you could give,

354
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,600
get them to give you money after
you had a kind of wash yourself out?

355
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,610
Well No, I told you that, that we have
that letter and that we were able to, uh,

356
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,820
we were, we were able to
amp to the letter, have the,

357
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:26,610
I don't know if he heard me because like
I was talking to telling you that we,

358
00:23:26,611 --> 00:23:30,890
uh, we, we, we put the letter out
and then we just gave him a good, uh,

359
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,120
but the thing,
yeah.

360
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,840
Okay. All right. How are you?

361
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,990
Hi,
I'm mark [inaudible] or how are you,

362
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,130
I actually have three questions
for you, but, um, I'll start

363
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,030
with the first one.

364
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,590
I watched the 60 minutes special on you
recently and they try to portray that

365
00:23:51,591 --> 00:23:55,220
there'd been kind of an
evolution in your career. Uh,

366
00:23:55,310 --> 00:24:00,170
they showed some bad press from the 80s
with the TWA deal and then they showed

367
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:04,850
some good press recently with the so
called icon uplift and some of the

368
00:24:04,851 --> 00:24:09,560
political, I mean the, um, uh, corporate
activism that you've been engaged in.

369
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,240
And in that interview you sort of
insisted that you hadn't changed at all.

370
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:18,440
And I was just curious if you had changed
and he didn't want to tell a reporter

371
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,470
or if the media was giving you a bad rap,

372
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,320
why can't hear the whole question,
but I haven't changed.

373
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,650
I haven't changed it off.
They call me,

374
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:36,010
they call me to call you an activist,
you know, I mean, I haven't really, uh,

375
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:41,230
I think what we do though
is very, uh, it's very, uh,

376
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,540
helpful to all investors.
I mean,

377
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:46,210
I think that's the point because
when we get into the company,

378
00:24:46,211 --> 00:24:50,170
the stock goes up for everybody.
So it really works out. But, uh,

379
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,830
but I've never changed what I do.

380
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,380
Okay.

381
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:58,550
Okay. Uh, actually I had
two more questions. Um,

382
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,690
the second question was about China and
there was a special report in the recent

383
00:25:03,691 --> 00:25:06,300
economist talking about the,

384
00:25:06,301 --> 00:25:11,301
a ravenous appetite the China has
for national resources right now.

385
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,220
And I was curious what you thought the,

386
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:17,550
the effect that would have on global
financial markets and your investing

387
00:25:17,551 --> 00:25:18,384
strategy.

388
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,583
Okay.

389
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:25,080
Well, yeah, I mean,
giant shiner is, is, uh,

390
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,060
is the great fire of, of,

391
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:35,150
of low, of, of these commodities. The
trouble with this country is we don't,

392
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,420
we don't have a lot of that.
We don't have a lot of natural resources.

393
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:43,421
So sell them hanging in the question
really what this country does,

394
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,190
we make software, we make technology.
We were in innovative, but so are they.

395
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:54,550
So what we really have to do is become a
lot more productive and we have to make

396
00:25:56,151 --> 00:25:57,920
our companies a lot more competitive.

397
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,420
And today I feel we're losing that Ed.

398
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:05,360
So while China is going
to continue to buy things,

399
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,820
it doesn't mean they're going to buy
them from us. And that's a fairly,

400
00:26:07,821 --> 00:26:10,130
even though the dollar has
gone down a great deal.

401
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,910
Thank you. Uh, this is my last
question. Um, New York Times columnist,

402
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:21,930
David Brooks gave a great commencement
speech last year at wake forest and he

403
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:23,190
said he was,
uh,

404
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:28,240
a journalist who led a boring life
and observed interesting lives,

405
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,300
uh, people like you.
And I was curious. Um,

406
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,720
you mentioned that a lot of
the great people that he'd
met, successful people, um,

407
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,540
had lots of pictures of dead
people on the walls. Uh,

408
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,690
meaning that they had conversations.

409
00:26:42,691 --> 00:26:45,840
He said famous people on pictures
of themselves on the wall,

410
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,750
truly famous people at pictures
of dead people on the walls.

411
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:53,370
And I was curious if you had any pictures
of great historical figures or what

412
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:57,960
historical figures inspired you or
influenced you on a regular basis?

413
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,190
Good question. I, uh,

414
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,650
well one of the greatest,
uh,

415
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:11,540
lots of his I ever read was
Aristotle Nica and ethics.

416
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:14,310
If you read it and make a, a great, uh,

417
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,620
a great deal of stance where
you live with this golden mean,

418
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,430
but at the end, use
your intellect. I mean,

419
00:27:22,431 --> 00:27:26,090
now you have to really read them in
depth to understand what he's saying.

420
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:31,300
And then, um, and then there's
a poem by Roger Kipling.

421
00:27:31,301 --> 00:27:33,860
And I like if I'm sure a lot
of you read it, you know,

422
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,490
if you can keep your head about you and
we'll lose him as I read that every once

423
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:39,360
in a while and,
uh,

424
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,750
in the code that we follow,
that's really important to be able to

425
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,810
meet with triumph and disaster. You know,
and not let either of those imposters

426
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,800
treat those imposters just the same
meaning that if you're doing great,

427
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,890
don't think you're a genius
than if you're doing badly.

428
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:04,610
Don't think the world comes to an end.
And if you work hard,

429
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,190
if you work hard, maybe south
drive, but if you worked on,

430
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:11,480
and don't let your ego get ahead of you
with so many people do when you're doing

431
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:15,470
well, and don't let yourself
become too despondent.

432
00:28:15,471 --> 00:28:19,850
If you're not doing well for awhile,
then I have faith in your own ability,

433
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:23,020
uh, and, and, and,

434
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:27,740
and really work hard at whatever you do.
Give it everything you have.

435
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:29,060
Whether if you can do all that,

436
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,740
I think the chances are that
you're gonna hit a lucky streak.

437
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,670
He goes, luck comes and goes. If you have
your health, what comes and goes. And uh,

438
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,510
realized when you, when you're
doing really well that it's not

439
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,780
just you and then when you're not,
it's not just you either.

440
00:28:50,781 --> 00:28:53,810
So I think that kind of thing.
You should read that poem.

441
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,610
I like the line where it's,

442
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,990
if you can be in a crowd but not
lose the common touch, that's fine.

443
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:01,900
That's right.
That's right.

444
00:29:01,901 --> 00:29:04,310
If you could walk in a
crowd and still not lose,

445
00:29:04,311 --> 00:29:08,510
but if you can walk with kings and
that moves the common. Yeah. Okay.

446
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,323
Yup.

447
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,920
I've never walked with Kenzo so I don't
have to worry about losing the common

448
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,600
touch cause I'm not walking with him.

449
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,053
Hmm.

450
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:24,490
Hi, miss drag on. I have two
questions. My first question is,

451
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:29,020
to what extent can investors like us
adopt your strategy of buying cheap

452
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,210
unexpecting the value
of a company to go up?

453
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,080
Well, I mean, I don't consider that to
be very lean as strategy. I think that,

454
00:29:37,081 --> 00:29:41,170
uh, when you, when you
buy sampling, the best is,

455
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:43,060
it sounds simple.
It's not simple.

456
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:48,280
So by generally when everybody
thinks you're wrong and if it,

457
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,130
and the more people I think you're wrong,

458
00:29:50,131 --> 00:29:53,700
the better you're going
to do it in a long run.

459
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:59,580
That's how it works.
Because at the end of the day,

460
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:04,380
when everybody is against you, everybody
sorta stole. You know, so it, it,

461
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,950
it's very hard to do it psychologically,
but

462
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:12,580
at certain times you're in between and
you're not going to get the benefit of

463
00:30:12,581 --> 00:30:17,450
that. But, uh, the old grave,

464
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:21,850
a dog philosophy that you,
you should just look at value.

465
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:27,710
But one of the things is when
people get given up on a company,

466
00:30:29,531 --> 00:30:31,050
that's the perfect dog.
But it,

467
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:35,560
but it doesn't always work because you
don't have to be damn sure you're right.

468
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:37,090
I mean,
sometimes everybody is right,

469
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:41,560
but generally it's not
true that they're right.

470
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,720
Generally if you look at the total,

471
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:52,070
uh, outlook on a company
and if everybody saw it,

472
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,820
it is down on it.
That's one to look at.

473
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,230
Thank you.
And my second question is,

474
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,700
what in your opinion these days do you
see I was going to do to be successful?

475
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,240
So they need more education,
experience, industry knowledge.

476
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:09,420
I take,
I think the answer is,

477
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:14,490
I think the answer is that most of
them have to have to leave the company.

478
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,173
Okay.

479
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,690
But there'll be a little more

480
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:24,820
good.

481
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,610
You'll be a little more fair
about it. Uh, uh, the, the CEOS

482
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,510
okay.

483
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,850
Uh, have a lot of companies probably
could do a good job, but, um,

484
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,710
they, they, they're more
it into building up. Um,

485
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,860
it's like the royal we,
you know,

486
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:47,300
it's more like the imperial CEO and they
build up a huge amount of people around

487
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:49,400
them and they very rarely,

488
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,090
okay,

489
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:53,360
get to the nub of the problem.
And some of them are probably okay,

490
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:57,230
probably good guys,
but there's no accountability.

491
00:31:57,231 --> 00:32:00,920
It's like you go to school and you never
have passed and nobody ever bothers you.

492
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:05,510
And that's what really happens until they
really hit the bad times eight. And, uh,

493
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,970
and I guess you could say I'm
a bad time when I come in.

494
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:13,880
They don't like it too much,
you know? Uh, uh, uh, uh,

495
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,110
I think that

496
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:21,380
the problem we have today
is very simplistically,

497
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:24,320
you don't have true,
so you can't,

498
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:28,910
it's very hard to get rid of the studio
even though you theoretically have a

499
00:32:28,911 --> 00:32:31,040
boat. It's very hard to
use the boat. I mean,

500
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:36,041
do you imagine it a political
race that the senator is fighting?

501
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,400
Is the incumbent is fighting for an
election and he can take all the money out

502
00:32:42,051 --> 00:32:42,601
of Washington.

503
00:32:42,601 --> 00:32:45,200
Did he could take it out of the treasury
of the United States and the other guy

504
00:32:45,201 --> 00:32:49,220
can't, you know, and uh, it's completely,

505
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:54,280
it completely set up and rig for the
CEO because anybody coming in to fight

506
00:32:55,131 --> 00:32:58,170
them, they slew them to begin
with. You know, they, they see it.

507
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:02,480
They don't see me anymore, too much, cause
they know I'm not going away. But they,

508
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,051
they,
they,

509
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:08,051
so they do not let a ledger have,

510
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:13,210
I could go into all the different shark
repellents for all the mud. Um, it's,

511
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,860
it's very,
very difficult to beat one of these guys.

512
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:18,950
I think that's going to change
in the next four or five years.

513
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,810
That's what I was telling you.
And I think we're going to have a,

514
00:33:21,811 --> 00:33:23,990
a better corporate democracy,

515
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:27,890
which gives people with real talent
who are really with a work ethic, a,

516
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,390
a chance to really make it.

517
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:33,180
Mr Icon,
as you've touched upon it,

518
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,290
we may be in the worst credit
bubble in history currently.

519
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,760
If you are right,

520
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,870
the upcoming debt deflation
will be long and painful.

521
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,640
How would you recommend that investors
protect their wealth during this period

522
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:50,880
to take advantage of upcoming
investment opportunities?

523
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:57,240
Well, it's, it's all I
do recommend, uh, how,

524
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:59,610
how do we invest at
this time? I, you know,

525
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:04,440
it without knowing how
much capital you have, but,

526
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:07,650
but I would be again,
you know,

527
00:34:07,651 --> 00:34:10,800
I'd been a year at a different arena.
You know,

528
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:13,990
we invest and we look for these
opportunities now, but, uh,

529
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,660
I feel that, uh, you have to be
certainly very careful, right?

530
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:24,170
You have to be very careful in your
investment of your investments.

531
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,430
Even though the markets were
going up the last few days,

532
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,480
I would be careful and not have
all your money invested in stocks.

533
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,870
I would look at a lot of
these distressed debt.

534
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,330
Some of the distress
that that has gone down.

535
00:34:36,331 --> 00:34:38,220
I don't know if you understand that,
but some of the,

536
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,110
some of the debt that even even back then,
which was the highest level,

537
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,130
uh, I think is, is there,
is become very cheap.

538
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,950
So that kind of stuff
if something to look at,

539
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:53,610
but I'd be very careful in
buying equities, but I mean,

540
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:57,450
you certainly could make a
fortune by, and I'm, I mean, I,

541
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,160
I'm certainly not telling you
it's not going to work, but, uh,

542
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:05,810
I think it's all risk
reward and a lot of risk.

543
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,660
I wouldn't be looking at
this at the dead areas.

544
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,110
You mentioned, um, about the US
dollar falling in value recently.

545
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:20,030
What kind of a foreign currency vehicles
or training would you recommend to kind

546
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:23,540
of hedge your bet against the dollar,
assuming that it continues to fall?

547
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:24,930
Yeah,
I don't,

548
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:30,810
I don't know much about carbon seats
and I really don't get into something I

549
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:32,730
don't know,
something about or generally dog.

550
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,760
So I don't play the currency market
unfortunately because I current,

551
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,400
she's gone down so much and uh,
I,

552
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:46,450
I don't necessarily think that you
should do that now because it could

553
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:52,090
theoretically turn in this country,
but I'm only saying that, uh,

554
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:57,300
that it has become one of the
manifestations of our problems.

555
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,380
The currency of out of the dollar
has the wallet. But do you know,

556
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:04,050
you can't be that same whine
about everything in Asia either.

557
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:07,380
Everybody loves Asia now would love
Jina and loves all these countries.

558
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,350
What'd you kind have
some global problems too,

559
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:13,630
so I don't know that it's time to
rush out of the dollar, you know?

560
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,513
Yeah.

561
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:20,230
Hi, miss di Com. Why major
criticism that I'm CEO,

562
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:25,240
I can stomp top right activist says that
they think activists think longterm in

563
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,920
chase of cooperation.
They just want to get money and get out.

564
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,540
How do you answer to that?

565
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,160
I would just say that the,
uh,

566
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,820
that the facts don't bear that out as
far as I'm concerned. I mean if you wee,

567
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,650
I own quite a few companies. Any
company we, we got controller.

568
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,990
I put literally hundreds of
millions of dollars into, I made me,

569
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:54,460
I bought a company in 85 and rail car
company. We put a hundreds of millions.

570
00:36:54,461 --> 00:36:58,120
We still have the pleat.
I, uh, I kept the,

571
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:02,830
I bought casinos and energy companies
and over the years kept them,

572
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,440
sold them now,
but that's after 10 years.

573
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,930
So any company that we've been
able to get control of, uh,

574
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:12,790
I actually kept because getting
control is a great thing. And if you,

575
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,250
if you really believe that
management is not doing well,

576
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,920
you can go and clean them up and put it in
big guy. And so we, uh, we, we, I don't,

577
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:24,100
I know that criticized you like that,
but that's part of the propaganda machine.

578
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,540
We just not the fast,

579
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,490
um, I related question is that, um,

580
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:35,330
what do you do when your um,
uh,

581
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:39,450
activist spirit as now?
I appreciate that as a nutcase.

582
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,590
I Moto roll out when you
ask for a seat in the board,

583
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:46,670
but just the decline and, well,
well, what's your next step?

584
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,953
All right.

585
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,823
Hm.

586
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,650
You'll have your,
you have a,

587
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:56,970
you have a patient and now it was a year
later and we'll see what happens now.

588
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:01,170
But a Motorola is a good example
of what I'm talking about.

589
00:38:01,171 --> 00:38:05,710
People don't like it, they don't
like the cell phone business. But uh,

590
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:10,090
I really think that that business,
if you look at Motorola and study it,

591
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,720
you're buying that whole
business for nothing.

592
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,660
It's not reflected in the stock price.
And what they have to do,

593
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,430
and I've said it publicly,
is take that business out of Motorola,

594
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,530
spin it off and give
it to the shareholders.

595
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:25,260
And I think then you've
got a real good value.

596
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,420
So what I'm saying is nobody likes it now,

597
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,420
but hopefully I'm correct on that.

598
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,390
And I really think by
being an activist and,

599
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:36,370
and putting pressure on that board
that has done nothing really,

600
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:40,390
that I think eventually that will happen.

601
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:42,363
Hopefully.

602
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,280
Maybe we'll have one
or two more questions.

603
00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:47,940
Yeah.

604
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,590
Two more questions and then we'll wrap up.

605
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,233
Okay.

606
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:53,990
Mr Icon,

607
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,800
why does the United States have bad
corporate governance and which countries

608
00:39:00,021 --> 00:39:01,490
have better models?

609
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,950
All right.
We got bad corporate governance.

610
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:08,990
It's evolved into this.

611
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,320
I don't think that why she
didn't understand how bad it is.

612
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,620
Nobody's really focused on it.
The different states,

613
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,360
the way we structured
the different states,

614
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:22,370
one corporations to to register it and
therefore what the rules are such that

615
00:39:23,751 --> 00:39:27,620
they protect the corporation with the
poison pills and I can't get into all

616
00:39:27,621 --> 00:39:29,810
these different things.
Staggered boards, poison pills,

617
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:34,880
and I think if you just change some of
that, we could be like for instance,

618
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:38,990
England as much better.
Canada has much better where you could

619
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:45,820
without getting too detailed and simple
by this where you can't have two or

620
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:51,961
elections and the United States because
of the way they're structured in the

621
00:39:52,551 --> 00:39:56,990
stage, you know the division between
the federal and the state government,

622
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:02,300
the have not been able to
really Patel some of the abuses.

623
00:40:02,301 --> 00:40:04,910
But I think it will of
course sooner or later,

624
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,400
especially to have a bad recession.

625
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,890
You mentioned that you believe that
many companies are poorly managed.

626
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,860
Obviously you don't
invest in every company.

627
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,910
So I was wondering what factors you look
for in identifying companies that you

628
00:40:20,911 --> 00:40:25,020
want to invest in and that you
think are especially poorly managed.

629
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,510
Okay. We look at a lot of
company, it's obviously,

630
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:31,080
I have a whole group of people here that
do that and I have a bunch of lawyers

631
00:40:31,081 --> 00:40:34,650
that look at all the providence and lead
companies and their bylaws and their

632
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,940
charters. But really some of them

633
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:43,950
become very apparent. And when
you look at them, you can,

634
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:48,030
you can understand and you have to
see that it related to the economy.

635
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:52,720
But some of these companies, uh,
it's just the parents that, uh,

636
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:57,410
the value of these companies
would be much better if,

637
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,010
if they were, if they
were better run, well,

638
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:03,460
they just simply did certain
things like, you know, like,

639
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,300
like borrows examples later that
broke it off or he, you know,

640
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,920
and then some biotech companies
that we're involved in now,

641
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,430
there's a need to them by the big Pharma,
big Pharma.

642
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:16,680
It hasn't really done
research for years for many,

643
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,720
many marriages in the biotech area.

644
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:23,610
And therefore a biotech
companies are that well run.

645
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:27,090
But they do. They have spent a great
deal in research for, you know, uh,

646
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:31,850
the large molecule drugs and, and,

647
00:41:31,851 --> 00:41:36,400
and so therefore,
you look at the [inaudible],

648
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,960
some of them become
quite apparent African.

649
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:42,460
You're doing it for the years and years.
I've known him a lot of,

650
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,210
it's almost after you do all the work,
it's almost an inch thick, you know,

651
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:51,700
a there which could be at a
monitor too fast. You know, it's,

652
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:54,140
it's like asking some real
great tennis way. Well,

653
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:56,390
why did you move here instead of,
there are four core player, you know,

654
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:57,470
when you're running down the field,

655
00:41:57,471 --> 00:42:00,590
why didn't you go to this way
instead of that way when you're,

656
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:02,330
when you're running down the field.

657
00:42:02,331 --> 00:42:05,180
And I don't think you could tell you it's
just one of an instinct why you do it.

658
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,600
But that's after a lot of work on,

659
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,080
well, I think this has been a
very, uh, enlightening talk. Uh,

660
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,280
and Carl,
I want to thank you very much.

661
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:18,990
Thank you.
