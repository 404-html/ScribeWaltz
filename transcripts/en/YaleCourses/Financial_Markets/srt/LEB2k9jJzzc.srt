1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,700
Next wednesday, we're
having David Swensen, uh,

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,750
lecture to us,
uh,

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,720
and he heads up the Yale and dam or
the investment of the Yale endowment.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,300
Uh, and, uh, I have, uh, a New
York Times article on the syllabus,

5
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,850
just like sort of a biography of him. You
could read on reserve. I have his, uh,

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,350
uh, his recent books. Uh,

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:33,960
so I hope that you will get
a lot from him. Uh, he, uh,

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:37,830
I misspoke. He's not a Yale
College graduate. He's a yell.

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,870
He can omics phd is undergraduate,
was from University of Wisconsin.

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,310
Um, but he's been at Yale
for a very long time.

11
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:50,850
He came to Yale from Wall Street in 1985.

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,680
And at that time, the Yale endowment
was worth about $1 billion.

13
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,390
Uh,
it,

14
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,740
it is now under his
leadership 22.5 billion.

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,610
Uh, and that, that, uh, that,

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,520
that explains a lot of
the quality of your life.

17
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,380
Um, because that means we have
about $2 million per student.

18
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,920
Uh, and the interest on $2
million is a, what is that? Uh,

19
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,830
a hundred. I can't even do division. About
a hundred thousand dollars a year. Uh,

20
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,850
and so that's why a Yale is more,

21
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,680
much more generous with financial aid
than other universities and why we have

22
00:01:31,681 --> 00:01:34,980
beautiful Chris. This room was
built, I believe in the 30s.

23
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:40,620
I don't think David Swensen for this room,
but for a lot of other things.

24
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,410
Uh, so, uh,

25
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,200
Yale I had a 28% return on
its portfolio last year,

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,520
which was number one of
all college endowments. Uh,

27
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:55,550
moreover it had a 17.8% average
return for the last 10 years,

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,380
which is number one among
a university endowments.

29
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,660
Um, we beat Harvard, we
beat France, but actually,

30
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,050
uh,

31
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:12,050
Princeton was the head of the Princeton
endowment is a protege of David Swensen.

32
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,840
Uh, and I'm sure that these
people get together and talk.

33
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,690
All of the major university Harvard
has been doing very well too.

34
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:24,110
And so has a Duke Mit Amhurst a
lot of it seems that universities,

35
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:30,120
uh, managed to invest very well. Uh,
at least they have in recent decades.

36
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:32,010
I think that has my theory,

37
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,150
that has something to do with
the intellectual atmosphere
at universities that,

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,393
uh,

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:42,210
investing well in
requires a careful study.

40
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,440
And the intellectual tradition
we have at universities, uh,

41
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,740
helps promote the, so, uh,

42
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,410
I dunno if David Swinson can continue
to do this. I think we're, uh,

43
00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,040
he's had a spectacular return,
but he's getting into a challenging year.

44
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,860
This is a year of financial crises,

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,280
so I'm warning you ahead that don't expect
a 28% return and the yell portfolio,

46
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,790
uh, for the coming year. Um,
you can ask him about that.

47
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,540
I don't know if he can do it again
in this car and this situation.

48
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,430
That will be amazing. Uh, okay.

49
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:26,320
So that, that would be next Wednesday.
So, um, meanwhile, uh, I wanted to,

50
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,340
uh, talk today about
regulation. Uh, and, uh,

51
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:36,280
wow.
I think we're all right.

52
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,980
Um, yeah, something needs
more regulation here.

53
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:45,940
I think so, uh, all these wires.

54
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:49,683
So,
uh,

55
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:56,550
I wanted to motivate regulation in terms
of the last lecture that our previous

56
00:03:56,651 --> 00:04:01,651
lecture was about behavioral finance
and it was about human failings.

57
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,920
Uh, and I think that, uh,

58
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,880
we motivate a lot of our regulation of
financial markets by the kinds of errors

59
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:14,150
that people make. And I
wanted to list a few, uh,

60
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,420
uh, a few errors that are
well known, uh, and that,

61
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:24,590
uh, are exploited by unscrupulous
people in finance. Uh,

62
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:28,600
and so I think they motivate a
lot of what a regular itself.

63
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,890
I'm going to write a number of principles
of behavioral finance down and just

64
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:36,790
mention them briefly and then
we'll turn to regulation.

65
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,860
So,
uh,

66
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,030
these are things from
the field of psychology,

67
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,070
wishful thinking. This refers
to the fact that people, uh,

68
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,630
this sounds like something
you probably already know how,

69
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,460
but it's been documented by psychologist.

70
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,170
People tend to make the air of
believing what they want to believe.

71
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,460
All right. Uh, so for example, uh,

72
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,900
people tend to believe
that their team will win.

73
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:15,920
This has been documented by psychologist.
They have a bias. If you ask them,

74
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:20,450
what's the probability that Yale
or when the Yale Harvard game, uh,

75
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,370
don't expect ELL students
or Harvard students to give
a, by unbiased probability,

76
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,200
you tend to in your mind think
that you're going to win. Uh,

77
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:35,180
and this also applies to elections
and we just had a primary,

78
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:40,070
uh, uh, yesterday. People tend to assume
that the candidate that they believe in,

79
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,053
we'll win.

80
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,360
So it's well known and this is
something that can be exploited by,

81
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,490
uh, people selling investments. Uh,

82
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,560
second thing,
attention anomalies,

83
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,970
um,
uh,

84
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,550
these are a
human attention,

85
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:11,630
tends to be sporadic.
Uh, that is that you,

86
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,370
the errors that people naturally
make are often errors of inattention.

87
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,790
You'll look at certain
things and you overly, uh,

88
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,810
you pay too much attention to some
things and too little to others. Um,

89
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,640
this is, uh, uh,

90
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,210
this is something that psychologists have
been talking about for over a hundred

91
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,200
years. Uh, human attention is
part of human intelligence.

92
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:41,201
We have to know what to pay attention
to and people have who are not good and

93
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:43,850
focusing their attention
on the right things.

94
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,510
And that talking just about attention
deficit disorder and talking about some

95
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:52,340
more high level question of how you know,
what you should be paying attention to.

96
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,370
Uh, and, uh,

97
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,300
under attention there's a
social basis for attention.

98
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:08,730
And that is that people tend to pay
attention to what other people are paying

99
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:13,540
attention to. And so, uh, uh,

100
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,290
it's easy to sweep things under the rug
and get people to forget something. Uh,

101
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,780
the kinds of things that are naturally
talked about yet excessive attention and

102
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:27,360
the details tend to get forgotten.
Uh,

103
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,280
three is anchoring.

104
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,550
This refers to a,
uh,

105
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,560
a tendency for people in
making quantitative judgements
to subconsciously have

106
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:46,850
their judgments anchored
by some arbitrary stimulus.

107
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,240
Uh, and I mentioned
overconfidence last period.

108
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:54,590
We then tend to have overconfidence
in our anchor judgments.

109
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,380
Uh, so, um, the, the,

110
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,460
the classic experiment that demonstrated
anchoring was caught on an diverse,

111
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,180
I'm writing k and t a and a
wheel of fortune experiment,

112
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,530
which they did in 1974.
Uh,

113
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,530
what they did is they, uh, they,

114
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:22,250
they got subjects to participate
in a psychological experiment.

115
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,300
And the experiment consisted of
asking the subjects questions that had

116
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:30,530
quantitative answers, which were
always numbers from zero to 100.

117
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,350
Uh,
and then they said,

118
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:36,230
I want to ask you a question about
before you answered the question,

119
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,370
I'm going to spin a wheel of fortune.
You know, he, you know, the wheel of,

120
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,290
it's like one of those
things on quiz shows.

121
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,090
If you spin this big wheel that rotates
for awhile and then it stops at one

122
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:47,924
number,

123
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,440
obviously a random number because this
wheel of fortune head all the numbers

124
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:55,950
from zero to a hundred. Okay? So
one of the questions they asked was,

125
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,410
what percent of African nations
belong to the United Nations? Okay.

126
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,880
And,
uh,

127
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,770
that apparently is a difficult question
that most people didn't know in 1974.

128
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,440
But they were, they did it. They said,

129
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,380
we'll ask you the question and think
about while you're thinking about it,

130
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,200
don't answer yet.
We're going to spin this wheel of fortune.

131
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,570
And so it comes up with a random number.
Okay. Then they ask for the answer. Well,

132
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:25,410
it turns out that people tended to give
an answer close to the number that came

133
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:30,120
up on the wheel of fortune. All right? Now
they perfectly well knew that the real,

134
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,660
real unfortunate was random.
Uh, so, uh, the experimenters,

135
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,930
after they got the number, they say, hey,

136
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:41,190
your number is almost the same as
the number that just came up, uh,

137
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,310
and people with. And he said, did you
just give me the number that came off?

138
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:48,800
And FIFA would deny it. They would say,
oh no, I wasn't influenced by that number.

139
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,160
The point of anchoring is that you are
subconsciously influenced by numbers,

140
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,390
uh, and that it affects your
judgment. You think, you know.

141
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,060
So for example,
in looking at a stock part,

142
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,630
if you ask people to predict
a stock market price,

143
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,320
they think of some number
that they saw before, uh,

144
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:11,760
and they are overly influenced
by that number. So for example,

145
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,110
if in the late 1990s you
were to ask a question,

146
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:19,650
I'm hypothesizing, ah,
how likely is that the,

147
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,850
is that the Dow will be over 10,000 by,

148
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,760
by the year 2008.
Uh,

149
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,940
people might give that a low probability
because it had never been over 10,000.

150
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,410
And so they just had no psychological
anchoring on that number. Um,

151
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,180
so, uh, but once it passes 2000,
then it seems completely natural.

152
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,520
And that's anchoring related
to this is, um, the, uh,

153
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,280
representativeness heuristic.

154
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,190
I can't even write this this long.
We're representativeness heuristic.

155
00:10:58,191 --> 00:11:01,790
It seems to me that if you type this,
you'll get a spellcheck error.

156
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,300
Okay.

157
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,750
And that's kind of an first ski again.
Uh,

158
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,890
and it's related to anchoring in
some sense. What it means is that,

159
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,540
uh,

160
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:18,540
it refers to a human tendency to judge
events on the basis of similarity to

161
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,790
other events that are prominent in our,

162
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,490
in our mind without regard to the
actual probability of the event.

163
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,360
Uh, I'll give you a, and one of
condiment and diversity is examples.

164
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,660
People were asked, uh, to, uh,

165
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,960
judge the occupation of a young woman,

166
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:46,000
and it had a description of the young
woman and the woman was described as

167
00:11:46,001 --> 00:11:50,980
sensitive, artistic,
et cetera. Uh, and, uh,

168
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,520
then the occupation that they were
allowed where bank teller sculptress or

169
00:11:58,331 --> 00:12:00,620
something else. All right. Uh,

170
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,820
many people chose sculptress
because they thought, well,

171
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:08,620
if she's a sensitive artistic
woman, maybe she's a sculptress. Uh,

172
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:10,830
but that is a, uh, uh,

173
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:15,831
a terrible mistake because we should
know that sculptress is a very rare,

174
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,620
very few people have the job
of a sculptress or a sculptor.

175
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,810
Um, and so, uh, it's a mistake.
So what it means is that people,

176
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,840
well, gosh, and being caught here,

177
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,520
what it means is that that's the
stuff, that's why I ran my pocket. Uh,

178
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,880
what it means is that,
uh,

179
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:43,050
we sometimes exaggerate in our imagination
some rare event and it colors our

180
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:45,670
thinking. Uh, so for example,

181
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,700
the stock market crash of 1929 is
repeatedly re expected even though it only

182
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,570
happened once,
but it's just a prominent in our thinking.

183
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,760
And people are looking at stock prices
to see patterns that they remember that

184
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:03,970
are prominent in their thinking.
And then those patterns, uh,

185
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:09,480
are given an exaggerated probability.
Uh, so when we looked at the random walk,

186
00:13:09,481 --> 00:13:09,941
the series,

187
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:13,420
I think the representativeness heuristic
played a role in there as well.

188
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,310
When you're,
when you look at a random walk,

189
00:13:15,311 --> 00:13:19,480
you have the intuitive impression
that you can extrapolate it,

190
00:13:19,481 --> 00:13:22,390
but it doesn't look like you
can't believe. It's really random.

191
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,940
But the reason you can't is because you
overweight the probability of certain,

192
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,440
uh, things that caught your attention. Um,

193
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,050
okay. So, um, there's some Maura,

194
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,033
uh,

195
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,410
so a
five is gambling behaviors.

196
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,020
Anthropologists have found that,
uh,

197
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,680
gambling is present in all human cultures.
Not that everyone gambles,

198
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,873
but,
uh,

199
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:16,030
there will be you go to any human society
and ask about it and there will be

200
00:14:16,641 --> 00:14:20,970
some game of chance that
they play that, uh, uh,

201
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:25,690
that influences their thinking.
So, uh, the problem with,

202
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,680
uh,
uh,

203
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,530
there's a problem with gambling behavior
because in a certain fraction of the

204
00:14:33,531 --> 00:14:36,970
population, we have
pathological gambling. Uh,

205
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:42,130
one study estimated that 1.1% of men
and a half a percent of women for some

206
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:44,270
reason,
more common among men than women,

207
00:14:44,271 --> 00:14:47,270
but in both sexes are
pathological gamblers.

208
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,790
That means it's like alcoholism.

209
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,080
They cannot control themselves
and it ruins their lives.

210
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,910
They get divorces because the spouse
compliance that, you know, my,

211
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,050
my husband or wife gambled away the,

212
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,260
all of her money and dad,
but they can't stop themselves.

213
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,190
There's an organization called
gamblers anonymous, uh, which helps.

214
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,160
It's like alcoholics anonymous. It helps
people who are really in trouble. Uh,

215
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,030
and this is a problem.
Now.

216
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,420
I think the financial industry
attracts people like that.

217
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:25,730
And so your overrepresented, if people
who are not quite pathological, uh,

218
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,870
people who are stimulated
somehow by chance, uh,

219
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:35,370
uh, and, uh, that is a, um, uh,

220
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,140
a problem, uh, magical thinking.

221
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,330
Uh,
this refers,

222
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:49,620
this actually goes back to
BF. Skinner, a psychologist,

223
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,243
uh,
Hu

224
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,020
were asked in the first
half of this century,

225
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,560
I actually had him as a next door neighbor
is a strange thing. I was visiting, uh,

226
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:02,720
uh,

227
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Harvard and MIT in Cambridge and I rented
a house and this guy was next door.

228
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,640
And he and I both used to walk
into work together, not together.

229
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,720
I never really met him, but I always
felt an affinity with him. Now,

230
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:21,810
he must've died 20 years ago
now. But anyway, he did it.

231
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:25,880
Famous experiment, uh, with
pigeons, uh, which, uh,

232
00:16:25,881 --> 00:16:30,410
in the 1940s, uh, uh, 1948, uh,

233
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:35,690
in which he induced strange
behavior patterns in pigeons
by the following simple

234
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:38,870
experiment.
The experiment was the,

235
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:42,320
he would put the pigeon was in a cage,
okay.

236
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,890
And he'd let the pigeon get pretty
hungry, okay. And hungry pigeon.

237
00:16:46,891 --> 00:16:48,590
And so not happy patients.

238
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,100
And then he had a machine that granted
each pigeon one piece of corn every 15

239
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:57,710
seconds. Okay. Uh,

240
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:02,520
and so that's very frustratingly slow for
a hungry pigeon. They get it, a feast,

241
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,130
one piece every 15 seconds.
And then he observed through time,

242
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,480
uh, after subjecting pigeons
to this torture for some time,

243
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,520
they might be not approved by,
it's not really torture.

244
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:19,490
It's like dieting or something. You all
lived through that, right? But, uh, stem,

245
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,670
I torture for a vigil.
He noticed that the pigeons were,

246
00:17:22,671 --> 00:17:26,080
it started behaving in
strange ways. So, uh,

247
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,110
and he kept them separate so they
couldn't learn from each other. Uh,

248
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,890
one patient was jumping up and down a lot,
and another one was bobbing it's head.

249
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,350
And another one was doing
a kind of a little dance.

250
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,840
And what he concluded was these pigeons
were trying to figure out what makes

251
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:46,220
those pieces of corn calm. And
they started to think, well,

252
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,890
he had to get the interval between corns,
right to make this work. But he started,

253
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,100
the pigeons started to
think effectively that,

254
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:56,370
what was it I did just before
that last piece of corn came,

255
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,990
I was bobbing my head. So maybe I'd
better Bob my head again. And sure enough,

256
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:04,950
another piece of corn comes and they
start assuming that what they were doing,

257
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,520
uh, is making the corn calm. Uh, and so,

258
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,970
but each one does a different thing.
So if they're all in isolation,

259
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:13,350
they would all be doing different things.

260
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,560
But I think our financial markets
are like that, that people,

261
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,910
they develop some investment strategy
and through pure chance it does well,

262
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,870
but they, because of overconfidence
and magical thinking,

263
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,260
it starts to go to their ego.
They think I'm really a smart investor.

264
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:32,520
I've figured it out. Uh, and uh,
it can reinforce the behavior,

265
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:37,680
uh, uh, until they get to
maybe some terrible end.

266
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,110
And that doesn't necessarily
work out as well.

267
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:44,460
Bf Skinner's never let his pigeons starve
and they all made it out. All right?

268
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,710
Uh, there's something else
called quasi magical thinking.

269
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,360
Uh,

270
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,360
which was a term coined many years
later by a Eldar Shafir year.

271
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,050
Uh, and Amos touristy shall fear.

272
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,640
Here's a young,
uh,

273
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,640
psychologist out of Princeton who
teamed up with the old psychologist,

274
00:19:14,641 --> 00:19:18,730
Tversky, uh, and wrote this paper. Um,

275
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,980
uh, and what it refers to is, uh, uh,

276
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,370
people,
uh,

277
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:32,570
get the impression that
they can control randomness.

278
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,060
Maybe the patients were thinking
that maybe not, we don't know,

279
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,130
a chauffeur and Torsky referred
experiments with people,

280
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,160
not Fijians. Okay. And
quasi magical thinking is a,

281
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:49,470
a, an illusion, that big document,

282
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,510
it occurs regularly and people,
uh,

283
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,990
which they might deny if asked about,

284
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:59,991
but there's an illusion that I can
control randomness to my willpower or my,

285
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,180
uh,
I won't talk about their experiments,

286
00:20:03,181 --> 00:20:08,181
but I just want to mention
one by a Harvard psychologist,

287
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,780
Ellen Langer. I mentioned
this before, but I,

288
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,460
I think I mentioned it
before. Uh, if you say,

289
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,620
I want to ask you to bet on a coin toss,
I,

290
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,630
there's two different ways of doing it.
One is to say how much,

291
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,890
how much will you bet?

292
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,610
And then I tossed the coin the other
way as I tossed the coin first and I can

293
00:20:28,611 --> 00:20:32,960
see the outcome. And then I asked
how much would you like to bet?

294
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:38,530
And Langer found that people want to
bet more if the coin hasn't been tossed

295
00:20:38,691 --> 00:20:42,200
yet. Okay, why would that
be? Why would you care?

296
00:20:42,201 --> 00:20:44,390
It's still the same experiment.

297
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:49,270
It appears that people
at some think that they,

298
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,230
they can exert willpower
over it and control it. Uh,

299
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:56,800
and this gives rise again to
overconfidence among investors.

300
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,860
It's also another example
which is relevant.

301
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,780
I don't know if any of you voted
yesterday. Um, why do people vote?

302
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,670
Because economic theory would say
that nobody ever votes if we're all a

303
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,640
conventional economic theory says we're
all relentlessly selfish and calculating,

304
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:19,820
right? Isn't that what you've
learned in economics? And so, uh,

305
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,290
well maybe you didn't necessarily,
but that is a canonical theory.

306
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:27,460
But if you're relentlessly selfish
and calculating, you would say, um,

307
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:31,210
the chances that I decide
the election or zero. Right?

308
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,440
And so I just don't, I know that's
not going to bother. The question is,

309
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,180
you must have thought that,
right?

310
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,720
You know that you're not going
to decide the election. Uh,

311
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,830
and so what does it matter?

312
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,490
And so if you can introspect
and ask why is it that I vote,

313
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,910
I think that at least for many of us,
there is a,

314
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,480
there is a sort of logical conundrum
we go through and that is a,

315
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,590
if good people don't vote, then
we'll be in a bad world. Okay?

316
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,010
And so I have to vote to
approve that good people vote.

317
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,740
And then maybe it will happen.
If I'm a good person,

318
00:22:02,741 --> 00:22:07,150
then other people will be good person.
All right? This is magical thinking. Uh,

319
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,410
and it,
uh,

320
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,280
it affects people because it gives them
a sense of confidence and power, uh,

321
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,620
over events that are thought
to be random or uncontrollable.

322
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,260
Uh, so, uh,

323
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,400
it can also be something
that can be exploited by,

324
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,390
uh, by, uh, some not so nice people.

325
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,093
Okay.

326
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,220
I wanted to talk about a regulation
that the problem with finance is that,

327
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,990
uh, it's a beautiful financial
institutions are beautiful structures,

328
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,620
uh, but they only, uh,

329
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:52,780
are as good as the people
who use them. And so, uh,

330
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,020
the problem is that history of finance
is the history of a lot of people.

331
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,383
Uh,

332
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,260
a lot of people being
exploited and treated badly.

333
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,880
So,
uh,

334
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:12,540
there's temptations of the market that,
uh,

335
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,830
people who,
uh,

336
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:19,450
no human psychology now that they
can exploit human weaknesses.

337
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,830
Uh,

338
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,830
and so there's a temptation to oversell
a investments that is promised that they

339
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:33,640
will do well. Uh, you see this all the
time. I was just seeing yesterdays paper.

340
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,790
Someone was selling gold coins, one of
the, you know, don't buy gold coins that,

341
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,730
you know, that, right? But there were
words in there. They said, of course,

342
00:23:42,731 --> 00:23:47,030
we cannot guarantee that they
won't go up in value, but, uh,

343
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,570
but historically they have always
done it or something like that.

344
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,460
They're trying to oversell,
you know,

345
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:57,070
that buying gold coins from some newspaper
ad is not a smart investment. Um,

346
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,020
but that they know that there will
be people out there. Uh, you know,

347
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:04,760
recent example of overselling the
National Association of Realtors has been

348
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:09,761
running ads saying that home prices
have always doubled every 10 years.

349
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,290
Uh, they, they didn't do it.

350
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,710
They didn't work that they put it in the
present tense home prices double every

351
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:16,544
10 years.

352
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:21,620
So that's an organization of people
who sell real estate and they have ad

353
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:25,700
campaigns trying to convince you
that home prices are going to double.

354
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,170
That's overselling because we're
in a real estate crisis in home,

355
00:24:30,171 --> 00:24:33,340
prices are falling. Uh, and, uh,

356
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,180
that's the kind of thing that
make some people upset. Uh,

357
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,790
there's a tendency to hide information.

358
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,140
Uh, you, you, you avoid telling people
the things that would discourage them.

359
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,480
People have attention anomalies,

360
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:54,480
so they don't go out and see all
the information and you, you, if,

361
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,460
if you don't put it up front,
then they'll never find it.

362
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:04,520
Uh,
there's a tendency for loyalty to friends.

363
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:09,260
That's your own friends.
Uh, and there's this word,

364
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,910
other people I think different languages
have different, uh, you know, there's,

365
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,060
there's friends and then there's all
those random people that we don't care

366
00:25:17,061 --> 00:25:19,430
about. Uh, and so, uh,

367
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:23,660
investors will have a tendency to
try to hide it from people who sell

368
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:24,470
investments.

369
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:29,400
We'll try to channel the good investments
to their friends and take her, uh,

370
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,510
and,
and dump the bad stuff on other people.

371
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,650
That's what's been happening a little
more than a little bit in the subprime

372
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:37,484
crisis.

373
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,520
So we've managed to package subprime
loans that we thought some people thought

374
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:47,681
were terrible and sell them
off to a unwitting foreigners.

375
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,760
I didn't know they thought that
they were getting good stuff. Uh,

376
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:57,830
there's also a tendency for
churning for commissions.

377
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,730
Uh, this is, uh,

378
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,220
of of fault that real
estate brokers can make a,

379
00:26:04,221 --> 00:26:06,590
if they're paid by
commission on each trade,

380
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,900
they just keep calling you up and coming
up with new ideas for new trades. Uh,

381
00:26:11,901 --> 00:26:16,640
and so, uh, that's unethical
behavior, uh, because it,

382
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:20,810
uh, uh, because if you,

383
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,070
if you keep trading too much,
then you cannot possibly make money.

384
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,970
The trading commissions will eat up all
of your profits and professionals know

385
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:31,220
that. So it's, it's bad behavior.

386
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:37,700
So we have, uh,
historically developed, uh,

387
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:41,540
regulation regulations that deal with,
um,

388
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,930
with these problems.
The only reason,

389
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,150
reason I believe that we have financial
markets that work is because we have the

390
00:26:48,151 --> 00:26:48,984
regulations.

391
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:54,180
So I'm going to talk primarily
about us regulations, uh,

392
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,250
and uh,
give a little history of it.

393
00:26:56,550 --> 00:27:00,730
But the U S is actually an important
country for regulation because, uh,

394
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,250
it has been a model for much of
the regulations around the world.

395
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,343
So,
uh,

396
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:12,580
I need to give a kind of a history of
financial regulations in the United

397
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:17,010
States. Uh, it makes it
rather a simple story.

398
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,750
And the simple story is that regulation,
uh,

399
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,960
mostly came in with the progressive era,
um,

400
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,480
at the beginning of the century,
uh,

401
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,370
and reached its culmination at
the time of the Great Depression,

402
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,710
uh, and set up a lot of institutions
that are still with us today.

403
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:42,910
And then there was deregulation,
which started in around the 1970s. Uh,

404
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,430
and the events we've seen,

405
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:48,330
whether that we're seeing today is a
outcome of both the regulation and the

406
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:52,710
deregulation. So, uh, I
wanted to start out with,

407
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,940
uh, the origins of
securities regulation. Uh,

408
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:03,470
a critical point was a book
written by Louis Brandeis.

409
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:09,720
Uh, that's the guy that Brandeis
university is named after.

410
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:15,600
He was an author and lawyer
then Supreme Court justice. Uh,

411
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:20,370
but he wrote a book in 1914,
uh,

412
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,920
called other people's money.

413
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:31,110
And, uh, it was very influential.
I have it on reserve,

414
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:34,560
but that's not required for the midterm
results if you're interested to see it.

415
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,450
Uh, and, uh, uh,

416
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,980
he believed that, uh,
the most important step,

417
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,060
uh,

418
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:50,060
for the government in promoting better
financial markets is disclosure to force,

419
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:53,773
uh,

420
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:58,970
to force businesses or
financial businesses to
disclose the truth equally to

421
00:29:01,201 --> 00:29:05,010
everybody. Uh, and, uh,
his famous quote is,

422
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:10,210
sunshine is the best disinfectant.
Sunshine meaning the truth. And, uh,

423
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,800
everyone in the financial industry has
to just tell people what they're doing.

424
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:17,340
Uh,
and he said it has to be really disclosed.

425
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:21,710
And he likened it to a
labeling. They were already, uh,

426
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:26,990
in 1914 starting to require that a
food packages would show nutritional or

427
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:30,930
ingredients and nutritional information.
Uh,

428
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:35,520
I was on the package and he thought
that's the kind of model for the financial

429
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:36,300
industry.

430
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:41,110
The disclosure has to be made convenient
so that it's not like you can get the

431
00:29:41,111 --> 00:29:45,080
information by going downtown to
city hall and asking for it. So the,

432
00:29:45,081 --> 00:29:50,081
the principle is that you have to require
that the information be given to the

433
00:29:50,381 --> 00:29:54,260
investor. So that was a very
important, um, so in, uh,

434
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:58,630
around the time of this book,
state regulators were, um,

435
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:04,240
developing, uh, at the state
government level and the United States,

436
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,530
uh,
what they call blue sky laws.

437
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,623
Okay.

438
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,660
These were laws regulating
how securities are sold. Uh,

439
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,890
and it was different theories about
why they call it on blue sky laws.

440
00:30:22,891 --> 00:30:26,730
I think it was because people
were overselling investments
and saying there's no

441
00:30:26,731 --> 00:30:31,470
limit to this investment, but
the blue sky above, uh, so,

442
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,693
uh,

443
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:37,680
the problem with the blue sky laws is
that they were each state done separately

444
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,210
and it was hard for states to
manage what we're basically,

445
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:47,250
um, national businesses.
So the blue sky lives,

446
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:52,310
we're basically coming in and the teens
and the 1920s things changed because the

447
00:30:53,731 --> 00:30:57,000
telephone first became wide,

448
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:02,370
widely spread, uh, until the,
until around that, until the teens,

449
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,330
telephones were very expensive because
they didn't have a good amplification

450
00:31:06,331 --> 00:31:11,250
technology. But by the tiny is everybody
got a telephone in their house. Um,

451
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,920
and the average person made
hundreds of phone calls a year.

452
00:31:13,921 --> 00:31:18,810
So it was a big change in our society.
And this led to the, uh, boiler rooms.

453
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:20,913
And if you know that,

454
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:26,050
uh, the so called born,
these were businesses that
called her on the telephone.

455
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:30,080
And so the stock often bogus stocks,
uh,

456
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,840
in the 1920s. The reason they
call them boiler rooms is, uh,

457
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,140
if you are,
I'm selling stocks by telephone,

458
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,010
there's no reason to rent a nice
office. Right? So you get the cheapest.

459
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,550
So you put a whole bank of telephones
in the cheapest place and that would be

460
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:47,740
the basement of some building
where they have the boiler.

461
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:52,540
And so you'd have a whole bunch of people
selling securities down there and it

462
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:56,680
could vacate quickly if the
authorities challenge you. Uh, so,

463
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:01,330
uh, uh, in the 1920s, a
lot of bogus stuff was,

464
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:03,640
so a lot of people were cheated.
Uh,

465
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:06,520
and so after the stock
market crash of 1929,

466
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:11,320
it led to and Movement for regulation.
Uh,

467
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:12,640
and so,
uh,

468
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:18,810
the most important thing was the
1934 foundation of the securities.

469
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:23,830
Yeah.

470
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,330
And Exchange Commission,

471
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:33,230
r s e c,

472
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:37,520
uh, which I think ultimately, um,

473
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:42,950
dates back to really the embodiment
of Louis Brandeis principles. So,

474
00:32:42,951 --> 00:32:47,590
uh, this, uh, securities and
exchange commission was a,

475
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,523
a,

476
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,240
an organization that I guess you say it's,

477
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:55,190
it's principle structure.

478
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:00,200
It's principle thing was to make sure that
disclosure was proper and that people,

479
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,590
uh,

480
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:06,290
were found it easy to get the
information about securities.

481
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,730
Uh,
and the SEC

482
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:15,770
was very controversial at first because
it was seen as interfering with business.

483
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,410
And the u s has been
built on principles of,

484
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:23,300
of individual freedom and this seem
like unnecessary government intrusion.

485
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,710
Uh, so there was a hostile attitude
between business and the original sec,

486
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,913
uh,

487
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:35,210
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was viewed as
very left wing by business and very, uh,

488
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,430
uh, uh, contrary to American values.

489
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,121
But in fact,

490
00:33:41,121 --> 00:33:46,010
the SCC promoted the very free
market concepts that were,

491
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,530
um, that were widely
believed in, in this country.

492
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,150
Uh, basically what it did is it made
it feel that people won't get cheated.

493
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:01,250
Uh, and so, uh, the sec
was a strong regulator,

494
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,410
uh, and it, uh, uh,

495
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:08,870
it really did it restore confidence in
the financial markets in this country.

496
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:13,250
Other countries in Europe
after the 1929 crash,

497
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:17,810
they had a different reaction to the
scandals and problems of the twenties,

498
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,310
and it wasn't as favorable.

499
00:34:19,311 --> 00:34:23,360
The markets is in the u
s with the Securities and
Exchange Commission from the

500
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:28,361
beginning had it as its mission to
make a financial markets work properly.

501
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,560
Uh, and that is a wonderful story. So, uh,

502
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:38,060
one of the first
chairman of the Sec,

503
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:39,810
uh,
was

504
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,180
a man named William O.
Douglas.

505
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,560
Uh,
uh,

506
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:55,540
was actually a Yale law professor.
Uh, I guess he influences me,

507
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,470
uh, because, um, I have, I have
on the reading list, again,

508
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,950
it's an optional reading, uh, but, uh,

509
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,140
he has a book called

510
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,860
democracy and Finance

511
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,610
1940.

512
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,450
Uh, and, uh, what he advocated again,

513
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:24,100
is that financial markets have to
be made to work for, uh, the people.

514
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:26,710
Uh, I guess this influenced me. Uh,

515
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:30,350
you actually am I 2003
book new financial load,

516
00:35:30,351 --> 00:35:34,660
or I talked about the democratization
of finance as a fundamental principle.

517
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:39,060
We have to make finance work
for real people. And so for me,

518
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:44,061
that not understanding human frailties
and understanding human psychology to

519
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:46,230
make things work.
Uh,

520
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:50,970
he was also a major figure
in the legal realism.

521
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:56,720
Um, uh, school, which was a represented,

522
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,500
recognized,
uh,

523
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:03,590
human failings and human behavior
and establishment of laws.

524
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:08,610
We have to realize that people
don't read all the fine print, uh,

525
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:13,730
and don't understand if you
have a precisely written
contract in legal language,

526
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:17,340
maybe they don't get it.
Uh,

527
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,790
one of the things that came out,
uh,

528
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:25,910
and it was firmly embodied into
law with the advent of the sec,

529
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:27,930
there were pre precursors to this,

530
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:32,931
but the FCC enforces the difference
between public and private securities.

531
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,720
This is a very important distinction.
Uh,

532
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:48,050
public securities are
securities that the sec doc,

533
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:51,500
uh, uh, um, we'll, uh,

534
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:56,560
except as suitable for the general public
and private securities or securities

535
00:36:57,421 --> 00:37:01,680
that have not been vetted by
the sec for the general public.

536
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,670
So, uh, uh,

537
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:11,560
the sec, uh, you have to decide,

538
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,980
you don't hear about public
companies and private companies.

539
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,540
If you're a public company,

540
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:19,650
it means that you've gone through the
procedure that the sec to be approved as a

541
00:37:19,651 --> 00:37:22,410
public company.
If you are a public company,

542
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:26,890
the important thing is you have to
do all of the disclosure that, uh,

543
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:29,170
Louis Brandeis would have like.

544
00:37:29,171 --> 00:37:34,171
So you have to file regular forms
with the SEC disclosing information,

545
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,450
uh, public companies and
these public companies.

546
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,420
If you want to get on the sec website,
uh,

547
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,880
go to sec.gov and then as,
uh,

548
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:51,810
there is a
tab that you can click,

549
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:55,270
which is Edgar. Uh, and uh,

550
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,330
if you click on Edgar,

551
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:01,800
you can enter the name of any public
company in the United States. Uh,

552
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:06,830
and then all of its filings are online
and you can find out incredible amount of

553
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:10,330
information about companies.
Uh,

554
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,820
it's all there as long as they're
public companies. Uh, so public,

555
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:19,320
a lot of companies don't want to be
public because you can't keep secrets very

556
00:38:19,321 --> 00:38:19,591
well.

557
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:23,790
You've got to regularly put those things
up online and they're out there for

558
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,490
everybody to see.
Um,

559
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:30,240
so why do companies can choose
whether to be public or private?

560
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:35,070
Why do they choose to be
public? Well, they, it's a
balancing. They have to balance.

561
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:39,040
Sometimes they don't like the
choice they made, but, uh, the,

562
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:43,180
the advantage to being public is that
people trust you more and more over your

563
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:46,840
market is bigger. Uh, and, and, uh,

564
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:50,150
so public companies have
an advantage. So, uh,

565
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:53,890
companies don't like to
be public. Generally. It's
contrary to their instincts.

566
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,290
We keep all sorts of
secrets in our company.

567
00:38:56,470 --> 00:39:00,940
We don't want to be filing all of our
information all the time and having it go

568
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:02,050
right up on the website,

569
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,920
on standard forms so that
everyone can easily process it.

570
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,540
Uh,
but they,

571
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:12,910
they may swallow their doubts because
they have a sense that it will improve the

572
00:39:12,911 --> 00:39:17,650
market for their shares.
So we have a lot of public companies.

573
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:23,080
Um, now if you are a public
or a private company,

574
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:28,080
uh, you are limited to, uh, what,

575
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:30,540
uh,
uh,

576
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:34,630
where you can sell your investments.
Uh,

577
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,280
and let's talk an example of, of, uh,

578
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,050
important kind of private company.
It's called a hedge fund.

579
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:44,743
Okay.

580
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,560
If you are, this is not, this
is a private investment company.

581
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:05,220
Uh, let's, let's think before
we talk about head. Think
of, suppose you're right.

582
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,890
Public Investment Company,
uh, approved by the SEC.

583
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:13,030
The problem with being a public investment
company is you have to file quarterly

584
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:16,990
reports about all the things you've
invested in. I mean, and so you say,

585
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,800
how can I make money beating the
market if every quarter I have to tell

586
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:22,840
everybody what I'm doing?
Uh,

587
00:40:22,841 --> 00:40:26,410
and so a lot of investment
companies don't want to be public.

588
00:40:26,411 --> 00:40:27,280
They want to be private,

589
00:40:27,281 --> 00:40:32,020
so they don't have to hedge funds do
not post their investments and Edgar,

590
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,880
and so they're private.
Um,

591
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,660
but if you're a private company,

592
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:42,250
you're subject to regulation that
limits a lot of things you can do.

593
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:46,700
Notably, you're not
allowed to advertise. Uh,

594
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:49,300
if you're a hedge fund,
you're not for the public,

595
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:51,640
you're not approved for
investing by the public.

596
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,030
So what business do you have
to put buy ads in newspapers,

597
00:40:55,330 --> 00:41:00,160
announcing yourself as a
result? Hedge funds, uh,

598
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:04,630
are, have a very low profile.
It's not their choice. They
might like to advertise,

599
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:08,530
but they can't without running
a foul of the sec. They'll say,

600
00:41:08,531 --> 00:41:12,570
you're behaving like a public
company and you're not public. Uh,

601
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
and so hedge funds do not advertise and
that's why people don't know about them.

602
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:23,040
And they have a mysterious, uh, uh, they,

603
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:27,790
they sound mysterious. Um, but
moreover, very significantly,

604
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:30,520
uh, they're, uh,

605
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,750
they are limited in what
kind of investors can take a,

606
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,610
now there's different kinds of hedge fund.

607
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,400
Th there's a lot of legal
complexity here, but, uh,

608
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,120
a three c one hedge farm,
uh,

609
00:41:44,121 --> 00:41:46,610
is limited to 99 and investors.

610
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,033
Yeah.

611
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:53,110
Uh, and that's not very many people. Uh,

612
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,060
and they must be accredited investors.

613
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,690
And so you asked what is an
accredited investor? Well,

614
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:07,680
if you want to find out,

615
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:11,910
you can get onto a sec.gov and it
will give you the current definition.

616
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:15,210
So I wonder how many of you
are accredited investors?

617
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:20,160
I would guess not many of you. Here's
how you become an accredited investor.

618
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:24,590
A, you have $1 million
in investible. Yeah.

619
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:28,890
That's not including your house.
Is it? An investible assets? Okay.

620
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:33,540
Uh, I won't ask for a show
of, I don't want any to,

621
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:38,250
you're making at least
$200,000 a year, uh, or, uh,

622
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:42,540
you, uh, if you're married, you have to
be the couple of making at least 300,000.

623
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,050
Uh, so, um,

624
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,950
it's supposed to be a fun for rich people.
It's done.

625
00:42:49,951 --> 00:42:54,420
They haven't raised the definitions of
accredited investors for many years. So,

626
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,220
uh, last year, the SEC, uh, put
out a proposal that, uh, you know,

627
00:42:59,221 --> 00:43:02,730
it's getting too easy to be
an accredited investor. Uh,

628
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:06,620
and so they put out a proposal
that we raised the, uh,

629
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:11,400
wealth level to 2.5 million. Okay. Uh,

630
00:43:11,401 --> 00:43:12,240
and I thought they were going to,

631
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:15,300
and that was to protect
people who might be naive,

632
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:17,520
innocent people who only have $1 million.

633
00:43:17,521 --> 00:43:20,990
They're only half $2 million and
don't know what they're doing, uh,

634
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,620
from hedge funds. But, uh, it got
shot down apparently, cause it never,

635
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,693
never happened.

636
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:31,560
I think it's very hard to raise the
definition of accredited investors because

637
00:43:31,561 --> 00:43:32,610
in that you do that,

638
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:37,320
you're closing large numbers of people
out from her ability to invest in hedge

639
00:43:37,321 --> 00:43:39,930
funds and they don't like that.
They feel insulted.

640
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:44,060
So there was a lot of angry reaction.
Uh,

641
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:49,000
there's also another kind of
hedge fund, three c seven, uh,

642
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:53,520
which can take 500 investors.
Uh,

643
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:58,590
if they, if they register as a three
c seven, they can take more investors,

644
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,480
but then they're limited
to qualified purchasers.

645
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:09,440
And this just an example
of their regulations. Uh,

646
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:14,450
and a qualified purchaser a has
to have at least $5 million,

647
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,710
uh, or if it's an institution
at least 25 million,

648
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,310
um,
that is a natural person.

649
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:27,570
A natural person refers to a human being.
Uh,

650
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,900
so it's 5 million for natural,

651
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,230
uh,
and 25 million for institutions.

652
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,340
So if you're a small college with
only 20 million in a portfolio,

653
00:44:41,341 --> 00:44:44,580
you don't come across as
a qualified purchases.

654
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:48,780
They're trying to protect innocent small
colleges who only have $20 million.

655
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,980
The idea is that people who don't have
much money can't afford expensive lawyers

656
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:56,310
and they can't figure it out and they
really shouldn't be investing in hedge

657
00:44:56,311 --> 00:45:00,290
funds. Uh, so that is the, uh,

658
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,730
uh,
these,

659
00:45:05,731 --> 00:45:09,660
these are public, private,
uh, uh, distinctions are,

660
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:13,400
anarchists are offensive to
some people because it, it's,

661
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,390
it seems like the government is acting
like a parent and most of the people are,

662
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,700
if you're not accredited as an investor,

663
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:24,240
it's like the government doesn't
respect you. Uh, right. I mean,

664
00:45:24,241 --> 00:45:25,770
it's like they're treating
you like children.

665
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:29,670
Why would it be that somebody else
is allowed to invest in a hedge fund?

666
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:33,060
And I'm not, uh, so, uh,

667
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:36,630
it rankles but on the other hand,

668
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:41,660
these regulations survive because the
reality is that people are victimized all

669
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:46,010
the time and uh,
uh,

670
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:50,830
we can't just allow companies
to act in secrecy. I,

671
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:55,420
this is something that I believe and not
everyone believes in this, uh, but, um,

672
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:59,340
the general principle has
been now ever since the 1930s,

673
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,760
that the general public is not allowed
to invest in things that are not properly

674
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:09,720
documented.
Another important distinction

675
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:16,640
and securities regulation is the
distinction between insider and outsider.

676
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:25,480
And insider is someone who is privy to
the secret information of a company.

677
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:30,660
Uh, and um, uh, the, uh,

678
00:46:30,661 --> 00:46:35,400
secret information could
be used to trade, right?

679
00:46:35,401 --> 00:46:39,230
If you know the secrets of a
company, if you know some, uh,

680
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:42,630
good news about the company
before the public does,

681
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,170
you could buy the shares
in the company and,

682
00:46:45,171 --> 00:46:47,910
and experienced that the
profit when the price goes up,

683
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:52,680
you would be exploding insider
information and you'd be victimizing the

684
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:54,630
outsiders.
Uh,

685
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:59,370
so the idea from the
beginning at the sec was that,

686
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:00,420
uh,

687
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:05,420
insiders should not be allowed
to trade on information that is,

688
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:10,520
uh, that is not properly
disclosed to the public. Um,

689
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:15,750
and, uh, but especially there
was an important change. Um,

690
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,940
regulation FD,

691
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:24,030
I came in in 2000 FTE stands
for full disclosure. This is a,

692
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:27,330
uh,
sec regulation,

693
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:31,310
a regulation FD,
uh,

694
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:36,040
was I think past and reg in
recognition of the internet under,

695
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:39,340
uh, uh, Louis Brandeis.

696
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:44,350
Brandeis wanted companies to
always present the information,

697
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:46,780
but for him it always met
presenting a document.

698
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:49,240
So they had something called a prospectus.
For example,

699
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:54,241
you could not sell a security without
giving a prospectus to the potential

700
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:00,380
buyers. And the prospectus would
be something approved by the sec.

701
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,580
Uh, and I don't know if the
word is approved, but it's a,

702
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:08,350
you have to run it by the sec and
then you always have to give that up.

703
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:12,700
But he was living in a paper age.
We now live in the Internet age.

704
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:13,810
Uh,

705
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:18,220
and so regulation FD and now I don't know
if it actually mentions the internet,

706
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:19,450
but it's, it's, uh,

707
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:25,230
tends to the regulation FD basically
says that whenever a company announces

708
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:27,904
information,

709
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:33,030
it has to be announced a available almost
instantly to everybody in the market.

710
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,870
And so the way it has worked out
in practice is that companies,

711
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:40,660
when they have a major
announcement to make,

712
00:48:41,110 --> 00:48:45,130
they have some kind of web
event and anybody in the world,

713
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,330
they would be notified and they can
get on and hear it as it's happening.

714
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:51,550
So we kind of have meetings,

715
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:57,130
big meetings on the web for a
disclosure of important information.

716
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,090
Uh, and so, uh, uh,

717
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:04,840
this has made it very clear
then there's a, there has to be,

718
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,070
if you announced anything,

719
00:49:06,071 --> 00:49:09,850
you have to announce it all at once on
a certain day and you can't have favored

720
00:49:09,851 --> 00:49:13,500
people that you give the announcement too.
Uh,

721
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:19,120
so market surveillance is the fastest that

722
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:26,640
dark exchanges and other organizations
do to make sure that inside information

723
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:32,470
is not being, uh, uh,

724
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:36,740
is not being mishandled.
And so the,

725
00:49:36,741 --> 00:49:41,150
the self regulatory organizations SROC,
um,

726
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,570
which are industry organizations
that regulate the industry,

727
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:52,510
that's an American way of doing things
rather than have the government, uh,

728
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,440
regulate.

729
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,460
We have an industry organization that
does it so that the government doesn't

730
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:00,430
have to, uh, the SRO is,

731
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:04,870
have complex regulatory equipment,

732
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:09,730
computers that can discuss
this discover, um, uh,

733
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:14,180
in insider trading. And, uh, the SRO is,

734
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,910
uh, we'll catch you or they
may catch you if, if you try.

735
00:50:18,911 --> 00:50:23,480
So I wanted to give you an
example of SRO behavior. Uh,

736
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:26,330
and this is just one news story.
Um,

737
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:31,310
it was in 1995,
uh,

738
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:35,450
a secretary at Ibm Corporation,

739
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,203
uh,

740
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:42,580
was asked to xerox some documents by
her boss and the documents described a

741
00:50:43,761 --> 00:50:46,760
proposed takeover of Lotus Corporation.

742
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,780
I remember Laura say that was the,
uh,

743
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,260
corporation that produced the
first thread sheet program.

744
00:50:54,261 --> 00:50:58,220
It's now been replaced
mostly by at Microsoft Excel,

745
00:50:58,370 --> 00:51:01,220
but at the time it was big.
Okay. So this was big news.

746
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:06,410
Ibm is going to take over at
Lotus or try to take over Lotus.

747
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:10,850
And, uh, we now know what
happened because of the, uh,

748
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,150
the surveillance investigation.
Uh,

749
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:18,980
she told her husband that she
adjusts xerox to this thing about,

750
00:51:19,100 --> 00:51:22,550
she'd read what she was xeroxing
and she told her husband,

751
00:51:22,551 --> 00:51:26,590
who is a beeper salesman about the news.
Uh,

752
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:30,860
he did nothing except tell
two friends than story.

753
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:33,590
He didn't buy show.
He just told two friends.

754
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:37,100
My wife says that IBM is
going to take over a lotus.

755
00:51:37,490 --> 00:51:42,200
The friends immediately
bought a lotus shares. Uh,

756
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:46,590
and uh, uh, then, uh, uh,

757
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:51,830
that was June two. By June
five, 25 people had bought,

758
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,600
had a half a million
dollars to buy on this tip.

759
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,460
They included a pizza chef and
electrical engineer, uh, bank executive,

760
00:52:01,461 --> 00:52:05,710
a dairy wholesaler, a school
teacher, and for stockbrokers,

761
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:11,090
stockbrokers get the word
faster. Uh, just what happened.

762
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:16,000
Those people are all in trouble because
it's illegal to trade on insider

763
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:20,180
information and they tracked
them all down. And, uh,

764
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:25,560
uh, uh, so, uh, I give
you another example. Uh,

765
00:52:25,561 --> 00:52:30,260
and this is the example of,
uh, uh, emulex corporate.

766
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:34,760
Maybe this isn't exactly an insider
trading. This is more fraud. But,

767
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,890
uh, in what year was, this? Was
around sometime in the late nineties.

768
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:44,900
Uh, Marc Jacob, uh, uh, his name,

769
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:48,680
he's a guy, he's the criminal here.
He's probably out of jail now.

770
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:52,610
Marc Jacob, uh, was upset with,

771
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,620
he had done an employee of
Emulex, uh, and, uh, uh, had,

772
00:52:57,621 --> 00:53:01,820
uh, had access to inside
information of the company. Uh,

773
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,790
and so he, I guess he
was involved in the, um,

774
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,840
in the dissemination of
information for the company.

775
00:53:08,841 --> 00:53:13,330
He kind of knew how they did press
releases. So he sent out a fic he bought,

776
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:18,200
he shorted the company and he, uh, the
stock in the company and he bought a,

777
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,540
he put out a fake press release,
uh,

778
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,040
saying that there was bad news
for the company. Uh, and, uh,

779
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:29,740
he knew how to make it look like
one of the Mbox press releases. Um,

780
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:34,470
he also did it from the El
Camino community college
library because he thought

781
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:35,640
I'd be careful.

782
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:40,260
I want issue this fake press release on
my own computer because they might be

783
00:53:40,261 --> 00:53:42,300
able to track me back to my own computer.

784
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:46,560
So he went to this community college and
got one of their library computers and

785
00:53:46,561 --> 00:53:50,700
issue the press release there. He got
picked up by all the major news services.

786
00:53:50,701 --> 00:53:55,110
A stock plummeted. He's sold
immediately and he made a lot of money.

787
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,920
But the problem is it didn't
work. They, they, they,

788
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:02,700
they track back who sold it, who had
shorted and who had sold just before,

789
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,310
just at that time. And they also, um,

790
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:10,740
they went back to the El Camino Community
College Library and they interviewed

791
00:54:10,741 --> 00:54:13,770
the librarians and tried to ask them,

792
00:54:13,771 --> 00:54:16,860
do you remember somebody coming here
that didn't look like a student?

793
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:22,110
And they identified him and so he
was caught. So that's what, uh,

794
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:23,790
what surveillance does.

795
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,990
They make markets work because
if you didn't have this,

796
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:32,910
they would be all kinds of, there
would be all kinds of, uh, uh,

797
00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:37,980
crooks and, uh, a bad, a bad actors. Uh,

798
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,450
and uh, the thing about these
organizations is that they
cost money and they cost

799
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:43,343
nuisances.

800
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,730
A lot of people in the financial community
are annoyed by them because of these

801
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:51,330
regulations are costly
to comply with. And, uh,

802
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,960
they take a lot of resources, but, uh,

803
00:54:56,110 --> 00:55:00,570
I think enlightened view is that
these things are absolutely essential,

804
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:04,560
uh, and to trust in the market. Um,

805
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:10,080
another form of, uh, uh, of, uh,

806
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:14,820
regulation is accounting regulation.
So for example,

807
00:55:14,821 --> 00:55:19,620
we have, uh, in the United
States, the financial accounting

808
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:21,780
standards board,

809
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,610
this right here in Connecticut.

810
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,500
All right?
Faas B.

811
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:39,040
This is not a government organization.
Uh, it was organized, uh,

812
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:44,260
uh, by the sec in 1973. Uh,

813
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:49,490
but the sec didn't want to do this job.
They wanted it to be done privately. Uh,

814
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:54,640
so what FASP does for the United States
is it creates what are called generally

815
00:55:55,850 --> 00:56:00,440
accepted as a g generally
accepted accounting practices.

816
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:01,843
Uh,

817
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:06,500
their rules for how an IT company
should keep its books so that, uh,

818
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:09,320
uh,
uh,

819
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:15,460
so that there's some regularity and
standards and how accounting is done.

820
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:20,000
Uh, and so when, when, uh,

821
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:25,840
the financial accounting standards board
to what corporations are saying and,

822
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:29,370
uh, and helps them, uh, uh, it,

823
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:31,810
it adjusts the standards
from time to time,

824
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:36,700
but it does have definitions
that have to be maintained.

825
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:42,250
Uh, and, um, so a company has a, uh, uh,

826
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:47,390
a profit and loss statement and
there is something that, uh,

827
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,760
it's called net income,

828
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:55,180
which is a measure of how much the
company is making the, the, uh,

829
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:59,380
the profits after expenses of the
company called the bottom line.

830
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:01,690
Uh, and, uh,

831
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:05,740
the gap standards are defined.

832
00:57:05,741 --> 00:57:10,540
This is also operating income.
Uh,

833
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:16,740
now companies can use other definitions
of other accounting standards besides

834
00:57:17,021 --> 00:57:17,990
these.
Uh,

835
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:23,610
and some of these other definitions
which are not always gap,

836
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:26,500
other standards

837
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:32,920
and are widely used in the
industry are other kinds of,

838
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:34,930
they have what's called core earnings,

839
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,970
uh,
pro forma earnings,

840
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:47,470
uh, Ebitda, which is earnings,

841
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:52,360
uh, uh, earnings before interest, taxes,

842
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:57,850
depreciation and Amortization,
uh, adjusted earnings.

843
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:04,060
There's all kinds of different
definitions. And so, uh, uh,

844
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:08,320
companies like to do it their own way
cause they weren't a present themselves in

845
00:58:08,321 --> 00:58:10,960
the best way to the public, but, uh,

846
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,830
they're not allowed to just do it their
own way. They have to do it according to,

847
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,840
uh, uh, standards. Uh,

848
00:58:17,841 --> 00:58:21,070
and so the gap accounting is standardized.
So what a,

849
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:25,180
what a company can do is present
things in two different ways.

850
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,870
Uh, uh, they,

851
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:31,600
they can present it gap and
then that goes to Edgar or,

852
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:35,490
and they can also present it any
other way they liked. But the law, uh,

853
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,090
the SCC requires that they at least
present the standard earnings, uh,

854
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:44,350
definitions for, um, for all these things.

855
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,230
Now another, um, let,

856
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:52,740
let me just mention a off balance
sheet accounting. Uh, the, uh,

857
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:57,820
one thing that the SEC requires that
companies file is there balance sheet,

858
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:02,320
uh, which you can look up
for any company. And Edgar,

859
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,370
uh,
the balance sheet

860
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:13,630
of a company has two columns.
It has assets

861
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:20,350
and it has liabilities.
Uh,

862
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:24,440
and so on one side is everything that
company owns and the other side is

863
00:59:24,441 --> 00:59:28,990
everything the company
owes. Okay. Uh, and the, uh,

864
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,170
uh,
the,

865
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:35,450
the net worth of the company is their
assets minus their liabilities. Uh,

866
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:36,650
and that represents

867
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,740
the value that the company has if they
paid off all their liabilities. Uh,

868
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:50,490
what the SEC has to worry
about is something called
off balance sheet account.

869
00:59:50,491 --> 00:59:51,324
Hey,

870
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:55,780
uh,

871
00:59:55,780 --> 01:00:00,780
which occurs when companies
try to hide some of the,

872
01:00:01,370 --> 01:00:05,020
uh, things that they, the,
the liabilities they have,

873
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,790
but not recording them on the
balance sheet. Uh, and, uh,

874
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:14,320
if you can get away with that,
then you can do, uh, you,

875
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:18,580
you can conceal maybe some risky
investments you've made or some,

876
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,070
uh, leverage that you've had. Uh,

877
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:24,940
you might've bought investments
in something by borrowing money.

878
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:29,870
And so the investment,
the combined investment and liability,

879
01:00:29,871 --> 01:00:32,980
it could be very volatile.
You don't want people to know that,

880
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:36,940
so you don't put it on the
balance sheet. Uh, so, uh,

881
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:40,300
the sec and other regulators
have to watch for this.

882
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:44,520
The classic example of a
company that did this, uh,

883
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:49,450
it's a classic now was
Enron Corporation. Um, and,

884
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,313
uh,

885
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:55,270
they had a number of partnerships
that they put on, uh,

886
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:59,770
as off balance sheet.
So they weren't making risky investments,

887
01:00:59,771 --> 01:01:04,570
but they weren't reporting it
properly on, uh, on the, uh,

888
01:01:04,750 --> 01:01:09,730
SCC forums. And so people didn't
know how risky, uh, how risky.

889
01:01:09,731 --> 01:01:14,120
And Ron was. Uh, more
recently we, uh, this is,

890
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:19,060
it came out last year,
uh, the sieves, alright,

891
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:22,360
phone called structured
investment vehicles.

892
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:25,563
Uh,

893
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:29,800
we're used by banks to
cover up investments.

894
01:01:29,801 --> 01:01:34,801
They had often in risky subprime loans
where they created special entities

895
01:01:35,861 --> 01:01:38,500
called sibs. Uh, and, uh,

896
01:01:38,501 --> 01:01:43,501
the sieves would be borrowing money
on the commercial paper market to buy

897
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:49,210
subprime loans. Uh, and, uh, they were,

898
01:01:49,810 --> 01:01:50,643
uh,

899
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:55,510
in a very risky position because subprime
loans were already recognized as being

900
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:57,670
risky and they borrowed to buy them,

901
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:02,350
sell off the value of the subprime loans
went down just a little bit. The, uh,

902
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:07,600
the sieve would be in trouble.
Uh, and so in the Civ contract,

903
01:02:07,601 --> 01:02:12,040
there was some language that implied
that if the sieve ever went bankrupt,

904
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,960
the bank would come back and rescue them.

905
01:02:14,590 --> 01:02:19,440
And so the say of really was a liability,
but it wasn't visible to,

906
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:21,840
to investors who are
investing in the back.

907
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:26,400
So this is another example of off balance
sheet accounting. That was frustrating.

908
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:30,840
Um, the rules of the SEC. Um,

909
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:35,790
I wanted to talk about, uh, the, um,

910
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,000
uh,
another,

911
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:44,720
another instance of regulation that
is important in the United States,

912
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,180
but it's very poorly known.
Uh,

913
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:53,290
we have something called civic.
Uh,

914
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,110
that's the securities

915
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,780
and investor

916
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:03,790
protection corporation,

917
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,770
which was created in 1970 a.

918
01:03:14,771 --> 01:03:19,000
And this is the securities
analog of the FDA. I see.

919
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:21,960
In banking, uh, I don't
know if I mentioned,

920
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:25,690
I assume you know about the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation.

921
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:30,690
I thought that was better known or, well,
let me just mention it by analogy. Uh,

922
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:35,570
in 1934,
after the failure was,

923
01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:40,000
it was actually created by
Congress in 1933 and, uh,

924
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:45,670
uh,
went into business in 34 f the,

925
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:51,010
I see Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.

926
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:59,430
So I'll put it down as 1934
guaranteed for a small depositors,

927
01:04:00,430 --> 01:04:02,530
uh, the, uh,

928
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:05,890
savings deposits they have at a bank.

929
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:10,810
And that was to protect depositors.
Uh, in the case of bank failure.

930
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:16,360
And it was a very important innovation
because at that time there were huge runs

931
01:04:16,361 --> 01:04:16,871
on banks.

932
01:04:16,871 --> 01:04:20,620
People were pulling money out of banks
because they feared that if the bank

933
01:04:20,621 --> 01:04:25,510
failed, then they would lose their money.
And so it created a huge crisis in 1933.

934
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:27,221
So it's,

935
01:04:27,221 --> 01:04:32,221
but it's for a small investors because
currently the limit and the sec,

936
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,010
uh, it's $100,000, right?

937
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:42,340
So that's not a lot of money.
Um, and whenever you think
of it as a lot of money,

938
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:47,290
but it's not, uh, if someone
saving for their retirement,

939
01:04:47,530 --> 01:04:52,350
you better have a lot more than that.
$100,000 is only a few years in comment,

940
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:55,670
even for lower income
people. But at least, uh,

941
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:00,680
we want to protect the small investors in
the saving in bags. So actually if you,

942
01:05:00,681 --> 01:05:04,360
if you, if you have more than a hundred
thousand dollars in a bank account,

943
01:05:04,361 --> 01:05:08,500
you should probably pull it out and spread
it around over several banks because

944
01:05:08,501 --> 01:05:10,690
each bank is separately insured.

945
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,160
So there's effectively no limit if
you're just a little bit smart, uh,

946
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:18,070
and you move your accounts
around. Uh, so we had,

947
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:22,690
so we had deposit insurance, uh, until,
uh, starting in the Great Depression.

948
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:27,500
And that's been very important. Uh,
and it's now in every country. Uh,

949
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:29,720
uh,
uh,

950
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:33,750
so we had a run on a bank in the UK.
Uh,

951
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,300
it was called Northern
Rock, uh, last year. Um,

952
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:42,190
and it turns out that there was a
failure of the UK deposit insurance.

953
01:05:42,191 --> 01:05:47,170
I would say it's a failure because a U K
deposit insurance insured northern rock

954
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:51,610
only for the first 3000
pounds, uh, up completely.

955
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:56,530
And then for the next, I forget how many
thousand pounds you were, 90% insured. Uh,

956
01:05:56,550 --> 01:06:01,000
so that was not good enough because
people were worried about losing 10% of

957
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:02,050
their deposits.

958
01:06:02,051 --> 01:06:07,051
And so there was a big
bank run and northern rock
would've failed if the Bank of

959
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:10,410
England hadn't come by to rescue them.
Uh,

960
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:14,890
so I think these deposit insurance
are very important, but we don't,

961
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:19,920
we didn't have anything for
a corresponding accounts
at brokerage services until

962
01:06:20,051 --> 01:06:24,220
1970. Uh, and, uh, it, uh,

963
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,290
this was motivated by a
spectacular failure of a brokerage,

964
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:34,630
good body, uh, in, uh, in company, um,

965
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:36,160
in 1970.

966
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:43,050
I hope. You know what I mean?
A brokerage service is a,

967
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:48,310
is a place where a stockbrokers work and
it stockbroker is somebody that manages

968
01:06:48,730 --> 01:06:53,200
your buying and selling of shares. All
right? And so if you want to buy stock,

969
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,720
you can call a stockbroker.
Uh,

970
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:59,470
like Merrill Lynch is a big retail
broker and they're right down here on the

971
01:06:59,471 --> 01:07:04,390
green. You can go there and say, I want
to buy stocks. And the broker will say,

972
01:07:04,391 --> 01:07:09,030
fine, we'll set up an account for
you. You deposit money in our account.

973
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,630
Now he's not a bank.
He's a broker.

974
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:15,730
Will have set up a cash account and a
securities account, put some money in,

975
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:18,190
and then you think about it and
then you call me up and say,

976
01:07:18,191 --> 01:07:22,000
do you want to buy some
stocks? Uh, then I'll,

977
01:07:22,050 --> 01:07:25,990
I'll take money out of your cash account
and I'll put it in these securities.

978
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,890
That's a broker. Okay, good
body and company was a broker,

979
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:34,570
but it failed in 1970.
It went bankrupt.

980
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:40,340
And then it looked like the people who
had money and shares and then we'd lose.

981
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:44,650
Uh, there's two things. You can
have a cash account with them.

982
01:07:44,651 --> 01:07:47,710
You put money into the cash account and
you haven't bought shares with it yet,

983
01:07:48,070 --> 01:07:50,960
it's just sitting here.
It's like in a bank. Um,

984
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:54,550
you could lose that because good body
and company is going bankrupt, right?

985
01:07:54,551 --> 01:07:57,460
It doesn't have it anymore.
And what about your shares?

986
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:02,420
Where are good body and
company is supposed to have
your shares, right? But they,

987
01:08:02,421 --> 01:08:05,440
they, they, they generally hold
them in what's called street name.

988
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:10,660
And that means good body and company
owns the shares and you just have a

989
01:08:10,930 --> 01:08:14,350
contractual relationship with
good body that in principle,

990
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:16,890
some of those shares are yours.
Um,

991
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:21,410
but the company that you're investing
in ultimately doesn't have your money.

992
01:08:21,411 --> 01:08:25,160
It's, it's good body that they're
dealing with, although they have ways of,

993
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:28,520
for proxy and their ways of
finding out who, who's who.

994
01:08:28,940 --> 01:08:32,600
But the problem is if your
brokerage fee for from fails,

995
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,970
you could lose a lot.

996
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:39,170
You could lose your cash account
and your security account. So, uh,

997
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:43,610
civic was set up in 1970 a and civic,
uh,

998
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:47,030
insurance cash accounts up to $100,000

999
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:52,550
and, uh, securities
accounts up to 500,000.

1000
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:57,880
And so, uh, that's another
example of government, uh,

1001
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:00,360
involvement, uh, in, uh,

1002
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:05,270
as a civic was set up by an
act of Congress. Uh, and, uh,

1003
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,680
so, uh, the, um,

1004
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,430
unfortunately, I don't know
if you've ever heard of civic.

1005
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,710
Most people don't even know it exists.
Uh,

1006
01:09:15,711 --> 01:09:20,300
civic did a survey of the U
s population. Uh, and, uh,

1007
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:25,210
this is one of the, in 2001, this is
one of the questions civic asked. Um,

1008
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:29,990
the response were asked to identify the
organization that insures you against

1009
01:09:29,991 --> 01:09:34,190
losing money in the stock market or
as the result of investment fraud.

1010
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:39,710
Uh, only 16% of investors knew
that there is no such company.

1011
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:42,920
They make me. It's clear.
SIPOC does not. If you,

1012
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:46,520
if you invest in some
stock and it does badly,

1013
01:09:46,790 --> 01:09:51,290
you can't go to civic and say,
Hey, I, my stocks went down,

1014
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:55,370
but please give me my money
back. Uh, they won't do it.

1015
01:09:56,570 --> 01:10:00,860
And Moreover, if you say this
stockbroker, he was lying to me.

1016
01:10:00,861 --> 01:10:04,790
He told me that this was a good investment
and he even lied and said something

1017
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:07,430
to get me roped in.
They won't pay you back.

1018
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:12,530
The only thing that civic does is
replaced securities. In other words,

1019
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:16,790
if you had an account at a brokerage and
you thought you had a hundred shares of

1020
01:10:16,791 --> 01:10:21,260
IBM and now the broker is going bankrupt
and the broker won't answer your email

1021
01:10:21,261 --> 01:10:26,180
anymore and it's just gone, you
go to civic and say, I, you know,

1022
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:31,181
I had these a hundred chairs civic
then returns a hundred shares to you.

1023
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:35,060
They don't pay you.
Can they give you the hundred shares?

1024
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:38,840
And that's all they do. Uh,
so you might say that we,

1025
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:42,440
our regulation hasn't gone far enough
and I think maybe it hasn't gone far

1026
01:10:42,441 --> 01:10:47,120
enough. Uh, we protect certain kinds of
things and people have to pay attention.

1027
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:52,010
W the, it's a difficult problem
that not everyone is smart.

1028
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:56,510
They vary in their ability.
So we try to make a world in which,

1029
01:10:56,790 --> 01:11:01,310
uh, it's pretty safe for the small
investor who's not paying attention,

1030
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:06,640
but it's never perfect and we can't
figure out yet a way to make it perfect.

1031
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:12,140
And we still have four small investors
who are defrauded, who are treated badly,

1032
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:14,430
and the subprime crisis as an example,

1033
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:18,360
some people were treated badly
in this recent financial crisis.

1034
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:23,040
So we just have to keep improving our
regulation and trying to make it a deal

1035
01:11:23,041 --> 01:11:25,170
with all of the problems as they come up.

1036
01:11:25,171 --> 01:11:30,171
The problems are complex because we're
trying to make a system in which people

1037
01:11:30,511 --> 01:11:34,590
are able to make their own decisions as
much as possible and to make them in a

1038
01:11:34,591 --> 01:11:36,960
way that, uh, in an
environment that they trust,

1039
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:41,370
but it's just too complicated and too,
it's impossible to make it work perfectly.

1040
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,020
All right, so that will conclude this
lecture. So us, I won't be here Monday,

1041
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:48,870
but I'll, I, TA's will, uh,

1042
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:53,370
will handle the exam and I'll,
I'll see you on Wednesday.
