1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,870
All right. This is the, uh,
second of two lectures, uh,

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,360
from Lawrence Summers.
Uh, me just say again,

3
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:12,120
this is the a o chem
lecture series off of,

4
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:16,950
created by an anonymous donor in honor
of Arthur oaken at the last lecture.

5
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,010
I was very pleased to hear the number
of fond memories very summers has of

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,210
Arthur oaken. Uh, so, uh,
at today's lecture, uh,

7
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:31,170
I think some people felt that we didn't
have enough time for question and answer.

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:32,160
Uh,

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,160
and so we plan to allocate
a half hour to that.

10
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:41,010
Does that sound good? So, uh, Larry will

11
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,823
well,
um,

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,640
wrap up just before the hour and
we'll have a good discussion.

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,090
[inaudible]

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:00,203
okay.

15
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,830
Judging by the discussions,

16
00:01:02,831 --> 00:01:07,831
I had an opportunity to
have lunch and a dinner.

17
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,510
I would suggest a, a, a,

18
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,560
a proposal for a, for you, Bob, with
respect to next year's Okin lecture.

19
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,880
Um, invite the Oakland lecturer
to give his first lecture,

20
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,670
then let him have dinner and let them
have lunch with the Yale Faculty and then

21
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:32,941
let him ponder what he's been told for
three weeks and invite him to come back

22
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,630
and encourage him to emphasize
what he was told rather than,

23
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,600
um,

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,600
any ideas he might have and you would get
substantially better oak and lectures.

25
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,830
I suspect as a con, as
a consequence if, uh,

26
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,630
the feedback that I got,
um, is, uh, any guide,

27
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:59,890
I want to thank everybody, uh,
for their hospitality. And I,

28
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:04,230
uh, having seen a certain number of, uh,

29
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:09,630
these kinds of lecture series over
time when I was president of Harvard,

30
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:13,630
uh, my deepest nightmare,
one of my deepest nightmares,

31
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:17,680
some of might do my nightmares actually
came true, but some of my lesser deeper,

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,800
lesser nightmares as president of
Harvard for the sequential lecture series

33
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:27,700
where at the third lecture,
no one came.

34
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,510
And so as a lecturer, I, uh,

35
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,780
was concerned the judgment of those
who have seen the product is a of more

36
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:39,940
interest in the judgment
of those who have not.

37
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:43,390
So the fact that the room looks a little
bit like the room looked yesterday,

38
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,430
I take as at least mild
encouragement and a validation,

39
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,710
uh, to, uh, proceed.

40
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:56,110
Yesterday I talked about two types of,

41
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,120
uh,
recessions,

42
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,750
what referred to as disinflation
recessions in which the Fed stepped on the

43
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:08,770
brakes,
the economy slowed,

44
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,060
the feds stepped off the brakes,
the economy reaccelerating.

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,400
And what was my larger, uh, focus, uh,

46
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:23,401
financial system breakdown recessions
in which in one way or another,

47
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:29,010
bubbles burst or banks faced liquidity
problems where the supply of finance,

48
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:31,930
uh,

49
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,220
dried up and the economy suffered.

50
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:42,180
I suggested that the latter category of
recession was the historical pattern of

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,633
procession,

52
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:51,210
that there were some signs that
the more relevant problem for,

53
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,180
uh,

54
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:57,180
the United States going forward
might well be the latter kind of,

55
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,510
uh, uh, might well be, uh, the ladder, uh,

56
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,120
kind of recession, uh, as well.

57
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,940
And I implied,
I thought I will develop a,

58
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:16,000
in the course of these remarks
that, uh, the incipient recession,

59
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:16,661
uh,

60
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:21,661
in the United States is almost certainly
of the ladder financial breakdown,

61
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,930
a variety rather than,
uh,

62
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,260
the disinflation a variety.

63
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,600
We have had a instructive,
uh,

64
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,880
for me,
uh,

65
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,970
conversations at a both dinner and
lunch on the question of how one thinks

66
00:04:44,921 --> 00:04:46,240
about,
uh,

67
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:51,450
these two categories of recession
in the context of an ISL m,

68
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:58,420
uh, model or in the context of a, uh,

69
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,110
simple, uh, some kind of a simple,

70
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,170
a macro economic model.

71
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,860
The correct answer to that question I
think is that it's pretty unambiguous that

72
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,550
a disinflation recession is best thought
of as the Federal Reserve tightening

73
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:19,864
money,

74
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,960
which represents some kind of leftward
movement of the LM curve that output,

75
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,533
uh,

76
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,710
declined and interest rates rise.

77
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:38,190
And that that's the proximate a shock
that is bringing about the recession,

78
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,870
that it turns out to be a
matter of semantic ambiguity.

79
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,930
What,
how to think about a financial crisis,

80
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,160
a recession in the context
of a simple macro model.

81
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,910
Everybody agrees on the movement of
three variables in such a recession,

82
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,240
output goes down, queue goes, uh,

83
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:16,450
down and short term
interest rates go down.

84
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,240
One instinct,

85
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,550
which is probably not the first
instinct in the city of new haven,

86
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,240
is to think of that recession in a
traditional ISL m curve with the I s curve

87
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,770
and the LM curve beings plotted in a space
determined by the level of output and

88
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:45,980
the short term interest
rate in that formulation.

89
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:51,490
It is clearly an I asked shock
the level of output declines,

90
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,160
the level of interest
rates decline, uh, as well.

91
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:04,390
And alternative of formulation and a
formulation that is probably more in the

92
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:11,321
spirit of a Yale economics is to think
of the ISL m diagram as having been drawn

93
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:21,191
in a space that focuses on output and
the required return to capital or focuses

94
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:26,240
on output and queue.

95
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:30,320
And in a formulation of that kind,

96
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,820
there hasn't been a shock
to the relationship between
investment in the price of

97
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,350
capital. There's been a shock to, uh,

98
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:43,100
the price of capital at any given
level of the short term interest rate.

99
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:48,580
And so one thinks of it as part
of the dynamics of the LM curve.

100
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,631
However,

101
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:55,631
one views that a question of the
IRS curve versus the LM curve,

102
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:02,450
the operative, uh,
distinction between, uh,

103
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,480
the two kinds of shocks is
that in a disinflation shock,

104
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,360
interest rates are up and that is why
output is down in a financial breakdown.

105
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,650
Shock output is down and that is
why policy interest rates were safe.

106
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:27,500
Uh, interest rates are
reduced from that perspective.

107
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:31,090
It's very clear what the current uh,

108
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:32,840
episode is.

109
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:38,110
As expectations of future output have
declined as asset prices have declined,

110
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,190
one is seen very substantial declines
in a treasury bond yields and in uh,

111
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,810
the federal funds rate for those
who are aficionados of such things.

112
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,760
I will mention that
for a period of a week,

113
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,150
the five year tips yield
was significantly nit,

114
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:10,731
was negative at one point
reaching negative 22 basis points.

115
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,820
And that there was a brief three hour
period in Japan when the one month

116
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:23,760
treasury bill was yielding.
Not two basis points,

117
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,500
not one basis point,

118
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,740
but literally a zero basis points as a
consequence of various machinations in

119
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:39,171
the money market that had
the character of an extreme,

120
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,480
a flight to safety.

121
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:49,100
If one thinks about the duration and
the policy response to recessions of uh,

122
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,290
these two kinds,

123
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:57,291
they are usefully distinguished the
policy response and the dynamics of

124
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:03,870
disinflation.
Recessions are not profoundly complicated.

125
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:09,450
The Fed steps on the brakes depending
on how hard the Fed steps on the brakes,

126
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,810
the recessions duration is uncertain
at a firt at a certain point when it is

127
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:20,481
satisfied that sufficient disinflation
has taken place or when it feels that

128
00:10:21,601 --> 00:10:26,400
other imperatives take precedence,
the Fed removes its foot from the brakes,

129
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,700
allow short term interest rates to decline
and eventually the economy expands.

130
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:34,980
There's no great mystery about it.

131
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,280
The length and depth of the recession is
closely tied to the strength force and

132
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:45,090
length of the Fed tightening
and the speed with which, uh,

133
00:10:45,091 --> 00:10:46,830
it eases.
Hence,

134
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:51,831
there was much more disinflation to
be done in 1980 82 and the recession

135
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,180
interest rates were pushed up much
further. The recession was, uh,

136
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,410
that much more severe.

137
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,920
The matter is much more complex.

138
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,150
When one turns to,
uh,

139
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,500
financial, uh, turns, uh,

140
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:15,060
to financial overextension,
uh, recessions.

141
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,260
Thinking about the limited sample of data,

142
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,100
it falls into two broad categories.
Uh,

143
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,890
the first is the recessions that
didn't happen or happened only barely.

144
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,400
There was a pretty exciting financial
crisis in 1987 and nothing really

145
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:36,090
happened.
Uh,

146
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,460
there was a pretty exciting financial
crisis for those involved in 1998 and in

147
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:46,950
neither case, if I gave you the data
on unemployment, GNP consumption,

148
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,480
any real variable,
and I didn't give you the timescale,

149
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,610
and I said, what year did we have
a percent stock market crash?

150
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:59,290
What year did we have a really dramatic
set of dislocations in financial

151
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:03,490
markets? As a major hedge fund failed,
you wouldn't be able to see it.

152
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,510
Even the 2001,
a recession,

153
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:10,210
which was associated with
the bursting of the Nasdaq.

154
00:12:10,211 --> 00:12:14,140
A bubble is a pretty minimalist recession,
uh,

155
00:12:14,141 --> 00:12:18,520
in retrospect, uh, with,
uh, the data revised,

156
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:23,200
there is no two quarter
period when, uh, Ga,

157
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:27,820
when GDP declined,
there are too pure to quarters.

158
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,010
Uh,
in which GDP declined put,

159
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:33,670
they're separated by a quarter
of modest positive growth.

160
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,480
So it is not the case that all financial
crises or even most financial crises

161
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,630
lead,
uh,

162
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:48,690
to economic downturns and some
have a natural explanation of that.

163
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,760
Essentially they explained that the
financial sector is only one small part of

164
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,600
uh,

165
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,600
the economy that the decline
in the financial sector
of the economy is a not of

166
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,890
that much a consequence.

167
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:20,250
And with reasonable policy responses
either with monetary policy or with fiscal

168
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:25,150
policy and automatic stabilizers,

169
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,640
any loss and demand, uh, can, uh,

170
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:30,910
be offset.

171
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,490
A not a typical calculation
of this kind would say,

172
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:41,491
suppose the stock market
lost 20% of its value.

173
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,620
If the value of the stock market is
on the order of the value of a GNP,

174
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:56,310
that's a loss of 20% of a GNP.

175
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:02,010
If the marginal propensity to
consume out of wealth is a 4%,

176
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,520
the loss is a 10th of a percent of Gen p
and amount that an economy would rather

177
00:14:10,331 --> 00:14:11,320
not lose,

178
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:16,620
but hardly the difference between
economic success and economic failure and

179
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:22,020
something that's potentially
offset. Uh, if there is, uh,

180
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,420
some, uh, policy of response.

181
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,860
And so there is data and evidence,
uh,

182
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,090
for the view that,
uh,

183
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:39,270
a significant amount of financial
disruption can take place with relatively

184
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:45,790
little consequence for,
uh, the real economy.

185
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,960
The difficulty is that there are other
data points as well as 1987 and 19,

186
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,520
uh, 98 and, uh,

187
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,630
2001,

188
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,080
there are data points to come from the
United States in the aftermath of 1929.

189
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:14,510
While those perhaps or in so different
and institutional environment with such

190
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:18,890
agregious errors as to,
uh, not be relevant.

191
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,600
There are data points from, uh, Japan, uh,

192
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,460
during the 1990s.

193
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:30,820
There are any number of data points
of from emerging markets in which,

194
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:37,160
uh, the reality of financial problems, uh,

195
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,630
created a very large, uh, losses,

196
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,130
uh,
output.

197
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And so it's natural to ask why is
the response to a financial crises,

198
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,190
uh,

199
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:56,990
so heterogeneous with some episodes
in which they seem to have very little

200
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:02,560
consequence and some episodes
in which they seem to have.

201
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,970
Uh, so, uh,

202
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,810
very much I think the natural,
uh,

203
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,840
explanation though it's a difficult to
prove in any kind of a conclusive a way

204
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:21,020
is an idea that runs through the work
of many economists. And probably in,

205
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,720
uh, recent, uh, decades,
uh, most strongly, uh,

206
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,670
through Ben Bernanke, he's, uh,

207
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:32,890
work suggesting that financial
intermediation capital is a substantial

208
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:37,820
contributor to the production process.

209
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,850
And when it is destroyed,
uh,

210
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,930
suddenly there are substantial losses
both to aggregate supply and to aggregate

211
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,110
a demand.
I made this point,

212
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,970
tried to make this point graphic in a
conversation with one of your colleagues

213
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,760
by asking, uh, the question.

214
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:10,420
Suppose one considered the following
macro economic shock for the next six

215
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:13,664
months.

216
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:19,120
It will not be possible to make and
complete a phone call in the United in the

217
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:21,470
United States.

218
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,610
What would be likely to happen to the GDP
of the United States and what would be

219
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:33,320
likely to happen to the performance of,
uh,

220
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,820
the American economy?

221
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,920
It's actually sort of an interesting
question and I don't have a clue exactly

222
00:17:39,921 --> 00:17:41,780
what the right answer is.

223
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:47,140
My strong suspicion is that it
would really be quite a bad event,

224
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,700
uh, for the performance of the
economy. The question of whether, um,

225
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,880
the telephone lines would transmit a bits,

226
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,840
uh,

227
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,840
would obviously be very important in
a where would only stop working for,

228
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:10,020
for the human voice would be
a very important determinant.

229
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,340
But in either case,

230
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:16,341
it's hard to believe that there would
not be substantial loss of output and

231
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:22,650
significant loss of employment as well.

232
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,700
There would be many methods for
seeking to estimate the value of,

233
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,090
uh,
the losses.

234
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,490
But I would argue that a particularly
poor method would be to ask what's the

235
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:40,830
market value of all the
telephone companies?

236
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,970
Let's say the market value of all the
telephone companies is $1 trillion.

237
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,460
If they're not going to earn
anything for a year than a,

238
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,310
their market value will
go down by $400 billion.

239
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:57,600
So we'll multiply $400 billion
by a marginal propensity to,

240
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,590
uh,
demand marginal propensity to consume,

241
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,610
and we'll add something for the
fact and we'll call that lost.

242
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,640
I've lost demand and we'll say there
needs to be some increased demand because

243
00:19:08,641 --> 00:19:11,400
we need to fix the phone,
we need to fix the telephones.

244
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:14,010
And so that'll be some
increased investment that would,

245
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:19,190
it seems to me be the wrong mode
of analysis that in some way,

246
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:24,840
one would want to capture
the idea that the protect,

247
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:29,870
that the production potential of the
economy would be lower because the

248
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:36,981
opportunities to generate output out of
a given amount of capital and a given

249
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:42,681
amount of labor would be impossible
without the intercommunication that the

250
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:46,110
telephone,
uh,

251
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:51,170
makes possible the results I would suggest
of that telephone shock would be lost

252
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:59,361
output and would also be lost output
without substantial disinflation a benefit

253
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,580
because the last output would not come,
uh,

254
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,230
in a way that created gluts of goods,
uh,

255
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:18,090
hanging over markets that
lead to declines in prices.

256
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:23,510
The benefit in terms of disinflation of
a downturn induced by the inability to

257
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:30,531
make a phone call would be much less
then the benefit of a similar loss of

258
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,200
output achieved,
uh,

259
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,380
through the more standard tools
of fiscal and monetary policy.

260
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,490
I emphasize this last point because it
connects with the observation with which

261
00:20:48,491 --> 00:20:53,491
I began yesterday that declines in,

262
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,570
uh, output associated with
financial crisis recession.

263
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:04,140
If avoidable probably create a welfare
gain of the kind that aren't Okin focused

264
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:13,410
so much on my end of the kind that Jim
Tobin emphasized when he spoke of all

265
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:18,571
those Harberger triangles filling and
Okin a gap and are not susceptible to the

266
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:24,760
critique that,
uh,

267
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:29,790
what you lose on the swings you gain on
the swerves that's associated with the

268
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:36,220
more conventional view of
cyclical, uh, fluctuations.

269
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,990
It should be clear from what I have said,

270
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:46,210
um, where I am, uh, going,

271
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,820
my suggestion is really to echo,
uh,

272
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,631
Ben Bernanke,

273
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:57,631
he's a suggestion that the destruction
of financial intermediation,

274
00:21:59,490 --> 00:21:59,830
uh,

275
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:04,830
capital should be thought of as
reducing the economy's potential,

276
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,810
uh, to, uh,

277
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,320
generate output in that process,

278
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:16,470
making people poorer and
reducing the level of demand as,

279
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,160
uh,

280
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,160
well when that process kicks in to a
substantial extent that I would suggest is

281
00:22:28,391 --> 00:22:33,391
the occasion on which financial crises
proved to be exciting events outside of

282
00:22:36,791 --> 00:22:41,720
the precincts of, uh, Manhattan and, uh,

283
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,633
Chicago.

284
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,440
And the crucial question
for economic policy.

285
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,870
I in responding, uh, to, uh, these, uh,

286
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:58,080
crises I would suggest is preventing
on that kind of destruction of

287
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:05,551
intermediation capital from
taking place on a large scale.

288
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,910
And that brings me to the policy task,

289
00:23:12,911 --> 00:23:14,620
uh, that, uh,

290
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,790
the US authorities a face at,
uh,

291
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,370
the current, uh, moment.

292
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,240
I like to define,
uh,

293
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,360
the problem as managing
and containing three Ah,

294
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,720
three separate a vicious cycle mechanisms.

295
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,090
The first is the one that I spoke,
I spoke about at length, uh,

296
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,533
yesterday.

297
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:48,680
What one might call the
a psycho the tendency,

298
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:53,980
I'm more than a tendency in the
market for fixed income instruments,

299
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:59,040
particularly mortgage backed securities,
um,

300
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:04,210
to some degree in the market for housing
for declines in value to give rise to

301
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,890
selling pressures that create further
declines in value reinforcing,

302
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,610
uh, the, uh, vicious cycle.

303
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:26,050
The second a vicious
cycle which builds on,

304
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,980
uh,

305
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,780
that is what is traditionally
referred to as the credit accelerator.

306
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:37,890
A Psycho II deteriorating financial
economy leads to less lending leads to a

307
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:47,591
deteriorating really economy leads to
less capacity to pay back a debt leads to

308
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:58,330
declining values of a financial
instruments leads to further reductions in

309
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,540
lending and the cycle continues.

310
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,630
And the third cycle,

311
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:13,631
the third potentially destabilizing
mechanism is the one that's perhaps most

312
00:25:14,871 --> 00:25:15,704
familiar.

313
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,720
The Keynesian mechanism in which reduced
spending leads to reduced income leads

314
00:25:20,721 --> 00:25:23,690
to reduce spending and,
uh,

315
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,720
on containing these mutually reinforcing,

316
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,870
uh,

317
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:34,870
cycles is I would suggest now the
central challenge for economic policy.

318
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:43,310
I am not in a position to make a
authoritative estimates of some of the

319
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:45,710
relevant, uh, magnitudes.

320
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,990
And I don't want my estimates
to be given more seriousness.

321
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:55,460
Uh, then, uh, their crudity, uh,

322
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,390
deserves,

323
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,680
which is why I'm not
projecting them on a screen.

324
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:06,310
But let me give you
some round numbers that,

325
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:07,430
uh,

326
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:12,430
are quite close to the judgment of
the various investment banks and,

327
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:17,690
uh, informed observers who
have studied these questions.

328
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,930
The intermediate,

329
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:25,931
the Equity Capital of leveraged financial
institutions in the United States

330
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,210
totals about $2 trillion.

331
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:35,450
It totaled a little more than two
train dollars a few months ago.

332
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:39,570
It probably totals a little less than
a few trees. Then $2 trillion. Uh,

333
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:44,370
today that $2 trillion of,

334
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,160
uh, capital, uh,

335
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,280
supported about $20
trillion of asset holding.

336
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:59,880
In other words,
those institutions were levered 10 to one.

337
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:05,930
Some were levered much
more than 10 to one.

338
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:10,800
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac
are, for example, levered 30,

339
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,720
uh,
to one.

340
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:18,330
A bank with an 8% capital
requirement is levered. Uh,

341
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:21,510
12, uh, two, uh,

342
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,550
one others,

343
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,580
hedge funds pursuing a certain
strategies are levered considerably less,

344
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,920
uh, then, uh, 10 to one. But on average,

345
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,270
the leverage works out to about 10 to one,

346
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,420
$2 trillion of equity capital,

347
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,740
$20 trillion of, uh, lending

348
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,930
the losses that have,
uh,

349
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,690
taken place over the last,
uh,

350
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,900
nine months and the projected losses based
on reasonable models of fundamentals.

351
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:11,300
These are not mark to market losses
that build in what might be market over

352
00:28:12,111 --> 00:28:13,200
reactions.

353
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,500
These are estimates of what will
happen to mortgage securities based on

354
00:28:18,691 --> 00:28:20,310
assumptions that for example,

355
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:25,311
house prices will decline by
another 15% from current levels.

356
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,780
Estimates of,
uh,

357
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,920
those total losses are
about a trillion dollars.

358
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:40,490
That trillion dollar figure sounds very
scary relative to $2 trillion of capital

359
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,010
in the intermediation sector.

360
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,700
But good news about half those losses
are outside the financial intermediary.

361
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:57,540
A sector there, a bill
Brainerd's pension. Um,

362
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:01,920
there, uh, the state of
Nebraska is a pension fund.

363
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:06,200
They're the Yale endowment, their
life insurance companies. Um,

364
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,400
and uh,
the like,

365
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:13,670
so about half are held by levered,

366
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,140
uh, are held by levered, uh,

367
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:23,610
intermediaries and more good news.
Um,

368
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:27,750
but levered intermediaries are mostly
sooner or later in one way or another,

369
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:32,580
going to get tax deductions
of various kinds.

370
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,760
And so when all is said and done,

371
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:41,660
the losses of capital to
the intermediation sector
represent about 300 billion,

372
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:48,760
uh,
dollars.

373
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:55,260
$300 billion of lost capital has been
offset so far by about $150 billion of

374
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:08,041
capital that has been raised in city
groups deal with Abu Dhabi and the like.

375
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,450
And so lost capitol,
which is,

376
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:18,750
which can be estimated with some degree
of accuracy compared to the next step

377
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,350
in, uh, this, uh,

378
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,410
calculation represents,
um,

379
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,920
about 150,
$1 billion,

380
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:35,790
$150 billion of lost capital at 10 to
one leverage means a trillion dollar,

381
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,570
trillion and a half dollars
of lost intermediation,

382
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,883
uh,

383
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:49,950
capacity or about seven and a half percent
of the financial asset holding that

384
00:30:51,611 --> 00:30:53,770
was previously taking place.

385
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,830
Now here comes a wildcard.

386
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:03,630
What should happen to the leverage of
intermediaries in the face of the events

387
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:11,890
of the last nine months?
Well,

388
00:31:11,891 --> 00:31:12,970
first of all,

389
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:18,030
they probably should have learned from
the last nine months that the degree of

390
00:31:18,851 --> 00:31:23,851
leverage with which they were operating
nine months ago was excessive.

391
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,250
Second,

392
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:32,700
they almost certainly will judge that
the volatility associated with the assets

393
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,080
they hold and the degree of uncertainty
about their portfolios is today very

394
00:31:43,331 --> 00:31:44,920
substantially greater.

395
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,910
Not just then they thought
it was nine months ago,

396
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:53,710
but then that objective
Lee was nine months ago.

397
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,340
And third,
the,

398
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
the magnitude of tail risk of existential
events which will cause the solvency

399
00:32:05,321 --> 00:32:09,100
of their institution to
come into fundamental, uh,

400
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,660
doubt has surely increased as well.

401
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:20,100
I don't think we have a sound basis for
estimating how much prudent institutions

402
00:32:25,451 --> 00:32:27,790
will reduce,
uh,

403
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:32,850
their leverage and the leverage choices
they make will of course be very much

404
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:38,101
influenced in some cases by the way
in which the government applies.

405
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,330
Uh, capital, uh,

406
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:46,570
rules if one makes the c conservative,

407
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,060
but in my view,

408
00:32:50,061 --> 00:32:55,061
not absurd assumption that
leverage will be reduced by 10%.

409
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,230
10% leverage,

410
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:05,980
a 10% reduction in leverage on a $20
trillion base of asset holding represents

411
00:33:10,401 --> 00:33:15,401
the loss of another $2
trillion in lending capacity.

412
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,960
Add the one and a half
trillion dollars and uh,

413
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:28,990
the to $1 trillion and you are looking
at the loss of on the order of three and

414
00:33:33,921 --> 00:33:38,921
a half trillion dollars or on the
order of 15% of the previous financial

415
00:33:43,191 --> 00:33:45,200
intermediation capacity.

416
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:51,460
It is not unreasonable at all to
suppose that this is a shock that is of

417
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:59,140
substantial magnitude relative to the
functioning of the financial system.

418
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:07,420
And to the extent that the economy
is dependent on the ability, uh,

419
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:12,550
to get credit to the functioning
of the economy and that route,

420
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:22,810
it is the challenge of policy to
address this shock in this environment.

421
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,080
What are the tools that
are available on to,

422
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,700
uh,
policy makers?

423
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:40,930
The first imperative of a policy
and one that has been pursued,

424
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:48,680
uh, in this crisis since
the beginning of 2008,

425
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:52,780
or be it in my judgment, uh, somewhat, uh,

426
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:57,970
belatedly is to seek to
maintain aggregate demand.

427
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,500
Whatever else is happening and
environment of this kind is likely to be a

428
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:09,410
disinflationary uh,
environment over time.

429
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,870
It is likely to be an environment
in which if spending is reduced,

430
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:19,871
asset values will decline further
compounding the degree of economic damage.

431
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:29,270
How do policy makers seek to maintain,
uh,

432
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,950
aggregate demand before these,

433
00:35:33,951 --> 00:35:37,130
before the events of the last,
uh,

434
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:42,120
18 months?
If asked to comment on this subject,

435
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,040
I would have said,
uh,

436
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:49,340
the dominant tool of short
run stabilization policy
should be monetary policy,

437
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,840
fiscal policy.

438
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:57,710
And I would have explained that a fiscal
policy except in the shortest of runs

439
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:05,030
was likely to be offset by the Federal
Reserve and so it would end up affecting

440
00:36:06,361 --> 00:36:07,800
the composition of output,

441
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,880
not the level of output,

442
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:17,450
and I would further have explained that
it was much more destructive of long run

443
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:23,031
values to try to very spending or the
tax structure in a short run way in order

444
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:29,241
to stabilize the economy and that that
was best accomplished through a monetary

445
00:36:30,631 --> 00:36:31,464
policy.

446
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,640
I continue to regard that as a reasonable
judgment about policy in normal times,

447
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:49,250
but it seems to me that while it is
appropriate in this environment to seek to

448
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:55,680
use monetary policy as a tool of stimulus,

449
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:01,280
there are several considerations that
suggests that it should not be the sole

450
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,710
tool of stimulus in this environment.
First,

451
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,040
there is much more than the normal degree
of uncertainty about what the impact

452
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:21,830
of changes in interest rates will
be on the level of aggregate demand.

453
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,020
Imagine,
for example,

454
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,800
an intermediary that
is capital constraint.

455
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,760
It only has $1 billion of capital and
it therefore can only lend $10 billion.

456
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,740
Imagine now that the rate
of interest is brought down,

457
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:47,150
it can still only lend $10 billion and
the rate at which it lens will still be

458
00:37:49,741 --> 00:37:54,741
the point at which the demand curve
for its loans is act $10 billion.

459
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:00,870
The only result of bringing down the
interest rate will be a reduction in its

460
00:38:00,871 --> 00:38:01,860
cost of funding,

461
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,320
which over time will allow
it to rebuild a it's capitol.

462
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,630
But that is a very slow process,

463
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:15,000
a very different situation than the
more normal situation in which the

464
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,640
intermediary is not constraint.

465
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:22,080
Is this the case for most intermediaries?
It's very difficult to know.

466
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,730
Most intermediaries are not
at their capital constraint,

467
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:32,090
but they probably are planning for
some given cushion relative to uh,

468
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:37,570
their capital constraint.
In this environment,

469
00:38:37,571 --> 00:38:42,571
it is likely that the multiplier from
monetary policy is less and did he surely

470
00:38:43,121 --> 00:38:48,070
more uncertain. And that is an
inhibition to the use of monetary policy.

471
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,760
Second inhibition to the use of monetary
policy as a sole tool is most of the

472
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:59,140
time with respect to
most economic policies,

473
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:04,360
we may not know what the multiplier
associated with the instrument is,

474
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,900
but we know where,
uh,

475
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,930
we have set the policy dial through
all of modern economic experience,

476
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:16,990
uh,
until uh,

477
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:22,020
nine months ago it would be completely
impossible to use any known econometric

478
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:29,371
technique to say anything about the
impact of changes in the Fed funds rate as

479
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:36,451
distinct from changes in library on
the behavior of the aggregate economy

480
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:42,600
because they were perfectly here as the
spread between them was small and little

481
00:39:44,741 --> 00:39:47,950
fluctuating in the last nine months,

482
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,160
a substantial spread has emerged
between the Fed funds rate,

483
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:58,420
the rate at which banks lend
to each other, uh, overnight.

484
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,010
And the,
uh,

485
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:06,180
interbank rate that prevails over a
longer horizons for a variety of reasons

486
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:11,910
that I don't have time
to get into. It is, uh,

487
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:16,840
almost certainly the case that large
parts of this spread reflect the credit

488
00:40:16,841 --> 00:40:21,810
risk, uh, that banks
experience, uh, when, uh,

489
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:24,100
they lend to each other.

490
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,880
Probably the right indicator for monetary
policy is not the Fed funds rate,

491
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:35,710
but he's live war in which case there
has been rather less easing of monetary

492
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:40,000
policy then looking at the
Fed funds rate would suggest,

493
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:45,160
but one cannot make that
decision in a definitive way.

494
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
And so easing monetary policy as the Fed
has been doing for some time and as the

495
00:40:51,191 --> 00:40:56,191
Fed did today in lowering the rate another
25 basis points is almost certainly

496
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,613
appropriate,

497
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:05,220
but it is almost certainly not appropriate
to rely only on a single instrument

498
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:12,390
in this context because one is uncertain
about how much of that instrument is,

499
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:19,230
one is applied because one is uncertain
about what the multiplier of that

500
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,700
instrument is. And because
in the current, uh,

501
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,110
context,

502
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,440
there are reasons to be concerned
about the pernicious side effects of

503
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,190
excessively low interest
rates to stand out.

504
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:41,270
Uh, the first, uh, while in general,

505
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:44,250
I am very much with,
uh,

506
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:49,420
the Keynesian consensus that the inflation
process depends upon a aggregate,

507
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,120
uh,

508
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,600
do aggregate demand in
the current context.

509
00:41:55,601 --> 00:42:00,601
A lower interest rates may well contribute
directly to the inflation process

510
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:06,320
through their impact on the dollar and
through their impact on commodity prices.

511
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,020
The second while,

512
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:14,050
I give less weight than most to
critiques of a to critiques of the policy

513
00:42:17,151 --> 00:42:21,980
environment that blame our
current problems on the fact
that interest rates were

514
00:42:21,981 --> 00:42:26,981
kept a low for a long time
responding to the last,

515
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,370
uh,
recession.

516
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:33,770
It seems to me reasonable to give some
weight to the concern that excessively

517
00:42:33,771 --> 00:42:38,000
low interest rates set the
stage for future bubbles.

518
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,520
I therefore think it's appropriate that,
uh,

519
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:48,580
the congress acted and I suspect the
congress wold need to act again to provide

520
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,380
fiscal stimulus, uh, to, uh,

521
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:59,470
the economy in advocating fiscals
in advocating a fiscal stimulus,

522
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,860
uh,
just after the turn of the year.

523
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:09,220
I urge that the stimulus be timely
because experience suggests that,

524
00:43:10,731 --> 00:43:11,390
uh,

525
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:15,740
the difficulty of lags in implementation
have traditionally been serious with

526
00:43:15,741 --> 00:43:19,940
respect to fiscal policy
that it be targeted,

527
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:20,930
uh,

528
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:25,430
designed to generate as
much spending as possible,

529
00:43:25,431 --> 00:43:26,690
as quickly as possible,

530
00:43:26,691 --> 00:43:31,310
which meant that tax breaks should be
channeled to those with lower incomes

531
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:36,110
rather than those with higher incomes.
That recommendation was adopted,

532
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,650
meant that,
uh,

533
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:42,820
taxes meant that a benefit programs
that went to people like food stamps and

534
00:43:43,101 --> 00:43:46,100
unemployment insurance recipients who
were likely to have a very high marginal

535
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:50,990
propensity to consume the political
process was unwilling, uh,

536
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,190
to, uh, do was, was unwilling, uh,

537
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,430
to,
uh,

538
00:43:56,540 --> 00:44:01,540
do that and the fiscal
stimulus be temporary in light
of the seriousness of the

539
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:07,730
country's long run a fiscal problems.

540
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:12,840
So macro economic policy in,
uh,

541
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,240
this,
uh,

542
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,100
environment can help to maintain,
uh,

543
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,870
aggregate demand,

544
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:26,530
but it does not address the disruption
in the productive mechanism associated

545
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:34,721
with the decline in the
financial sectors capacity.

546
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,420
Uh, for, uh, intermediation.

547
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:45,630
There are a number of tools
of policy directed at, uh,

548
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,250
the maintenance of, uh,
financial stability.

549
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:56,030
One has received overwhelming emphasis
today and it is entirely appropriate,

550
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,700
but I would suggest
presumptively insufficient.

551
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:08,690
And that is the Fed through a dizzying
array of new facilities and ad hoc

552
00:45:13,231 --> 00:45:18,231
actions has made clear that it stands
ready against good collateral to provide

553
00:45:24,031 --> 00:45:28,350
liquidity to financial institutions.

554
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:34,610
Now go back to the calculations.

555
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:40,170
Uh,
that I went through a moment ago.

556
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:46,100
I emphasized the loss of capital and
I represented the desired reduction in

557
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:59,750
levels of leverage associated
with a more risky environment.

558
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:06,410
I did not say anything in doing those
calculations about the difficulty of

559
00:46:07,471 --> 00:46:08,910
attracting funds,

560
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,070
about the difficulty of borrowing funds,

561
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:19,670
I did not raise the concern
about a bank runs and,

562
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,110
uh,
the life,

563
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:28,160
the provision of liquidity
by the Fed is necessary.

564
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,330
Without it in my judgment,

565
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:38,331
it is very likely that we would have
seen problematic runs on a number of

566
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,230
institutions.

567
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:48,860
I believe the Fed behaved in a broadly
correct way in responding to the events

568
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,470
at a bear Sterns.

569
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:58,190
It is certainly possible that if the
Fed had not acted the losses to bear

570
00:47:01,171 --> 00:47:03,660
Stearns shareholders
would have been total.

571
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:08,370
There would have been
substantial disruption in the
bond markets for a period of

572
00:47:08,371 --> 00:47:09,330
five days,

573
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:14,690
a valuable lesson would have been taught
and the matter and the world would have

574
00:47:15,601 --> 00:47:20,580
moved forward. It is certainly
possible that that is the case.

575
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,560
It seems to me one doesn't need to
assign a very high probability to the

576
00:47:25,561 --> 00:47:30,561
alternative scenario in which
runs on bear Stearns cascaded,

577
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:35,500
uh, to other institutions, um,

578
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:40,620
which then cascaded to other institutions
and led to substantial destruction of

579
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:46,480
many institutions that were
thought previously viable.

580
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,520
I don't think one has to assign
a very great probability, uh,

581
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:55,560
to the latter of event to believe that
a rescue of bear Stearns was worthwhile.

582
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:01,500
And I myself would co would assign
a much greater than 50% probability,

583
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:06,800
uh, to a major systemic risk, uh,

584
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:11,850
incident if the damage at bear
Stearns had not been a contained.

585
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:17,740
But in any event,
while noting the necessity of all of that,

586
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:20,740
I want to emphasize it's insufficiency,

587
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:26,610
that it does nothing about either the
reduction in capital and it does very

588
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:32,710
little about the reduction in desire.

589
00:48:32,711 --> 00:48:37,711
Degrees of leverage that I would
suggest are at the root of the problem.

590
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:45,300
That brings me to what is I think
the second crucial tool of uh,

591
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,720
financial stability,

592
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:55,140
which is the most important financial
policy issue in the current environment.

593
00:48:58,510 --> 00:49:00,340
And unfortunately by its nature,

594
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,470
it is difficult to tell the vigor
with which it is being pursued.

595
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:11,370
And that is the infusion of new
capital into financial institutions.

596
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,730
Notice that if financial institutions
raise their level of capital,

597
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,550
then at any given level of leverage,

598
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:26,620
they are able to raise
their degree of lending.

599
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,210
And you were able to re-institute
the intermediation capacity,

600
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:35,740
uh, that has, uh, been, uh,

601
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:40,210
that has been lost.
There is a crucial,

602
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:45,690
an internalized externality in our
current system of financial regulation.

603
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:54,540
Institutions are regulated and their
soundness is judged on the basis of a

604
00:49:57,431 --> 00:49:58,480
capital ratio,

605
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:02,590
on the basis of their degree of leverage.

606
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:08,400
They are pressured rationally enough
not to have deposits that are or live,

607
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,640
but short term liabilities that are too
large relative to their degree of kappa.

608
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:25,210
Notice that an institution can acquire,

609
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,590
can reduce,

610
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:31,790
it's can improve its capital
ratio or reduce its leverage.

611
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,590
In one of two ways.

612
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,400
It can reduce its leverage by shrinking
its balance sheet or it can reduce,

613
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:46,180
it's a leverage by expanding
its level of capital.

614
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:53,330
If the institution is indifferent
between those two choices,

615
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:57,080
society is clearly not indifferent.
Uh,

616
00:50:57,410 --> 00:50:59,090
between those two choices,

617
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:04,630
it has a strong preference
for the issuance of capital
or to put essentially the

618
00:51:07,281 --> 00:51:09,980
same point in a different way.

619
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,160
If an institution raises capital,

620
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:19,240
it dilutes its shareholders
and a substantial part of
the benefit of that extra

621
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:25,511
capital goes to the holders of it's risky
debt whose claims have now become more

622
00:51:28,341 --> 00:51:31,790
secure.
As a consequence,

623
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:36,050
the private incentive for capital raising,

624
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:41,860
even with a capitol rule operating as
regulation is substantially less than the

625
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:49,160
social incentive.

626
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:55,300
One hopes that the regulatory system
is internalizing this externality is

627
00:51:59,121 --> 00:52:04,121
placing substantial pressure
on institutions who after all,

628
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:10,030
are enormously dependent on
their relationship with the
financial authorities to

629
00:52:13,311 --> 00:52:18,110
raise more capital than
they otherwise would.

630
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:23,900
It is very difficult to know
from the outside to what extent,

631
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,850
uh, that is, uh, taking, uh,

632
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:33,080
that is uh, taking place, uh,

633
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:38,350
eight prudent regulator who was forcing
an institution to raise more capital,

634
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:44,770
would conspire with that institution to
not have it be known that the regulator

635
00:52:45,171 --> 00:52:50,000
was forcing the institution to raise
more capital last the health of the

636
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:54,500
institution. Uh, come into a question.

637
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,120
Certainly there have been a number of
favorable developments involving the

638
00:52:59,121 --> 00:53:02,780
raising of capital in a recent months,

639
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:06,080
but uh,
in my judgment and uh,

640
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:10,310
the kind of numbers I presented
suggest that we have a long way,

641
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:12,560
a long way to go,

642
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:18,170
I would suggest a particular
importance in uh, this,

643
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,010
uh,

644
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:24,010
re in this regard is the capital
situation of the government sponsored,

645
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:31,610
which are levered 30 to one and which
have a crucial role in this environment in

646
00:53:33,631 --> 00:53:37,770
supporting the mortgage market.
To date,

647
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:42,300
they have been encouraged to buy more
mortgages through a reduction in their

648
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:47,301
capital requirement and there have been
rather diffuse statements about it.

649
00:53:48,211 --> 00:53:51,360
Is there hope and intention to
raise more capital in the future?

650
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:56,390
We've been moving towards the
future. They have not yet raised, uh,

651
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,540
the capital.

652
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:02,870
Some rather skeptical statements about
the need to raise capital have come from

653
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:07,290
their management with as yet
relatively little criticism,

654
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:11,940
uh, from, uh, the public authorities

655
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:17,730
liquidity, raising, uh, capital.

656
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:23,660
The third broad policy question involves
direct more direct intervention,

657
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:29,850
uh, in, uh, markets in my judgment,

658
00:54:29,851 --> 00:54:34,851
any attempt to support the housing market
in general at current levels would be

659
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:37,463
misguided.

660
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:42,990
There's little reason to believe
that house prices have yet fallen to

661
00:54:42,991 --> 00:54:47,850
fundamental levels, let alone
fallen through fundamental levels.

662
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:53,360
The lesson of the Japanese experience
is that price keeping operations by

663
00:54:53,881 --> 00:54:57,300
governments delay processes of adjustment.

664
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,500
Why would anyone want to buy something
whose prices being supported by the

665
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:06,240
government? Since it's likely that
there will be further downwards,

666
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:10,410
a adjustment rather than upwards,
uh,

667
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:15,530
adjustment where there is a much stronger
case is for policy to support the

668
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:25,040
mortgage backed security market where
prices reflect expectations of terrible

669
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,410
perform terribly high
default performances.

670
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:39,120
Some mortgage backed securities
on some classes of subprime debt.

671
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:43,830
Our building in the expectation
that more than half the houses, um,

672
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,510
will be foreclosed.

673
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:50,930
Estimates that go way beyond what even
fairly pessimistic forecasts suggest by

674
00:55:55,081 --> 00:55:55,980
stealth.

675
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:01,340
A rather substantial program of support
for the mortgage back securities market

676
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,430
is um, uh, is underway.

677
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:10,850
Key elements include the actions of the
government sponsored enterprises that I

678
00:56:11,011 --> 00:56:16,011
referred to that will enable $180 billion
of increased purchasing of mortgage

679
00:56:16,561 --> 00:56:17,550
back securities,

680
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:21,660
a similar change on the part
of the federal home loan,

681
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:24,780
a home loan, uh, banks.

682
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:29,110
And if with that 31 leverage ratio,

683
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:34,500
the GSES are caused to raise
a significantly more capital.

684
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:40,210
There is the prospect of
significantly further support for,

685
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:40,870
uh,

686
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:45,870
the mortgage back securities market
who's greater health would impact both on

687
00:56:46,961 --> 00:56:51,961
the availability of credit to potential
new homeowners and the availability,

688
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:53,531
uh,

689
00:56:53,531 --> 00:56:58,531
and the health of the financial
institutions that are holding,

690
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:02,290
uh, their securities. I think,

691
00:57:02,291 --> 00:57:07,291
and I will not dwell on the point for
reasons of a time that there is also a

692
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:15,060
strong a case for policy measures
directed at strategic intervention in near

693
00:57:20,801 --> 00:57:24,640
foreclosure situations to promote,

694
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:25,960
uh,

695
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:30,490
the writing down of
mortgages as an alternative,

696
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:33,040
uh,
to foreclosure.

697
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:38,320
Given that available
estimates suggest that, uh,

698
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:43,440
the losses associated with the foreclosure
process itself can easily add up to

699
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:51,100
more than half the value, uh, the
residual value of the home. Finally,

700
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:56,101
I would highlight the international
dimension of policy and with stress to,

701
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:01,300
uh, aspects. The, uh,

702
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:06,220
global dynamic here is that
two things are happening.

703
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,140
First,
uh,

704
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:13,200
US aggregate demand is falling second
the fall and the dollar ssociate it with,

705
00:58:16,031 --> 00:58:20,860
uh, all the various ramifications of
these financial events are switching

706
00:58:20,861 --> 00:58:24,820
expenditure from the rest
of the world towards, uh,

707
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:27,100
the United States.
Third,

708
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:32,190
some of the forces operating in the
United States are also operating to reduce

709
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:35,320
aggregate demand in the rest of the world.

710
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:41,220
A crucial priority for policy
coordination in that context has to be the

711
00:58:41,471 --> 00:58:44,280
stimulation of aggregate demand,
uh,

712
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:49,320
in the rest of the world and probably the
achievement of a more balanced pattern

713
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:54,190
of dollar depreciation.
To date,

714
00:58:54,191 --> 00:58:58,480
the dollar has depreciated
disproportionately against
a very small number of

715
00:58:58,481 --> 00:59:01,720
currencies, principally the euro, uh,

716
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:06,900
that stand for countries that do not
have problems like those of the United

717
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:11,940
States and that allow their exchange
rate to fluctuate a more balanced path

718
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:13,480
would be desirable.

719
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:19,650
Second priority for policy coordination
is with respect to the very large

720
00:59:21,621 --> 00:59:26,621
quantities of liquidity that
are now managed by governments.

721
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,400
They represent potentially and enormously
important resource in the current

722
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:38,771
context pools of patient capital that
can be managed for the long term and that

723
00:59:43,521 --> 00:59:44,000
can provide,

724
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
that could provide liquidity to badly
distorted fixed income markets but have

725
00:59:50,511 --> 00:59:55,010
not yet done so on a substantial,

726
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,780
uh,
scale.

727
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:01,770
These sets of,
uh,

728
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:04,400
measures represent,

729
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:09,401
I believe a policy approach that offers
a very good though not certain chance of

730
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:17,030
containing the current situation.

731
01:00:18,170 --> 01:00:19,670
The risks,

732
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:25,030
it seems to me are much more on the
side of it being pursued with two little

733
01:00:25,341 --> 01:00:29,810
vigor than on the side of it
being pursued with too much.

734
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,150
And in particular,

735
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:37,630
the imperative of the
rapid recapitalization of
financial institutions stand

736
01:00:39,471 --> 01:00:40,304
out.

737
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:45,910
I will for reasons of a time leave
a discussion that I had intended,

738
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:51,710
uh, raising questions about, uh,

739
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:57,100
the regulatory structure and changes
that might make crises of this kind less

740
01:00:58,341 --> 01:01:02,840
likely, uh, in the future, uh, to,

741
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:05,840
uh, the question, uh, period.

742
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:10,940
But I will just make a five
telegraphic observations.

743
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,433
First,

744
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:17,500
it is the irony of financial crisis that
the very forces that caused it are the

745
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:24,530
opposite. Uh, are the,

746
01:01:24,531 --> 01:01:29,390
are also the very forces that
are necessary to get out of it.

747
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:35,290
If the world's problem 18 months ago was
that there was too much greed and too

748
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:37,160
little fear.

749
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:42,880
The world's problem today is that there
is too much fear and too little greed.

750
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:50,980
The policies that would have been
highly constructive 18 months ago in

751
01:01:51,951 --> 01:01:54,550
inhibiting undesirable,
uh,

752
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:59,590
lending are potentially counterproductive
today in inhibiting constructive

753
01:02:01,101 --> 01:02:02,870
lending.
Second,

754
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:08,500
there's an overwhelming case for
stronger consumer regulation in all,

755
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:13,360
uh, financial areas. Uh,

756
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:18,670
if one studies carefully the extent to
its subprime mortgages at agregious,

757
01:02:19,590 --> 01:02:24,590
interest rates were taken
on to help people get out
of credit card debt at super

758
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:28,110
egregious rates.

759
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:33,410
One has a sense of the greater complexity
of the problem and the need to view it

760
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:37,170
from an integrated
consumer. Uh, perspective.

761
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:42,990
Third, the government should
be paid for providing,

762
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:43,820
uh,

763
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:48,820
the safe should be paid for providing the
safety net and the modalities that are

764
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:54,360
necessary to do that, uh, need to be, uh,

765
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:55,890
carefully,
uh,

766
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,470
need to be much more
carefully designed so that a,

767
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:05,610
if everything works out splendidly in,
for example, the bear Stearns transaction,

768
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,950
the government will be a beneficiary of
the success since it's surely will be a

769
01:03:10,951 --> 01:03:15,930
beneficiary, surely will bear
the burden if everything else,

770
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:19,410
um, is, uh, is lost.

771
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:24,990
Fourth, uh, the dominant pro,

772
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:30,020
the single most important area for
thought in thinking about the future of

773
01:03:31,861 --> 01:03:35,730
financial regulation is the
problem of pro cyclicality.

774
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,960
Prudent behavior by individual
institutions involves
shrinkage of balance sheets

775
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:46,680
in bad times.

776
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:52,700
Everyone's effort to shrink bound
seats in a bad times has catastrophic,

777
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:59,940
has potentially catastrophic
consequences for the system.

778
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:05,490
How to regulate to avoid pro
cyclicality is a fourth, uh,

779
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:09,660
crucial,
imperative and fifth,

780
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:14,850
these issues should be addressed slowly,

781
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,280
carefully,
and uh,

782
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:19,860
deliberatively as I suggested,

783
01:04:19,861 --> 01:04:24,861
the problems of getting us
out of a situation of this
kind are in many ways the

784
01:04:25,621 --> 01:04:30,621
opposite of the problems of
preventing future financial crises.

785
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:33,750
It will be tempting,

786
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:39,140
but would be unfortunate to address the
concerns through a what ever officials

787
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,710
do when they're not sure what to do,

788
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:49,130
which is reorganize our central
is our central challenges involve,

789
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:56,190
uh,
the questions of how we define capital,

790
01:04:56,191 --> 01:04:59,640
how we regulate capitol for
whom we regulate capital,

791
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:01,800
how we avoid pro cyclicality.

792
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:05,250
Until we know the answers
to those questions,

793
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:09,960
it will be difficult to
think intelligently about
what the right bureaucratic

794
01:05:09,961 --> 01:05:14,040
structure of regulation, uh, is.

795
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:19,670
All of this is to suggest to the students,
uh,

796
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:24,990
here that the macro economics of the 21st,

797
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:30,600
early 21st century will be no less
important than the macro economics of the

798
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,790
latter part of the 20th century.

799
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:42,600
That that macro economics has a good
chance of being much more centrally

800
01:05:43,391 --> 01:05:48,391
involved with financial issues than
the macro economics of the late 20th

801
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:50,734
century.

802
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:55,980
Or perhaps fairness requires me to say
the macroeconomics practiced outside of

803
01:05:57,161 --> 01:06:00,890
new haven in, uh, the, uh,

804
01:06:00,970 --> 01:06:05,920
late 20th century and the many,

805
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:09,820
many in precisions,
uh,

806
01:06:09,821 --> 01:06:14,290
and speculations in, uh, these, uh,

807
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:17,470
remarks,
I apologize for,

808
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:22,800
but offer as a modest and inadequate
defense that they point up that there's a

809
01:06:24,671 --> 01:06:29,671
great deal of very valuable research
to be done that will contribute to our

810
01:06:30,491 --> 01:06:31,990
understanding of economies.

811
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:37,620
And also I believe to art Ocwens vision
of harnessing that understanding to help

812
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:45,400
make better and more secure lives for
our fellow citizens. Thank you very much.

813
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:50,540
[inaudible]

814
01:06:56,530 --> 01:06:58,990
I went over my time,
but I've got some time for questions.

815
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:01,953
Jeff.

816
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:10,330
Recommendations
answer to a

817
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:16,250
problem this year will die on the vine.

818
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:29,110
Die. Get traction on the
vine. I guess. Um, the,

819
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:35,010
you know, there's certain, I'm going
to not associate myself with, uh,

820
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:39,280
all the words you used in
describing the secretaries, um,

821
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:44,800
secretary his proposals
so I can understand why I
can't understand why you use

822
01:07:44,961 --> 01:07:47,590
them. Oh, I think that, um,

823
01:07:48,220 --> 01:07:53,220
it is almost always a good
idea to bet on inertia,

824
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:59,530
um,
in anything political.

825
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:02,490
I suspect that,
uh,

826
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:05,440
in the remainder of this election year,

827
01:08:05,830 --> 01:08:10,830
it is very unlikely that anything will
get done that doesn't appear necessary to

828
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:16,490
respond to current difficulty. And, uh,

829
01:08:17,180 --> 01:08:21,140
usually when there's a new
administration or a new secretary,

830
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:24,020
um,
the problem is,

831
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:28,880
is not excessive fealty to the
visions of the previous secretary.

832
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:33,850
The problem is a desperate effort at
artificial product differentiation. Uh,

833
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:38,360
there were a number of issues I found
when I was at the treasury where there was

834
01:08:38,361 --> 01:08:41,330
a certain way to do it.
That was kind of a good idea.

835
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,510
And actually our predecessors
had more or less figured it out.

836
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:48,050
And it was my experience
that we never decided to say,

837
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:52,430
let's really work to get secretary
Brady's good idea in place.

838
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:56,270
We always found a few points of minor
difference and found a variety of ways of

839
01:08:56,271 --> 01:08:57,104
relabeling it.

840
01:08:57,380 --> 01:09:02,020
And that was when we thought the ideas
were good and he had it right. Um,

841
01:09:02,180 --> 01:09:05,240
in the cases where we didn't,
it was much more dramatic.

842
01:09:05,241 --> 01:09:09,500
So I would be surprised if,

843
01:09:09,820 --> 01:09:10,653
um,

844
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:16,000
the ideas contained in that report
proved to be a dominant starting point,

845
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:22,010
uh,
for a discussion to be,

846
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,010
to be sure to be sure to be sure.
I didn't want to say one thing.

847
01:09:25,011 --> 01:09:30,011
There is one thing that that report was
getting at and there is one aspect of

848
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:38,140
our system that I think we need to think
very carefully about and it goes deep

849
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:44,530
and that is do we believe in competitive
regulation of financial institutions?

850
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:51,370
We have a banking system and it has
for a long time been a fairly sacred

851
01:09:52,341 --> 01:09:55,850
principle that we have a so
called dual banking system.

852
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:57,950
And the idea is, well, you know,

853
01:09:57,951 --> 01:10:01,490
you get to choose your regulator and
therefore no regulator can be too stupid

854
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,410
because if they're unreasonable or stupid,

855
01:10:03,411 --> 01:10:05,690
then people will choose a
different regulator. Well,

856
01:10:05,691 --> 01:10:06,950
that's one way of thinking about it.

857
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:11,660
Another is that if regulators like to
have more jurisdiction and they like to do

858
01:10:11,661 --> 01:10:16,310
more stuff, uh, competitive regulation
is the prescription for limited,

859
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:21,500
uh, regulation and implicit in, uh,

860
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:25,310
Secretary Paulson's, uh, sort of, um,

861
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:28,660
in the language one might expect,
uh,

862
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,000
from a republican emphasis on efficiency
and the avoidance of duplication,

863
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,770
um, was, uh,

864
01:10:36,771 --> 01:10:40,670
moving away from a competitive regulation.

865
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:44,060
And I suspect that may be
quite an important idea.

866
01:10:46,420 --> 01:10:47,253
10

867
01:11:20,590 --> 01:11:25,100
you
repeat?

868
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:35,510
So it's a question, uh, said, uh,

869
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,650
oh, come on, don't Tuck the
question. I'm going to rephrase it.

870
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:42,110
I'm going to rephrase the question. The
question was okay. All right. That's good,

871
01:11:42,111 --> 01:11:44,900
but don't duck all the
interesting questions. Uh,

872
01:11:44,901 --> 01:11:47,420
there's a lot of experience in
a lot of places in particular,

873
01:11:47,421 --> 01:11:50,390
England has a single financial regulator.
If you had to guess right now,

874
01:11:50,391 --> 01:11:53,680
what's the best way to do it? Um,
it's not a fair rephrase this.

875
01:11:55,040 --> 01:11:57,040
Is that a fair rephrasing the question?
Uh,

876
01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:01,790
10 I think that,

877
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:02,753
uh,

878
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:05,343
the

879
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:12,020
three things I would emphasize
are competitive regulation
is probably a mistake.

880
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:18,870
If you believe in a regulation

881
01:12:20,270 --> 01:12:21,230
that

882
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:26,440
the central bank does need to have a
role in financial regulation of major

883
01:12:31,101 --> 01:12:32,480
institutions.

884
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:37,840
Because if it doesn't have a role in the
regulation of financial institutions,

885
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:46,300
it's not going to know things that it
does that it should know and it's going to

886
01:12:46,881 --> 01:12:48,800
end up living with the consequences.

887
01:12:48,801 --> 01:12:53,720
And so the central bank
should be crucially involved
in the regulation of major

888
01:12:53,721 --> 01:12:57,860
financial institutions.
And that it's a,

889
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:03,280
if you believe in regulations that
are pursuing objectives that are not

890
01:13:06,711 --> 01:13:09,380
immediately in the interest
of financial institutions,

891
01:13:09,980 --> 01:13:11,840
if you believe in those regulations,

892
01:13:11,841 --> 01:13:16,730
consumer regulations as a
community regulations and the like,

893
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:20,570
if you believe in those regulations and
you want them carried out with vigor,

894
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:26,110
you need to give them to their own
regulator who is not responsible for the

895
01:13:27,171 --> 01:13:30,620
health of the institutions
in the way that, uh,

896
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:35,180
the Federal Reserve is.
So separation of consumer regulation,

897
01:13:35,570 --> 01:13:40,570
elimination of competitive regulation
and regulation of major financial

898
01:13:41,151 --> 01:13:43,700
institutions by an entity,

899
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:47,000
by a single entity in which,
uh,

900
01:13:47,001 --> 01:13:51,030
the central bank has a role would
be the three principles, uh,

901
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:53,120
that I would suggest.
John,

902
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,213
you

903
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:06,590
all enjoyed your talk very much louder.

904
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:12,460
Calming. He enjoyed the talk that that
tends to that. That's the kind of thing,

905
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:17,030
that's the kind of thing you say before
the devastating question. And uh,

906
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:22,170
I knew John when we were in graduate
school together and nothing in my four

907
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:26,140
years of going to graduate school with
him makes it less likely that after he

908
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:30,100
said he really enjoyed the talk, that the
devastating question was going to come.

909
01:14:30,101 --> 01:14:31,180
So I embraced,

910
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:05,100
well,
I thought at least I got the comment,

911
01:15:05,101 --> 01:15:07,950
which was that he really liked the talk.
I would, that didn't even count at all.

912
01:15:07,951 --> 01:15:09,800
Okay. Go right ahead. Don't

913
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:13,430
seem to have followed through
to the end of the story,

914
01:15:13,431 --> 01:15:17,700
which is that you think that the marriage
is not being set by supply and demand

915
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:21,590
properly, too much in good
times and not another bad times.

916
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,990
When I thought he was
from the question periods,

917
01:15:24,991 --> 01:15:29,991
I'm giving you a chance to say then you
would think that regulators to change

918
01:15:30,071 --> 01:15:32,360
the leverage. So, for example,

919
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:36,740
in good times they could prevent people
from the leverage so much and in bad

920
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:39,200
times it's a little more difficult
to see what you could do.

921
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:41,720
Particularly what I
want you to talk about,

922
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:46,900
how can a fad intervene in a
way to increase the leverage?

923
01:15:47,180 --> 01:15:51,770
For example,
should it directly against collateral,

924
01:15:51,771 --> 01:15:54,470
but the lend more money
against collateral,

925
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:56,960
then the market is willing to do not lend.

926
01:15:56,961 --> 01:16:00,900
The lower interest rates were just
saying on your mortgage derivative,

927
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,600
which the market lonely men,

928
01:16:02,601 --> 01:16:06,880
$50 on the Fed will take
that as collateral and lend
at the same interest rate

929
01:16:06,881 --> 01:16:08,810
the market will,
but mine is $60

930
01:16:12,010 --> 01:16:14,490
the second,

931
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:20,000
the second question is
about the housing crisis.

932
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,110
In this 50% of houses,
you know,

933
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:25,640
people may be from subprime borrowers as
two and a half million of them might be

934
01:16:25,641 --> 01:16:29,330
tossed out of their houses. And you
said at the same time that you know,

935
01:16:29,331 --> 01:16:32,030
you think intervention sometimes

936
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:35,910
make it worse, but I mean, do you really,

937
01:16:35,911 --> 01:16:39,950
this hundred 80 billion you spoke of is
not going to make much of a dent in two

938
01:16:39,951 --> 01:16:43,430
and a half million families
being tossed out of their houses.

939
01:16:43,431 --> 01:16:47,480
So do you think there should be some more,
a bigger intervention?

940
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:52,100
And one that I would suggest is the people
doing the editing or the ones who are

941
01:16:52,101 --> 01:16:54,710
going to lose all the money when
these were thrown out of their houses.

942
01:16:54,711 --> 01:16:58,040
They're the ones with the biggest
interest to see something done.

943
01:16:58,430 --> 01:17:03,320
They're paralyzed because the bond holders
are split up so completely that they

944
01:17:03,321 --> 01:17:07,830
can't coordinate there. Uh, you know,
modifying the terms of the loan.

945
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:09,200
No single banker,

946
01:17:09,410 --> 01:17:12,890
you would let two and a half million
families be thrown out on the streets and

947
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:15,440
have their houses sold
for 50% of the loans.

948
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:20,770
So can you think of a way of
coordinating these people,

949
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:24,830
these lenders who aren't coordinated so
that they themselves without the mark

950
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,860
look, government having to put up
any money can help solve the problem

951
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:34,960
characteristically characteristically?
Good,

952
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:39,310
good questions on the first,
on the first question,

953
01:17:39,311 --> 01:17:43,540
which was about procyclical uh,
leverage.

954
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,990
I'm not,
as I tried to explain,

955
01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:52,290
I'm not sure the focus on leverage is
right rather than the focus being on

956
01:17:53,351 --> 01:17:56,680
lending and those are very,
those are quite different things.

957
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,640
I actually think that
the world is more risky.

958
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:06,010
The uncertainty surrounding what's going
to happen to loans is greater than it

959
01:18:06,011 --> 01:18:11,011
was a year and a half a year then
certainly then people perceived it to be a

960
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:12,910
year and a half ago.

961
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:17,910
So I'm not sure institutions should have
much higher leverage today than they

962
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:21,430
did a year and a half ago.

963
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:24,640
That's why I put emphasis on
what I think is the right thing.

964
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:28,510
I'm not sure they should
have more leverage,

965
01:18:28,511 --> 01:18:32,110
they should have more lending and there's
a way of getting them more lending

966
01:18:32,290 --> 01:18:35,830
without having more leverage,
which is raising more capital.

967
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:38,860
And that's why I emphasize the,
uh,

968
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:43,540
that's why I emphasize the importance of,
uh,

969
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:48,100
pressuring institutions
to raise more capital.

970
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:53,230
And that's why without having any
terribly compelling way to con,

971
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:56,320
to concretize it,

972
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,690
I think in our thinking about regulation,

973
01:18:58,691 --> 01:19:03,691
we need to get away and get a bit away
from the capital ratio as the central

974
01:19:03,851 --> 01:19:08,650
variable. Since we, what
we want is capital raising,

975
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:12,280
uh,
now not balance sheet,

976
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:14,320
not balanced sheet shrinking.

977
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:19,770
And an emphasis on the capital
ratio treats those two as
equivalent when they're

978
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:24,730
not, uh, when they're not.
In fact, uh, equivalent.

979
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,730
You know,
the one suggestion that has been made,

980
01:19:27,731 --> 01:19:32,731
and I have no idea whether it
actually works out in a viable way,

981
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:38,480
is to force institutions to issue a,

982
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:43,650
some kind of security that is a reverse
convertible that that becomes the

983
01:19:47,471 --> 01:19:52,000
converts from debt to equity, uh, in,

984
01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:53,770
uh,
difficult times.

985
01:19:53,770 --> 01:19:57,760
It's hard to see why that security
is going to feel a lot like debt, um,

986
01:19:57,940 --> 01:20:02,230
when you buy it, uh, in, uh, the, uh,

987
01:20:02,231 --> 01:20:05,410
in the good time. So, I'm not
sure whether that works out,

988
01:20:05,620 --> 01:20:10,500
but that's the type of thing that one has
to think about. But I would resist, uh,

989
01:20:10,710 --> 01:20:12,360
the,
I would,

990
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:17,390
I would resist the idea
of framing the question,

991
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:22,680
uh, through, uh, the
leverage ratio should,

992
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:26,130
uh, should the government, um,

993
01:20:26,340 --> 01:20:31,340
try in good times to require,

994
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:33,630
uh,

995
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:38,660
levels of capital or limits on leverage
that go beyond what appears to be

996
01:20:41,790 --> 01:20:46,790
potential for individual institutions
in the name of protection of the system.

997
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:51,023
Uh,

998
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:56,090
I'm probably one big financial mass
away from being in favor of that,

999
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:01,140
uh, and not quite, uh, and not quite,

1000
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:07,160
not quite there because I think you
gotta be very careful about the adverse

1001
01:21:07,591 --> 01:21:09,690
effects if you don't do it very carefully.

1002
01:21:10,050 --> 01:21:13,950
Once you're talking about a punitive
capital requirement that's not related to

1003
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:19,050
your institution's prudential needs,
the incentive to avoid it is very strong.

1004
01:21:19,410 --> 01:21:22,140
And so if you don't do
it for every institution,

1005
01:21:22,530 --> 01:21:25,290
the action's gonna Migrate Away.

1006
01:21:25,410 --> 01:21:28,200
And if you do do it for every institution,

1007
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:32,310
you're getting to a pretty
dear [inaudible], um,

1008
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,850
place in which the government is
regulating in a lot of places where it's

1009
01:21:35,851 --> 01:21:39,900
probably not going to
be so good. Um, at, uh,

1010
01:21:40,290 --> 01:21:45,240
at regulating. Your other question
was about the foreclosure and, uh,

1011
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:47,640
the mortgage a problem.

1012
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:52,830
I think one of the easiest
judgments to make in the sense that,

1013
01:21:52,831 --> 01:21:53,520
uh,

1014
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:58,520
there's a measure available that has a
reasonable chance of doing good and has,

1015
01:21:59,851 --> 01:22:03,870
I think roughly no chance
of doing bad is uh,

1016
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:09,080
the legislation that's been introduced
by Senator Castle and others,

1017
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:10,920
uh,

1018
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:15,920
to remove legal liability
from servicers for,

1019
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:21,960
uh, any decisions they make to
renegotiate the total value,

1020
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:24,030
uh,
of these mortgages.

1021
01:22:24,390 --> 01:22:28,220
I think there's considerable doubt
as to how much activity that,

1022
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,510
how much positive activity
that would generate,

1023
01:22:30,990 --> 01:22:35,990
but there's no downside and
potentially some upside.

1024
01:22:36,510 --> 01:22:41,510
There's also another interesting
problem in this area,

1025
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:46,650
which is many subprime mortgages,
probably more than a third,

1026
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:50,400
have second liens,
um,

1027
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:55,640
against them that are serviced by somebody
other than the original originator.

1028
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:02,120
Anybody's good plan for working these
things through where you reduced the value

1029
01:23:02,161 --> 01:23:06,670
of the house, um, is in effect
in wipe out that second mortgage,

1030
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:09,970
but it is going to require the
consent of that second mortgage.

1031
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:15,420
And that second mortgage doesn't have any
very strong incentive to give consent.

1032
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:21,750
And there's a long and dubiously honorable
financial tradition of being paid to

1033
01:23:24,101 --> 01:23:24,934
be a holdout.

1034
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:30,600
And how one handles that is a
potentially serious problem,

1035
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:36,420
not least because if it's financially
and economically advantageous to do so,

1036
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:41,820
people who are good at being holdouts are
likely to acquire a substantial number

1037
01:23:42,101 --> 01:23:43,600
of these second mortgages.

1038
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:48,010
And so the holdout rights will
be exercised more skillfully, uh,

1039
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:53,100
then the than they would be
by their current holders.

1040
01:23:53,930 --> 01:23:58,930
I guess my reaction is to request is
can the capital markets handle it?

1041
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:03,980
Yes.
At a price.

1042
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:09,290
And the price will be that
they facto in this environment,

1043
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:12,620
the demand curve for
equity slopes downwards.

1044
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:17,920
And so if a lot of equity needs to be
raised to the price will be lower than if

1045
01:24:18,921 --> 01:24:23,060
a small amount of equity, uh, needs,

1046
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:26,570
uh, needs to be, needs to be raised.

1047
01:24:26,571 --> 01:24:31,571
And so share owners of these institutions
are not wrong to be hoping to reduce

1048
01:24:35,421 --> 01:24:38,670
the amount of capital they have to,
uh,

1049
01:24:38,780 --> 01:24:42,830
raise that is rational behavior on,
uh,

1050
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:46,460
that is rational behavior on their part.
Um,

1051
01:24:46,670 --> 01:24:51,670
but it may not be desirable from
the point of view of the system.

1052
01:24:59,450 --> 01:25:01,190
Oh,
I don't think we have a,

1053
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:06,410
I think with the trillions of dollars
sitting in sovereign wealth funds with the

1054
01:25:06,411 --> 01:25:11,411
very large volume of assets that are
held by pension funds and endowments and

1055
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:15,140
Life Insurance Companies,
I don't,

1056
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:20,200
I don't think one needs to fear that
if a $200 billion more in capital was

1057
01:25:21,741 --> 01:25:25,250
infused into us financial institutions,

1058
01:25:25,550 --> 01:25:29,390
that somehow there'd be a generalized,
you know,

1059
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:32,210
relative prices would
adjust in various ways.

1060
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:35,980
But I think the least of
the concerns is that, uh,

1061
01:25:36,110 --> 01:25:40,280
somehow we'd have a general
general shortage of capital of,

1062
01:25:40,281 --> 01:25:45,260
for, for other purposes. I
think there is a, you know,

1063
01:25:45,261 --> 01:25:46,540
there, there is a, uh,

1064
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:53,100
this is a tricky subject in the sense
that everybody's got the same idea,

1065
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:58,290
which is that they want to be
the last dollar of equity in and,

1066
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:02,680
uh, because you don't want, you want to
be in after the dilutions rather than in,

1067
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:06,020
uh, before, uh, the dilutions.

1068
01:26:06,021 --> 01:26:11,021
And so there's the concern that when you
speak of large needs for capital that,

1069
01:26:11,891 --> 01:26:16,240
uh, they're, the incentive
to be a partial solution, um,

1070
01:26:17,030 --> 01:26:19,670
may not be that great.
On the other hand,

1071
01:26:19,671 --> 01:26:24,500
the strategy of sort of deception, we
only need a little and then we'll be done.

1072
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:25,550
We only need a little,

1073
01:26:25,551 --> 01:26:29,870
and then we'll be done also is probably
not a strategy that can be carried on

1074
01:26:29,871 --> 01:26:32,990
very successfully for
a long period of time.

1075
01:26:32,991 --> 01:26:37,820
And that's why somewhat more
comprehensive, somewhat larger approaches,

1076
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:42,350
uh, to capital raising, uh, would,
it seems to me be desirable,

1077
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:47,673
Gus.

1078
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:04,380
Oh, uh, I suspect, uh,

1079
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:09,960
there should be a contingency plan
that is in place to give more rebates,

1080
01:27:12,610 --> 01:27:17,460
um, during the tax filing
season, uh, next, uh,

1081
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:22,330
next spring that, uh, somebody
can decide to pull the trigger on.

1082
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:27,370
We're not to pull the trigger on a late
next fall as we see where the economy is

1083
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:34,020
and there should be some supplementation
of unemployment insurance and food

1084
01:27:35,771 --> 01:27:39,310
stamps and there should be,
uh,

1085
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:45,070
they should almost
certainly be some effort to,

1086
01:27:45,071 --> 01:27:48,970
uh, reduce the pro cyclicality
of the state and local sector,

1087
01:27:49,420 --> 01:27:50,440
um,
which,

1088
01:27:50,441 --> 01:27:55,441
because of balanced budgets and less a
tax collections spending of all kinds as

1089
01:27:55,481 --> 01:27:57,640
being a cut back.

1090
01:27:57,820 --> 01:28:02,820
I say almost certainly because
there is a bit of a problem if the,

1091
01:28:03,971 --> 01:28:07,780
uh, history of fiscal federalism in the
United States is that whenever times are

1092
01:28:07,781 --> 01:28:09,520
good states,

1093
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:13,150
governors cut taxes and
whenever times are bad,

1094
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:17,080
the federal government provides support,
um,

1095
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:19,120
to respond to the emergency.

1096
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:22,390
That's not a terribly
healthy set of arrangements.

1097
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:27,400
And there was a lot of tax cutting going
on in the good times. But on balance,

1098
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:29,940
um, I think a, the right,

1099
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,430
there are a variety of
mechanisms including medicaid
reimbursement for doing it,

1100
01:28:33,700 --> 01:28:36,610
but doing something for state and local
governments would be the other piece I

1101
01:28:36,611 --> 01:28:37,444
would emphasize.

1102
01:28:38,050 --> 01:28:38,883
Yeah,

1103
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:48,973
yeah,

1104
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:53,790
yeah.

1105
01:28:53,790 --> 01:28:58,420
Oh, I think, um, most of

1106
01:29:00,380 --> 01:29:02,460
most of the positive feedback mechanisms

1107
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:07,460
that I talked about yesterday
were operative both going up and,

1108
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:08,970
uh,

1109
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:13,950
going down in the housing
and mortgage security, uh,

1110
01:29:13,951 --> 01:29:18,780
market. Uh, it's not that you can't
understand why people made these loans.

1111
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:24,170
The truth is that in the period
from the late 1990s through 2006,

1112
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:30,960
no matter how crummy the person,
no matter how many coke crummy,

1113
01:29:30,961 --> 01:29:33,720
the credit of the person
you lent money to,

1114
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,330
you did not get defaulted on.

1115
01:29:37,650 --> 01:29:41,370
And the reason was that
if he bought a house,

1116
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:46,290
the house went up in value and he was
able to borrow more, uh, to pay you back.

1117
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:51,350
And so the lesson that was learned
was that lending money to people,

1118
01:29:52,591 --> 01:29:56,010
even people who didn't look like they'd
be very credits, very good credits,

1119
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:59,760
was a safe thing to do.
Now it's post,

1120
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:04,680
we can see what the error
and the inference was that
it presumed the continued

1121
01:30:04,681 --> 01:30:09,510
strong behavior of house prices,
but that wasn't completely obvious.

1122
01:30:09,810 --> 01:30:11,880
Um, uh, that was,

1123
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:15,540
I was less completely obvious at the time.

1124
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:18,710
And then you had various other things
people may be investments in day six.

1125
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:22,290
You know, if you were in
the mortgage business, um,

1126
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:24,840
you bought mortgages,
you succeeded,

1127
01:30:24,841 --> 01:30:27,960
your mortgages went up in value
as risk premiums went down,

1128
01:30:28,230 --> 01:30:29,610
then you had more capital,

1129
01:30:29,850 --> 01:30:34,140
you got paid on the basis of how
much you invested with more capital,

1130
01:30:34,141 --> 01:30:36,070
you decided to invest,
uh,

1131
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:40,800
more so you'd all the kind of positive
feedback mechanisms I described on the

1132
01:30:40,801 --> 01:30:45,270
upside. And then you more or less
had all those mechanisms on, uh,

1133
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:46,200
the downside.

1134
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:22,660
No, those have an anti,
those have a very strong,

1135
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:27,610
the um, if you like
Chicago school bent, uh,

1136
01:31:27,910 --> 01:31:30,530
make the, make the point. Uh,

1137
01:31:30,910 --> 01:31:34,600
so let's see who did well in
this situation. Let's see,
let's see who did badly.

1138
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:36,640
Let's see. You did reasonably well
in this situation. Hedge funds,

1139
01:31:36,641 --> 01:31:39,560
nobody much regulates them.
They seem to have done, uh,

1140
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:44,300
they seem to have done okay.
Um, individuals, you know,

1141
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:47,320
some of them they got to know,
some of them got in trouble,

1142
01:31:47,321 --> 01:31:50,110
but some of them got loans on
terms that weren't very attractive,

1143
01:31:50,111 --> 01:31:54,730
that wasn't so bad, who
really made a huge mess. Well,

1144
01:31:54,731 --> 01:31:59,731
the big money center banks made a huge
mess who's most extensively while the big

1145
01:32:00,221 --> 01:32:03,790
money center banks or most
extensively regulated. So I get it.

1146
01:32:03,791 --> 01:32:08,791
We need more regulation is sort of the
Chicago is this sort of Chicago argument

1147
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:13,190
and it's,
it should give one each.

1148
01:32:13,720 --> 01:32:15,490
I don't think it's the end of the subject.

1149
01:32:15,491 --> 01:32:19,090
I think it probably doesn't point in the
right direction at the end of the day,

1150
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:22,930
but it's not a point a to be taken.

1151
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:27,280
It's not a point to be, uh, taken lightly.

1152
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:31,630
And, uh, since I liked the
spirit of your observation,

1153
01:32:31,631 --> 01:32:35,140
here's another observation
in the spirit of yours. Um,

1154
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:40,260
so all these banks lost a lot of
money who made money or a ton of them.

1155
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:45,800
A ton of the gain that is opposite the
bank's laws is a bunch of relatively poor

1156
01:32:48,251 --> 01:32:53,251
people who sold their houses
for substantially more
than they otherwise would

1157
01:32:55,121 --> 01:32:59,350
have. Uh, because of the bad credit, uh,

1158
01:32:59,351 --> 01:33:02,290
that the financial sector was prepared,
uh,

1159
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:05,770
to was prepared to give. I think. Yeah.

1160
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:09,290
I think the thing you have to say is,
uh,

1161
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:14,730
that there are a fair number of
people who are having to explain to,

1162
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:17,980
uh,
their children,

1163
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:23,230
why a policeman is knocking at the door
and telling them they have to leave

1164
01:33:23,500 --> 01:33:28,500
within six hours because they signed
documents that they didn't understand and

1165
01:33:30,490 --> 01:33:32,260
that weren't explained to them,

1166
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:37,740
that lock them into an arrangement
that was for them going to be highly

1167
01:33:38,081 --> 01:33:39,040
problematic.

1168
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:43,120
And you can call it predatory borrowing
and you can explain how they lived in a

1169
01:33:43,121 --> 01:33:47,080
house in a sense, rent free for
a significant period of time.

1170
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:51,430
But I think it would be
a mistake to a discount.

1171
01:33:51,730 --> 01:33:56,440
Uh, the trauma, uh, that, uh, has been,

1172
01:33:56,500 --> 01:33:58,540
that has been imposed,

1173
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:03,810
but there is a sense in which a more
regulated entities have performed worse

1174
01:34:04,511 --> 01:34:08,950
than suffered more than less
regulated entities. Last question.

1175
01:34:19,180 --> 01:34:20,013
Let's

1176
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:28,713
see.

1177
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:04,750
Good day for

1178
01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:09,110
you now.
Seconds

1179
01:35:11,090 --> 01:35:14,370
also paid to know about that.

1180
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:21,480
Are you driving through
you guys or private

1181
01:35:29,250 --> 01:35:30,083
look,
I think

1182
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:36,480
there are structural similarities
between our problem and Japan's problem.

1183
01:35:37,091 --> 01:35:39,580
I think there are a variety of
reasons to think that the bubble was

1184
01:35:39,581 --> 01:35:42,370
substantially greater in Japan.

1185
01:35:42,730 --> 01:35:47,320
And I think if one compares US policy
in the last nine months with Japanese

1186
01:35:47,321 --> 01:35:50,760
policy between 1989 and 1992,
uh,

1187
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:55,990
we are acting with substantial
more substantially more
aggressiveness to get in

1188
01:35:55,991 --> 01:35:59,200
front of, uh, the problem.

1189
01:35:59,530 --> 01:36:02,170
And you as regulators,
uh,

1190
01:36:02,350 --> 01:36:07,350
fortunately from my perspective have
been very resistant to what was a major

1191
01:36:07,511 --> 01:36:08,740
Japanese idea,

1192
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:13,210
which was a mark assets in ways that will,

1193
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:17,980
that, that it is thought will contribute
to confidence rather than in ways that

1194
01:36:18,010 --> 01:36:21,370
reflect market realities.
And I think that, uh,

1195
01:36:21,940 --> 01:36:26,740
the rather arbitrary accounting that
was pursued as a major tool of policy in

1196
01:36:26,741 --> 01:36:28,120
Japan,
uh,

1197
01:36:28,300 --> 01:36:32,200
inhibited a great deal
of necessary adjustment.

1198
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:36,340
That said a while,
I think the probability is low.

1199
01:36:36,580 --> 01:36:39,130
One can't rule out,
uh,

1200
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:43,750
the kind of situation that
developed, uh, in, uh,

1201
01:36:44,110 --> 01:36:46,420
Japan.
I think we do.

1202
01:36:46,421 --> 01:36:51,010
I think there's these issues of levels
of capital in troubled financial

1203
01:36:51,011 --> 01:36:54,370
institutions are,
um,

1204
01:36:54,790 --> 01:36:57,880
is a very important, uh, issue. You know,

1205
01:36:57,881 --> 01:37:02,881
one way of responding to an
externality is with a subsidy.

1206
01:37:03,700 --> 01:37:08,700
The idea of subsidizing institutions to
raise capitol seems quite untenable in

1207
01:37:10,451 --> 01:37:14,410
the context of the institution.
Shareholders holding onto their,

1208
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:17,920
holding on onto their shares.
And so in a way,

1209
01:37:18,190 --> 01:37:22,060
we operate a system where the
government can't infuse capital into an

1210
01:37:22,061 --> 01:37:25,630
institution until the
situation is very far gone.

1211
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:30,580
But once the situation is very far gone,
it is very far gone.

1212
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:31,863
Uh,

1213
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:36,730
I don't think it's inconceivable that the
government will have to infuse capital

1214
01:37:36,731 --> 01:37:41,731
into institutions on a significant
scale in the course of this crisis.

1215
01:37:43,210 --> 01:37:48,210
But I don't think we're ready yet to
start planning for a Nordic style or

1216
01:37:50,771 --> 01:37:55,771
Mexican style or Japanese
style socialization of,

1217
01:37:56,220 --> 01:38:00,540
uh, the finance of, uh,
the financial system.

1218
01:38:00,870 --> 01:38:04,650
Though I wouldn't,
I think the probability is very low.

1219
01:38:04,860 --> 01:38:08,880
I wouldn't preclude that,
uh, as a possibility.

1220
01:38:08,881 --> 01:38:12,150
And I think in retrospect, uh, it, uh,

1221
01:38:12,660 --> 01:38:17,660
came significantly later in Japan and
would in retrospective in have been ideal.

1222
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:19,920
Thank you very much.
