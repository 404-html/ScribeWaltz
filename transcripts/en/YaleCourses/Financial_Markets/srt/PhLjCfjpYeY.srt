1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,060
So I wanted to talk today about insurance,
uh,

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,190
which is another risk management device
that's traditionally separate from a

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,750
securities which we
talked about last time,

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,790
but the underlying principles
are the same. Um, before I begin,

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:22,020
I wanted to just give some
more thoughts about, uh,

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,790
the, uh, the diversification through
securities and that will lead us into,

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,200
uh, insurance. Uh,

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,540
so let me just review a
preceding lecture briefly,

9
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,070
but that purpose,
what we did,

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,120
the core theoretical framework
that we had was the mean variance,

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,020
uh, theory, the, which led us to
the capital asset pricing model.

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,310
But the basic thing was that we had to,
in order to use the framework,

13
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,140
we had to start by

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,910
producing estimates of the
expected returns on each
asset we call those are and

15
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:09,351
the standard deviation of the return on
each asset and the covariance between

16
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:13,800
the returns of each pair of assets.
And then once we did that,

17
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:17,790
we could plug that into the formula
that I gave you last time and get the

18
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:22,470
standard deviation of the portfolio and
the expected return on the portfolio.

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,650
And from then on, if you accept the
analysis and the assumptions that, uh,

20
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,400
are the estimates that underlie it,

21
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,770
we pretty much know how to
construct portfolios. Uh,

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,240
but the underlying estimates,
uh,

23
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,270
may not accord with your belief or
your intuitive sense of common sense.

24
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,400
And so the other thing that I mentioned
last time was that there seems to be a

25
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:52,401
really big difference between the expected
return on the stock market and the

26
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:57,780
expected return on a short term debt.
Uh,

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,550
we found an equity premium,

28
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,620
or actually Jeremy Siegel's book
gave an equity premium of 4% a year.

29
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,470
Uh,
and some people find that hard to believe.

30
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,750
How can it be that one asset does
4% a year better than another?

31
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,910
Some people say, well, if that's the case,

32
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,060
I want to invest in nothing
more than that one asset.

33
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:21,600
Why should I take something
that, uh, is under performing?

34
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,000
Jeremy Siegel goes on further to say that,
uh,

35
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,000
since the mid 19th century,

36
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,270
we've never had a 30 year period
when stocks underperformed bonds.

37
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,040
So as docs are, uh, really, uh,

38
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,590
if anyone who has a investment
horizon of 30 years, you'd think,

39
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,240
why should I ever hold bonds?
Uh,

40
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:48,350
so the numbers that Jeremy Siegel
produces seem implausibly high for,

41
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,570
uh, for the stock market. So, ah,

42
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:56,880
what we call this is the, uh, want
to emphasize that I wrote this again,

43
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,890
I like this again,
the equity

44
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,490
premium puzzle,

45
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,710
that term was actually
coined by economists,

46
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,830
Prescott and Mayra,

47
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,750
but it's now in general use that it just
seems that stocks so much outperform

48
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:27,160
other other investments. So for Jeremy
Siegel and the latest edition of his book,

49
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:31,330
the equity premium is 4% a year,
uh,

50
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,340
since 1802. That's almost, no,

51
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,530
that's more than as 106 years. Uh, so, uh,

52
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,360
why would that be?
And how can you believe that?

53
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,420
So one question that
comes up is that maybe

54
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,320
this is for the u s data.
And so some people say, well,

55
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:54,370
maybe,
you know,

56
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:59,490
why are we looking at the u s because
the u s is an arguably very successful

57
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:04,590
country. Uh, and so, uh,
we have potentially a,

58
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,400
a bias in our, uh, scholar selection bias.

59
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:15,090
If you heck as the country you study one
of the most successful countries in the

60
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:21,910
world, uh, that doesn't
inform you. Can you see now,

61
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,700
uh, that doesn't inform you very well
about what it is for a random country.

62
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,100
And, or for the u s going forward.
Uh, there's something wrong. Uh,

63
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,260
the U S has been successful in financial
markets and it's being imitated by lots

64
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,900
of countries.
Uh,

65
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,630
financial markets similar to ours
are being set up in many places.

66
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,770
But you wonder, you know, maybe they're
over imitating. Maybe, you know,

67
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:52,630
maybe we were just lucky or maybe it
was because the u s was, was the, uh,

68
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,230
the, uh, the first, uh,

69
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,400
in some ways to develop some of these
financial institutions are one of the

70
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:03,910
first. And so, but now when the more
and more countries start doing it,

71
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:05,730
maybe it won't work so well.

72
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,940
The one way of investigating
this is to, uh, to, uh,

73
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:13,750
get around the selection bias is
to try to look at all countries.

74
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,880
Let's not just look at the United States.

75
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,460
Let's look at every country of the
world and let's see if they have, uh,

76
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,300
if they have a equity
premium. Okay. So, uh,

77
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,830
but there's a problem with that.

78
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:32,370
And the problem is that countries that
are less successful don't keep data,

79
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,570
that's a problem. Or are they, were they,

80
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,090
they sometimes they just shut down their
stock markets at some point. Uh, this is,

81
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:43,720
uh,
this is since 1802.

82
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,100
How many countries do you think have
uninterrupted stock market data? Since 18.

83
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:51,934
Oh,
two.

84
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:56,810
What do you think you name another
country that probably has it.

85
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,300
What's that Angela? Then
you got UK, you, uh,

86
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,400
uh, I said, uh, if you go
onto the continent though,

87
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,140
they tended to be interrupted by
World War One and World War II. Uh,

88
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,290
what about Japan? Do they have, do
you think they have uninterrupted,

89
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,610
they have a little bit of a
problem around World War Two and a,

90
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,910
or you can try to bridge
the gap, but, uh, but, uh,

91
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,510
anyway, uh, there are people
who've tried to sort this out. Uh,

92
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,450
and, um, there's one, it's
a book by Dimson Marsh,

93
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,010
uh, and Stanton that, uh,

94
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,140
called triumph of the optimists that
Jeremy Siegel quotes. He has a table in,

95
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:46,750
in,

96
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:51,750
in the new fourth edition of his
book and Dimension Dimson Marsh,

97
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,470
uh, and, uh, Stanton look at, uh,

98
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,640
the following countries.
Belgium, Italy, Germany, France,
Spain, Japan, Switzerland,

99
00:07:01,641 --> 00:07:06,110
Ireland, Denmark, Netherlands,
UK, Canada, U, s, South Africa,

100
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,520
Australia, and Sweden. Every one of
them has a positive equity premium,

101
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,420
although the u s is on the high side
of them, or it's not the, not the,

102
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,630
not the best, the country that
has the highest equity premium.

103
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,620
And that's for the whole 20th century.
They couldn't go back to the 1802,

104
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:27,280
uh, the most successful
country, you, Sweden, uh,

105
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,970
and after that Australia.

106
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,960
So us is not the most
successful stock market, uh,

107
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,360
though it's high and the
high on the list. So, uh,

108
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,810
um,
Jeremy Siegel concludes that there is a,

109
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,180
that the equity, he said, uh, that these,

110
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,830
that this book right Dimson Marsh
Stanton, uh, late puts to bed,

111
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:55,680
any concerns about selection bias.
Uh,

112
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,380
and he claims that so many countries have
shown an equity premium that we can be

113
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:05,590
confident. He, this book is really
very strong. And the conclusions,

114
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,970
the title of the book
stocks for the long run,

115
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:11,030
it's docs always outperform other
investments for the long run.

116
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:14,750
And he said it's not due to
selection bias, but you know,

117
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:18,770
I kind of wonder the list of countries
that I just read to you that let them

118
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:22,550
send marsh and Staunton's studied, exclude
some important countries, doesn't it?

119
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,970
What does it exclude? Well, it doesn't
have India, Russia and China in it.

120
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:33,470
For example, uh, and I know at
least, uh, Russia and China,

121
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,720
do you know anything about their history?

122
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:39,020
Do they ever need to stock market
disruptions in the last hundred years?

123
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:42,070
I think it's kind of obvious.
Uh,

124
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:47,030
they had a communist revolution
in both places. Right. And so, uh,

125
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:48,380
Russia and China

126
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,900
are not mentioned a buy
or not studied by Demson.

127
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,510
Washington's not. And why not?
Well, they can't get data.

128
00:08:57,511 --> 00:08:58,740
There wasn't this stock work.
Well,

129
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:03,741
there actually was the stock market in
Russia before 1918 and in China before

130
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:07,230
1949. So what, what happened to investors?

131
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:12,060
If you were a Chinese investor
in Chinese stocks in 1949,

132
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,900
what happened? We know
what happened. It went,

133
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,790
that's that famous minus 100% return,
right? Which dominates everything.

134
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,400
And so, uh, uh,

135
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,400
so I think what would Siegel say?
You know,

136
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:31,401
he's really saying that this equity
premium is enduring and we should believe

137
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:32,664
it.

138
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,390
Uh, but, uh, I dunno, I think

139
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,050
good. I think what Jeremy would
say is, well, you're looking,

140
00:09:41,051 --> 00:09:42,820
if you look at Russia and China,

141
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,170
you're looking at political factors and
I'm only looking at politically stable

142
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:51,070
countries. And so this whole
thing is irrelevant really.

143
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:54,340
We're not going to have a communist
revolution in any of these advanced

144
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,760
countries now.
And so Jeremy would say,

145
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,950
forget that.

146
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,080
It looks pretty sound that
we have an equity premium
until we can trust that, uh,

147
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:09,880
well he's a good friend of mine, but I
think he may be overstating a little bit.

148
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,790
We have, we'd have some disagreements. Um,

149
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:17,740
the thing that comes to my mind is that
I wanted to say before concluding this

150
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,220
review of the last lecture,
uh,

151
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:25,650
that is that the stock market is
inherently political in any country.

152
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,650
That politics have tremendous,

153
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,350
a tremendous effect on the
values in the stock market.

154
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,013
Uh,

155
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,870
and that's because of even if the
government doesn't nationalize the stock

156
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:47,590
market or confiscate assets,

157
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,010
they tax them. Right. And do you know,

158
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:54,850
we have in the U s we
have a corporate profits

159
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,723
text?

160
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,810
Well, it's not just in the
u s uh, essentially every,

161
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,990
I don't if there's any exception,
there may not be an exception,

162
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:13,560
but essentially every country
has a corporate profits tax.

163
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:15,570
And then we also have

164
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,890
personal
income tax.

165
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,813
Okay.

166
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,810
So the corporate profits tax goes after
the profits that corporations make the

167
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:35,820
personal, it's taken from corporations
before they pay out their dividends.

168
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:41,050
The personal income tax is
levied on individuals and, uh,

169
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,320
these individuals have to pay it.

170
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,040
But that the personal
income tax is not simple.

171
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,730
It's not just a flat rate on your income.
It depends on the type of income.

172
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,950
So dividend income or capital income.

173
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,290
And the stock market is taxed differently.

174
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,000
The interesting thing is,
is that through time,

175
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:05,920
as political winds change,
these taxes have changed.

176
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,020
Uh, and they've gone up through some very
high levels in the past in the United

177
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,220
States and other countries. I'm
going to give some, uh, US tax rate.

178
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,503
Um,

179
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,130
the personal tax on dividends,

180
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,610
of course, it depends also on
your tax bracket and your income.

181
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,760
I'm going to talk about the highest tax
bracket in the u s it went over 90% in

182
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:39,640
World War II and,
and the succeeding years.

183
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,760
So the government was taking 90%
of your dividend income, right?

184
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,010
What does it today,
do you know what anyone know?

185
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:52,930
What's the tax rate on dividends today?
Uh,

186
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,820
it might be zero for, yeah, for
some people, but it's actually,

187
00:12:57,821 --> 00:13:02,430
it is a, the standard rate for
people who have not negligent,

188
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,630
not negligible income is 15%.

189
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,310
So it's gone down from over 90% to 15%.

190
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:10,960
Why did it do that?
Well,

191
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:15,961
it's some kind of political change and uh,

192
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,320
the, uh, corporate, uh, okay.

193
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,560
And incidentally at the
beginning of the 20th century,

194
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,260
you were right who said
zero. We didn't, uh,

195
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,260
we didn't even have a income tax
until 1913 when the Supreme Court, uh,

196
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:32,920
allowed it.
So it was zero.

197
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:37,330
Then it went up to 90% are
actually is 94% of the peak.

198
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,190
It came down to 15%. Okay. That's a
pretty big hit on the stock market. So,

199
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:42,371
you know,

200
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:46,780
it wasn't just China that took the
stock market when we were taking 90% of

201
00:13:46,781 --> 00:13:50,770
dividends, that was 90% of the stock
market was being taken by the government.

202
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,760
But that's not all because we were
also taxing the corporations. Uh,

203
00:13:55,761 --> 00:14:00,340
and in the early postwar period,
the corporate,

204
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,390
now I'm going to talk,

205
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,590
there is a distinction between the rate
that they charge and the actual amount

206
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:08,120
that they take. Uh, uh,

207
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,260
most advanced countries of the world today
have a corporate profits tax rate for

208
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:17,680
large corporations have about a third.
So they typically,

209
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:20,290
a typical advanced country
takes a third of the profits.

210
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,360
The government takes a
third of the profits,

211
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,540
but that's not the actual
amount that they pay.

212
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:29,020
Because it tax law is so complicated
and there's so many loopholes.

213
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,020
So what I looked at,
and I have this on the website,

214
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:37,050
I have a chart showing corporate profits
taxes paid as a fraction of corporate

215
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:41,260
profits for the United States since 1929.
Uh,

216
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:43,450
and that had moved around a lot,

217
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,580
but it got almost up to 60% in the,
in the post World War II period.

218
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,100
And now it's down to less than a third.
Uh,

219
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,840
why is it that is because they're
changing enforcement of the taxes and the

220
00:14:56,841 --> 00:15:01,550
changing of marks of loopholes.
So, uh, most countries, uh,

221
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,800
they have a tax rate of about a third,

222
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,020
but corporations are paying less than
a third of their profits detective.

223
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:12,980
So if we want to look going
forward at the equity premium,

224
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,240
we have to know how much, uh, what,

225
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,970
what's the politics and what's the
government going to do in the future?

226
00:15:17,971 --> 00:15:20,450
And they've moved these
tax rates around a lot.

227
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,840
So I think that it's very hard to be
sure that we know going forward what are

228
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,980
sigma and, uh, the, the expected return,

229
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,030
the standard deviation of returns.
And the covariance of returns are really,

230
00:15:35,031 --> 00:15:36,950
so we have a nice theoretical framework,

231
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,990
but the application of the framework
to the real data is hard and it ends up

232
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:46,970
politics underneath it all. And
that's, uh, that's just the real world.

233
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,470
I want to say one more thing
about, uh, about the, uh,

234
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,450
uh, diversification in a mutual fund. Uh,

235
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,720
ideally mutual funds are calculating
our and sigma and sigma one two,

236
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,780
and plugging in and finding what the
optimal portfolio that you should hold is,

237
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,120
and then offering that to you in
their mutual fund. That, uh, in,

238
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,110
in Prac, it's firms that do
that are in practice. However,

239
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:23,140
the minority and most mutual funds
have some gimmick or some special,

240
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,790
uh, they claimed to be beating the
market, not forming the optimal portfolio.

241
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,740
And I also have up on the website,
uh,

242
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,050
some questions that I
asked investors about, uh,

243
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,120
about, uh, what they
think about picking stock.

244
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,350
Picking stocks means trying to find a
stock that's going to do really well. Uh,

245
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,750
and so, uh, what I found,
the question I asked is,

246
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:51,983
um,

247
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,200
do you agree or say which of the following
is a correct answer to this statement?

248
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:02,300
Trying to time the market to get out
before it goes down and in before it goes

249
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:06,530
up. Is a smart thing to do, or B,

250
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,030
not a smart thing to do.

251
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:12,830
Most people think that it's not a smart
thing to do to try to time the market.

252
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:17,690
Only 11% said yes to that.
But then I ask another question.

253
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,700
Do you think, uh, trying to pick
mutual funds, uh, trying to,

254
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,060
to find a mutual fund that
will beat the market, uh,

255
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,950
is a smart thing to do or not a smart
thing to do the most people think it's a

256
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:31,880
smart thing to do.

257
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:37,070
So what I think the mutual fund industry
has turned into largely is a stock

258
00:17:37,071 --> 00:17:41,060
picking industry,
not a portfolio diversification industry.

259
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:46,310
Uh, and so what most people are doing
when they go into a mutual fund is they're

260
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:49,500
trying to find smart people
who will beat market,

261
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:52,440
will pick those stocks that will do well.
Uh,

262
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:56,130
but the Mutual Fund theory that
we gave last time said, no,

263
00:17:56,131 --> 00:18:00,360
the mutual fund is just supposed to
be diversifying for you. In fact,

264
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:02,340
the truth is somewhere in between.

265
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,140
Most mutual funds are providing some
diversification service and they're also

266
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:11,160
trying to, uh, they're also trying to

267
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,160
beat the market. Finally, I
just wanted to say that I,

268
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,910
I've been talking mainly about
the, uh, about the u s but, uh,

269
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,290
mutual funds have been growing
in importance around the world.

270
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,780
Uh, and, uh, there was a
recent paper by, um, uh,

271
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,250
Havana surveys,
I'm sorry,

272
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,570
Urana
surveys

273
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,350
and too far now that looked
at when it is that explains,

274
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,280
uh, which, uh, countries have

275
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,580
had rapidly growing mutual
fund industries. And they
found, not surprisingly,

276
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,990
that it tends to,

277
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,390
mutual funds have been growing more
rapidly in countries that have stronger

278
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,980
securities laws and institutions,

279
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:10,320
especially laws that protect
individual shareholders rights. Also,

280
00:19:10,321 --> 00:19:14,610
a mutual funds had been growing more
in countries that have higher level of

281
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:18,660
education and higher level of wealth.
Uh,

282
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:23,220
and they also grow more in countries
that have institutional structures that

283
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:26,690
encourage, uh, that encourage, uh,

284
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,860
investing in mutual funds
such as pension plans. Uh,

285
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,780
but I think it's a trend around the world
that we're going to see more and more

286
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:37,020
mutual funds. Uh, and I
think it's a good thing.

287
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,440
I think they will help us
to diversify our risks.

288
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,493
Uh,

289
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:47,400
so anywhere I wanted them to move on to
the topic of today's lecture, which is,

290
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,350
uh, insurance and, uh,

291
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:56,430
the insurance is the other side
of the risk management, uh, that,

292
00:19:56,431 --> 00:19:59,970
uh,
institutions that we have insurance

293
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:06,720
evolved separately from securities.
It's long been a different industry,

294
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,920
but the principles are the same.
And the principles of Insurance,

295
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,270
the fund,

296
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,270
the fundamental powerhouse is the
principle of risk pooling and,

297
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,870
uh, insurance, just like mutual funds
or providing risk pooling for you.

298
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,513
Okay.

299
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,580
So risk pooling means they put a lot of
people in independent or low correlated

300
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:34,710
risk into a pore and reduce the
risk for the whole pool. Uh,

301
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,590
they have to contend with
something called moral hazard,

302
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:47,060
which is the risk that people will be
affected by the fact that they're insured

303
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,480
and then do something bad.

304
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,270
The classic moral hazard
problem is the problem that, uh,

305
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,480
you would give fire insurance on her
house and so someone burns down the house

306
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,390
in order to collect the insurance.
Um,

307
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,200
and they also have to
deal with selection bias.

308
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,293
Uh,

309
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,060
what this means it in the insurance
context is that if you offer insurance

310
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:17,440
policies, you will tend to attract
people who are higher risk.

311
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,990
All right?
So if you offer life insurance,

312
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,430
you have life tables which give you
probabilities of dying at various ages,

313
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,440
but that's for the general population.

314
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,770
All the sick people will come to you to
buy life insurance and they will, uh,

315
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,530
turn out to have a higher death
rate than the population at large.

316
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,910
So these are the problems of
insurance that we have to deal with.

317
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,433
Um,

318
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,020
I just wanted to review
the mathematics of this.

319
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:52,030
This is actually just in part I just to
review of what we talked about in the

320
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,420
second lecture. But, uh,

321
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,360
in the ideal world,
if you have independent risks,

322
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:09,950
uh, under the independence assumption, the

323
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:16,190
probability distribution
for the number of, uh,

324
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,070
contract,
uh,

325
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,140
insurance contracts that you will
have to pay on follows the binomial

326
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,003
distribution.

327
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:27,490
So x is the number of accidents that
say this is some accident insurance.

328
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,380
Okay.
Oops.

329
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,350
Uh, the, the, uh,

330
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,680
the probability of having an
n is the number of policies

331
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:50,150
that you're writing and if you're going
to have p is the probability of an

332
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:51,054
accident.

333
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,043
Okay?

334
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:00,550
Then the binomial distribution,
uh,

335
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:06,470
gives you the probability of having
x accidents out of your end policies.

336
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:11,970
And, uh, we had that before. That is, uh,

337
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:15,510
it is, um, p two,

338
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,720
the x one minus one minus x

339
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,850
power,
uh,

340
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,610
times and all over

341
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:35,170
x factorial times and x factorial.

342
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:44,990
And so that is the binomial distribution
and it allows you to calculate the,

343
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,350
the probability of any
number of accidents. Uh, the,

344
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:55,250
the mean, uh, proportion

345
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,130
as the mean of x over n,
which is a,

346
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,190
is equal to p. So, uh,
am I writing big enough?

347
00:24:09,191 --> 00:24:12,460
I can see the, uh, uh,

348
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,800
if x is the number of accidents,

349
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,870
the mean number of accidents divided by
your number of policies is given just by

350
00:24:20,871 --> 00:24:21,704
the probability,

351
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,810
but the standard deviation of x over n

352
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,880
is equal to the square root of p
times one minus p all over again.

353
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,340
And so that is the should get these,

354
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,140
uh,
so that is the,

355
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,720
that gives us a mean and standard
deviation of the proportion.

356
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,330
So to actually apply this,

357
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,660
it helps to go to something called the
normal approximation cause the binomial.

358
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,790
Uh, so, uh,

359
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,410
because it's kind of difficult to compute,

360
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,060
this formula is an easier
formula and you assume that,

361
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,800
uh,

362
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:27,800
the binomial distribution is really
a normal distribution with a mean of,

363
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:33,780
let's say the proportion
of accidents x over,

364
00:25:33,781 --> 00:25:38,781
around and follows a normal distribution
with mean p and standard deviation

365
00:25:39,001 --> 00:25:42,970
given by this.
Uh,

366
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,200
and that's all, that's the, uh,
the whole theory that I have here.

367
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,750
It's simple. Um, so maybe I should

368
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:58,530
make a bigger, well, let me do it here.

369
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,970
I can fit it in here.
I think

370
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,880
I'm going to draw an example. I've got
a plot it out and it's on the website,

371
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:11,150
but it's a very simple example where
I have the case where p equals 0.2.

372
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,400
Okay,
so the probability of an accident is 20%.

373
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:25,380
This is a significantly high probability
of accident. Can you see down,

374
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:30,450
you can see all of this right from zero.
Let's do this from zero to 0.4.

375
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,840
Uh, if, uh, if you wrote only one policy,

376
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:41,040
what's the probability
distribution of x over n? Well,

377
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:43,050
it has two possible values.

378
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:48,210
It could be the one person doesn't have
the accident or does have the accident.

379
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,100
So if any equals one,

380
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,940
uh, we have, uh,

381
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:00,770
an 80% chance this would be 80% of,

382
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:05,710
of, uh, of no accident. Uh, and uh,

383
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:11,450
actually this makes this one not 0.4 then
a 20% chance of one of x over n equals

384
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:17,970
one. Okay? So I'm plodding, uh,

385
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,620
this is the probability
of various values of x,

386
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:27,390
ovarian, if any equals one x over
and can take on only two values,

387
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:32,460
zero or one. And it takes on the
value one with a probability of 20%.

388
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,320
And the value of zero with a probability
of 80% I didn't use the normal

389
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:41,280
approximation there. I just, that's
obvious, right? I use the binomial itself,

390
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:46,850
but let's go to the case
ware and as a hundred then,

391
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,830
uh,
see how should I,

392
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:57,000
maybe I'll leave that up. You can see
this, okay, these diagrams on growing,

393
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,310
if Annie was a hundred,

394
00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:02,310
now I'm going to label this access
differently and now I'm going to show the

395
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:04,800
normal bell shaped curve.

396
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:10,890
And I'm going to do this from zero to 0.4.
Maybe I do have to make this be,

397
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,610
can you see this all right back there?
Okay,

398
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:18,340
so zero to 0.4.
Uh,

399
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:22,050
and so 0.2 is here in the middle.

400
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:28,140
That's 0.2, uh, for any equals.

401
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:33,370
Now I'm going to do any
equals a hundred. Okay. Uh,

402
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,530
what is the mean?

403
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:39,330
But the mean is always point to no
matter how many policies you write.

404
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,033
So it's going to be,

405
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,920
we're going to have a normal
distribution centered on point to

406
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:49,290
this point to is not very readable here.
Um,

407
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,010
I have to crunch down and to do it.

408
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,280
Okay. So, uh,

409
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:02,290
and what does the standard deviation is
the square root of 0.2 times 0.8 over a

410
00:29:03,631 --> 00:29:08,190
hundred. So that's a 0.16, uh,

411
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,430
uh,
over a hundred.

412
00:29:11,431 --> 00:29:16,431
So the standard deviation is 0.04.

413
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:21,960
Uh,
so what does the curve look like?

414
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,723
Uh,

415
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,140
it's a bell shaped curve
that looks about like that.

416
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,840
I didn't draw that very well.
We try it again. I should do,

417
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:38,140
I'll do a nice bell shaped curves,
but uh,

418
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,470
it's harder than it
looks standing up here.

419
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:48,580
Okay. So that's your bell shape
curve. So with a hundred policies,

420
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,240
uh,

421
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,040
they can't really count that accurately
on having 20% of the policies pay.

422
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:58,140
There's still substantial
insurance risk because the,

423
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,910
it could easily be only 15% or
it could be 25% of the policies,

424
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:05,890
uh,
that ended up paying.

425
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,900
So the insurance company with a hundred
policies would have still substantial

426
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:13,040
risk. It's much better. The, the,

427
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:18,060
the uncertainty about x over n is much
lower for the case n equals a hundred

428
00:30:19,421 --> 00:30:22,000
than it was for the case. N
Equals one. But it's still there.

429
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:28,930
Now I want to draw,
what if we write 10,000 policies?

430
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,550
Okay?
Uh,

431
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:36,750
and so what is the probability
distribution for x over N in that case?

432
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,810
But you can see you're going to
be dividing that by 100 here,

433
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,480
but by a hundred times a hundred.

434
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,840
So it's going to reduce
this from 0.04 2.04.

435
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,130
Okay.
And so the normal,

436
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:56,430
the bell shaped curve in that case for
the x over n is going to look something

437
00:30:56,621 --> 00:31:01,150
like this. Well, I've got a plotted
here. It's even more steeply than that.

438
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,550
That's a bell shape curve,

439
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:11,551
but it's Senate exactly on point
to exactly a number of policies.

440
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:15,430
It doesn't affect the mean,
but it affects this Dan deviation.

441
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:20,590
So it becomes very collapsed. And this
is the basic core idea of insurance.

442
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:24,070
You have to be a big company to do it.
And if you have a big company,

443
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:28,990
you've exhausted the, uh, the risk of
a almost never goes away completely.

444
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:33,160
Uh, and so if we did a,
uh, we could go another,

445
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:38,320
another two decimal. If we did
a million Chi now, uh, yeah,

446
00:31:38,321 --> 00:31:42,620
a million, uh, policies, then we
would, this would almost be just, uh,

447
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,580
a spike here at, uh, at that point.

448
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,440
But that's the concept of
insurance. Um, but, uh, the idea,

449
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,340
uh, uh, really took root, the idea,

450
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:58,600
the intuitive idea that as you
write a large number of policies,

451
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,730
the fraction that are,

452
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:05,970
that will result in accidents becomes
closer and closer to the probability of

453
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,030
one accident.
That's an idea that it struck,

454
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:14,410
struck people intuitively
at various times in history,

455
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,460
but they didn't know how to, um, how to

456
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,400
do these calculations. So, uh,

457
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,650
historians of probability have noted
that this basic idea is actually in

458
00:32:29,711 --> 00:32:34,420
Aristotle, the ancient Greek
philosopher or scientist,

459
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,540
and I'm going to quote Aristotle
from his book, Decarlo,

460
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,770
uh, it, and he says to, uh,
he's talking very generally
here, but I think it's this,

461
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:46,100
he's really talking about this.
He says,

462
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,960
to succeed in many things or
many times is quote difficult.

463
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,251
For instance,

464
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:57,251
to repeat the same throw of dice a
10,000 times would be impossible.

465
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,730
Whereas to make it once or twice,
it's comparatively easy.

466
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:05,480
That's Aristotle talking.
It's exactly this theory,

467
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,780
but he doesn't have the word probability,
which hadn't been invented yet.

468
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,640
So he's using intuitive,
he says, difficult or easy.
So he says it's difficult,

469
00:33:13,641 --> 00:33:18,350
meaning the probability is very low
or easy. It probability is high.

470
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,280
He had the idea, but he didn't
have the math. Uh, so that,

471
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:26,570
I think that may be the first a known
statement of the binomial distribution.

472
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:30,080
Well, it doesn't get very precise,
but it has the intuitive concept.

473
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,300
The idea of using this theory
for insurance. Uh, it's,

474
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:39,800
uh, the earliest known
statement of it is a, uh,

475
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:44,860
it was in an anonymous letter
written in 1609 to account Oldenburg.

476
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,520
But that's not the person who said it.

477
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,490
That was the person who received
the letter. Uh, anyway, uh,

478
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,090
the person wrote,

479
00:33:56,091 --> 00:34:01,091
he was talking about fires and it was
proposing that people should pay 1% of the

480
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:06,500
value of the home every year into a
fund and then the fund would be used to

481
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:11,180
replace the home if it burned down and
coating this anonymous person writing in

482
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:13,040
1609.
Uh,

483
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,280
there is no doubt that it would be fully
proved if a calculation we're made of

484
00:34:18,351 --> 00:34:23,351
the number of houses consumed by fire
within a certain space in the course of 30

485
00:34:23,391 --> 00:34:24,110
years,

486
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:28,430
that the loss would not amount by a
good deal to the some that would be

487
00:34:28,431 --> 00:34:29,630
collected in that time.

488
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,230
So it's interesting that this
person uses the word calculation.

489
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,670
This person has the idea,

490
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:38,750
this is the 1600 was the year when
probability theory was invented.

491
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:43,860
So someone had the idea of going
beyond the intuitive notion that, uh,

492
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:48,970
Aristotle have mentioned and moving
to something that is calculable.

493
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,080
And that's when the insurance
industry, it was really born. So,

494
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:58,880
uh, it's, so insurance relies
on this theory of risk pooling,

495
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,940
but it has to make it work. Uh, and I,

496
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:04,840
I stressed in the third lecture that,
uh,

497
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,010
like any insurance,

498
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:11,990
like any other risk management
device is an invention. And that, uh,

499
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,543
uh,

500
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:19,180
every risk management device relies
on a design and the design is,

501
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:21,860
uh,

502
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:26,860
is usually complex and has
it all has to work together.

503
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,690
In order for a design to work well,

504
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:34,520
we have to have every component there.
If one component is missing,

505
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:36,290
we may have a failure.

506
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,900
All of these components have to be
compatible with each other and it has to

507
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:45,200
work. Uh, in a, um,

508
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:52,650
I work according to a plan which
ultimately is informed by this theory.

509
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,430
So insurance as an invention

510
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:05,120
has to have what, what, uh,

511
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,230
things,
uh,

512
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:10,380
it has to have a contract design.

513
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,770
It, that would be a, uh, document, uh,

514
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,370
which is a contract between the
insured and the insurance company.

515
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,790
It specifies what does it specify?

516
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:28,280
It specifies what risks
are covered, uh, and uh,

517
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:32,520
exclusions.
Some risks are not covered.

518
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:33,860
Uh,

519
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:38,860
and those exclusions are carefully
designed in regard of moral hazard and

520
00:36:40,051 --> 00:36:41,190
selection bias.

521
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:49,620
Um, there, there has to
be the mathematical model,

522
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:54,390
which I just presented, but it
may be more complicated. Um,

523
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,570
there has to be a form for the company.
Uh,

524
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,980
there could be a corporate
form that there's the,

525
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:05,180
the insurance company
could be a corporation and,

526
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,063
uh,

527
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,700
or it could be either a
nonprofit corporation or a
for profit corporation owned

528
00:37:11,701 --> 00:37:16,380
by shareholders or the insurance company
could be a mutual insurance company,

529
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,640
in which case the insurance
company is owned by the insured.

530
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,840
Um,
and then you need as well,

531
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:30,030
you need a government regulation
because,

532
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,023
uh,

533
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:35,550
the insurance companies don't
seem to exist without it.

534
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,870
There has to be regulators that are
at least verifying that the insurance

535
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:44,250
company is doing what it it,
it says it's going to do.

536
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,690
And so,
uh,

537
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,330
one thing that the government
has to do is assure that, uh,

538
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,430
reserves requirements are met.

539
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:58,830
The company has to have enough money
on hand to pay out, uh, in the,

540
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:03,720
in the case of default.
So,

541
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,870
uh,
okay.

542
00:38:06,871 --> 00:38:10,350
One way of classifying,
uh,

543
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,800
insurance companies is that they,

544
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,050
um,

545
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:22,370
can exist as either a multiline

546
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,260
insurance companies

547
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,590
or mono line
insurance companies.

548
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,500
A multiline insurance company insures
many different kinds of things,

549
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,000
uh, and, uh, doesn't
confine itself to one thing.

550
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:49,540
So if a company were just a,
a fire insurance company,

551
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:53,450
it would be a mono line
insurance company. Uh, but,

552
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,500
but then they're essentially more risky
and more regulators have to watch them

553
00:38:58,691 --> 00:38:59,780
more because they're,

554
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:04,630
they're standing a higher probability
amount of line of some major disaster.

555
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,750
Uh, and, uh,

556
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:13,240
in contrast to a multiline
kind of ensures, uh, it, uh,

557
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,350
itself.
Uh,

558
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:20,620
so we hear a lot about mono-line insurance
companies in the newspapers today.

559
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:24,430
I don't know if you're reading
about the subprime crisis, but, uh,

560
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,660
we are living in a time at this
moment of a financial crisis,

561
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:33,010
uh, called the subprime crisis. And, uh,

562
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:38,070
that naturally hits mono-line insurance
companies more than multiline insurance

563
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:44,971
companies because they are more
specialized and more vulnerable.

564
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,230
Uh, I'll come back to this
distinction in a minute,

565
00:39:50,231 --> 00:39:54,190
but I wanted to talk
about a certain kinds of,

566
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:59,600
uh, of, uh, uh, uh,

567
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:04,150
mono line insurance
companies that, uh, uh,

568
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:08,680
the biggest, uh, well, one
category is property and casualty

569
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,890
insurance company or PNC.

570
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:19,430
He's aren't insurance companies
that insure the value of
a home or a business or

571
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:22,510
an automobile.
Uh,

572
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:26,980
and another kind of monolines insurances,

573
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:31,981
health insurance company that merely
ensures people against health costs.

574
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:37,420
And another important
category is life insurance.

575
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:44,560
Uh, so, uh, life insurance is,

576
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,930
uh, w what it ensures is, uh,

577
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:51,850
a beneficiary against the
death of an insured. Uh,

578
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:56,080
and the classic example of the
most important example is families.

579
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,300
Uh,
the,

580
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,300
you would buy life insurance on
both the husband and the wife.

581
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,830
Okay. You might have, might do
different amount and it's done right.

582
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,960
Families with young children to protect
them against the economic cost of the

583
00:41:10,961 --> 00:41:13,510
death of one of their parents.
Uh,

584
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:18,490
and you need insurance on both parents
because both parents are contributing,

585
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:23,590
uh, to the, uh, success
of the children. So,

586
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:28,050
um, these are big industries. Uh, the, uh,

587
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:33,570
total assets of a property and
casualty in 2007 and the United States,

588
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:40,870
uh,
and these are assets,

589
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:46,480
property and casualty, uh, was

590
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:51,490
one point $4 trillion.

591
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,563
Uh,

592
00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:00,450
and life insurance was
four point $9 trillion.

593
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:07,510
So, uh, I don't actually did, I don't have
to, somehow I missed getting the health,

594
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:12,220
but that would be another big, uh,
insurance. So this is a, these are huge,

595
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:17,830
hugely important institutions,
uh, in our, uh, in our, um,

596
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,400
in our society. So, uh,
what are, what does proper,

597
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,620
let me go to property and
casualty. Um, what do they insure?

598
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:28,943
Uh,

599
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:34,250
actually the most important that
thing that they insure is automobiles.

600
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:36,953
Uh,

601
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:42,400
the total premiums collected on
automobiles is about, is much bigger.

602
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:47,350
I like five times bigger than the
premiums they collect on homeowners.

603
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,420
Automobile Insurance is
collision insurance. Okay.

604
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,890
Homeowner's insurance is used to be
called fire insurance, but now they've,

605
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,530
they've extended it to include
so many other risks. Uh,

606
00:43:02,531 --> 00:43:05,050
it depends on the particular policy,
what it includes.

607
00:43:05,051 --> 00:43:09,610
It might include risks as well of
personal liability if someone injures

608
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:14,200
themselves on your property or
risks of storms of hurricanes,

609
00:43:14,201 --> 00:43:17,770
earthquakes, everything else. So
we call it homeowners insurance,

610
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:22,540
but actually the automobile
insurance is more important.

611
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:27,050
And then the homeowners insurance, even
the homes are so much more valuable. Uh,

612
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:31,780
because I think that's because cars move
and they drive around and they bumped

613
00:43:31,781 --> 00:43:34,540
into each other, cut homes,
just stay where they are.

614
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:38,570
And so we have far fewer accidents so
they don't have to charge is high premium,

615
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:43,970
uh, for, uh, for, uh,

616
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:50,500
for the, uh, insurance. So, uh,

617
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:57,050
these insurance contracts have
come across gradually through time.

618
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:01,940
Uh, as we developed the theory, uh,

619
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:06,800
and I talk about the growth of insurance
and about some of the components of it.

620
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,533
Uh,

621
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,143
uh,

622
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,820
real insurance industry, as I mentioned
before, began in the 16 hundreds,

623
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:29,523
uh,

624
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:34,950
with the invention of theory and with
the invention of a life tables for an

625
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,640
invention of actuarial science.
But it grew slowly.

626
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:45,390
And I think the reason that it grew
slowly was that insurance is a very

627
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,960
sophisticated concept. Uh,
in order to explain it,

628
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,260
I had to write down in the
binomial distribution and, uh,

629
00:44:52,261 --> 00:44:56,280
I have to explain it properly. For most
people, that's a difficult concept.

630
00:44:56,910 --> 00:44:59,970
Uh, and so, uh, I think I may have
mentioned some of this before,

631
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:04,650
but let me give this history,
uh, in, uh, insurance,

632
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:08,460
it was invented in the 16 hundreds,
but it did not for the, for eight fast.

633
00:45:08,461 --> 00:45:12,360
They proliferate,
proliferated only very slowly.

634
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:14,500
And some of the,
uh,

635
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:19,040
important figures is there had
to be certain inventions, uh,

636
00:45:19,790 --> 00:45:22,650
to make it work. Uh, again,

637
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:26,160
I'm repeating a theme that isn't my book,
New Financial Order,

638
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:31,370
that financial innovation and
insurance innovation is a succession of

639
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:32,790
inventions.

640
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,500
And each invention propels
the idea more forward.

641
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:38,860
So it's like,
uh,

642
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:43,110
we have laws of thermodynamics
that underlie the use of engines.

643
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,300
Uh, and, but you know,

644
00:45:45,301 --> 00:45:48,960
you can't just go from the laws of
thermodynamics to an automobile.

645
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:53,460
There's a million steps along the way.
And if you look at the history of engines,

646
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,470
there are discreet advances.

647
00:45:55,800 --> 00:46:00,150
And when people were able to apply the
theory more and more, well, in insurance,

648
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:04,950
there's a similar list of inventions.
So, uh, Morris, Robert Robinson,

649
00:46:05,310 --> 00:46:10,270
uh, was head of mutual life, um,

650
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:15,000
of New York
and the 1840s.

651
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:19,340
Uh, and he, uh,

652
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,780
got the idea of highly paid
life insurance salespeople.

653
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:27,630
Uh, the idea was that, uh,

654
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,400
it's difficult to sell people on insurance
back in the 1840 [inaudible] life

655
00:46:32,401 --> 00:46:36,840
insurance was very important because
the average expectancy of life was only

656
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,220
something like 45 years. And so that
meant parents were dying left and right.

657
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:45,840
What would be the probability that a
married couple would live both of them to

658
00:46:45,841 --> 00:46:49,950
the, uh, to the, uh, time
when their children are grown?

659
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,370
Uh, well it was fairly low, right?

660
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,850
If the average age at death was
something like 45, uh, you know,

661
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:02,440
maybe a 50, 50 chance of,
of high a risk, uh, of,

662
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,810
of one of the parents dying.

663
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:09,150
So you should think that people would
really want life insurance, but they,

664
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:13,800
uh, but they were not buying it.
And why was it? Well, first of all,

665
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:18,210
they were dying in such numbers.
P was so high that it was expensive.

666
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:21,120
They have to pay that premium
has to cover the costs.

667
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:25,350
And so it was tough to get
someone to buy life insurance

668
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,870
even though they really needed it. It
was such a idea for them. Uh, but, uh,

669
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:36,430
it's partly because there's a
psychological resistance to it, you know,

670
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:38,470
this is still very much alive today.

671
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,420
I was standing at the World Economic
Forum at one of our lunch things and a

672
00:47:43,421 --> 00:47:47,860
young woman approached me from Swiss re,
uh, which is a Swiss reinsurance company.

673
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:53,310
And she said she wanted my ideas on
how to sell crop insurance and Africa.

674
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:57,730
She said, we have it now at Swiss re. Uh,

675
00:47:57,731 --> 00:48:02,540
and of course the World Bank sponsors
a crop insurance for farmers. So,

676
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:07,620
and there are some very poor areas in
Africa where farmers really run the risk

677
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:12,700
if their crop fails, uh, it could
be really bad. Uh, you know,

678
00:48:12,701 --> 00:48:14,590
they would be approaching starvation.

679
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:19,950
So wouldn't you think that farmers would
want to buy crop insurance from this

680
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:23,380
Swiss company?
It looks like a good idea to me,

681
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:28,270
but she says we're having a
lot of trouble selling it. Uh,

682
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:30,040
and uh,
he said,

683
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:33,850
if you talk to the farmers
in these rural areas,

684
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:38,710
what do you think they say when you offer?
They say, I can't afford the insurance.

685
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,020
Well, they're not
thinking, right. You know,

686
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:47,010
the whole idea of insurance is that you
take from your good years and you move

687
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,410
it into your bad year so that you
make it through all your years.

688
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,690
And so you're having
a good year this year.

689
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:56,440
Maybe it looks that way now and
you think you can't afford it,

690
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:59,890
but just think how bad it will be. If
it's a bad year, then you really won't.

691
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:04,480
You won't feel afford to
stay alive. Uh, and so, uh,

692
00:49:04,481 --> 00:49:06,790
but she says they didn't,
some of them respond,

693
00:49:06,791 --> 00:49:08,710
but a great majority of them don't.

694
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:13,240
And I think it's because
of a psychological aversion
to people have to thinking

695
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,940
about insurance.
It's just unpleasant.

696
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,960
And Life Insurance is actually an
insurance against one of you dying.

697
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,480
It's a very unpleasant topic. So if
someone comes to your home and says, I'm,

698
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,020
I would like to send a sell you life
insurance. You know, you think, you know,

699
00:49:29,021 --> 00:49:29,860
some other day,

700
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:34,690
I don't want to talk today
about the probability of
one of us dying. Uh, and so,

701
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:39,580
uh, it was a tough sell. So
Morris Robinson, however,

702
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:43,900
realized that some people are very
talented salespeople and they're probably

703
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:48,440
talented at other things as well.
So it may sound like a small, uh,

704
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,900
a small improvement,

705
00:49:49,901 --> 00:49:54,250
but he just had very highly
paid insurance sales,

706
00:49:55,540 --> 00:50:00,430
uh, and they were paid as long
as people kept their policy.

707
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,760
And so that motivated insurance salesman
to form long term relationships with

708
00:50:06,041 --> 00:50:10,540
the families and he was insuring and to
keep them from canceling their policies.

709
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,850
So he got talented,

710
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:17,851
respected members of the community who
people admired to become life insurance

711
00:50:18,671 --> 00:50:22,420
salesman and he had to pay them enough
so that they would stick with the job.

712
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,750
And then it finally worked.
It may seem crazy,

713
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:30,080
but it may seem like a modest
innovation, but it actually, uh, was,

714
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,480
uh,
it was an important innovation.

715
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,910
So I don't know how you think
of life insurance salespeople,

716
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:39,350
but they have been pillars of the
community. There are people that you,

717
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:44,240
the community trusts that people are
willing to let into their home and discuss

718
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,170
things like death.
Uh,

719
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:49,920
and that was an innovation
that came in then.

720
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:53,090
Then the other innovation was Henry.

721
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:58,050
Hi. Uh, and he was at,

722
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:58,923
uh,

723
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,520
another insurance company,
equitable life.

724
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:04,843
MMM.

725
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,640
Uh,
and that was in the late 18 hundreds.

726
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:22,210
Uh, and what he invented was a
insurance policy that had a cash value.

727
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:26,800
And that's another, uh, it's a
cash value on the insurance policy.

728
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,390
That is that the insurance
policy doesn't just

729
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:38,680
insure you against death. It also
builds value over the years. Uh,

730
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:43,681
and this invention was very important
because it stopped people from canceling.

731
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:48,040
The big problem with life insurance had
his people would buy it and they'd pay

732
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:52,660
for several years. Uh, and then
eventually they would think, well,

733
00:51:52,661 --> 00:51:56,740
we didn't die. We were losing all this
money. Let's just cancel the insurance.

734
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:01,270
And it especially happens the way life
is and real families is, you know,

735
00:52:01,271 --> 00:52:05,020
you start getting accustomed to a certain
style of life and you start spending

736
00:52:05,021 --> 00:52:07,060
more and more money and
then it comes upon it.

737
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,160
There comes a time when you have
a little crunch and you know,

738
00:52:09,161 --> 00:52:11,710
you're a little short on
money and so you're casting,

739
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,690
you're out for some way to
come up with some money.

740
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:18,550
And so canceling your life
insurance was a good idea. Uh,

741
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,770
but, uh, uh,

742
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:25,510
the turns out that if you make them
forfeit their cash value on canceling,

743
00:52:25,511 --> 00:52:29,890
then they won't cancel. And so,
um, that both of these were ideas,

744
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:33,430
uh, that, uh, were copied
all over the world.

745
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:36,340
That's the way inventions are.
Uh,

746
00:52:36,341 --> 00:52:41,070
and so a lot of insurance policies
today have cash values. Uh,

747
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:42,920
the third thing I was going to report,

748
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,243
uh,

749
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:49,180
was a sociologist Viviana Zelizer,

750
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,153
uh,

751
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:56,350
wrote a book about life insurance
salesmen sales in the night in the 19th

752
00:52:57,861 --> 00:53:00,710
century. And she found that, uh,

753
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:05,870
there was a lot of resistance to purchase
of life insurance in the 19th century.

754
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,160
Uh,

755
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:10,760
and she tried to study it and try to
figure out how it was that life insurance

756
00:53:10,761 --> 00:53:14,290
became more and more important
over that century. Uh,

757
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:18,470
and one of her conclusions without life
insurance seem to be opposed quite a bit

758
00:53:18,471 --> 00:53:21,830
by women, uh, 19th century women.

759
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:23,623
Uh,

760
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:34,710
and why didn't they like it?
You would think that any rational,

761
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:39,440
a woman in the 19th century would reflect
on the fact that there's a significant

762
00:53:39,441 --> 00:53:43,640
probability that her husband will die of
something while you still have children.

763
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,110
And why wouldn't they want a,
well,

764
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:50,090
what she found is that
life insurance salespeople,

765
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:54,470
we're going to families and trying to
sell them on life insurance by explaining

766
00:53:54,471 --> 00:53:57,190
the concept. And they would
say something like, I did.

767
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,270
Maybe they didn't write down
the binomial distribution,

768
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:03,950
but they explained the idea
of insurance. Uh, and uh,

769
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:09,310
it didn't sound right to the typical 19th
century American woman or I suppose it

770
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:11,810
wasn't just America.
It was a worldwide problem.

771
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:17,530
And the reaction that salespeople would
get from women was, you know, this, this,

772
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:21,290
you're giving me some probabilities or
something. And you're asking me too.

773
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:26,200
It sounds like you're asking me to play
in some gambling thing where I win.

774
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:31,040
If my husband dies, it doesn't,
it doesn't sound right to me.

775
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:34,670
Uh, I think, uh, in fact a lot
of women would say something.

776
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:36,470
I put my faith in God,

777
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:41,600
and I think I might bring down God's
wrath if I did such a thing as to bet that

778
00:54:41,601 --> 00:54:45,530
my husband is going to die.
Uh, and so she would, uh,

779
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:48,740
refuse to take part in it.
It doesn't sound right to her.

780
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,460
I'll trust in prayer and other things.
Uh,

781
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:55,390
so it didn't work and you
couldn't sell them on.

782
00:54:55,670 --> 00:55:00,020
So what Xcel is a reported is that some
life insurance companies surmounted this

783
00:55:00,021 --> 00:55:03,680
problem by changing the pitch,
by telling their salespeople,

784
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:08,050
don't try to explain probability
theory to these people, uh,

785
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:12,320
but you have to do is come
across differently. And so the,

786
00:55:12,321 --> 00:55:17,321
the thing that she said they started doing
is to pretend that in a way that they

787
00:55:17,361 --> 00:55:22,361
were missionaries with a Gospel
and the Gospel is insurance.

788
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,900
Uh, and they would tell
these women, uh, you know,

789
00:55:26,901 --> 00:55:29,930
if you buy life insurance on your husband,

790
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,300
then should anything happen,

791
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:37,360
your husband can love and protect
you from beyond the grave. Uh,

792
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:42,680
and uh, that sounds
good. So, uh, it worked.

793
00:55:42,681 --> 00:55:46,430
And these little things you, you may,
they may seem like little things,

794
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:49,070
but they are technological advances.

795
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:55,020
People in a profession over the
years learn more and more how to, um,

796
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:56,870
how to,
uh,

797
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:04,220
how to manage the public's expectations
and get them to actually purchase

798
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,150
insurance. So, uh,

799
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:11,880
I wanted to talk about government
regulation of insurance because, uh,

800
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:16,000
I said that was an important
aspect of insurance. Uh,

801
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:20,240
and what the regulators
do. Many things, uh,

802
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:24,340
but insurance regulators, uh, most of our,

803
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:29,340
our concern with capital adequacy, so, uh,

804
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,610
so insurance,
now insurance is in the United States,

805
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:41,640
is regulated not by the federal government
but by insurance regulators in each

806
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,390
of the 50 states.

807
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:47,980
So it's very hard to summarize insurance
regulation in the United States.

808
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,150
Why is it regulated separately
by the 50 states? Uh,

809
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:55,030
that's because it started out that
way when the federal government wasn't

810
00:56:55,031 --> 00:56:59,380
involved in those sorts of things. But
somehow we never had the, uh, uh, in fact,

811
00:56:59,381 --> 00:57:03,760
it's talked about, we should maybe we'll
see it in the next 10 or 20 years. Uh,

812
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:07,240
there's talked about that there should
be a federal government regulation of

813
00:57:07,241 --> 00:57:11,290
insurance, but it's actually state
regulators and it makes it hard.

814
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,690
This is a handicap to the
US insurance industry.

815
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:18,000
Other countries have it centralized, but
in the U S it's split up over 50 states,

816
00:57:18,001 --> 00:57:21,520
it was very hard to start an insurance
company because you've got to meet the

817
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,470
requirements of all 50 regulators.

818
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:28,570
But the most important thing that
these do is they specify what reserves

819
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:33,760
insurance companies have
to hold. Okay. And so,

820
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,020
uh, they, in other words,

821
00:57:35,021 --> 00:57:38,140
the insurance company doesn't trust
the insurance companies to do the

822
00:57:38,141 --> 00:57:41,320
calculations like I just showed
with the binomial theorem.

823
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:46,620
They want to make sure that there's a
significantly high probability it since

824
00:57:47,081 --> 00:57:50,560
sufficiently high probability
that even if they get a bad draw,

825
00:57:50,561 --> 00:57:54,430
and there's a lot of policies
that require paying out,

826
00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:57,940
that these reserves will satisfy.
Uh,

827
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:03,520
so an insurance company must hold
the reserves, it can hold more.

828
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:08,830
Uh, and that's called a
statutory surplus. So, uh,

829
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,720
the reserves are an accounting entry. It's
how much they are required to hold. Uh,

830
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:17,830
but the companies will hold
more than that. Uh, if, uh,

831
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:22,840
typically in order to protect themselves
more than is required and their policy

832
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:27,790
holders more than is required
by the regulators. So,

833
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,690
uh, occasionally you get
into problems, uh, with uh,

834
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:36,400
with the reserves. And, um, uh,

835
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,680
before I get to that, let me just
say, uh, uh, I want to just mention,

836
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:47,130
mentioned a few types of insurance
that are important. So, uh,

837
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:49,990
let's talk about life insurance

838
00:58:53,650 --> 00:58:56,740
and we're talking about kinds of
policies that are around today.

839
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,810
The simplest form of life insurance.
It's called term insurance.

840
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,873
Okay.

841
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:08,940
And this is insurance that you pay each
year for insurance in that year and it

842
00:59:10,181 --> 00:59:13,270
does not build a cash value.
So this is the symbol of me.

843
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:16,240
I can buy insurance for myself this year,
uh,

844
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:19,060
and I can stop and if I,
uh,

845
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:22,300
there's no nothing her,
uh,

846
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:25,970
next year I would just
have to pay it again. Um,

847
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:31,990
whole life is more complicated
because it builds a,

848
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:37,590
a cash value according to a schedule.
Uh,

849
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,193
and uh,

850
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:44,450
there is both a non participating and
participating with non participating what

851
00:59:44,451 --> 00:59:46,320
was participating.
You in a,

852
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:51,360
you are participating in the portfolio
outcome that the insurance company is

853
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:55,460
experiencing and so you have some
uncertainty about your cash value.

854
00:59:56,350 --> 01:00:00,820
Um, there's something
called variable life, uh,

855
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:07,120
which refers to a life insurance policy
where the policy holder can shift.

856
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:14,020
You can make decisions about the
investment of the money in the whole life

857
01:00:15,051 --> 01:00:19,640
policy. And so it's not just taking
what's given by the insurance company.

858
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,220
There's something called universal life.

859
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:27,040
These are all explained
in full Bozi at uh, uh,

860
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:27,950
that's a,

861
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:32,950
it's a whole life policy that gives
the policyholder flexibility over the

862
01:00:33,681 --> 01:00:34,700
insurance premiums.

863
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:40,210
You can pay more into the cash value in
one year and less than another year as

864
01:00:40,911 --> 01:00:45,380
long as you keep paying a
a, a minimum amount. Um,

865
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:52,400
and uh,
it was also survivorship policies,

866
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:58,990
uh, that will pay, uh, uh,

867
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,030
for example, uh, the second to die.

868
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:05,570
There'll be a policy if a
husband and wife get it and uh,

869
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:07,790
it pays out when the second of them dies.

870
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:11,540
Or also about regulation.

871
01:01:11,541 --> 01:01:16,541
I want to dimension n a I see very
important institution that stands for

872
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:23,280
National Association of
Insurance Commissioners. Uh,

873
01:01:23,290 --> 01:01:27,620
and this is something
that's very important in the
United States because as I

874
01:01:27,621 --> 01:01:28,620
mentioned,
uh,

875
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,750
insurance regulation is
divided up over the 50 states.

876
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:36,620
And the problem that that creates is a,

877
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,730
that it's a nightmare for
insurance companies because
every different state has

878
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:43,790
different laws. Uh,
recognizing this problem,

879
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:49,120
the insurance commissioners in the
various dates have decided to form an

880
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:54,650
organization that's the NAI seat
and they hold regular conferences.

881
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:57,980
Uh, and at these conferences they, uh,

882
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:03,130
decide on a recommended or uniform
like insurance regulation policy,

883
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:07,880
uh, and it acts a little bit like
a congress and they make laws,

884
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:12,500
but the laws are not binding on anyone.
They just suggested laws or regulations.

885
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:17,590
Uh, and so it's an effort to
try to get the complex, uh,

886
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:22,950
uh, complexity of different
regulators uniform. So as I say,

887
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:26,070
when they nai see decides
on some regulation,

888
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:30,660
it's only a recommendation to the
separate state regulatory commissions.

889
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:32,010
Uh,

890
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:36,840
but of course it has a lot of force
because all 50 states have met.

891
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:40,890
The commissioner has a 50 states
I've met and hashed it out. Uh,

892
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:45,780
so most states would essentially
adopt with the NAI c says, uh,

893
01:02:45,781 --> 01:02:48,180
otherwise, you know, they're
not going to figure it all out.

894
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:52,170
They can't claim the beat. It would
be rational to do that. Right?

895
01:02:52,171 --> 01:02:55,800
You wouldn't think that we would rethink
all of these things ourselves and then

896
01:02:55,801 --> 01:02:57,120
have a different in our state.

897
01:02:57,870 --> 01:03:02,870
So the NAI C is kind of a quasi
regulatory body or is it quasi government?

898
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:05,100
It's not government,
uh,

899
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,270
because it has no authority and yet it
acts almost like a parliament where these

900
01:03:09,271 --> 01:03:14,070
people get together and decide on things
and they end up as a force of law.

901
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,900
Uh, so, uh,

902
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:25,730
another important, uh, there's some
milestones in insurance that, um,

903
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,550
I wanted to mention.
Um,

904
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:33,210
and then I'm going to come back to finally
concluding with problems that we see.

905
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:36,860
Uh, and of course the
problems are not damning.

906
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:41,890
There are problems that reflect the
progress yet needed to be made and

907
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:47,490
insurance. But, um, I just
wanted to mention the, uh,

908
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:52,690
the um,
uh,

909
01:03:53,970 --> 01:03:57,360
the itch
lily,

910
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:03,570
um,
financial modernization act

911
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,350
of 1999.

912
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:15,230
And what this did is it allowed
banks to offer insurance or to,

913
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:22,000
uh, ally and join in merge
with insurance companies.

914
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:27,550
Before that did I said before, insurance
is really the same thing as security.

915
01:04:27,551 --> 01:04:32,551
So both based on risk
management and pooling of risk
diversification or pooling.

916
01:04:32,951 --> 01:04:34,000
I really the same thing,

917
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:38,020
but we had a separate set of institute
and people never thought of insurance as

918
01:04:38,021 --> 01:04:42,010
the same as a bank. Uh, but since
this is relatively recently,

919
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:45,010
that's only nine years
ago, um, at this time.

920
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:49,790
So it means then that we are now seeing a,
uh,

921
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:55,200
expansion of our banking
system in the u s to become,

922
01:04:55,570 --> 01:05:00,100
uh, uh, insurance related. It's
different in other countries.

923
01:05:00,190 --> 01:05:05,190
In Europe they've had a universal banking
which allowed banks to offer insurance

924
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:10,800
for a much longer time.
But in the U S it's a kind of a recent,

925
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:16,240
a recent innovation.
So I wanted to conclude with problems,

926
01:05:16,241 --> 01:05:20,200
which may sound kind of,
but, uh, this is, uh,

927
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:23,110
I don't shrink from negative is
it's not really negative isn't it?

928
01:05:23,111 --> 01:05:25,180
It's talking about what,
what should be done.

929
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:29,020
So I wanted to come back to,

930
01:05:29,021 --> 01:05:32,620
I told you that Marta line
was in the news a lot lately.

931
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:37,210
And so why don't we talking about when it,
uh,

932
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:39,280
I don't know how much you read about that.

933
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:46,320
Okay.

934
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:46,580
Uh,

935
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:51,580
right now we are going through a major
financial crisis which started in the u s

936
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:57,170
but has spread over the world
and this is called the, uh,

937
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,330
the subprime crisis.

938
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:00,733
Yeah.

939
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:09,170
Subprime refers to mortgages, which
is not the subject of today's lecture,

940
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:14,590
but a sub prime mortgage is a mortgage
issued to a borrower who is not

941
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:19,340
considered a crime.
That's not a good risk.

942
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:24,440
Borrowers that are thought by the
various models to be likely to fail,

943
01:06:24,441 --> 01:06:28,430
to pay on their mortgage and
to have to be foreclosed low,

944
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:32,390
often low income. But also there are
people with poor credit histories.

945
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:35,540
So, uh, the crisis that we're in now,

946
01:06:35,541 --> 01:06:39,320
and this is very important you
where you're living through it. Uh,

947
01:06:39,321 --> 01:06:41,990
and we'll see how it pans out.
Uh,

948
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:47,120
the subprime crisis is happening today
because home prices are falling and with

949
01:06:48,981 --> 01:06:53,510
falling home prices more
subprime borrowers are re are,

950
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:58,600
are failing to pay their mortgage and
default rates are shooting up and a

951
01:06:59,781 --> 01:07:04,230
valuation of securitized subprime
mortgages have crashed. Uh,

952
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:09,260
and it's throwing turmoil all over
the [inaudible] all over the financial

953
01:07:09,261 --> 01:07:14,030
community. Uh, it's, we're, we're
seeing what they call systemic effects.

954
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:18,653
Uh,

955
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:22,550
that's a very general term that goes
beyond insurance. By systemic effects,

956
01:07:22,551 --> 01:07:26,540
I mean something that affects
the whole financial system.

957
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:31,250
Uh, and when you do these calculations,
which I just did for insurance,

958
01:07:31,251 --> 01:07:35,360
I was talking about insurance companies,
assuming that risks are independent,

959
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:39,650
everything's independent, we've got
it all figured out. Uh, underlying at,

960
01:07:39,651 --> 01:07:43,160
there were other things besides just
the calculation of their accident rates

961
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:46,600
that I had a certain assumptions built in.
Uh,

962
01:07:46,610 --> 01:07:50,540
and the failure of the assumptions in
many different industries can create

963
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:53,060
systemic effects.
So what happened?

964
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:58,130
I want to talk about a particular line
of Mano Line insurers that you may never

965
01:07:58,131 --> 01:08:01,970
have even heard of because they
don't deal with the general public.

966
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:04,790
And these are municipal bonds

967
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:10,200
insurance.

968
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:15,190
Okay. These are private
companies, insurance companies,

969
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:16,670
their motto line,

970
01:08:16,730 --> 01:08:20,880
because they look only at a certain
class of risk and not all risks that the

971
01:08:20,881 --> 01:08:24,560
insurer they deal with principally with

972
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:31,070
state and local governments who are
issuing bonds to raise money for their

973
01:08:31,071 --> 01:08:36,000
activities like new haven, for
example. Uh, or any other, uh,

974
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:37,790
any state or local government,

975
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,020
we refer to the bonds that they
issue as municipal bonds. Now,

976
01:08:42,021 --> 01:08:47,021
the problem is that if you invest in
bonds from some state or local government,

977
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,340
they might not pay you back.
They can just go bankrupt.

978
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:55,900
The cities going bankrupt
and they just can't pay. Uh,

979
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:00,230
and so you as a, as a
buyer of these bonds, uh,

980
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:03,110
feel reluctant to invest in them.
Okay?

981
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:08,470
So in order to make their guns salable
to the general public city and state

982
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:11,600
governments go,
or any region,

983
01:09:11,601 --> 01:09:16,040
a local governments go to the
municipal bond insurer companies,

984
01:09:16,730 --> 01:09:17,750
uh,
and

985
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:19,010
they have names.

986
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:23,600
Big Ones are Mbia Ambac,

987
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:28,730
uh, F G I see. That's not FDA. I see.

988
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:32,120
It's not the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.

989
01:09:32,121 --> 01:09:36,020
It's f GIC and there are others as well.
Okay.

990
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,620
And so what these do is
they ensure the bond.

991
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:44,650
They ensure the investor against the
municipality failing to pay on the bond.

992
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:46,283
All right?

993
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:51,400
And so lots of investors won't buy a
municipal bond unless it's insured.

994
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:56,480
Uh, okay. So now I'm talking about
systemic effects in the home.

995
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:01,160
So these insurance companies have
reserves on hand and they invest these

996
01:10:01,161 --> 01:10:05,000
reserves in something. So what
are they invest in then? Well,

997
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:09,710
one of the things they've been investing
in a man, uh, is sub mortgages. You know,

998
01:10:09,711 --> 01:10:13,550
I can see what I'm talking
about. Systemic effect. So, uh,

999
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:15,440
the housing sector in the United States,

1000
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:18,650
you might say is completely different
from municipal bond insurers.

1001
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:21,290
But when the housing
sector starts going down,

1002
01:10:21,470 --> 01:10:24,340
people start defaulting
on their mortgages. Uh,

1003
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:29,620
then the value of the subprime
loans that the mortgage,

1004
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:33,920
municipal bond insurers own
starts to go down. Okay.

1005
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,180
Now these guys have never failed
to live up to their guarantees.

1006
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,470
They're doing just fine.

1007
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:44,710
But people are noticing that
their portfolios are going down.

1008
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:48,040
And so their surplus,
uh,

1009
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:51,940
statutory surplus is going down. And, uh,

1010
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:54,770
and so we're starting to
worry about these companies.

1011
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:58,030
And so notably it was January 18,

1012
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:03,590
a rating agency, Fitch lowered

1013
01:11:05,630 --> 01:11:06,463
handbag

1014
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:14,520
from AAA rated to Aa

1015
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:19,020
rated. Okay. That was a big news story
or you might not have caught it right?

1016
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:23,400
But it was a big news story for the
field work in municipal government.

1017
01:11:23,401 --> 01:11:27,060
You Thought, oh, this is bad
news. If this is the only,

1018
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:30,630
if only one rating agency
does that. Okay. But,

1019
01:11:30,631 --> 01:11:35,130
and it's only Ambac that's been down
rated. But uh, yeah, you start wanting to,

1020
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:38,640
reporters start calling the other
rating agencies standard and Poor's and

1021
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:42,640
Moody's and others and say, are you
going to down rate these guys? And,

1022
01:11:42,641 --> 01:11:46,020
and you read in the newspaper
their interpretation of
what is going to be said.

1023
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:50,440
And so far the other aid
agencies, I haven't, you know,

1024
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:51,900
they're not saying anything,
they're not,

1025
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:55,620
but now people are suspecting that
these are all going to get down rated.

1026
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:59,820
Well if they're down rated then nobody
trusts him anymore as insurance companies.

1027
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:04,290
Uh, and so that means that the
municipal governments will have it,

1028
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:08,370
find it hard to issue bonds
to continue their activities.

1029
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:13,730
So the municipal governments might have
to shut down some activities like fixing

1030
01:12:14,191 --> 01:12:17,910
the roads or bridges or whatever things,
building schools,

1031
01:12:17,911 --> 01:12:22,911
whatever the cities do with their
municipal bond money they raised from the

1032
01:12:23,301 --> 01:12:24,240
municipal bonds.

1033
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:27,270
So then what you can see how things
are feeding through the system.

1034
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:28,860
It starts out in one thing,

1035
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:33,090
it goes to the insurance companies and
then it goes to the municipal governments

1036
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,010
and all that kind of thing can,
might,

1037
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:39,010
might put this economy into a recession
if it's not just the municipal

1038
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:39,810
governments,

1039
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:44,810
but a lot of different of
a lot of different aspects
of our financial system are

1040
01:12:46,021 --> 01:12:51,021
going to be touched by a crisis that
spreading from one segment to another.

1041
01:12:52,950 --> 01:12:57,870
Uh, so, uh, that's where this
stands right now. The latest thing.

1042
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:02,610
Well, now this is a crisis.
Uh, I'm municipal bond crisis,

1043
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:03,444
which is unfolding.

1044
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:08,660
The New York state regulators have been
trying to get companies to subscribe

1045
01:13:10,441 --> 01:13:15,060
more capital to the line insurance
companies to bolster their, uh,

1046
01:13:15,061 --> 01:13:19,210
their capital so that they have more
money to pay out and that will prevent any

1047
01:13:19,211 --> 01:13:23,730
more Lorings of their
ratings. And, uh, uh,

1048
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:27,250
so, uh, uh,

1049
01:13:27,450 --> 01:13:31,080
the other thing has happened now is that
Warren Buffet said he wants to get into

1050
01:13:31,081 --> 01:13:35,550
the, um, uh, municipal
bond ensuring business.

1051
01:13:36,090 --> 01:13:39,180
And so, well, he's just a
business person coming in. Uh,

1052
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:43,770
and so there will be new municipal bond
insurers appearing that will take up the

1053
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:45,690
slack.
And so we'll be all right.

1054
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,480
But the problem is that we
may have a crisis for a while.

1055
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,570
The other thing that I wanted to talk
about, I guess I'm running out of time,

1056
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:56,910
was about, uh, uh, management
of disaster risk. Uh, and, uh,

1057
01:13:57,330 --> 01:14:02,220
we, we have another insurance crisis
developing now, uh, because of,

1058
01:14:02,730 --> 01:14:03,563
uh,

1059
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:08,130
well a very important source of
insurance risk that's developing.

1060
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:13,210
It has to do with the rising rate of
hurricane damage that we're observing in

1061
01:14:13,211 --> 01:14:17,320
the east coast of the United States.
And notably, we saw Hurricane Katrina,

1062
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:22,540
uh, that caused a huge
property damage, uh,

1063
01:14:22,810 --> 01:14:27,400
in, uh, uh, uh, a couple
of years ago that, uh,

1064
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:29,830
I kind of tested
insurance companies again.

1065
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:34,750
And the risk is that global
warming will, uh, will,

1066
01:14:35,830 --> 01:14:40,640
uh, make hurricanes more
common. And, uh, I guess I,

1067
01:14:40,641 --> 01:14:44,630
I'll have to, I'll just
conclude that, uh, uh,

1068
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,960
I'll talk a little bit about that. I've
gotten through almost all of us, uh,

1069
01:14:48,310 --> 01:14:51,610
next time. The only other thing, uh,
then next year we're going to talk,

1070
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:55,380
on Friday we're meeting again and
we're meeting again about, um,

1071
01:14:56,750 --> 01:15:01,180
this time, it, it's about
efficient markets. Uh, and, uh,

1072
01:15:01,181 --> 01:15:04,960
I want to talk about the evidence
for efficient markets and against it.

1073
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:08,980
And that will lead you into your third
problem set, uh, about efficient markets.

1074
01:15:08,981 --> 01:15:10,330
But that's not coming for a little while.
