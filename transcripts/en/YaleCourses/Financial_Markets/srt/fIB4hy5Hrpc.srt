1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,470
I'm Bob Schiller.
Uh,

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,670
I have the pleasure of introducing
this a [inaudible] lecture. Uh,

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:09,150
Lawrence Lawrence Summers.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,750
I wanted to say first that the [inaudible]
lecture series was founded by an

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,260
anonymous donor in honor
of Arthur [inaudible],

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,440
who was professor of
economics here at Yale. Uh,

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:28,610
who later became a chairman of the Council
of Economic Advisers who founded with

8
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:31,470
William Brainerd,

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,500
the Brooking's papers on economic activity
and was widely admired both here at

10
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:38,820
Yale and,
uh,

11
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,090
around the world as an
economist that has a,

12
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,970
had a lot of impact on policy,
uh, economist with a purpose.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:48,721
Uh,

14
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:53,721
so it's altogether fitting that we have
Lawrence Summers here as our OE can

15
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:58,770
lecture for this year.
Uh, very summers. Um,

16
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,040
he'd go through his career briefly.

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,430
He started out at age 16
at MIT as a physics major.

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,140
Um, fortunately for us, he switched
into economics, uh, at an very,

19
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,930
as soon as a teenager.
Uh,

20
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,750
he got his PhD at Harvard. He, uh,

21
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,020
got tenure at Harvard at one of
the, he's one of the earliest, uh,

22
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:29,520
an aid at age 28. Um, in 1993,

23
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:34,610
he won the John Bates Clark Medal for
the best economist under the age of 40.

24
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,450
Uh, he joined the staff of the
Council of economic advisors.

25
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,160
He was under secretary of Treasury,
uh, for international affairs.

26
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,250
He was chief economist at the World Bank.

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,620
He was the US Secretary of Treasury.
Uh,

28
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,740
he was president of Harvard University.
Uh,

29
00:01:55,741 --> 00:02:00,741
and now he is a university professor at
Harvard and also a director at de Shaw.

30
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,190
His research, uh, has been truly stunning.

31
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:13,330
I say I've always been a huge admirer
of it and it covers many fields,

32
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,180
public finance, labor, macro
economics and finance in particular.

33
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,081
Uh,

34
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:24,081
I thought I would just conclude my
introduction with a couple of famous Larry

35
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,190
Summers quotes. Uh, this, these quotes
are advice to graduate students,

36
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:33,330
but they might as well be
advice to any researcher. Uh,

37
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,950
there he is quoted as saying,
uh,

38
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,690
you might as well work on big problems
because it takes just as much time to

39
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:46,320
write a paper on a little
problem as on a big problem.

40
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,360
Uh, and, uh, another bit
of advice to students,

41
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,610
um,
do your research on the economy,

42
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,160
not on the economic.

43
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,480
And so I think that that's
a bit of wise advice,

44
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:06,310
but I think that, uh, that, uh,

45
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,960
to me that says something about
the essence of his research style,

46
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:11,531
uh,

47
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:16,531
he's been extremely potent in his work
on very important results that kind of

48
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:22,320
shape our view of the world.
Uh, and I think that, uh,

49
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,860
it's this research style that is part
of the reason why he's been tapped for

50
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:29,950
such important physicians. So, uh,

51
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,160
I'm pleased to introduce Larry Summers.

52
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:39,250
[inaudible]

53
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,640
thank you Bob very much for that,
uh,

54
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,490
overly generous introduction.
Uh,

55
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,180
at least one thing he
said wasn't quite right.

56
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,220
It may or may not have been.

57
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:04,850
Economics is good luck
when I left physics,

58
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,300
but it was surely the good luck of
the physics profession when I left.

59
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,810
Uh,
physics.

60
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,233
Yes.

61
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:15,840
Just a minute.

62
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,960
I've got an elaborate
program of microphones they
wished me to turn on here.

63
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,933
How's that?

64
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,500
No, I just turned that one off.
Okay, good. Everybody happy?

65
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,323
Um,

66
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,850
I appreciated your generosity
in reflecting on the different,

67
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:47,330
uh,

68
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:52,330
sectors in which I'd had a chance
to work when I first moved from,

69
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,950
uh, the university to, uh, Washington.

70
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,570
People ask me,
well,

71
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:04,571
what's different about being a senior
treasury official from being a professor

72
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,460
at Harvard?
And I realized the answer,

73
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:14,060
that one was easy.
As a professor at Harvard,

74
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,070
the single worst thing you could do was
to sign your name to something you had

75
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:23,210
not written yourself. On the other
hand, in the Treasury Department,

76
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,590
it was a mark of effectiveness to
do so as frequently as possible.

77
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,750
And then I got back to Harvard and had
the honor of serving as its president.

78
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:37,751
And people ask me what was different
about the university from Washington.

79
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,510
And in those first months I gave an
answer that in retrospect seems slightly

80
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,810
breathtaking in its naive tay.
I said,

81
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,610
Washington is so political.
There's so much opposition.

82
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,140
University, it's very different from
that. We're all on the same side.

83
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,690
It is a real honor to be here at Yale
and it is a particular honor to deliver

84
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:10,520
the Arthur oaken lectures.

85
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,810
I am told that I first met art Okin when
I was one week old as he and my father

86
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:26,321
were close friends during the time when
they were assistant professors at a Yale

87
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,340
together.
And in fact,

88
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:36,341
I grew up until a certain age calling
him uncle art and I don't have many vivid

89
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:42,044
memories,

90
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,300
but I have a quite vivid memory and
I was able to go back and a place,

91
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:52,301
the year it was 1969 and art
delivered a set of lectures,

92
00:06:55,551 --> 00:07:00,080
probably a set of lectures like this one,
um, at the University of Pennsylvania.

93
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:05,710
And he stayed at our house and he stayed
up telling my parents a whole set of

94
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:13,100
stories about life as
an economist, uh, with,

95
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:18,140
uh, Lyndon Johnson, some of the
stories are a little too Raunchy, uh,

96
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,860
to, uh, repeat, uh, ray here.

97
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,310
But it was the first inkling I had that
this academic research stuff like my

98
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:33,611
parents did really could
have a very direct and real,

99
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:38,930
uh, impact on the policy
arena. I remember,

100
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:40,130
especially somehow,

101
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:43,460
I don't know what determines what makes
an impression on you when you're 15,

102
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,320
but a 14.

103
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:49,930
But my father telling me the
story of how there was a,

104
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,190
and I have no idea where
this story is actually true,

105
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:57,610
but the story he told was that there
was a publication that the Department of

106
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,210
Commerce published called BCD,

107
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,960
which stood for business cycle digest,

108
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,940
which compiled all the facts about the
business cycle and whether the economy

109
00:08:10,941 --> 00:08:13,220
was up or whether the economy was down,

110
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,240
but that because of all this stuff
that economists had figured out,

111
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,620
uh,
like art,

112
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,070
we now had these practical policies that
we could use so that when there was a

113
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:30,590
recession,
we'd stopped the recession from happening.

114
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,010
And when there was an excessive boom,
we'd smooth off the boom.

115
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,990
And so we didn't necessarily have to
have business cycles anymore. And so,

116
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,470
but we liked calling the publication BCD.

117
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,460
So art had had the clever idea
of renaming the publication,

118
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,790
the business conditions digest to
celebrate the success of a Keynesian

119
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,430
economics. Time went on. And the first,

120
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:00,264
um,

121
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,560
great success if there ever were any
great successes of my career as a graduate

122
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:11,100
student came when, uh,
Art Okin and George Perry,

123
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,060
um, invited, uh, Kim Clark.

124
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:20,450
And I to give what was the first
significant paper that I had written as a

125
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:25,620
graduate student on labor market
dynamics and unemployment at,

126
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:30,260
uh, the Brooking's papers
on economic activity, uh,

127
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,010
conference. And it was the, uh,

128
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:36,510
thrill of our young lives.

129
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,670
And it was also a vastly,
vastly better paper in the form in which,

130
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,450
uh, it was, uh, published, uh,

131
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:49,350
than it was in the form in which
it was originally written. Uh,

132
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,960
thanks to, uh, art.

133
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,790
And I have a final memory that pertains,
uh,

134
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,500
to art that also says something
about art. I remember, uh,

135
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,600
sometime in the early 1980s,
uh,

136
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,040
sitting at the lunch table
in the MIT faculty club,

137
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:12,690
and in a way that some of you who
know me won't find surprising,

138
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:17,691
I was a declaiming on various subjects
with a certain lack of reticence that

139
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,830
perhaps, uh, was not commensurate
with my lack of knowledge.

140
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,580
And I asserted some proposition.

141
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,570
And Paul Samuelson turned
to me and he said, Larry,

142
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,360
I just wrote a eulogy for Art
Oakland who died recently.

143
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,420
And I said that in all the years
that I had known art. Okay.

144
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:48,090
Art Okin had never said a stupid thing.
Well,

145
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:51,840
Larry,
now I won't be able to say that about you.

146
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,540
And one of the things that it gives me
particular pleasure in along with Greg

147
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,710
Mankiw taking over the editorship of,
uh,

148
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,510
the Brooking's papers on economic activity
from bill Brainard and George Perry,

149
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:16,800
who have done such a stellar
job for the last 25 years,

150
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,320
is the knowledge that it was a project,
uh,

151
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,730
that had been initiated by art.

152
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,690
It was a project that had been initiated
by art out of a conviction that I have

153
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:37,590
tried to live by in my career.

154
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:42,120
And that I hope in some
small way to illustrate, uh,

155
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,130
with my remarks, uh, here, uh,

156
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,420
today that serious economic thinking can
one understand the world much better.

157
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:03,750
That with the aid of the metaphors and
the models and the measurements to come

158
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:10,620
from serious economic,
uh,

159
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,810
thinking one can direct economic policies
in better and in more sensible ways.

160
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,930
And as a consequence,

161
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,130
the lives of very large numbers of people,
none of,

162
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:30,700
most of whom will never hear of
economics and certainly will not study.

163
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,700
It's details will in some way the
improved by having a higher incomes,

164
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,480
by facing less risk,

165
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,810
by being more secure as they go through,
uh,

166
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,110
their livelihoods.

167
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:53,250
And it's in that spirit that I want
to reflect today on some aspects of

168
00:12:55,751 --> 00:13:00,280
macroeconomic thinking and experience
and then some aspects of financial

169
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:05,281
thinking and experience and how
they bear on financial crisis.

170
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,790
And then tomorrow on the particular
financial crisis that we faced right now,

171
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,530
what has been done,
what may happen,

172
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:23,460
what should be done and what can be done
over the longer term to make the return

173
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:31,780
of such a crisis, more
important, more, uh, less, uh,

174
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,823
less likely.

175
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,750
Art was preoccupied through most of his
career with the central macro economic

176
00:13:40,901 --> 00:13:45,901
issue of assuring stable growth and
to use language that's perhaps a more

177
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,220
congenial to older than younger ears,

178
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,560
avoiding underemployment
and output, uh, gaps.

179
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,760
It's revealing that the journal he founded
was called the Brooking's papers on

180
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:05,761
economic activity suggesting a concern
with the cyclical performance of the

181
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:08,734
economy.

182
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,640
He surely as much as anyone would have
subscribed to Jim Tobin's famous dictum

183
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:22,170
that it takes a heap of
Harberger triangles to fill
an Okin in gap or that the

184
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:28,660
macro economic issues of recession
and depression are terribly,

185
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:33,220
terribly important relative
to the Microeconomic, uh,

186
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:38,310
efficiencies that are a preoccupation
of a very large number of economists.

187
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,770
This idea,

188
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:47,010
this first idea that oak
and gaps exist and are large

189
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:55,530
and very important relative to micro
economic inefficiencies is one that is

190
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,880
increasingly unfashionable,
uh,

191
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,940
today discussing them within the
context of what has been called.

192
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,820
Although I suppose it can't
be called that anymore.

193
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:15,350
The new classical macroeconomics
is almost impossible.

194
00:15:15,351 --> 00:15:17,780
There's no role for any kind of gap.

195
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:20,960
It's much like discussing epicycles,
uh,

196
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,320
with a modern astronomer.

197
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,610
But even within the Keynesian tradition,

198
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,540
the excepted versions of the Keynesian
model greatly circumscribe the scope for

199
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,870
what was arts major concern
under employment and,

200
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,600
uh,
the output gap.

201
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,590
Because if one thinks about the uh,

202
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,330
centerpiece of,
uh,

203
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,770
the supply side of any
macro economic model, um,

204
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,710
almost any macroeconomic model post,
uh,

205
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,660
1980 in some form or other,

206
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,350
it has the implication that,
uh,

207
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:17,410
the change in inflation is in some
way dependent on the output gap.

208
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:23,510
Perhaps it's the change in inflation,
perhaps even more problematically. Uh,

209
00:16:23,511 --> 00:16:28,160
it's the unexpected
component of inflation.

210
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:33,550
Perhaps the causation runs the other way
and the output gap is related to that

211
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:40,690
is caused by the change in
inflation or is caused by the,

212
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,650
uh, level of unexpected, uh, inflation.

213
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,080
Any equation,

214
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,440
any theory of output that has that
property has a simple consequence if you

215
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:59,390
aggregate it over a long period of time,

216
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,970
namely that if you look at the difference
between inflation at the end of the

217
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:09,971
period and inflation at the beginning
of the period or equivalently,

218
00:17:11,211 --> 00:17:15,290
if you look at the average
level of unexpected inflation,

219
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,910
which has to be zero,

220
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,280
it will relate to the size
of, uh, the output gap.

221
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,910
And therefore if one thinks of a
steady state as being a state in which

222
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:34,120
unexpected inflation averages zero or a
state in which the accelerate the change

223
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,850
in inflation average is zero.

224
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,720
You know what the output gap has,
uh,

225
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,760
got to be,
it has got to average zero.

226
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,850
This doesn't mean there's
no role for cyclical policy,

227
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,600
but it has the very strong
implication that what you gain,

228
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,240
um,

229
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,440
in the booms you lose in the recessions,

230
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,100
that if you have deeper recessions,
you will be able to have larger booms.

231
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:09,660
That if you have larger booms,

232
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:14,040
you will be able to have a show.
You will be,

233
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:18,690
you will be forced to
have a deeper recessions.

234
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,610
And in a sense,
if one accepts this idea,

235
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,420
the subject of cyclical fluctuations
in macroeconomics becomes an order of

236
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:36,600
magnitude less important than it was.

237
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,900
If one maintains some older idea in which
it's possible to have output gaps that

238
00:18:44,701 --> 00:18:49,530
are not offset by a subsequent,
uh,

239
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:51,360
gains in output.

240
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,800
To be sure and much has
been made of the point.

241
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,470
At a certain moments,

242
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:03,830
there may be some impact on nonlinear
of nonlinearity in the relationship

243
00:19:06,991 --> 00:19:11,190
between the gap and the change in
inflation or unexpected inflation.

244
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:15,500
If this relationship is a nonlinear,

245
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,900
then it's possible that
by running smoother,

246
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,060
a smoother economy, one can run
a somewhat higher pressure, uh,

247
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:24,923
economy.

248
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:30,410
But in a world where economy attritions
struggle to estimate any kind of a

249
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:35,370
Phillips curve, the idea that one
can measure with any precision,

250
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:40,730
a nonlinearity of this kind is
at the very least problematic.

251
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,280
And so ironically,

252
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,920
the Keynesian model as it came,
uh,

253
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,160
to evolve the Keynesian model that and
the Keynesian discussion that had as its

254
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:57,750
centerpiece,

255
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,340
the Phillips curve in some form,

256
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:07,990
in almost all of the forms in
which the Phillips Curve, uh, came,

257
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,880
was quite skeptical of the role of
macroeconomic policy in effecting average

258
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:20,760
levels of output through time.

259
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,750
Very little room for art Ocwens dedication
to closing output gaps or maintaining

260
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:33,561
a higher pressure economy as a way of
spurring economic growth or as a way of

261
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:40,530
promoting a more equal, uh, income, uh,

262
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,630
distribution
arts lab.

263
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,650
The last decade of arts professional
work was directed at a questions that in

264
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:54,580
one way or another, uh, relate, uh,

265
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,720
to, uh, these equations.

266
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:01,330
His final book was entitled,
uh,

267
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:06,390
prices and quantities and his dominant
professional preoccupation was,

268
00:21:07,301 --> 00:21:07,840
uh,

269
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,840
in his last years with how the rate of
inflation could be brought down with a

270
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:19,480
minimum level of the output gap with,
as he would have put it,

271
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,470
a minimum sacrifice,
a ratio.

272
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:29,730
It's not hard to understand why these
questions relating to inflation and

273
00:21:31,811 --> 00:21:32,644
output.

274
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,760
We're preoccupations of Arts juring his,
uh,

275
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,780
professional, uh, lifetime.

276
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:46,620
It's interesting to think
about a US business cycle,

277
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,920
uh,

278
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,920
history when people like me gave
talks about the economic outlook to a

279
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:58,240
nonacademic audiences.

280
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,930
A 15 or 20 years ago,

281
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,320
it was a considered a
cleverness to observe that
American economic expansions do

282
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:12,820
not die of old age.

283
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,360
They are murdered by the Federal
Reserve with inflation control as a,

284
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:22,900
the motive.
And if one thought about,

285
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:27,070
thinks about a universe of,
uh,

286
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,590
experience,
uh,

287
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,580
the three Eisenhower
recessions that were formative,

288
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,560
um, for, uh, art, although, uh,

289
00:22:38,561 --> 00:22:43,060
I believe the second of them
coincided with my birth. The, um,

290
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,410
1966,

291
00:22:44,411 --> 00:22:49,411
1967 economic downturn more conspicuously
the major downturns in 74 75 in the

292
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:57,280
wake of the oil supply
shock. And in 1980, 1982,

293
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:02,550
the Volcker disinflation these were
most of the experience we had with the

294
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:04,114
business cycle.

295
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,720
In a substantial swath
of economic history.

296
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,800
The economy expanded
in one way or another.

297
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:17,410
Inflation got out of control,

298
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:21,730
people got nervous about inflation.
The Fed hit the bar,

299
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:26,630
the Fed, uh, hit the brakes.
Interest rates spike,

300
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:31,570
the yield curve inverted the economy,

301
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:36,730
uh, slowed to be sure there
were great controversies,

302
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:39,550
uh, about, uh, how,

303
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,770
what exactly the mechanism was.

304
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:45,440
What was the role of credit rationing
in the housing sector versus higher

305
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:50,150
interest rates? To what extent did
the transmission mechanism take place,

306
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,390
uh, through, uh, Tobin's Q,

307
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,840
but if one asked what was
the cause of downturns?

308
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,200
The cause was monetary.

309
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,390
The accounts of business cycle historians,
uh,

310
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,910
who tracked events,
um,

311
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:15,620
were couched in those terms.

312
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:21,100
The enormously influential
monetary history of the
United States emphasized the

313
00:24:22,791 --> 00:24:27,530
role of monetary contractions
and of Federal Reserve,

314
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,730
uh,
Federal Reserve policies.

315
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,810
The academic issues of the day,

316
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,670
which focused quite critically on
the questions of price. Rigidity,

317
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:46,150
therefore led to a natural focus as
the canonical experiment of suppose you

318
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:49,160
reduce em the money stock,

319
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:53,780
what happens to the level of output in
the short run and why does that happen?

320
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:59,500
And so the prevailing view about business
cycles was that they were determined

321
00:25:00,561 --> 00:25:02,060
by monetary policy.

322
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:07,061
And what led to contractionary monetary
policy was either a mistake by the Fed

323
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,150
or a necessary action,
um,

324
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,320
by the Fed as inflation, uh, accelerated.

325
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,940
But it is interesting to contemplate that
if one looks before or after what one

326
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:27,410
might think of as,
uh,

327
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,620
the Okin period and tries to give a
simple account of what was behind the

328
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:40,400
business cycles, uh, that, uh, took place.

329
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:45,500
One offers a rather different,
uh,

330
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,990
kind of,
uh,

331
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:53,110
story 1907 is linked to a financial panic.

332
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:58,780
It couldn't have been caused by the
feds since the Fed. Uh, it didn't exist.

333
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,210
It didn't exist yet.

334
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,400
In 1929.

335
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:09,790
The actions of the Federal Reserve in
1928 or 1929 may or may not have been a

336
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,960
crucial causative factor,

337
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:20,180
but there's a reason they talk about
the stock market crash as a prelude,

338
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,320
uh, to, uh, the depression. Uh,

339
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:29,470
the dominant influences
were indogenous too,

340
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:32,900
or the workings of the financial system.

341
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:38,590
And if one thinks about the three most
recent instances of cyclical fluctuation

342
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,130
in, uh, the, uh, United in

343
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,640
the United in the United States,
um,

344
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:52,890
the 1990 1992 case can be debated.

345
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:57,450
There was an oil shock. There had been
some tightening of monetary policy,

346
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,840
but I think most observers would assign
a dominant influence to the problems in

347
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:09,051
the financial system associated with the
SNLs and the overextension of banks in

348
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,580
a real estate lending.

349
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,540
There's no question that almost any close
watcher if asked to say what was the

350
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:22,740
2001 recession about,

351
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:27,660
they would say bursting of
the technology bursting of,

352
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,000
uh,
the technology bubble.

353
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,770
And I'll have more to say about,
uh,

354
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,640
the 2008, um, uh,

355
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:42,560
recession a little later and,
uh,

356
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:47,440
tomorrow including some speculations on
the probability that there is one. Um,

357
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:52,670
but no one would say of the current
fluctuation that it reflected the Federal

358
00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,890
Reserve's excessive or necessary effort
to curb inflation in product a price

359
00:28:03,331 --> 00:28:04,860
markets rather,

360
00:28:04,861 --> 00:28:09,861
they would attribute it in one way or
another to something indogenous to uh,

361
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,010
the financial system.

362
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:19,080
The debates would turn on whether it was
best thought of in terms of a housing

363
00:28:19,081 --> 00:28:20,160
price bubble,

364
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:24,570
whether it was best thought of as a
matter having to do with the extension,

365
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,340
excessive extension of a sub,

366
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,260
uh,

367
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,920
pro of a subprime credit,

368
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,260
whether it was,
uh,

369
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:42,160
a reflection of a generalized
excessive complacency, uh,

370
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:46,110
in credit markets that led to the
extension of financial institutions.

371
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:49,160
All of those questions could,
uh,

372
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:54,470
be debated but no serious dispute about,

373
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,220
uh,

374
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,220
the proposition that he
came out of the workings of,

375
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,330
uh,
the financial system.

376
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:09,410
And so with this history before us in
thinking about macro economic policy and

377
00:29:14,191 --> 00:29:17,220
in thinking about cyclical fluctuations,

378
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,760
it seems to me appropriate that we
at least consider redirecting some

379
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:31,190
macroeconomic attention from traditional
preoccupations with the price setting

380
00:29:31,381 --> 00:29:32,214
process,

381
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:37,610
the Phillips curve and disinflation
to more traditional Keynesian,

382
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,300
uh,

383
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,930
preoccupations with the workings
of the financial system,

384
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,150
uh, with, uh,

385
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:50,470
animal spirits with a,
if you like,

386
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,680
shocks to the I s curve that come out
of the workings of the financial system.

387
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,273
It,

388
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:05,700
this view I would suggest is certainly
confirmed by less detailed reflection on

389
00:30:10,061 --> 00:30:11,920
international experience.

390
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:17,610
If one thinks about the two most dramatic
OEC macro economic events of the last

391
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:23,730
20 years, they are almost certain oes,
excuse me, presidents, the Deo, uh,

392
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:28,030
permanent OACD, uh, member
events. So I exclude,

393
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:32,610
uh, the drama of which, uh, you are a, uh,

394
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:37,090
you are so central. Um,
uh, yeah, me too. Uh,

395
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,010
so Centra,
so central a part,

396
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,360
they were almost certainly the Japanese,
uh,

397
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:51,930
financial crisis followed by depression
in the 1990s and the dramatic declines

398
00:30:54,371 --> 00:30:58,810
in output associated with the failure
of the banking system to the point where

399
00:30:58,811 --> 00:31:03,580
it needed to be nationalized
in the Nordic countries in, uh,

400
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,260
the early 1990s.

401
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:12,730
Indeed,
it is interesting to note

402
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,190
that in recent years,
uh,

403
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,140
financial crises have a,

404
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,310
become a pervasive one
always remembers the, uh,

405
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,590
comments one makes about
economic fluctuations that
prove to be pressured and

406
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:35,680
forgets the ones that prove
to have been completely wrong.

407
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,980
And I am no exception.
Uh,

408
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:43,981
so I will recall that I was fond of
observing in 2005 and 2006 that if one

409
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:50,530
looked at the last, uh, 20 years,

410
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:55,120
there had been six, uh, six or seven,

411
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,420
six major, uh, financial crises,

412
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,080
the 1987 stock market crash,

413
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:06,820
the 1990 savings and loan,
uh, real estate crash,

414
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:11,620
the 1995, uh, Mexican, uh,

415
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:16,630
crash. Some would argue that
if this is a u s list, um,

416
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,320
that Mexico doesn't belong,
one could have that argument.

417
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,970
The 1997 Asian financial crisis,
the,

418
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:30,010
uh, events associated
with Ltcm and Russia that,

419
00:32:30,011 --> 00:32:34,150
uh, President Clinton and
Secretary Ruben at the time, uh,

420
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,680
labeled the most serious financial
crisis since the Second World War,

421
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:43,430
since the Second World War and the 2001,

422
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,580
um, financial crisis associated with, uh,

423
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:52,460
the bursting of the tech bubble
problems in the high yield sector,

424
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,210
um, of where the subsequent, uh,

425
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:01,130
problems in capital markets, uh,
exemplified by what happened,

426
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,070
uh, at, uh, [inaudible].

427
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,480
It is interesting to ask the question
whether there is some relation between all

428
00:33:15,841 --> 00:33:20,841
of these events because what
I've suggested so far is
that if one distinguishes

429
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:28,270
the last generation from the preceding
a generation in the proceeding

430
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:34,520
generation,
financial crises were relatively rare.

431
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:39,920
Business cycles were caused by
the Federal Reserve eliminating,

432
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:40,640
uh,

433
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,640
Federal Reserve's concern about
inflation for the last generation.

434
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:50,690
Um, business cycles have
been associated with, uh,

435
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,170
financial,
uh,

436
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:57,430
crisis and the Federal Reserve has not
caused downturns through its concern with

437
00:34:01,401 --> 00:34:06,260
inflation. How were
these events, uh, linked?

438
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:10,940
I'm not entirely, uh, sure. Uh,

439
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:14,660
sitting in the Brooking's papers
meetings for all these years,

440
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:18,470
I've learned how bill
Nordhaus is hard to satisfy a,

441
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:23,450
sometimes people have t statistics of
three and bill pronounces them to be quote

442
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:26,270
unquote Darwinian,
um,

443
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,700
and reflecting the data
mining of the author.

444
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:32,510
And on other occasions they
have only a few observations,

445
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,920
in which case they're deemed to have
committed one observation, a econometrics.

446
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,240
I'm going to commit about
four observation, uh,

447
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:45,270
econometrics and offer the hypothesis
that the right way to understand,

448
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:49,880
uh,

449
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,880
this pattern is that we achieved that,

450
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,530
uh,
arts generation.

451
00:34:57,531 --> 00:35:02,531
And then Paul Volcker achieved
a hugely important thing.

452
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,400
They achieved a measure of credibility
and commitment to non-inflationary

453
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,920
monetary policies that enabled inflation
expectations to be kept in check.

454
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:30,550
And that just as success in
curing infectious disease
leads there to be far more

455
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:39,731
cancer than there was before infectious
disease was brought in check.

456
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:46,130
So to the achievement
of disinflation leads,

457
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:50,840
uh, to an economy, uh,

458
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:56,050
in which expansions are
enabled to continue until
they lead to the complacency

459
00:36:00,751 --> 00:36:05,700
in confidence associated, uh, with, uh,

460
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,990
financial, uh, crisis. Perhaps, uh,

461
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:13,670
we will have 6% inflation two years
from now and the Fed will cause a risk.

462
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,700
Fed will find it necessary to engineer
a recession in this theory will fall

463
00:36:18,811 --> 00:36:20,370
completely by the wayside.

464
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:24,330
Perhaps there is an alternative,

465
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,460
more compelling, uh, explanation, uh,

466
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,350
for this pattern.

467
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:35,370
But for now I would have dues,
uh,

468
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:40,430
the hypothesis that the
increased incidents of
financial crisis and the closer

469
00:36:46,051 --> 00:36:51,051
relationship between financial crisis
and economic downturns is a byproduct of

470
00:36:55,771 --> 00:37:00,771
our success in achieving low and credible,

471
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,580
uh,

472
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:06,090
inflation and the associated great,

473
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:11,040
uh, moderation whether or not,

474
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,720
um, we can, um,

475
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:21,230
except that idea as to why a financial
crisis seems to have been the cause of

476
00:37:26,401 --> 00:37:29,940
previous recessions where
it was not previously.

477
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,870
The empirical observation,
uh,

478
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:39,020
stands that financial crises are frequent
and that not infrequently when there

479
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:46,560
is a financial crisis,

480
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:52,070
it leads to some
significant disruption in,

481
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,950
uh, real, uh, economic activity.

482
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
It follows that the causes
of a financial crisis,

483
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:10,070
the policy response to a financial crisis
need to occupy a larger part of our

484
00:38:14,701 --> 00:38:18,810
consideration of macroeconomics. Then, uh,

485
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:23,730
they have, uh, uh, then, uh, they have,

486
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,450
uh,

487
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:29,450
traditionally I should
suggest also that this is,

488
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:35,961
this conclusion is reinforced by

489
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:42,390
the observation that whereas disinflation
recession lends itself very much to

490
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:50,890
the unfortunate conservation argument
I presented at the beginning,

491
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,550
uh, that suggested that, uh,

492
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:59,820
you couldn't really alter the output
gap over long periods of time if you did

493
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:04,900
not want to accept changes in inflation.

494
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:10,740
It is easy to understand financial
crisis and the associated downturns and

495
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:16,110
output as a reduction in aggregate
supply and therefore highly plausible to

496
00:39:17,141 --> 00:39:22,141
believe that the better management of
financial crisis or the prevention of

497
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:29,370
financial crisis will lead not
just to a smoother path of output,

498
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:37,530
but a path that by avoiding downturns
has a higher average over long periods of

499
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:44,341
time and therefore is more successful
in achieving the goal that aren't

500
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:49,840
[inaudible] and Jim
Tobin and Yale for many,

501
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:54,841
many years set a four
macro economic policy of,

502
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:00,030
uh, raising the average, uh,

503
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:03,430
level of, uh, output.

504
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,040
Now, discussions of a
financial crisis, um,

505
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:14,210
tend to have the character of a accident.
Uh,

506
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:18,250
investigations.
There are many different suspects,

507
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:23,170
great numbers of details.
Our mustard, uh, to tell, uh,

508
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,690
the, uh, story.

509
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:30,691
There are always particular
words associated with
particular financial crises.

510
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:36,211
One talks about portfolio insurance in
the context of the 1987 crash when talks

511
00:40:37,211 --> 00:40:41,890
about a test to Bono's in
the context of, uh, the,

512
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:45,190
uh, Mexican experience.
One talks about bubbles,

513
00:40:45,191 --> 00:40:50,110
psychology in the context of
the Nass of the Nasdaq, uh,

514
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:53,620
experience. One uses the
t one speaks about, uh,

515
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:58,510
the vicissitudes of the separation
between the originators and the owners of

516
00:40:58,511 --> 00:41:01,300
mortgages. In talking about, uh,

517
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:05,710
the current subprime mortgage crisis,

518
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:11,190
it all brings to mind a Tolstoy's
observation that every happy family is the

519
00:41:11,771 --> 00:41:16,771
same and every unhappy family
is a miserable I in its own way.

520
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,810
And it is all correct or
not all of it is correct.

521
00:41:25,811 --> 00:41:29,980
But in each of, uh, the, uh,

522
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,390
crises,

523
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:36,720
there are important elements
of institutional detail of
particular practice that

524
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:43,790
explain how the story played out, uh, in,

525
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,120
uh, the way, uh, that it did.

526
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:53,230
But I want to suggest that there is some
common structure that lie behind the

527
00:41:57,351 --> 00:42:02,270
various phenomena that are
associated with a financial crisis.

528
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,720
The understanding of which can
at least help us to think about,

529
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:12,830
uh, the mechanism of
crisis and perhaps, uh,

530
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:16,520
the appropriate, uh, policy, uh,

531
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:21,550
responses for thinking
about financial crises.

532
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:22,400
Uh,

533
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,400
economics has a classic metaphor that
captures a many elements of the problem.

534
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,150
It's a set of ideas that,
uh,

535
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:40,360
go back at least to Badgett in economic
history and are known to current

536
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:47,240
economic theorists as a diamond did Vig,

537
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,920
uh,
phenomena.

538
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,330
And the idea is simple,

539
00:42:53,331 --> 00:42:56,150
powerful and uh,
incomplete.

540
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:59,120
Imagine a bank,

541
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:03,410
the bank takes deposits,

542
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:09,280
the deposits can be withdrawn
at any moment or at least
can be withdrawn at high

543
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:11,864
frequency.

544
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,680
It takes the deposits and it
lends the money for projects.

545
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:22,910
The projects have a higher rate of return,

546
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:27,200
then the deposits do.

547
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:32,980
But the projects take some significant
time to complete and there is no market

548
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:39,260
for a half finished project.

549
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:46,100
Think about that financial institution,

550
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:51,910
perhaps it also chooses to keep a
portion of its deposits on hand.

551
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:55,220
I in a cash,

552
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,310
a moment's reflection on,
uh,

553
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,520
that financial institution,
um,

554
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:09,700
will cause you to recognize that it
is subject to multiple equilibrium.

555
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:19,570
If everyone believes that
the bank will remain healthy,

556
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:25,490
the bank will in fact remain healthy.

557
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,480
Depositors all can be paid back.

558
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:32,070
The project will be completed.

559
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,130
The bank shareholders are better off.

560
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,670
The of the depositors are better off.

561
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:44,030
The entrepreneurs who have been lent
money for their projects are better off.

562
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:50,570
It is a nash equilibrium
and everyone is better off.

563
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,690
It is not.
However,

564
00:44:55,050 --> 00:45:00,050
the only Nash equilibrium a
moment's thought will also
cause you to realize that

565
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:09,741
if everyone else is taking
their money out of the bank,

566
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,800
then you are well advised to take your
money out of the bank as soon as you can

567
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,500
because the bank is not going to be
able to pay off all of the claims on it.

568
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,900
And so a solvent bank is subject
to self fulfilling prophecy.

569
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:43,490
It can either remain solvent or it can uh,

570
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:47,790
fail depending upon the state,

571
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:53,120
not just of expectations but
in a manner much like canes,

572
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,510
beauty contest,

573
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:59,340
expectations of others expectations.

574
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:04,341
If I expect that you expect that tn
expects that the bank is going to fail and

575
00:46:05,761 --> 00:46:07,680
that he is going to withdraw money,

576
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:13,220
then the safer thing for me
to do is to withdraw money.

577
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,240
If one wants a simple theory of why,

578
00:46:18,241 --> 00:46:23,241
if you go to any American town and you
look for the most solidly built building

579
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,810
with the most impressive facade,

580
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:35,490
it will be a building that
was used as a bank. Um,

581
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,520
particularly if it was constructed
before the era of deposit insurance.

582
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:46,310
It is precisely this notion of multiple
equilibrium that explains why banks more

583
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:54,531
than other institutions are at such pains
to project credibility and to project

584
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,310
a permanence.

585
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,960
Notice that this metaphor is very powerful
and is very suggestive of a case for

586
00:47:09,301 --> 00:47:14,301
activism because it suggests that there
are multiple possibilities to which the

587
00:47:16,801 --> 00:47:19,200
free market will be subject.

588
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:25,010
It suggests that if
coordination can be achieved,

589
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:30,710
there are possibilities that are
unambiguously better for everyone and

590
00:47:32,321 --> 00:47:37,321
possibilities that are worse for everyone
and it suggests a natural role for

591
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,000
government as a coordinator or as
a guarantor in favor of the better

592
00:47:50,111 --> 00:47:50,944
equilibrium.

593
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:57,180
Now to be sure the more
rigorous and skeptical,

594
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:00,160
uh, among, uh,

595
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:05,161
among you will have noticed that I slipped
and important issue by in telling the

596
00:48:08,801 --> 00:48:09,634
story,

597
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,240
I said quickly that there was no
market for unfinished projects.

598
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:22,710
It's hard to understand why if it's a
certainty that all unfinished projects are

599
00:48:23,021 --> 00:48:24,460
going to succeed.

600
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:28,120
And it's a certainty that
when they do succeed,

601
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:32,320
the bank will have more money
and have enough money to pay off.

602
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,560
It's, uh, depositors.

603
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:40,710
Why there will not be some
profit maximizing actor
who is prepared to come in

604
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,830
and buy those unfinished,
uh,

605
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,960
projects and in the process
make the depositors hole.

606
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:54,750
And so in the language that is always
used in talking frequently used in,

607
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:01,540
uh, talking about, uh, financial, uh,

608
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,110
financial, uh, crisis,

609
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:10,470
it's hard to understand how you can have
a liquidity problem without at least

610
00:49:11,291 --> 00:49:14,830
the possibility of a solvency problem.

611
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:19,630
And once you have the possibility
of a solvency problem,

612
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:25,020
it becomes less clear just how much
you're making everybody better off by

613
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:32,220
lending the money or by allowing the
projects to be partially completed.

614
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:38,560
Nonetheless,
this liquidity nonetheless,

615
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:43,740
this diamond did vague bank run metaphor
has been very powerful in influencing

616
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,280
financial policy in a wide range of,

617
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:55,090
uh,
situations.

618
00:49:55,630 --> 00:50:00,630
It was this idea that
was the justification,

619
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:07,960
albeit without mentioning diamond
or did figs name that, uh,

620
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:13,560
Secretary Rubin and I used in explaining
to President Clinton why it was

621
00:50:14,921 --> 00:50:19,810
important that we support Mexico in,

622
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:24,080
uh, 19, uh, nine in, uh,

623
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,280
1995 and in countless other efforts
of what their supporters call support

624
00:50:32,991 --> 00:50:37,610
programs and their
opponents call bailouts in,

625
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,510
uh, financial history when, uh,

626
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,600
institutions or,
uh,

627
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:48,670
countries or individuals in Diskin
financial distress we're provided with

628
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:50,930
support.

629
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:56,480
The concept of it's a liquidity problem.

630
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:01,720
So by providing support we can coordinate
around the positive equilibrium was,

631
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:06,170
uh,
invoked.

632
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,400
So this idea of a bank run or a set of
bank runs and the provision of support

633
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:21,580
provides a powerful way of
thinking about a destructive gap,

634
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:24,530
increasing financial crisis.

635
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:30,050
And it certainly fits a
variety of situations. Uh,

636
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,160
the situation that Mexico faced in 19,
uh,

637
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:35,390
85,

638
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:40,630
perhaps the situation that a bear
Stearns faced several weeks ago,

639
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,800
certainly the situation that the Fed
was concerned about that has led it to

640
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:54,191
provide financial support in the form
of backstop facilities of many kinds to,

641
00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:00,380
uh, many, uh, financial institutions.

642
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:06,820
But it does not really address or seem
in an obvious way to apply to many of the

643
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:15,680
financial crises that, uh, we observe.

644
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,500
Many of the financial
crises that we observe,

645
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:23,501
think of the 1987 crash or think about
events in the housing market or mortgage

646
00:52:23,691 --> 00:52:27,620
market today involve freely traded assets.

647
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,970
They don't involve banks,

648
00:52:28,971 --> 00:52:33,140
they don't seem to involve a bank runs.

649
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,570
What I'd like to suggest,

650
00:52:35,571 --> 00:52:40,520
and I can only suggest
this in an imprecise way,

651
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:43,310
is that an important sense?

652
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,640
There is a broad class of behavior that
goes on in speculative markets that is

653
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:55,230
in its character, very similar to, uh,

654
00:52:55,310 --> 00:53:00,310
the character of a bank run.

655
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,960
One way of thinking about,
uh,

656
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:10,210
that a bank run is to think about the
value that you associate with a deposit

657
00:53:16,851 --> 00:53:21,080
claim on the bank in question.

658
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:26,550
There's this troubled, there's this
bank in normal times I have a $1

659
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:30,600
deposit.
The deposit is worth $1.

660
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,650
That's $1 deposit. It's
worth $1. That's easy.

661
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:40,520
Now imagine that the price of that
deposit falls because there comes to be a

662
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:50,721
question whether that bank is going to
succeed or whether that bank is going to

663
00:53:53,191 --> 00:53:58,191
fail or for that matter that the price
of that claim falls because of doubts

664
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:06,480
about the solvency of uh,
the bank.

665
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:12,680
Do I as a depositor wished to put more
deposits into the bank because the price

666
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:14,993
has fallen?

667
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:20,800
We're do I wish to sell my
claim as rapidly as I can?

668
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:24,690
If you think about it for a minute,

669
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:30,110
the situations in which the value
of deposits are falling are the very

670
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:35,931
situations in which you are most
eager to sell those deposits.

671
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,600
Back to,
uh,

672
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:43,130
the bank to go back to,
uh,

673
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,080
economics is a standby.

674
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:51,890
The most basic idea that we teach
freshmen and egg that we teach freshmen in

675
00:54:54,151 --> 00:54:58,350
economics is a,
the law of supply and demand,

676
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,920
the stabilizing nature of markets
markets as a negative feedback mechanism.

677
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,410
We tell the story in lots of
ways. There's a surplus. Uh,

678
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:11,560
there's a,
uh,

679
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:17,030
there's a surplus of apples
when there's a surplus of,

680
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:23,400
uh, when there's a, when
there's a surplus of, uh,

681
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,500
apples,
uh,

682
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:30,560
the price falls and then there is
demand increases and then there isn't a

683
00:55:30,691 --> 00:55:35,250
surplus of apples anymore. There's a
shortage of apples. The price rises,

684
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,180
then there isn't a shortage,

685
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:40,710
then there isn't a
shortage of apples anymore.

686
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,280
And our basic image of the economic
system is as a self equilibrating a system

687
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:53,420
with a single equilibrium
that is determined by that
law of supply and demand.

688
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:02,510
If the demand curve
slopes in the wrong way,

689
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:10,040
if a falling price leads to less demand
or equivalent and the two more supply,

690
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:21,330
then none of our normal intuitions,
uh,

691
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:26,380
work price falls in response,

692
00:56:26,710 --> 00:56:29,190
uh, to, uh,

693
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:34,260
excess demand and rises in response
to excess supply magnifying,

694
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:38,230
uh,
the excess.

695
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,220
If there's a single equilibrium,
it can be unstable.

696
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:48,120
If the demand curve has the more exotic
shape that goes with some people,

697
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:53,920
uh, responding to, uh, price,

698
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:54,581
uh,

699
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:59,581
over some range by reducing demand
and others responding by increasing,

700
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:04,180
uh, demand. Then there
are other possibilities.

701
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:08,050
I draw here a diagram
that's been produced, uh,

702
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:12,210
many times in many
different, uh, contexts. Uh,

703
00:57:12,610 --> 00:57:17,260
where you engage in the intellectual
exercise of this is complicated.

704
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:19,030
This is wild.
This is really crazy.

705
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,570
Let's think of a reason why the
demand curve could have both slopes.

706
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:26,560
Let's suppose that sometimes it has the
normal slope and sometimes it has the

707
00:57:26,561 --> 00:57:31,210
other than if it fits together in the
right way. There can be two equilibria.

708
00:57:31,211 --> 00:57:34,660
One good and one bad.

709
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:39,280
And one could clearly
proliferate examples of uh,

710
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,413
this kind.

711
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:46,260
So if there is a mechanism present
more generally in financial markets,

712
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:54,390
that causes the price of,

713
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,490
uh,
the,

714
00:57:55,490 --> 00:58:00,490
the demand for financial
assets to increase with a
price were to decrease with,

715
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:09,720
uh, supply, uh, or to, or to,

716
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,820
or causes,
um,

717
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:16,360
a demand to decrease as price falls.

718
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:21,780
Then one has the possibility
of instability that has
very much the character of

719
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:25,450
the bank run.

720
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:31,180
Is this a reasonable hypothesis,

721
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:35,320
uh, to, uh, main, uh,

722
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:39,490
to maintain, uh, this brings us,

723
00:58:39,491 --> 00:58:44,491
and I will not dwell on this at any
length to a broad set of issues,

724
00:58:46,031 --> 00:58:48,970
uh, associated, uh,

725
00:58:49,210 --> 00:58:54,020
with a behavioral, uh, finance, uh,

726
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:55,870
like Bob Schiller.

727
00:58:56,320 --> 00:59:01,320
I was very struck when I encountered the
assertion of Mike Jensen and others in

728
00:59:02,891 --> 00:59:07,891
the late 1970s that the efficient market
hypothesis was the best established

729
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:11,980
fact in, uh, the social
sciences. By the way,

730
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:16,690
that didn't necessarily mean that
it was a well established a fact.

731
00:59:16,930 --> 00:59:21,290
Um, but as Jensen, uh, used the term, uh,

732
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:22,790
that was its meaning.
And I,

733
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:27,020
I have to say that as I make that
remark about social sciences,

734
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,150
I'm reminded of,
um,

735
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:33,710
the observation somebody wants to offered
that if you have to call it science,

736
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,640
it isn't, um, cognitive science,

737
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:42,560
Christian science, political
science, social science,

738
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:47,990
social science.
And so I have ever since hearing that,

739
00:59:47,991 --> 00:59:51,530
never used the term economic science,
uh,

740
00:59:51,531 --> 00:59:56,390
to refer to, to refer to any, uh,

741
00:59:56,810 --> 01:00:00,980
phenomenon.
These issues were crystallized,

742
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:04,460
uh, for, uh, for me,

743
01:00:04,461 --> 01:00:08,320
I had followed a Bob's,
uh,

744
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:13,360
Bob's work on a excess volatility and
tried to contribute some of my own on the,

745
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,040
uh,
power of a statistical tests.

746
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:24,370
And I was struck by the bitterness
of the controversies that surrounded,

747
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:26,150
um,
uh,

748
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:30,530
Bob's working on excess volatility in
particular were so many in finance,

749
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:35,770
seems to regard a tax on the efficient
market hypothesis in rather than the way

750
01:00:35,901 --> 01:00:40,490
they would regard attacks
on their spouses. Um, or,

751
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,470
uh, children that, uh,

752
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:46,370
called for not just a
rational rejoinder, but, uh,

753
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:50,050
some effort at the destruction of,
uh,

754
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,190
the assailant.

755
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,880
But I remember that my sense of the issue
and the merits where my sympathies had

756
01:01:01,161 --> 01:01:02,400
always been,
uh,

757
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:07,660
with Bob crystallized in the summer
of 1987 and the summer of 1987,

758
01:01:09,621 --> 01:01:12,140
there were a certain set of
facts that were very clear.

759
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:17,770
It was very clear in the summer of 1987
that if you divided stock prices by any

760
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:21,590
interesting denominator,

761
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:27,380
they were at an extraordinarily
high level earnings.

762
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:31,430
Give it in sales, GNP.
If you were at Yale,

763
01:01:31,431 --> 01:01:32,990
the value of the kappa,

764
01:01:32,991 --> 01:01:36,380
that you added the debt and you divided
by the value of the capital stock,

765
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:40,040
it didn't matter all denominators.
Uh,

766
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:42,350
stock prices were extraordinarily high.

767
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:48,700
And then the question was how
to interpret that observation.

768
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:55,760
And there were two
interpretations on offer.

769
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:02,020
One was the conventional interpretation
that would have seemed the only

770
01:02:06,381 --> 01:02:10,430
plausible interpretation to
anyone who read the newspaper,

771
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:16,300
which was that stocks have been going
great and a lot of people wanted to buy

772
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:22,151
stock and therefore they all tried to
buy stock and there are only so was so

773
01:02:22,471 --> 01:02:26,100
much stock and the price went up

774
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:31,500
and as a consequence
of the price going up,

775
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:36,830
it was probably true that the return going
forward was going to be lower than it

776
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:42,180
had been before the price went up.

777
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:48,470
That was one interpretation that seemed
the obvious and natural interpretation.

778
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:55,880
You alternative interpretation
was that for some reason,

779
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:02,270
people who used to demand 8%
expected returns to buy stocks,

780
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:09,240
we're now demand had somehow had decided
for some reason that they'd really be

781
01:03:09,241 --> 01:03:10,400
justice,
that they'd really be,

782
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:14,460
they used to demand 8% to buy stocks
given the risk. But all of a sudden,

783
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:18,450
for whatever reason, and the reason
was never spelled out with any clarity,

784
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:23,960
they now we're happy to accept a 6% rate
of return and therefore all the future

785
01:03:24,421 --> 01:03:27,390
dividends and all the future earnings
were discounted at a lower level.

786
01:03:28,770 --> 01:03:30,900
So there was an a way,

787
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:34,590
a simple intuition for
deciding what you believed.

788
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:40,550
Did you believe that returns were low
because stock prices were high or did you

789
01:03:41,941 --> 01:03:46,830
believe that stock prices were high
because people had decided they were

790
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:51,330
perfectly content with low returns?
Well,

791
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:56,100
it was an easy way to distinguish those
hypotheses. And Bob did it at the time,

792
01:03:56,610 --> 01:03:59,850
which was to ask people what
returns they were expecting,

793
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,400
what returns they were settling for.

794
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,940
And the answer suggested that if anything,

795
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:11,540
they favored high returns rather than
they expected higher returns than they had

796
01:04:13,861 --> 01:04:18,090
previously. Not Lower returns
than they had previously.

797
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:21,690
Why do I dwell on all of this?

798
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:27,500
Because it is a first example of what I
actually think are substantial variety

799
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,410
of mechanisms,

800
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:37,100
all of which can produce this kind of
positive feedback behavior in a financial

801
01:04:40,261 --> 01:04:45,060
markets. The first and easiest
mechanism for understanding,

802
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:49,950
um, why, uh, there will be

803
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:55,170
positive feedback behavior or equivalently
a decline in demand is price falls

804
01:04:55,331 --> 01:05:00,331
and an increase in price and demand
as price rises is the extrapolate of

805
01:05:00,761 --> 01:05:03,610
expectations that come
from recent experiences.

806
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:08,440
One of the things I learned painfully
being involved with managing the dollar as

807
01:05:08,441 --> 01:05:12,280
secretary of the Treasury was
there is absolutely no way,

808
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:16,390
no matter how powerful you are,
and no matter how clever you are,

809
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:20,050
that the dollar can be
lower without falling.

810
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:26,100
It cannot happen no matter how much you
want to have a falling dollar with low

811
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,960
dollar without a falling dog.

812
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:34,470
And in just the same way a rising stock
price leads to a higher stock price.

813
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:42,990
And therefore if people demand
more after increases in price,

814
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:47,590
they are demanding more as price rises.

815
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:53,400
That's one mechanism through which
there can be positive feedback is second

816
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:58,780
mechanism, which Bob has put
considerable emphasis on, uh,

817
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,900
in, uh, his, uh,

818
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:06,610
writing is a social contagion.
Uh,

819
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:11,680
it's, people persuade other people.
People look at other people basically.

820
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:14,950
Uh, the bubbles psychology, uh,

821
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:19,510
takes hold as a social dynamic,
uh,

822
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:22,420
not necessarily related,
uh,

823
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:27,600
to any rational assessment of
the future behavior of markets.

824
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:35,190
A third mechanism is a one that
can easily be given a rational,

825
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:41,860
uh, explanation. I am the risk manager.

826
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:43,990
John is a trader.

827
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:48,400
I don't actually know whether
John knows anything or not. Uh,

828
01:06:48,401 --> 01:06:50,800
he says he does and,
but,

829
01:06:50,801 --> 01:06:55,270
and he's got a complicated story and
I can't quite tell how much he knows.

830
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,720
He just lost a lot of money.

831
01:07:00,370 --> 01:07:05,370
Should I have more confidence in John
or should I have less confidence in John

832
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,990
knowing that he lost a lot,
that he just lost?

833
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:15,040
Um, a, a lot of money?

834
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:18,580
Probably I should have less confidence,
uh,

835
01:07:18,581 --> 01:07:22,900
in John and as an empirical,
uh,

836
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:27,880
proposition, his risk manager
will have less confidence,

837
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:31,270
uh, in, uh, John.

838
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:36,570
And so positions that do not succeed
have less capital associated with them.

839
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:42,490
Then positions that do succeed.
Again,

840
01:07:42,790 --> 01:07:47,300
creating this kind of positive,
uh,

841
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,333
feedback.

842
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:53,140
A fourth mechanism that will create a,

843
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,730
this kind of, uh, positive, uh,

844
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:59,710
feedback,
uh,

845
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:04,270
derives from a leverage.

846
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:10,680
Anyone who buys on margin or any
financial institution that has a capital

847
01:08:13,481 --> 01:08:15,920
requirement,
when

848
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:17,750
they lose money,

849
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:23,690
there is a margin call or a need,

850
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:27,500
uh, to uh, generate, uh,

851
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:32,530
capital which can lead
to the liquidation of,

852
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:35,150
uh,
the,

853
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:40,070
that can lead to the
liquidation of positions.

854
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:45,290
Again, falling price, more, uh, selling

855
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:51,620
a fifth example and a fifth source of,

856
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,590
uh, positive, uh,

857
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:58,190
feedback comes,
uh,

858
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:00,620
from uh,

859
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:05,680
what one might think of
as a model uncertainty.

860
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:11,720
There are different ways to tell the
story and I suspect it could be given much

861
01:09:11,721 --> 01:09:15,730
more rigorous formalization.
Uh, then I'm going to, uh,

862
01:09:15,950 --> 01:09:20,950
attempt here a prominent macro economist
early in his career developed on the

863
01:09:22,551 --> 01:09:27,551
basis of some macro economic model that
he had a extremely strong view that the

864
01:09:29,751 --> 01:09:34,751
British pound was going to
depreciate with great excitement.

865
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:43,450
He found an older colleague who had a
broker called the broker and explained

866
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:51,970
that he wished to place an order in the
futures market to sell the pound short.

867
01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:02,480
The broker said,
okay,

868
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:06,800
I've got your order.
What would you like your stop loss to be?

869
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,113
Yeah.

870
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:13,470
The young macro economist said,

871
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:14,850
what's that?

872
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:19,650
The broker explained that it was normal,

873
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,920
that when you placed a position in
case the position moved against you,

874
01:10:25,740 --> 01:10:29,820
since you didn't want to lose too much
money and if the position moved against

875
01:10:29,821 --> 01:10:29,941
you,

876
01:10:29,941 --> 01:10:34,020
it might signal that you didn't understand
this and things weren't playing out

877
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:37,800
according to your theory of the
case that you might want to sell.

878
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:41,070
The macro economists said,
Hell No.

879
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:43,740
If it goes up 5%,

880
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:49,160
I want to buy a lot more young
macro economists did not have had,

881
01:10:49,891 --> 01:10:50,160
uh,

882
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:54,870
went on to have a very
distinguished career as a
macro economist but rather less

883
01:10:54,871 --> 01:10:59,430
distinguished career as a speculator.

884
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:03,600
If I asked you,
um,

885
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:08,580
in what way would you like to place a,

886
01:11:08,581 --> 01:11:12,420
you had some, you have some
conviction, you've got some idea, uh,

887
01:11:12,421 --> 01:11:14,060
that the end going to go up at the end

888
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:15,150
is going to go down something.

889
01:11:15,151 --> 01:11:19,950
Let's suppose it's that the yen
is going to go up and I say,

890
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:25,580
would you rather buy yen and take your
chances at the end might go up or the end

891
01:11:26,341 --> 01:11:31,341
Mica Dam or would you rather
buy an option on the yen?

892
01:11:32,540 --> 01:11:37,050
If you buy an option on the end,
then there's no way,

893
01:11:37,051 --> 01:11:40,820
no matter what happens that you can lose
more than the amount that you paid of

894
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:44,880
for the end.
You can get very substantial leverage.

895
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:48,900
Um, on the option if you
buy an out of the money

896
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:54,330
option, you can pay only a very little
bit of money and if the end goes up,

897
01:11:54,331 --> 01:11:59,310
you will multiply your, uh, initial
stake by a very substantial amount.

898
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:04,890
Most people presented with that choice
if they believe the option is priced

899
01:12:04,891 --> 01:12:07,890
fairly choose to buy the option.

900
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:11,280
But if you think about what that means,

901
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:16,880
that is a decision to pursue a
positive feedback trading strategy.

902
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,000
That is a decision that the more
the position moves in your favor,

903
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:29,240
the more your option is in the money
and the larger is your exposure to the

904
01:12:30,811 --> 01:12:34,320
underlying stock or the
underlying currency.

905
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:40,310
So anyone who chooses to use options
as a trading vehicle is choosing an

906
01:12:42,361 --> 01:12:47,361
approach in which they are going to
increase the magnitude of their position.

907
01:12:48,871 --> 01:12:50,250
As the price rises,

908
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:55,850
we're decrease the magnitude of
their position as the price falls.

909
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:57,713
Again,

910
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:02,900
exactly the opposite of the
natural stabilizing response.

911
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:10,910
A final source of this kind of positive,

912
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:12,150
uh,

913
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:17,150
feedback is the prospect
that increases in,

914
01:13:19,410 --> 01:13:22,830
uh, movement, uh,

915
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:27,860
for any of these reasons are jumped
on by those who simply anticipate the

916
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:37,221
positive feedback behavior of others and
therefore trend follow in an effort to

917
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:45,291
front run others who are
generating these trends.

918
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:53,030
I would suggest to you that consideration
of these mechanisms along with

919
01:13:56,761 --> 01:14:01,761
consideration of the
experience in markets,

920
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:08,070
a basic pattern that we
tend to observe in markets.

921
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:13,760
Positive serial correlation in the
short rod mean reversion in the long run

922
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:21,420
suggests the pervasiveness of this
kind of positive feedback behavior and

923
01:14:28,391 --> 01:14:33,391
therefore suggests the likelihood that
financial markets will be subject to very

924
01:14:38,231 --> 01:14:43,231
substantial instability
and multiple equilibria.

925
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:50,040
And just as the positive
feedback associated with the
bank run makes a case for

926
01:14:54,910 --> 01:14:59,710
or at least opens up a case
for activist, uh, policy.

927
01:15:00,670 --> 01:15:05,670
So also in the case of financial markets,

928
01:15:07,030 --> 01:15:12,030
the possibility of downdrafts caused by
falling prices that lead to selling that

929
01:15:15,971 --> 01:15:17,980
lead to more Sally,
uh,

930
01:15:18,010 --> 01:15:23,010
lead to falling prices or updraughts
caused by the opposite mechanisms make a

931
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:31,380
potentially strong case for government
action to contain financial,

932
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:36,370
uh,
crisis.

933
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:42,280
So far I've tried to make
the case that I want to make,

934
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:44,920
uh, for, uh,

935
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:50,250
today that the macroeconomics of the
next generation will be much more about

936
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:57,670
finance and financial crisis.

937
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:03,120
Then the macroeconomics of the
generations that shaped our textbooks,

938
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:13,350
that the social gains from preventing and
containing financial crises are likely

939
01:16:19,361 --> 01:16:24,361
to be significant and offer the prospect
of achieving the deep seated goal of

940
01:16:27,851 --> 01:16:32,851
every Keynesian macro economist reducing
the average output gap over a long

941
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:39,841
period of time and thereby producing
more total output that a realistic theory

942
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:50,550
of financial,
uh,

943
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,800
crisis has to be based on something
other than the idea that the market is

944
01:16:57,850 --> 01:16:58,683
efficient.

945
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:04,650
And that the notion that bank run like
behavior can be generated out of the

946
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:13,170
behavior of speculative participants in
financial markets who respond perversely

947
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:21,341
from an economist's point of view to a
price signals is a highly plausible one.

948
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,660
Tomorrow I hope to illustrate,
uh,

949
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:34,720
that these broad ideas have connection
with the current financial crisis,

950
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:40,790
uh,
that we face and to suggest a,

951
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:45,910
to evaluate some of the policy measures
that have been undertaken and to suggest

952
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:49,610
some policy actions for the future.
Thank you very much.

953
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,000
[inaudible]

954
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:00,860
Bob,
I don't know what the format here is,

955
01:18:00,861 --> 01:18:02,600
but I'd be happy to
answer a few questions.

956
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:04,023
Yeah.

957
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:07,103
Yes,
sir.

958
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:15,143
Feedback.

959
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:34,810
I had a,
um,

960
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:41,900
I had a conclusion addressed to the word
moral hazard that I decided to defer to

961
01:18:44,411 --> 01:18:48,520
the first part of what I was going to
say tomorrow. But since you ask, uh,

962
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:51,340
essentially the question I'll,
uh,

963
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:55,420
I'll address to right now.
Um,

964
01:18:55,870 --> 01:19:00,870
I chose in summarizing the
main points to use the phrase,

965
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:07,090
uh,
this possibility of positive feedback,

966
01:19:07,540 --> 01:19:12,540
open space for constructive government
action precisely so as to not judge with

967
01:19:16,601 --> 01:19:21,601
absolutism that in every case there would
be desirable things for governments to

968
01:19:21,611 --> 01:19:26,470
do, uh, precisely because of
the expectational effects, uh,

969
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:30,940
that you describe. But
it seems to me that, um,

970
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:36,520
before embracing moral hazard
and fundamentalism, uh,

971
01:19:36,521 --> 01:19:40,390
and the idea that if the government gets
involved and there'll be expectations

972
01:19:40,391 --> 01:19:42,470
of the government doing things
and then if their expectations,

973
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,390
the government doing things,

974
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:48,010
people will respond to those expectations
and then it'll surely be bad before

975
01:19:48,011 --> 01:19:52,630
embracing that idea.
One needs to pause over three points.

976
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:53,950
Uh,

977
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:58,950
first moral hazard is not a
reason why there should not be,

978
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:05,500
uh,
insurance or a reason why problems,

979
01:20:05,740 --> 01:20:06,573
uh,

980
01:20:06,610 --> 01:20:10,860
should not be addressed
by collective action.

981
01:20:11,310 --> 01:20:15,020
The standard wise crack on the subject is,
uh,

982
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:20,250
the fact that I smoked in bed is not
usually considered a good reason for the

983
01:20:20,251 --> 01:20:24,180
fire department, not to come to
my house to put out the fire,

984
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:29,660
especially if my house borders very
closely on many other people's houses.

985
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:34,800
So the first point is yes,
there may be adverse act,

986
01:20:34,801 --> 01:20:38,730
there may be adverse effects that come
from the expectations and there may be

987
01:20:38,731 --> 01:20:43,731
beneficial effects that come from the
direct action and those have to be traded

988
01:20:44,011 --> 01:20:45,810
off.
Second,

989
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:51,110
there is a certain sloppiness in supposing
that all induced behavioral changes

990
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:57,750
are to be thought of as undesirable.

991
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:01,770
Consider a standard bit of public policy.

992
01:21:02,490 --> 01:21:07,490
The placing of guardrails beside highways
the government chooses as part of the

993
01:21:08,821 --> 01:21:13,530
provision of a public good
to place guardrails, uh,

994
01:21:13,590 --> 01:21:15,480
beside,
uh,

995
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:18,920
highways and to place good
guard rails beside highways.

996
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:25,040
It is a documented empirical fact that
is a consequence of the presence of those

997
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:25,963
guardrails.

998
01:21:26,430 --> 01:21:30,180
People drive faster than
they otherwise would.

999
01:21:31,650 --> 01:21:34,920
How should one think about,
as an economist,

1000
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:40,190
the fact that they drive faster as in
doing a welfare evaluation of guardrails?

1001
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:47,550
I think a moments thought,
uh,

1002
01:21:47,700 --> 01:21:52,700
should convince you that since they had
the option of driving at the same speed

1003
01:21:55,830 --> 01:22:00,570
that they did before in the
presence of the guardrails,

1004
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:02,700
they adjusted their behavior.

1005
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:08,180
The welfare gain from building
the guardrails is greater
than it would have been

1006
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:13,850
if people had, is, is made,

1007
01:22:13,851 --> 01:22:18,851
is magnified by the behavioral
response that takes place.

1008
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:23,040
So if people decide,

1009
01:22:23,190 --> 01:22:28,190
for example that because
we have deposit insurance,

1010
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:34,370
they are not going to check
on the expressions of the
bank tellers at their bank

1011
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:36,360
every day.

1012
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:42,380
That I would argue is an
induced behavioral response
from a public intervention.

1013
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:50,480
But it is one that magnifies the gain
from deposit insurance rather than

1014
01:22:51,631 --> 01:22:55,890
reducing the gain, uh, from, uh,

1015
01:22:55,950 --> 01:23:00,060
deposit, uh, insurance.
The third point, uh,

1016
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:04,320
to be considered,
and it's getting a bit ahead of,

1017
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:07,750
uh, our, uh, of our,

1018
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:12,810
of our story of our story
tomorrow is that there is no,

1019
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:18,911
uh,

1020
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:23,911
is that one has to very carefully
consider the cost to the government of

1021
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:28,450
contemplated actions.

1022
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:34,020
People talk about bailouts in
a rather indiscriminate a way,

1023
01:23:36,010 --> 01:23:41,010
but it is a very different thing for
me to loan my friend John $1,000,

1024
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:52,080
then for me to give my friend
John a thousand dollars.

1025
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,200
And if I loan my friend,
uh,

1026
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:03,300
John $1,000 at a premium interest rate
that exceeds the cost at which I borrow,

1027
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:12,610
it may even be profitable for me,
uh,

1028
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:17,020
to lend money to my friend John.

1029
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,420
And if I am making a profit,

1030
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:24,840
the question of in what
sense I am subsidizing him,

1031
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:30,210
becomes a,
uh,

1032
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:34,300
rather becomes a rather subtle, uh, one.

1033
01:24:34,301 --> 01:24:39,090
So take as a concrete example,
uh,

1034
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:42,580
that poses, uh, the issue, uh,

1035
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:45,970
the loan that the United States made to,
uh,

1036
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:48,550
Mexico in uh,

1037
01:24:48,730 --> 01:24:52,630
1990 in 1995,

1038
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:57,960
the loan that the United States
made to Mexico came at a premium of,

1039
01:25:00,610 --> 01:25:05,610
let's say on average about 200 basis
points over the treasury's borrowing cost.

1040
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:10,780
At the time the United States made it,

1041
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:16,320
Mexico would have probably been unable
to borrow at any interest rate below a

1042
01:25:19,121 --> 01:25:22,780
thousand basis points and perhaps
would have been unable to bop more

1043
01:25:22,781 --> 01:25:26,500
realistically. Probably would
have been unable to borrow at all.

1044
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:31,150
So how does one think about
that 200 basis point loan?

1045
01:25:31,510 --> 01:25:34,780
One way to think about it is we made
a profit. 200 is more than zero.

1046
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:37,930
Another way to think about
it is what weight the market,

1047
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:43,080
the market price of a loan to
Mexico was a thousand basis points.

1048
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,810
We made the loan at 200 basis points.

1049
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:50,620
Therefore the loan is underwater
in the first instance.

1050
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:54,160
Another way to think about it is,

1051
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:58,030
well the market price is 200 basis.

1052
01:25:58,060 --> 01:26:02,200
The market price is a thousand points,
the thousand basis points,

1053
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:06,650
but that's that it's Citibank
trying to collect from Mexico.

1054
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:10,570
Probably the United States is going
to be much better at collecting, uh,

1055
01:26:10,580 --> 01:26:13,850
from Mexico for a variety of reasons.

1056
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:18,800
Then a city group just as the Fed is
going to be much better at collecting from

1057
01:26:18,801 --> 01:26:23,180
Merrill Lynch, uh, then most, uh, others.

1058
01:26:23,420 --> 01:26:28,420
So there's considerable subtlety involved
in judging whether lending activity at

1059
01:26:32,631 --> 01:26:37,631
premium interest rates does or
does not constitute a subsidy.

1060
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:45,700
Almost always will be profitable if paid
back relative to the lenders borrowing

1061
01:26:46,191 --> 01:26:47,024
cost.

1062
01:26:47,450 --> 01:26:52,450
Almost always it will be at
an interest rate that is low,

1063
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:57,520
that is lower than the borrower
could borrow at on the markets.

1064
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:03,860
And almost always in the case of
public or queasy I public activity,

1065
01:27:04,130 --> 01:27:06,560
there will be a reasonable
argument that the,

1066
01:27:06,740 --> 01:27:11,740
that the lender is better at
collecting then the private sector,

1067
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:13,550
uh,
would have been.

1068
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,170
So the question of evaluating
subsidy is a difficult,

1069
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:23,620
the position that I always
took as secretary of the
treasury with respect to the

1070
01:27:24,291 --> 01:27:26,420
IMF was,
look,

1071
01:27:26,421 --> 01:27:31,421
we've got a long experience and over
time our loans have been paid back and

1072
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:33,830
we've made money.

1073
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:38,810
And so you can't really think
of this as bailout and subsidy.

1074
01:27:39,230 --> 01:27:41,300
And I think it was a
pretty strong argument.

1075
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:45,460
I would want to resist
in the strongest terms,

1076
01:27:45,790 --> 01:27:50,790
the idea that because government
involvement will affect private sector

1077
01:27:51,431 --> 01:27:55,960
behavior, there is to
be some presumption, uh,

1078
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:57,970
that it is to be avoided.

1079
01:28:02,030 --> 01:28:02,863
Yes.

1080
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:43,620
The world's a very,
uh, the world's a very,

1081
01:28:43,621 --> 01:28:47,280
and the world is a,
a very uncertain place.

1082
01:28:47,281 --> 01:28:51,330
And a default risks are a very,
very,

1083
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:55,500
are a very, very difficult, uh,

1084
01:28:55,860 --> 01:28:59,850
to, uh, to, uh, to judge.

1085
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:02,160
It's a far from,

1086
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:06,000
it's far from clear that
as a general matter,

1087
01:29:06,450 --> 01:29:10,500
investors understate to fault risks.
Indeed,

1088
01:29:10,501 --> 01:29:15,501
I think most people who've looked closely
at pricing patterns in bond markets

1089
01:29:15,780 --> 01:29:17,340
would tell you that if anything,

1090
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:22,170
investors systematically
overstate default risks.

1091
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:27,440
And so on a very consistent basis if
you a buy riskier bonds and sell safer

1092
01:29:28,440 --> 01:29:33,440
bonds that on average proofs
to VA a profitable strategy
and even proves to be a

1093
01:29:34,981 --> 01:29:39,981
profitable strategy adjusting for the
degree of risk that you're taking.

1094
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:47,300
But the premise of a policy has,

1095
01:29:47,650 --> 01:29:50,110
uh,
tended to be a,

1096
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:55,150
a great deal of emphasis on transparency
in the hope that with more transparency

1097
01:29:55,501 --> 01:30:00,030
and better information, uh, investors,

1098
01:30:00,031 --> 01:30:00,690
uh,

1099
01:30:00,690 --> 01:30:05,690
we'll make a more rational decisions
and we'll make a more rational,

1100
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,670
uh, decisions. Uh, ex-ante.

1101
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:14,130
There were also a set of
issues that are involved here.

1102
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:17,430
Um, and I'll say something
about this tomorrow,

1103
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:22,440
having to do with the fact
that the optimal number of
auto accidents is not zero

1104
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:27,930
and the optimal number of
plane crashes is not zero.

1105
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:33,560
There is a tradeoff to be
made between a accepting,

1106
01:30:33,571 --> 01:30:38,571
a certain possibility of accident and a
variety of advantages that come from the

1107
01:30:38,731 --> 01:30:43,250
conservation of capital and
the making available of, uh,

1108
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:46,110
finance, uh, in a variety of ways.

1109
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:49,110
Thank you very much.
