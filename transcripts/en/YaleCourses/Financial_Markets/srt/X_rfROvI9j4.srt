1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,780
I wanted first to just, uh, think
back a little bit about, uh,

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:11,090
the lecture we got from Steve
Schwarzman and a Friday, uh,

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,070
before he came, I talk
with them in my office. Uh,

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:20,110
and I had the audacity to ask him if he
thought there was any chance that his

5
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:23,970
fortune was just due
to luck. I said, well,

6
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:28,800
we have this efficient markets
theory, uh, in finance, uh,

7
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:32,040
that, uh, uh,

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,660
says that nobody can beat the market.
So what do you think he said?

9
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:43,000
Um, obviously he believes
in himself, but I,

10
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,080
I'm inclined to believe in him also,
uh,

11
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,350
that efficient markets
theory never sounded right.

12
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,623
Uh,

13
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,670
what one thing about efficient market
theory that has always bothered me is this

14
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:01,671
idea that the so called smart
money sets prices in the market.

15
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,050
Um, the thing that bothers me about
it is who is the smart money anyway?

16
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:09,570
It's as if it's an all or nothing thing,
right?

17
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:13,770
There's the smart money and then as the
dumb money and the smart money rules,

18
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,120
but isn't there all different
gradations of intelligence and insight?

19
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,160
So it's not like why should they
be just one level of smart money?

20
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,260
So I think he probably exemplifies,
uh,

21
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:32,440
a higher level of smart money
than smart. I think a lot of, um,

22
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,490
mistakes people make in judging financial
markets is a being easily impressed by

23
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:42,930
someone stockbroker or
someone's analyst who, uh,

24
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,960
who seems very smart and is very smart
but may not be enough to outsmart the

25
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:53,630
markets. Uh, so that's the
lesson of efficiency. Uh,

26
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,860
especially when you're young.

27
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,590
I think you may not realize how many
smart people there are in the world.

28
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,660
And, uh, uh, and so when you,

29
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,140
when you're dealing in a trying
to win and financial markets,

30
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:12,260
you have to take account of who out,

31
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:17,330
who is really out there and how much
insight and effort and research are they

32
00:02:17,461 --> 00:02:21,930
putting in to their trading.
And you really think you can beat that.

33
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,710
Uh,
so that's the lesson of efficient market.

34
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:30,120
But I don't think the lesson is
that you can't, uh, you can't.

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,520
It's impossible for anyone no matter how
smart to beat the market. Now, of course,

36
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,260
you know, Albert Einstein never made any
money in the stock market. And in fact,

37
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,310
Tia Cref,

38
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:46,020
the pension fund had an ad campaign
in which they pointed out that Albert

39
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,850
Einstein left all of his pension
investing to Tia Cref. He was a professor.

40
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,170
And, uh, there are a pension
fund for professors. So, uh,

41
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,070
Einstein didn't think he could
beat the market. And, uh,

42
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,710
Mr Schwartzman very candidly pointed out
that he didn't have the greatest a math

43
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,850
score. Isn't that one how he fought
it? He said he was no math genius.

44
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,130
And you think finance requires a
lot of math. Um, but I think that,

45
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:17,080
you know, it's uh, uh,

46
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,420
it's something about
practical intelligence. Uh,

47
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,380
psychologists have talked about
different kinds of intelligence. Uh,

48
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,420
this thing is all supposed
to be coming up here. Uh,

49
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,920
at least we're seeing something now.
Uh,

50
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:38,230
that's why I don't like a PowerPoint.
Actually. This kind of thing happens.

51
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,333
Uh,

52
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,540
yeah,

53
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:56,270
so, uh, that's it. Uh, and now,

54
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,090
yeah.

55
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,870
Okay. Uh, so, uh,

56
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:04,700
I'm not going to use
this for a few minutes,

57
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:08,110
so I'll just blink it out for the moment.
Um,

58
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,260
but you know, remember Carl Icahn when he
talked to us, said something about, um,

59
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:18,470
he always just had some, he was always
just good at making money, I think.

60
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,340
And I think that, um, uh,
there are separate talents.

61
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:25,880
I mean some people love markets and I
like to think about them and figure out

62
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:28,130
how they work and,
um,

63
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,050
if they have the right kind
of intelligence and the
right kind of spirit to do

64
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:36,320
the work,
they ought to be able to beat the market.

65
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:41,660
When I've talked to icon a number of
times and I have the idea that he's a very

66
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,520
down to earth, solid, inquisitive
sort, he wants to know what's going on.

67
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,330
Uh, and when I've talked to him, sometimes
he'll ask the same question of me.

68
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,850
He's trying to get information from me.

69
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,470
It asks the same question from me three
different ways because apparently my

70
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:02,330
answer isn't satisfactory and he must
think I might know something cause he

71
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:04,830
keeps asking.
I think that's the kind of persistence.

72
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:06,260
It's certain personality traits.

73
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,090
So persistence that trying to figure
out what really makes things work, um,

74
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,160
is, uh, is important in
these, in these markets.

75
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,500
And I think it's just relish or
inclination to keep thinking about them.

76
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,070
So maybe that's why I went
into economics as a professor.

77
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,450
I don't know that I really,

78
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,430
and someone who wants to watch the markets
all day and so you have to judge your

79
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:35,150
own, uh, interest. Uh, so anyway,

80
00:05:35,151 --> 00:05:37,620
it was very nice that we got, um, uh,

81
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,220
Steve Schwarzman came and

82
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,970
told us about his life's work.
Uh,

83
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,350
so anyway, I, I wanted to
talk today about futures. Uh,

84
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:54,560
oh,

85
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,430
but one more thing I wanted to say about
a Schwarzman I was dating at one point,

86
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:01,940
he said very confidently, uh, I
thought now if you've heard this right,

87
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:06,650
that this current financial crisis
ought to be over in a year, and that,

88
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,750
uh, he said something and it was
a little vague about, about, uh,

89
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,920
investing in distressed securities
now as an opportunity because,

90
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:20,750
uh, I think he pointed out
that AAA mortgage securities
are selling for 80 some

91
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:23,450
cents on the dollar and
it can't be that bad.

92
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:26,900
And now this is the same thing that we
got from David Swensen and I've heard it

93
00:06:26,901 --> 00:06:30,940
from others that that's the
opportunity now. So when,

94
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,490
when I hear Steve Schwarzman
proclaiming that he thinks this,

95
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,250
I thought he said something like
that, that this, uh, business, uh,

96
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,600
crisis will be over before Laura.
It made me wonder, you know,

97
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:46,550
do I do I know more than he does about
that sort of thing cause I don't think

98
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:50,000
it's going to be over.
So then it gets back to,

99
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:52,490
I think you have to put all
these people in perspective.

100
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:55,820
There's so many different
kinds of expertise. Um,

101
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:59,000
and when you listen to someone,
you always have to ask, well,

102
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:02,260
what does he or she know that,
uh,

103
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,720
that is specific to their expertise?

104
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,940
And I don't think Schwartzman
is a macro economist. So, uh,

105
00:07:09,941 --> 00:07:13,720
I don't want to say he's wrong,
but he might be wrong. Really.

106
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,550
Let's not put everyone you're good
thing is to listen to everyone. And uh,

107
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,790
and not,
uh,

108
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,140
except that anyone has
the whole truth anywhere.

109
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,100
Um,

110
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,100
I wanted to get onto futures markets
and so that is a very important topic.

111
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,120
Uh,
in finance.

112
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,720
And the important thing to understand
when I put an s on the end futures that

113
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:45,491
refers to a marketplace with
a particular characteristic,

114
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,500
uh, and, uh, as, as traded
on a number of exchanges,

115
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,970
notably in the u s the biggest exchange
for futures is the Chicago Mercantile

116
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,500
Exchange, which just merge with
the Chicago Board of trade.

117
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,150
Uh,
and they are now called the c

118
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,380
the group.
Uh,

119
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,430
so future a sense,

120
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:24,431
it has its origin in agriculture is a
Chicago thing rather than a New York

121
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:29,870
thing. Chicago is the second city,
or it was the second biggest city,

122
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,800
um, hog butcher to the world, farmers,

123
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,610
a marketplace in the Midwest.
Uh,

124
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,690
and so future is in the United
States. Started there, uh,

125
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,460
and uh,
but actually future is,

126
00:08:46,461 --> 00:08:50,510
didn't start in Chicago.
Um,

127
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:55,180
it started in Japan,
uh,

128
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,630
on an island,
uh,

129
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,710
in Osaka called Dejima.

130
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,420
Um, and, uh,

131
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,530
in the 16 hundreds in the,
uh, sorry, I didn't, yeah,

132
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:18,531
it was a 1600 1673 is the date
date for the first futures market.

133
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,510
And so I was just in Osaka
again a few months ago. Uh,

134
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,460
and I again asked, can
I please see Dejima, uh,

135
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,000
because it's such a historic
place, uh, and again,

136
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:37,590
they said there's nothing to see there.
It's all,

137
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,540
anything from long ago it was gone.
Uh,

138
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,660
but that was where these markets started.

139
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,840
So let's go back and I'm not sure
how well developed it was in 1673,

140
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:52,530
but let's say early 17 hundreds in dodgy.
My,

141
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:56,980
what was happening? Well, it was
the Ryse Center for Japan. Uh,

142
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,110
their people,

143
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:02,760
rice merchants would bring
their rice too though Gima and,

144
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,620
uh, sell them there. And, uh, also, uh,

145
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:11,640
naturally as you would expect, there
were big warehouses for rice, uh,

146
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,470
which, uh, which store it, uh, would
be a natural thing to see at the,

147
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,230
uh, at the, uh, center of trade. Uh, and,

148
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,020
uh, it was a big thriving
trade center. Uh,

149
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,230
so people, when they buy it, incidentally,

150
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,180
let's talk about the fundamental problem.
Uh,

151
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,420
agricultural commodities like rice
are harvested typically once a year.

152
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,890
Actually, I think rice has
more than one harvest. Um,

153
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,850
but let's, uh, let's just simplify it.

154
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,390
I say it's harvested once per year and
people depend on it for their lives

155
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:55,860
actually because they need the food
for, uh, for the, for the whole year.

156
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,820
So that means there's a storage business.
Rice has to be stored,

157
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:04,821
you have to keep it away from moisture
and rot and away from rats and vermins.

158
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,830
And that's a business and it's a
very important business or any,

159
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,920
uh, any country. If it isn't rice,

160
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:18,630
it would be some other grain
which is stored. And so,

161
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:20,820
uh,
when people buy and sell grain,

162
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:25,440
they know it's their thinking out at
least a year because that's how long the

163
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:29,370
cycle is for one, one
harvest, one, uh, one cycle.

164
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,290
And so lots of contracts are
signed to buy and sell rice,

165
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:38,910
but typically at some future date. So, uh,

166
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,270
well we talk about spot contracts,
uh,

167
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,310
means buying and selling
something right now.

168
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,780
So if you show up at the warehouse
and say, I've got my wagons,

169
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:56,140
I want to load rice in a,
how much do I have to pay to get rice?

170
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,910
That price would be called the
spot price on the spot right now.

171
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,390
Uh,

172
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,880
but often you would show up at
the warehouse and you would say,

173
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,770
you know, I have some trucks, wagons
coming next week or next month.

174
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,900
And I want to arrange now
to, uh, to buy the rice. Uh,

175
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,030
and uh,
if you say,

176
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,050
if you agree on a price today
for delivery in one month,

177
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,410
that's called a forward contract.
Okay.

178
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,200
Not Futures. There's an important
distinction between forward and futures.

179
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,700
A forward contract.
Let me explain what a forward contract.

180
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:37,720
It's very simple.

181
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,990
It's a contract between two parties to
exchange something at a future date for a

182
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:49,690
price in the future that's
pre determined today.

183
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,580
So for example, a forward
contract will be, uh, between me,

184
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,630
a rice merchant and the warehouse that
in two months I will come and take

185
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:01,690
delivery of,
you know,

186
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:05,830
so many bushels of rice and then
I will pay such and such a price.

187
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,260
Okay. That's a forward
contract. So before 1673,

188
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,220
there were lots of forward
contracts and lots of, uh,

189
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,470
people trading in these. And
so someone in Doji, my thought,

190
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,020
why don't we set up a big
market for these? Because, uh,

191
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:31,120
people have trouble knowing what
the price is for a forward contract.

192
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,690
People would travel around from one
warehouse to another and they get a

193
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:39,370
different price from one or the other,
and they kind of wonder what the price is,

194
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,560
you know, today. So someone said, well,

195
00:13:41,561 --> 00:13:45,540
why don't we kind of create a
market for forward contracts? Uh,

196
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,110
but we don't call them forward contract.

197
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:50,110
I don't know what they call them in
Japan and I'm just going to get the idea.

198
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,250
So the idea is let's create a marketplace,

199
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,000
a central marketplace so
that all of these different,

200
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,770
you don't have to go around in
a hundred different warehouses.

201
00:14:00,771 --> 00:14:05,490
They try to find the best price. You
find out what the real price is. Uh,

202
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:10,120
and so what they did is they
created an exchange in Doe Jima.

203
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,230
Uh, and the exchange had
a lot of modern features.

204
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,250
It had a trading floor.
Okay.

205
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,730
There was a designated area where people
who wanted to trade in rice futures

206
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,250
would congregate.
Uh,

207
00:14:27,251 --> 00:14:29,890
and all trades we're
supposed to be done there.

208
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:34,510
So that became a central
marketplace. Um, and uh,

209
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,630
so many people came to the exchange floor
that it got very noisy and traders can

210
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:43,570
be very noisy people shouting
and getting upset, uh,

211
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,910
trading rapidly back and forth.

212
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,470
So in they developed in Doji
Ma instead of hand signals.

213
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,890
So it was so noisy and loud that you
couldn't talk sometimes and it was hard,

214
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,500
especially to communicate something to
someone on the other side of the room.

215
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:03,530
So they invented hand signals.
So the traders would be,

216
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,960
I don't know exactly what they were,
but typically when you,

217
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,800
if you had something like this,
you hold out your hand with your palm out.

218
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,420
That means I want to sell. And if it's
four fingers up, that means for contracts,

219
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,370
if you put it this way, uh, it would
be buying, I want to buy for contracts.

220
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,910
So those hand signals developed in,

221
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,470
in Osaka and they became a mainstay
of futures markets after that.

222
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,790
Okay. So, uh,

223
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:35,630
another thing they did in Japan
to create the central market, uh,

224
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:39,740
was to standardize the rice.

225
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,880
So, uh, standardized.

226
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,440
Now, uh, this is very important.

227
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:52,400
If you go shopping around to different
warehouses to try to buy rice,

228
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:56,190
you'll get some warehouse
who says, well, I'm charged.

229
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,950
I know I'm charging a higher price,

230
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,550
but my rice is better than that
other guy's rice. You know,

231
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:06,440
his has some worms in it, sometimes
don't trust that other guy. Uh,

232
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,180
and so, or whatever it is, or you know,
even rice isn't all the same, right?

233
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:15,770
There's different varieties and some
of them taste better than others. Uh,

234
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,580
so how would you ever know what the
price of rice? It's just a mess.

235
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:25,330
So what they did in Osaka is they made
a standard form of rice for delivery in

236
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:32,150
their contract. Okay?
That's important because,

237
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,500
uh,
there's many kinds of rights,

238
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:39,800
but they picked one that's
maybe the most common. Uh,

239
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:42,860
and then they said that's what
all of our contracts are about.

240
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,550
So you would be taking delivery
of a standard rice. Moreover,

241
00:16:46,551 --> 00:16:51,551
at the exchange they had experts on
rice who could tell whether it was that

242
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:55,130
contract.
It's not the best rice,

243
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,260
it's the most common rice.

244
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,680
I visited the coffee sugar and cocoa
exchange in New York once and jokingly I

245
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:07,760
said, can I have a cup of coffee?
And so this is the coffee,

246
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:11,630
sugar and cocoa exchange.
Surely I can get a cup of coffee here.

247
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,950
And then the guy said, uh, who was
showing me around, he said, well,

248
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:20,180
we could give you a cup of coffee, but
it's not what we trade here. Uh, he says,

249
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:24,300
you wouldn't like the coffee we
trade here. It's not Starbucks. Uh,

250
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:29,210
it's the most standard. So they set up a
standard for coffee at the coffee shop.

251
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,470
Maybe he was being too candid.

252
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:34,490
I don't know if they would
say that officially they
set up a standard for coffee

253
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,271
at the coffee,

254
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:40,271
sugar coco exchange and then no one would
ever deliver better coffee than that.

255
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,930
Right. Well, after explain that everyone,
they wouldn't even be allowed to.

256
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:48,800
The whole idea is the
contract has standards.

257
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,080
Uh, what, what actually
happens if you are,

258
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,440
have a contract to deliver rice
or coffee or anything like that.

259
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,120
And there's some expert there who's
going to judge whether what you delivered

260
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,440
was up to quality standards.
And you are a smart businessperson,

261
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,800
you will deliver exactly
the minimum quality,

262
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,200
right to fulfill the contract.

263
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:15,390
So it'll never be below the minimum
quality because no one can deliver it.

264
00:18:15,391 --> 00:18:18,060
The x,
the testers will not allow that.

265
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,870
And it can't be above the minimum
standard because you'd never do that.

266
00:18:21,871 --> 00:18:24,540
You'd be stupid to do that.
So you always,

267
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,210
it's always becomes the standard variety.

268
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,660
So what they did at the futures market
is they then not only had standardized

269
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,840
the rice,
but they standardized delivery date

270
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:43,200
and delivery locations.

271
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,640
So they then, so what, what,

272
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:50,490
what would you trade on these
con in these futures markets?

273
00:18:50,491 --> 00:18:51,360
You would be training,

274
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,560
you either be buying or selling rice
for future delivery on a standardized

275
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,980
delivery date at a standardized location,

276
00:19:01,981 --> 00:19:05,700
probably one of the warehouses
that they designate. Okay.

277
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,713
Um,

278
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,450
and that might not be the rice
you want or the date you want.

279
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:16,800
And yet somehow the market
gets going and gets very big.

280
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,110
And this is the reason the,

281
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,220
what a futures market does
that's different from a
warehouse market is it sets

282
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:30,570
up a standard price and a liquid market.
And the,

283
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,260
uh,

284
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,260
and so people end up using the futures
market to lock in the price or to,

285
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,150
or to hedge price risk.
And they,

286
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,230
they know that the price in the
futures market is the meaningful price.

287
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,060
You hear all kinds of prices of rice.
You know,

288
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,990
you ever hear rumors here and there,
uh, they'll, someone will say,

289
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:58,290
I saw a rice sell for such and such,
so many Yan or whatever it is.

290
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,570
Don't believe any of that nonsense.

291
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,550
Who knows what was sold
or what terms there were,

292
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:08,570
what exigencies there were only look at
the futures market because the future's

293
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:12,960
market is absolutely standardized,
you know, the terms of delivery,

294
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,910
the location and everything else.

295
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:20,510
And so what ended up happening is that
everyone wanted to trade in the futures

296
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:24,780
market and it became a huge market.
Uh,

297
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:28,770
and then everyone started
watching the futures price. Okay.

298
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,700
So, uh, that's, that's
what we now have wood.

299
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,890
That's what is in a future.
I wanted to taste some other,

300
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,960
one other curious thing about the two
other things about the Osaka market is

301
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,480
they had trading hours
just as we do today. Uh,

302
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,041
in other words,

303
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:52,000
only certain hours of the day the floor
was open and then it was shut off.

304
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,200
And so people get very excited
and trade very actively.

305
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,650
You have to somehow let people know that
the trading time is over and all trades

306
00:21:01,901 --> 00:21:05,770
have to stop at the end of the day.
So they had a burning fuse,

307
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:10,060
which they would light in the middle
of the trading floor just a few minutes

308
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,721
before the end of the day.

309
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:14,530
And you can see this flame and that
meant you better finish your trades right

310
00:21:14,531 --> 00:21:18,700
now because when the flame
goes out, it's over. Uh,

311
00:21:18,701 --> 00:21:20,530
and so we don't have fuses anymore.

312
00:21:20,531 --> 00:21:24,430
We have clock the same and a bell at
announces the beginning and end at an

313
00:21:24,431 --> 00:21:28,150
exchange. Uh, but there's
one of the thing they had,

314
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:30,730
which I think is kind of curious,
but it hasn't been copied.

315
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,130
They had people called water
men who after the fuse went out,

316
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:39,040
they carried buckets of
water under the exchange.

317
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,270
And if anybody was still trading,
they splashed them with water.

318
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,100
That was the doubts that the fuses out.
Everything is Dallas for today. Uh,

319
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,470
we don't do that in modern
futures exchanges. Of course,
it's all electronic now.

320
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
There's no, well, it's getting
increasingly electronic.

321
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:01,920
The CME and the CVOT still have trading
floors like Doji Mazu and they're still

322
00:22:04,091 --> 00:22:07,000
using these hand signals. Uh, but it's,

323
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:11,230
it's getting lonely there because
everything is moving away,

324
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:15,760
uh, to the, um, uh,

325
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,010
everything is moving away
to the electronic markets.

326
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,100
But you'll still see on CNBC, uh, Bob
[inaudible], we'll be standing at the, uh,

327
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,590
t bond trading pit, uh,
and he'll give us little,

328
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:30,160
they focus the camera right on where all
the people are active and they're still

329
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:34,190
out there. Josh jostling
each other and, um,

330
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,870
shouting at each other.
Uh, so it's still going on,

331
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:41,850
but it's increasingly becoming
an electronic market. Um,

332
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:46,610
but I guess the, uh, uh,

333
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:52,270
the most important thing to realize
about futures markets is that they're

334
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:56,490
different from forward markets in that it,
uh,

335
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,750
with a futures market,
when you buy and sell a contract,

336
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,730
you are buying and selling with the
exchange or the clearinghouse of the

337
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:10,300
exchange.
And you do not know the counterparty.

338
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,620
You do not know who's on the other side.
With a forward market,

339
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,210
you
with a forward market,

340
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,630
you know very well who's
on the other side, you're,

341
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:23,050
you're going into a
warehouse and there was,

342
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:27,130
this warehouse is going to
take your w, your grain, uh,

343
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,830
and uh, in the warehouse, uh,

344
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:33,740
you better trust the other side because
suppose the other side doesn't work.

345
00:23:33,741 --> 00:23:34,690
And I suppose you have your,

346
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,710
you've loaded up all your rice and you
come to the warehouse and then the guy

347
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:42,490
says, uh, oh, I don't, I don't, I don't
want to honor the contract. I signed it,

348
00:23:42,491 --> 00:23:46,250
but I just not going to take it or
I'm going to lower the price on you.

349
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:50,850
Then you have to sue this guy, you
know, and it's a big mess. So, uh,

350
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,620
the problem with forward contracts
is that they're not standardized.

351
00:23:54,621 --> 00:23:58,190
You're not dealing with a reputable
exchange with an exchange.

352
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,080
There is of course,
the counterparty,

353
00:24:00,081 --> 00:24:02,750
if you're selling rice and
someone else is buying it,

354
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:07,490
but there's an intermediary between
you and that's the exchange.

355
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,180
And since the exchange,
we'll honor any contract,

356
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,470
you don't have to worry
about the other side.

357
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,080
So that's another reason why futures,
price prices,

358
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:19,730
there's so much more meaningful
than spot or forward prices, uh,

359
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,690
because there's no, uh,
uh, put it this way,

360
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:27,200
there's no counterparty risk

361
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,620
unless you worry about
the exchange itself.

362
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:38,060
But since the feature exchanges in the
u s had been here since the 19th century

363
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,070
and they've never lost a contract,

364
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:45,071
people assume as a first approximation
a that there is no counterparty risk.

365
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,710
Um,
but before I,

366
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,240
I'm still haven't maybe fully explained
futures, but let me, uh, before we go on,

367
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:57,970
I wanted to talk a little bit about
forwards, uh, because we then,

368
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,120
now we have a slide up here.

369
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:04,370
We do have forward contracts and they
still play an important function.

370
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:10,090
The reason is that futures markets by
their very nature are standardized markets

371
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,300
or you might say their retail markets,

372
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,920
they have a huge number of people trading
in them, but it's all a standard thing.

373
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:24,170
Forward markets are,
are between persons. Uh,

374
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:27,680
and so they, they can be, the
contract can be anything you want.

375
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:32,930
And so forward contracts
are very important. Uh,

376
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,850
but they tend to be less. Uh, well, I,

377
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:41,600
I tend to observe them last because
they don't have this newsworthy

378
00:25:41,601 --> 00:25:42,434
characteristic.

379
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:46,220
Everyone's talking about futures prices
because everyone knows that is a very

380
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:49,250
well defined central market,
liquid price.

381
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,330
The forward contracts are not liquid.

382
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,220
You can't get out of it. So if you
as a rice merchant sold your rice,

383
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:03,400
if you are, say a rice farmer, you sold
your rice forward to, uh, uh, to, uh,

384
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,240
uh, to a warehouse, uh, and
then you change your mind.

385
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:12,260
You want to get out. Uh, you can't
because unless the other guy says,

386
00:26:12,261 --> 00:26:16,170
I'll let you out because you've
just got a contract. And so, uh,

387
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,850
the futures has this
active trading in and out.

388
00:26:19,851 --> 00:26:23,720
And so the prices seem to mean more.
But let's talk about forward market.

389
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:26,780
There's forward markets for a lot
of things. One very important.

390
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,410
A forward market is a foreign
exchange forward market.

391
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,300
And this happens a lot because
there's tons of businesses that have,

392
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,220
they sell things,
uh,

393
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:41,150
in countries around the world and
they get a foreign currencies.

394
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,200
So if you sell some Europe manufacturer
and you sell something in, uh,

395
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,760
in Japan, uh, then they're
paying you in yen, uh,

396
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,710
and they might be paying
you in three months.

397
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,900
And so you worry about the exchange
rate between dollars and yen. So, uh,

398
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,370
you want to get it in dollars.

399
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:04,400
So you might want to find a counterparty
who will exchange your yen for dollars

400
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:09,030
in three months, uh, or
whatever the term is a.

401
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:13,650
And so that's called a forward contract
for exchange of currencies. Uh,

402
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,550
very simple. Okay, I'm getting,
I'm selling cars in Japan.

403
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:22,380
That sounds, that does happen.
US cars sold in Japan. Uh,

404
00:27:22,381 --> 00:27:26,740
and so I'm going to get, I know I'm going
to get this yen in three months. Uh,

405
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:30,690
I just, uh, sign a contract with
somebody to exchange dollars.

406
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,830
We fixed the exchange rate. That's
called the forward exchange rate. Okay?

407
00:27:34,831 --> 00:27:37,620
It's not necessarily the same as
today's exchange rate. In fact,

408
00:27:37,621 --> 00:27:42,300
it will generally be systematically
different. Uh, and so we have this, uh,

409
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,950
what's called forward interest
parody relation. The forward,

410
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:52,340
this is an arbitrage relationship that
holds very well in the forward market for

411
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:56,670
foreign exchange. The forward
exchange rate, that's yen per dollar.

412
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:02,010
In the case of a, we're
talking about Japan, us, uh,

413
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:06,080
equals the spot exchange
rate. Uh, that's uh,

414
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:10,570
in, uh, in, uh,

415
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:15,930
uh, the yen per dollar times one,

416
00:28:15,931 --> 00:28:20,550
plus the yen interest rate. That's for
three months. If it's three months,

417
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,530
a horizon times one plus the
dollar interest rate. Uh,

418
00:28:25,531 --> 00:28:29,450
and that, that relation
holds very well. Uh,

419
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,900
because if it didn't hold,
I could make money, uh,

420
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:38,970
quickly, uh, without risk and
uh, that shouldn't happen. Right?

421
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:40,860
Think of it this way.

422
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:45,810
The interest rate in Japan is different
from the interest rate in the u s

423
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,820
government bonds issued in Japan
are perfectly safe. Well, I mean,

424
00:28:50,821 --> 00:28:55,350
you could say, of course the
Japanese government could
default, but hey, you know,

425
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,380
it's not going to happen to a first
approximation is not going to call that a

426
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:02,610
zero probability.
Uh,

427
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:06,870
and same thing with the u s so how can
two different countries have different

428
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:07,740
interest rates?

429
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,820
Because you would think what wouldn't
investor is always invest in the country

430
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:15,060
with the higher interest rate.
Why now? If it's riskless, well,

431
00:29:15,061 --> 00:29:17,310
there is risk and that's
exchange rate risk.

432
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:22,350
But you can get rid of the risk by taking
a forward contract. So you could say,

433
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:23,640
if you're living in Japan,

434
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:28,770
I note that interest rates are higher in
the u s then Japan. So I'm going to go,

435
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,410
I'm not going to invest in yen, uh, bonds.

436
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:35,400
I'm going to invest in US bonds
and then I'm going to cover myself.

437
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:39,390
But making a forward contract to
get the money back in the end.

438
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,810
Uh,
well that's a very clear thing to do.

439
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:48,520
But the problem is you can't make any
money doing it because this holds because

440
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:49,354
of arbitrary.

441
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:53,560
There are so many people who've noticed
that that interest rates are higher in

442
00:29:53,561 --> 00:29:56,740
the u s and in Japan.
They're both risk plus interest rates.

443
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,970
It can't be right that there is this
profit opportunity that's riskless.

444
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,980
Uh, and so the forward exchange
rate satisfies this relationship.

445
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:11,560
The forward rate equals the spot rate
times one. The relative interest rates.

446
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,930
And this is over the horizon between,

447
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:18,200
now this is not the annual
interest rate unless it's a,

448
00:30:18,201 --> 00:30:23,200
an annual, a forward contract. So if
it's a three month forward contract,

449
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:26,080
this would be the interest
earned in three months in. Yeah.

450
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:30,280
And this would be the interest during
the dollars, uh, over three months.

451
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:35,170
So that's one kind of forward ready
Freeman. This market works very well.

452
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,410
It satisfies this relate we've explained,
we know this market.

453
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,170
It just satisfies the forward
interest parity condition. Um,

454
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,530
so another, um, uh,

455
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,230
another market, uh, Eh,

456
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,670
a forward market is
the market for, uh, uh,

457
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:02,410
different interest rates. Uh, so, uh, we,

458
00:31:02,411 --> 00:31:05,150
we can have a forward a loan.

459
00:31:05,151 --> 00:31:09,950
We can say I want to make it alone at
a future date of a certain maturity.

460
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,640
Well, let's tie in the
interest rate now. Uh, so our,

461
00:31:14,641 --> 00:31:16,010
as the contract rate,

462
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,370
so suppose you want to either borrow
or lend money in the future. Uh,

463
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:24,530
we talked about forward rates implicit
in the term structure earlier. Uh,

464
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:26,840
and you could try to
achieve those forward rates.

465
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:29,900
As we talked about earlier about
buying and selling government bonds.

466
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,450
But this is another way to do
it, which may be simpler. Uh, uh,

467
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,930
it doesn't involve shorting bonds.
You can just make a contract. So, uh,

468
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:39,640
uh,

469
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:44,540
there was a contract rate in the
forward contract and the contract says,

470
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,170
and the contract specifies
the contract rate are,

471
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:51,980
and the number of days,
uh, in the contract period,

472
00:31:51,981 --> 00:31:56,840
that's how many days hence this contract
will be delivered, will be executed.

473
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,380
And this is this, you can make any
forward rate contract you want,

474
00:32:00,381 --> 00:32:04,410
but this is the most standard
contract got it's between counter.

475
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:05,930
So you can do whatever you want,

476
00:32:05,931 --> 00:32:09,110
but if you talk with a broker
and you got a standard contract,

477
00:32:09,111 --> 00:32:10,130
you'd probably get this.

478
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,390
Now the purpose of this contract
is to lock in an interest rate.

479
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,490
It's a risk management contract.

480
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:21,380
And so you don't actually want to
bow and lend from this other person.

481
00:32:21,381 --> 00:32:22,820
You'll arrange that separately,

482
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:27,200
but you want to protect yourself so that
you know today what interest rate you

483
00:32:27,201 --> 00:32:28,370
can get in the future.

484
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,440
So what they do is they defined some
measure of actual interest, right?

485
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:38,890
And it could be something like live bar
just mentioned library l I v O r is the

486
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:47,300
London interbank offered rate.

487
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,890
It's just a an interest rate that's
defined by an agency in London.

488
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,190
They have a website and you can read it.
So it's a well known,

489
00:32:55,191 --> 00:32:56,600
well defined interest rate.

490
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,370
So you could say a three month
lie bar is the interest rate.

491
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,900
90 days in the future d would be 90.
Uh,

492
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,150
and so what the contract specifies,

493
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:13,180
it also specifies a contract them out
a a and B is actually usually 360 but

494
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:20,330
sometimes I'll say 365 what? You can write
whatever you want and these contracts,

495
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:24,320
but this is standard typically 360 days.

496
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:29,300
And so all it specifies what the contract
says. There's two counter parties,

497
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,490
there's the,
the long and the short.

498
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:36,200
Somebody is receiving interest and
someone is paying interest. So, uh,

499
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:40,970
the settlement is this amount from
one side to the other. And this,

500
00:33:40,971 --> 00:33:41,960
this formula actually,

501
00:33:41,961 --> 00:33:46,490
it doesn't appear in for Bozi
in exactly this notation,

502
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:51,350
but this is in the chapter
on futures market. This, uh,

503
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,990
this equation, although it's
written a little differently,

504
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,980
it's the same equation
appears in for Bozi, uh,

505
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:02,330
in the chapter on futures
markets. Uh, so what you do,

506
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:07,520
the standard forward contract says one
counterparty pays the other this amount

507
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:12,370
and that is equal to the, uh, the, uh,

508
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:17,090
actual interest rate minus the
contract rate times the number of days,

509
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,060
times the number,
uh,

510
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:24,100
the contract amount divided
by B times a hundred.

511
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,520
This hundred is here because l and R
are assumed to be measured in hundreds.

512
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:34,130
So, uh, like percent, 3% is
really pointed over three

513
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:40,030
times l times B. Okay? This,

514
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,880
this equation might be easier if you
divide both numerator and denominator by

515
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:44,714
100.

516
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:49,940
Then you can see all the 100 is doing
is correcting the interest rates from

517
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,120
percent to, to, to, uh,

518
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:58,660
like from 3% to 0.03. So all
it's doing, all this contract is,

519
00:34:58,661 --> 00:35:02,230
is, is an amount, uh, a, um,

520
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:07,750
a promise to pay the difference between
the contract rate and the actual

521
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:12,710
interest rate on that date.
So that effectively allows you,

522
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:17,770
if you want to say bar with that rape
to lock in the interest rate today,

523
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,910
because I will get an amount of money
from this contract that will offset any

524
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,030
changes in interest rates in
the future. So that's, uh,

525
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:29,990
that's another example
of a, of a contract. Uh,

526
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:35,030
but I want to emphasize here
futures not, uh, so where am I?

527
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,450
Let's talk about futures prices. Okay. Uh,

528
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,830
I took this from the old newspaper
extra my old lecture. Um,

529
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:48,270
this is what used to be in the
Wall Street Journal. Uh, and uh,

530
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,650
this is an example of a futures contract.

531
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,380
I'm going to stick here with
agricultural futures. Uh,

532
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,520
in the next lecture we're going
to talk about financial futures,

533
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
but I like to talk about agricultural
futures because it's just really expanding

534
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:09,990
on the Japan, uh, Osaka
Dorjee my story. Uh,

535
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:15,030
and it's,
it's so earthy agriculture down to earth.

536
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:18,990
Uh, I think I like to start
with that because it seems
very simple to understand.

537
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,340
Uh,

538
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,960
and so I want him to explain one contract
and I thought I would emphasize corn.

539
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,560
Uh, and this is as it was laid out, uh,

540
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:33,000
in 2001 that was seven years ago.

541
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:36,870
I was giving these lectures seven
years ago when I clipped it out.

542
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,240
That was before,
uh,

543
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,480
I must've covered it earlier in the
semester cause I have marks 15 there and

544
00:36:44,581 --> 00:36:48,940
we're now April 14th,
but we'll just use this just as I,

545
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,250
I'll show you in a second what
you can get today. Newspapers,

546
00:36:53,251 --> 00:36:54,600
just seven years ago,

547
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,740
covered lots more financial data than
they do today because we're moving to the

548
00:36:58,741 --> 00:37:03,570
Internet. Of course they had the internet
in 2001, but we weren't so into it then.

549
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:08,040
So they still publish this in the
Wall Street Journal as of 2001,

550
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,130
so let me just use this
as an example. Now. Uh,

551
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,880
what is this? This is corn.
That's maids. Okay. Uh,

552
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:22,970
it was what this means that one contract
is a contract to deliver 5,000 bushels.

553
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:29,340
And the price here is shown
in cents per Bushel. Okay.

554
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:33,100
And these are the contracts. There
was a, now this is [inaudible].

555
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,280
Today is March 15,
2001,

556
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:40,120
there's a main contract in
July contract and this is a,

557
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:44,850
okay, this shows the price
over today, which is March 15,

558
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:49,640
2001. Okay. The guys
in the pit at the, um,

559
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,160
the stands for Chicago Board of Trade.
I put an o in it,

560
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:58,470
but often they did say CBT.
There's, uh, there's a,

561
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:01,950
uh, uh, corn pit okay. With, uh,

562
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,300
with traders and there might be 50 guys.
They're guys and girls.

563
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,410
It's a rough, uh, my colleague
runny wall. And he was, uh,

564
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:15,020
worked in the futures pits in Chicago.
And uh,

565
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:18,360
she told me that it was so rough.
She was,

566
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:22,800
she got pregnant and they were,
she was still coming into work.

567
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,960
Um, and she got knocked over one day by
one of the traders that her boss said,

568
00:38:27,961 --> 00:38:31,590
no way. You have to take a
vacation until the baby is born.

569
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,650
This is no place for a
pregnant woman. Um, it's true.

570
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:40,360
They get rough and tumble there.
Uh, when I had a tour of the CBOT,

571
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:43,280
this is like 10 years
ago, I was asking, um,

572
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:49,100
I was observing the guys in
the pit where, so Rawkus, uh,

573
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,890
and at 1.1 trader got another trader
in a headlock and he was dragging him

574
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:56,640
around. And, uh,

575
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:02,170
I think it was all in fun at that time
anyway. But, uh, so the guy said, well,

576
00:39:02,171 --> 00:39:03,920
you know, we had a good record. This,

577
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:08,650
we've had only two broken arms
this year and that's a good year.

578
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,760
Um, in Chicago, they're not
as, they're farmers, right?

579
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:15,580
Or I shouldn't be put them down. They're
different. They have a different spirit.

580
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:19,190
They're not, they're down
to earth, real people that,

581
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,280
and so it's fun to watch,
but it's unfortunately,

582
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:28,540
it's probably too late unless you
go to the treasury bond pit. Uh,

583
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:33,250
it's all fading away to under the,
onto the Internet. But anyway,

584
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,280
what this means is these were the prices
that corn took per bushel over that day

585
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:43,450
of March 15. So if price was going up
and down as they were trading all day,

586
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:47,890
uh, and so, uh, this
was the opening price.

587
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:49,390
When the market opened in the morning,

588
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:54,670
this was the highest price for May
futures. This was the lowest price.

589
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:59,680
And this is called the settle,
which is essentially the last price,

590
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:04,330
but not necessarily because the exchange
has a settlement committee and they

591
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:06,910
decide on what is the last price.

592
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,990
And the reason it's not the same thing
as the last actual trade is that they're

593
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:14,830
worried about somebody trying
to manipulate the market
and doing something funny

594
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:19,120
with the last trade. So it's, but
it's, it's like the last trade.

595
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:23,860
Okay. And so this is the change
from the previous day of the price.

596
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:29,040
So this is the price for May delivery
at a specified warehouse of corn to

597
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:34,520
Chicago. Okay. Uh, and, uh,

598
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,790
open interest is the number of contracts.

599
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:41,770
So there was 186,000 may contract.
That's only two months away.

600
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:42,611
March,
April,

601
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:46,480
may you see almost all of the open
interest is in the short contracts.

602
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:51,970
Okay. Now, if you drive through
the country and turn on the radio,

603
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,140
you will hear at regular intervals,

604
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:01,460
the announcer will tell you what corn
is doing. So that's a current, uh,

605
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:05,890
at the latest trading is up
to $2 and 18 cents a Bushel.

606
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,800
What price is that guy coding?

607
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:13,960
It's always going to be the futures
price. And so you might say, well,

608
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:18,310
but that's two months in the march, April,
May, why are they talking about May?

609
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,690
Because this is march.

610
00:41:19,691 --> 00:41:23,950
Why doesn't the announcer tell us
that at some warehouse, you know,

611
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:28,750
the price today was, uh, and the
reason is that, as I was saying,

612
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:33,680
those prices are not meaningful because
there they jump around because of reason.

613
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:38,300
So this is the price. Um, uh,

614
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:45,490
and so the other thing that I want to
emphasize is that these markets are used

615
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:53,321
to manage risks of
holding or raising grain.

616
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:59,710
Most of the time people who are trading
in this market do not complete the

617
00:42:00,201 --> 00:42:03,230
contract. In other words, if I,

618
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:08,290
let's say I'm a farmer raising corn and
I'm worried that the price of corn might

619
00:42:09,021 --> 00:42:13,370
fall while I'm raising it and I
lose money, right? I'm, you know,

620
00:42:13,371 --> 00:42:17,750
if if the world market
for corn drops, then, uh,

621
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:20,900
I might not be able to
cover my expenses this year.

622
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,640
And so I could be at great risk so
I can sell in the futures market,

623
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:30,230
but I probably won't deliver
to the futures market.

624
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,430
And why not?

625
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:37,120
Because the delivery point is in Chicago
and I'm a farmer in Iowa and I don't

626
00:42:38,631 --> 00:42:41,030
know how to deliver it
all the way to Chicago.

627
00:42:41,031 --> 00:42:45,650
I'd have to rent trucks and
drive to Chicago with my car.

628
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,060
I'm not going to do that. I'm always just
delivering to the local grain elevator.

629
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:52,130
In fact, I don't have to,
I don't need any trucks.

630
00:42:52,131 --> 00:42:56,690
The guy will pick it up from my farm.
And so, uh, that's what I want to do.

631
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:02,030
So what I do typically is I
sell in the futures market.

632
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:06,560
I as a farmer and then one day
before the contract expires,

633
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:11,300
instead of delivering, I will buy
it back and cancel out my contract.

634
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:15,800
And then, so all I've done is a
purely financial trade in the future.

635
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:20,440
You see the difference, I don't actually
want to deliver because it's two truck,

636
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:21,710
too much trouble to deliver.

637
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,180
So you get farmers trading all over the
country and all over the world in this

638
00:43:26,181 --> 00:43:31,181
market as a way of hedging their corn
and very few of them will ever deliver.

639
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:39,520
The only reason why delivery is kept
open as an option is that is what sells.

640
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:44,390
That's what determines the
price in the market. Ultimately,

641
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,660
the only people who deliver
our professional arbitrary
jurors who on the last

642
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,510
day or right when their
contract is expiring,

643
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,920
they look at the futures price
and they say, maybe I can deliver,

644
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,950
maybe I can buy for less than that
and deliver it and I'll really do it.

645
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,930
Those are the only people, so if they
can buy for less than that and deliver,

646
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:11,620
they'll do it and so they compete with
each other and that brings the futures

647
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:16,550
price and the spot price in line
at the end. Or alternatively,

648
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:21,230
if the f the spot price is above
the futures price at the end,

649
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:24,980
then these arbitragers will
say, hey, I'll take delivery.

650
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:29,120
I'll go there and I'll take delivery
on a contract and then I'll sell it and

651
00:44:29,121 --> 00:44:29,954
make money.

652
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:35,560
And it's of the arbitragers that the
cash price and the spot price line up at

653
00:44:36,151 --> 00:44:40,740
the end. It's not through any, um, uh, uh,

654
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,010
law requirement.
And so you see what people are doing.

655
00:44:44,011 --> 00:44:47,670
They're using the futures market
as a purely financial market.

656
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:52,470
Most people relying on the
arbitrary jurors to, uh,

657
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,393
to,
uh,

658
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:58,670
enforce the futures prices converging
on the spot price at the end.

659
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,050
Most people are not even raising the
right kind of core maybe or I don't know

660
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:05,740
how a lot of them certainly are.

661
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,650
There's all different kinds of corn and
if you are raising one kind of corn and

662
00:45:10,651 --> 00:45:14,670
are hedging your risks with
a different kind of corn,

663
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:19,370
that's called cross hedging. Okay. Uh,

664
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,910
cross pledging.

665
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:24,690
That means across products.

666
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,550
I'm going from one product to another,

667
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,860
so I could be raising some of this
beautiful Indian corn that remember,

668
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:33,240
it turns all these different
colors and people put it,

669
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,650
hang it on their doors and Halloween,
um,

670
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:40,620
that's not suitable for
delivery at the CBOT. Uh,

671
00:45:40,621 --> 00:45:45,060
so if I'm raising that, there's no
market for this, uh, it's no future.

672
00:45:45,061 --> 00:45:48,840
It's no big market for that. But it
probably correlates with regular corn.

673
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,160
So I could cross hedge.

674
00:45:50,161 --> 00:45:53,580
If I'm raising Indian corn and
I'm worried about the price,

675
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:57,660
I can sell in the futures market in
Chicago and buy it back the next day.

676
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,530
I said I was going to show you
what's in the Wall Street Journal.

677
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,370
I got this this morning from the
Wall Street Journal. That's all.

678
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:09,420
They have four futures markets in the,
in the newspaper.

679
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:13,440
Unless I've missed it, I couldn't
find it. Commodities and currencies,

680
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:18,110
they don't have any agricultural
futures mentioned at all in uh,

681
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,090
Chicago in the Wall Street Journal.
But uh,

682
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,980
as I'm going to talk about next period,

683
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:28,050
most futures has migrated to financial
futures anyway. It's the same idea,

684
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:32,750
but it's not agricultural. I don't
see anything agricultural up here. Uh,

685
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:37,770
there's commodities. There's crude
oil and natural gas. Um, gold.

686
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:41,250
Everything else is purely financial.
Well,

687
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:45,000
actually we've got the
DJ Aig Commodity Index.

688
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:49,770
That's an index of a number of prices,
probably including agricultural.

689
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:54,720
Uh, and, uh, so that, that's
traded lots of Maura's traded.

690
00:46:55,050 --> 00:47:00,050
I went down to cbot.com this morning
and I got wheat futures prices.

691
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,093
This is a,

692
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:07,430
well this is on their website and you
don't need any special permission to get

693
00:47:07,681 --> 00:47:11,820
on CBO t.com they're actually changing
the name of the website though.

694
00:47:11,821 --> 00:47:12,654
I think it will be

695
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:19,790
CME group.com because of their merger
with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

696
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:25,150
So, uh, this is the same thing that
we just saw. Uh, this is the price of,

697
00:47:25,151 --> 00:47:29,180
um, of a Bushel of wheat. Uh, and uh,

698
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:32,650
so this is, uh, uh,

699
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:38,260
as of um, uh, would it be last Friday,

700
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:43,030
932 cents a Bushel?
Uh,

701
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:47,840
and it ranged from 885 it
caused that it's high nine. No,

702
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,040
it closed it and opened it high.

703
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:53,350
It's high and it's settled down.

704
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,830
So we went down on the,

705
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:58,990
and this is for delivery in May of 2008.

706
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:04,340
And these contracts go out to 2010. This
doesn't show open interest, but, um,

707
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,660
you understand what this is, man. Um,

708
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:10,960
now the,
the real,

709
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:15,990
the price that we talk about when we talk
about commodities is the futures price

710
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:20,020
overwhelmingly. So, uh, the, uh,

711
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:25,021
this is the Chicago board
of trade price for corn,

712
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:30,040
um, since 1929 I, we could
take it even further back,

713
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:34,080
but because he's exchangers,
exchanges have been going since, uh,

714
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:38,260
the CBOT goes back to the 1860s.
But anyway,

715
00:48:38,261 --> 00:48:40,030
this is the long time horizon,

716
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,860
a plot of the price of corn.
Uh,

717
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:49,630
and I adjusted it for CPI inflation.
And so this shows,

718
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:55,000
uh, in dollars per Bushel, of course,
contracts are for 5,000 bushels.

719
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:59,950
So you'd have to multiply
these numbers by 5,000. Um, so,

720
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:00,813
uh,

721
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:05,110
and this just shows what has been
happening to the real price of corn since

722
00:49:05,111 --> 00:49:08,280
1929. There's a lot of
talk recently. It must,

723
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:12,460
you must have heard it about
this spike up. Uh, in fact,

724
00:49:12,461 --> 00:49:13,900
it's quite a hefty spike up.

725
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:18,160
It's a doubled more than doubled in real
terms and just the last couple of years.

726
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,420
Do you know why this is?
Why is corn getting expensive right now?

727
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:28,240
But what's there, right?
It's, that's the theory.

728
00:49:28,241 --> 00:49:30,450
I think it's right that,
uh,

729
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,900
it's because oil prices are
getting high and because, uh,

730
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:38,860
we can make alternative fuels out of,
um,

731
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:43,120
food stuffs a cane or corn.

732
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,670
And so in response to the high oil prices,

733
00:49:46,671 --> 00:49:49,270
as also subsidies for ethanol production,

734
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:55,080
corn is being demanded to run automobiles
a and all these rich people who want

735
00:49:56,921 --> 00:50:01,870
their SUV is they want
to, uh, have a good drive,

736
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:07,120
are now paying more for
the corn and bidding it up.

737
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:12,120
And this is a huge international crisis
because it's spreading over all of the

738
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:17,380
grains. And it's a, it's a
worrisome situation because,

739
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:18,190
uh,

740
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:23,190
people in some of the poorest parts of
the world cannot tolerate a doubling of

741
00:50:23,201 --> 00:50:27,530
the price of grain.
Uh, they'll starve. Uh,

742
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:32,620
and so this is a huge moral issue that
we're facing right now that in order to

743
00:50:32,631 --> 00:50:37,470
keep our cars going, we're driving
some people to starvation. Uh,

744
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:40,340
on the other hand, uh, I
don't mean to minimize that.

745
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:45,130
I thought it was interesting to
look at the whole run of, uh,

746
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:50,250
of corn prices back to 1929 and
they have come down a great deal.

747
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:55,250
Uh, it's quite curious if
you correct for inflation,

748
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:58,730
it was like $15 a Bushel in 1950.

749
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:01,460
On top of that,
our incomes have risen.

750
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,550
And so I think this says
something about why futures,

751
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:07,520
agricultural futures are not as
prominent as they used to be.

752
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:12,970
It used to be that food was really a
lot more expensive and a bigger share of

753
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:17,030
our income.
And we live in a very plenty as time.

754
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:22,031
This is very unusual by
historical standards right
now you just eat whatever you

755
00:51:22,101 --> 00:51:26,630
want, right? You don't even
look at the price, right?
It's also cheap. Maybe you do,

756
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:30,380
maybe you don't eat caviar
for because of price. But, uh,

757
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:35,330
we're just in a time of plenty
with the real price of food so low,

758
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:39,100
it's not normal times
historically. So, uh,

759
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,100
agricultural futures are
somewhat, uh, downplayed.

760
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:47,970
But I wanted to give an
example of wheat futures, um,

761
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:50,960
because, uh, this is, um,

762
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,110
uh, we have a reading on the reading
list by Holbrook working. Uh,

763
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:02,230
Holbrook working was the great theorist
of futures markets and it's actually,

764
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:02,990
uh,

765
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:07,850
read the reading comes from the 1950s
and he is explaining futures market.

766
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:09,420
I like this,
uh,

767
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:13,460
article because it sets it forth very
well and nothing has changed since the

768
00:52:13,461 --> 00:52:17,180
1950s except that the
markets are electronic now.

769
00:52:17,810 --> 00:52:20,930
So I wanted to focus in
on one futures market.

770
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:26,140
And this is the market for wheat and are
these are the standards for delivery at

771
00:52:27,861 --> 00:52:32,060
the Chicago Board of trade. I got this
off their website and this is current.

772
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:34,610
This is today. Uh, if you,

773
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:39,340
one contract is 5,000 bushels, okay. Uh,

774
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:44,290
they will accept a number of different
kinds of wheat that meet there. There,

775
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:48,230
there must be some standards for quality,
no bugs in it and whatever else.

776
00:52:48,830 --> 00:52:50,930
But Dell except number two,

777
00:52:50,931 --> 00:52:55,760
soft red winter or number two,
hard red winter,

778
00:52:56,360 --> 00:53:00,530
uh, are, uh, what is it?
See, I just copied this from,

779
00:53:00,531 --> 00:53:04,220
there were no nar,
it says no dark northern spring.

780
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,560
Now it must be numbers,
something. What happened?

781
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:12,020
I must've lost the number two northern
spring and all those are at par.

782
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,850
However, you can also deliver
a number one soft red winter.

783
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:22,100
That's different cause we, this is number
two, soft red winter or a number one,

784
00:53:22,101 --> 00:53:23,990
hard red winter or number one,

785
00:53:23,991 --> 00:53:28,080
dark northern and not
number one northern spring.

786
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,960
And you get 3 cents a Bushel
over the contract price.

787
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:35,010
What's they're trying to do is recognize
that there is so many different kinds

788
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:39,120
of wheat. Um, and so I thought, um,

789
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:44,460
uh, we would remind
ourselves of um, of what,

790
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,800
uh, they are, uh,

791
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,890
one c hard, uh, hard. It's soft.

792
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:56,070
Wheat is used for making biscuits and
breast breakfast cereals and cakes and

793
00:53:56,071 --> 00:54:00,280
hard wheat is used for
making bread. Uh, and if you,

794
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:04,590
if you do baking, you should not
just always use all purpose flour.

795
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:09,140
You should get the different varieties
and that's what is being mentioned here,

796
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:13,800
these different varieties.
Um, okay. Now I wanted to,

797
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,140
uh, let me see. Uh,

798
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:20,840
I wanted to talk about the
Holbrook working paper, uh,

799
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,740
Holbrook working talks about, I'm
sorry, I'm having trouble about,

800
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,800
um, uh, it's, uh, let me,

801
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:32,920
the difference between winter is
anyone here was a farmer or great,

802
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:37,590
did anyone grow up on a farm? Can
anyone tell the story of a winter wheat?

803
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:42,240
Nope. Nobody. We're not very
down to earth people here. Okay.

804
00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:47,940
There's two s two planty.
There's winter wheat and spring wheat,

805
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:53,160
winter wheat. You plant it in the
winter and you harvested in the spring.

806
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:57,660
Uh, it stays in the ground all winter
and it comes up the first thing and it's

807
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:01,200
coming up now and you
harvest winter wheat in May,

808
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,360
so we're almost close to the harvest.

809
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:08,630
Did you know that there are these way
amber waves of grain flowing in the wind

810
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:13,050
out there and the wheat belt
right now? Uh, and they're there.

811
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:18,270
They will soon be harvested in a another
month and a half spring wheat you

812
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:21,250
planted in the spring and you
harvest it in the fall. Uh,

813
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:23,550
but they're allowing now
delivery of either one.

814
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:26,520
When Holbrook working wrote the paper,

815
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:30,870
there was a separate contract
for hard winter wheat. Uh,

816
00:55:30,871 --> 00:55:35,430
and so I think that there's
some consolidation of these
markets as agricultural

817
00:55:35,431 --> 00:55:39,420
futures is becoming less important.
So that's why we just have,

818
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:43,410
this is the only cbot wheat
market, uh, that's listed now.

819
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:47,820
Okay. So, um, you understand
what the contract is.

820
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:51,990
The contract is to deliver one of
these varieties and there's a separate

821
00:55:51,991 --> 00:55:55,410
contract for each of these dates. Uh, and

822
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,110
okay, so the, what is the
pricing? This is the thing,

823
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:06,200
what is the futures
price? Uh, now there's,

824
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,060
this is what I'm going
to try to conclude on.

825
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:13,560
It depends on whether
wheat is in storage or not.

826
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:19,040
Normally we is in storage because we
only harvest of particular variety once a

827
00:56:20,161 --> 00:56:24,910
year and we have to consume it all
year, right? So after the harvest,

828
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:29,830
the warehouses get full and then they're,
they're brimming with wheat.

829
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,220
Okay.
And then as the year goes down,

830
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,280
the warehouses deplete their
contents of wheat and it hits zero,

831
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:39,041
right?

832
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:43,240
When the new harvest comes in and then
it all gets booked packet back into the

833
00:56:43,241 --> 00:56:46,040
warehouse. This is a
physical necessity. Uh,

834
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:49,780
when there is wheat in storage,

835
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:55,920
normally most of the time this relation
should hold the price of the futures

836
00:56:57,461 --> 00:57:02,461
contract should equal the spot price
times one plus the interest rate between

837
00:57:05,231 --> 00:57:07,750
now and delivery.
Uh,

838
00:57:07,751 --> 00:57:12,580
and that is that it means that if say
interest rates are 5% a year and the

839
00:57:12,581 --> 00:57:17,230
delivery is in six months,
then this should be 0.025,

840
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:21,610
right half of a year. I want to,
it's not annual interest rate,

841
00:57:21,611 --> 00:57:25,850
it's the interest rate until delivery
or if it's a third of a year, you know,

842
00:57:25,851 --> 00:57:29,830
you divide by whatever the,
uh, it's the interest from,

843
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:34,950
from today until delivery date and s is
the cost of storage from today until the

844
00:57:36,941 --> 00:57:37,774
delivery date.

845
00:57:40,330 --> 00:57:44,950
This should hold normally all the time.

846
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:46,870
And why is that?

847
00:57:46,871 --> 00:57:51,370
Because if I'm running a
warehouse storing grain,

848
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:52,970
I'm uh,

849
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:57,990
I can either sell at the spot price
or I can today I can always unload my

850
00:57:58,631 --> 00:58:00,010
warehouse and sell it today.

851
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:05,560
Or I can wait and deliver it in
the future at the futures contract.

852
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,500
But at today as a warehouse,

853
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:13,150
I'm losing money because
of the cost of storage. Uh,

854
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:16,460
I have to pay insurance and I have
to do other things that are, that,

855
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,880
that maintain the quality of my storage.

856
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:22,090
And that's s on top of that,

857
00:58:22,091 --> 00:58:26,230
I'm losing an interest because
if I'm storing the grain,

858
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:30,070
I'm not getting interest on the
money that I paid for that grade.

859
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,230
So that's another loss to me.

860
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:35,650
So this is the breakeven
for storing grain.

861
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:41,220
If the future's price is enough above
the spot price that it pays for my

862
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:46,240
interest cost and my storage costs,
I'm making money storing grain, right?

863
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:50,320
If,
if the future's price is below this,

864
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,470
I'm not going to store grain.
I'll unload my warehouse.

865
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,420
Why should I store grain
for another minute?

866
00:58:56,050 --> 00:59:00,790
If I'm a professional warehouse offer
and I see that I can make more money by

867
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:05,280
selling my grain today,
then I will do it. Um,

868
00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:09,880
conversely, if the future's
price is above the spot price,

869
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,210
uh, then I'm going to
want to store more grain.

870
00:59:13,211 --> 00:59:17,650
I'm going to go out and buy up other grain
and that's going to tend to force the

871
00:59:17,651 --> 00:59:18,790
spot price up.

872
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:23,750
So this relationship to
hold almost all the time,

873
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:28,100
or you might say it holds all the
time if you interpret it correctly.

874
00:59:29,060 --> 00:59:34,060
Normally the futures price is above the
cash price because interest rates are

875
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:39,260
positive and storage costs are
positive and it has to be that way.

876
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:44,560
The normal course of brain of grain
prices over the harvest year is to rise as

877
00:59:46,611 --> 00:59:50,000
the year progresses because
it has to be that way.

878
00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:53,810
The grain is cheapest
right after the harvest,

879
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:57,950
when there's a lots of green around,
uh,

880
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:03,040
and then the grain price goes up steadily
throughout the year until the new

881
01:00:04,941 --> 01:00:08,530
harvest comes in and then it
collapses. So it's the, the,

882
01:00:08,531 --> 01:00:13,250
the price of grain over
the year, uh, is, uh,

883
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,760
it's a sawtooth pattern.
Uh,

884
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:21,190
if there's nothing interfering with it,
the

885
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:25,950
price of grain,
uh,

886
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:30,330
we'll tend to look like this.

887
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:38,570
Okay. And these are the
harvest, right? And,

888
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:43,120
and the reason that the price of grain
is going up between harvest is to

889
01:00:43,121 --> 01:00:44,710
compensate the warehouse owners.

890
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:47,500
They're not going to do this business
if they're not getting compensated.

891
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:51,630
So this is almost like an iron
law. This is going to hold, um,

892
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,780
but it doesn't necessarily home,
uh,

893
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:58,120
in a given year because there's
other things that affect price.

894
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:03,090
Uh, so this is what I was saying, that
arbitrage enforces spirit bear valley.

895
01:01:03,490 --> 01:01:07,960
But there is a problem if
there is no grain in storage.

896
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:12,490
So for example, right at the harvest
end when the harvest is coming in,

897
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:17,020
the relation between futures and
spot price can become very erratic.

898
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:22,000
The futures price can be way below
the fair value, the right hand side,

899
01:01:22,001 --> 01:01:24,850
spot times one plus r plus
acids called fair value.

900
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:29,030
Futures can be below
fair value. Uh, and, and,

901
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:33,700
and there's no way to for arbitrage
to make up the difference because,

902
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:39,190
uh, there's nothing if the
future is we're very low, uh,

903
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:43,210
let me see.
You would want to take money out of,

904
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:46,630
take grain out of storage and sell
it on the spot price, that market.

905
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:49,060
But if there isn't whole grain in storage,
you can't do that.

906
01:01:49,930 --> 01:01:54,010
So it sometimes happens when
the grain is not in storage,

907
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,610
that the price of the
future is below fair value.

908
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:01,270
But there's another interpretation
of it. People would say, well,

909
01:02:01,271 --> 01:02:06,250
but there is still some grain in
storage. It's not gone everywhere. Uh,

910
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:10,870
so how can it sometimes be that the
futures price is below fair value?

911
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:14,710
Well, you might say, and
this is, um, that, um,

912
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:16,430
that the,

913
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:22,080
you could either say that sometimes
the between price and fair value is

914
01:02:22,621 --> 01:02:26,640
violated, or you could say,
no, it's never violated.

915
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:31,020
But sometimes the storage
cost is negative. Uh,

916
01:02:31,021 --> 01:02:34,040
and so we have something
called convenience yield,

917
01:02:35,610 --> 01:02:37,470
which has a negative storage costs.

918
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:42,530
Suppose you are a,
uh,

919
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:47,570
corn merchant and you're noting that
right now the market is in backwardation.

920
01:02:47,671 --> 01:02:51,870
The futures price is less than the
spot price. So you're thinking,

921
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:57,320
uh, I want to, I want to
get grain somehow, uh,

922
01:02:57,330 --> 01:02:59,550
and sell it on the spot
market and I'll make money.

923
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:05,010
So you go around trying to find someone
to sell your grain and you find that

924
01:03:05,011 --> 01:03:09,480
someone has it and won't sell it to
you. And you'd say, well, why not?

925
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:14,540
Uh, and the guy will say, because I
need this grain, who has green, when,

926
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:18,630
when the market is in backwardation,
uh, it's somebody who really needs it.

927
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:22,890
So for example, in the
case of, uh, of wheat,

928
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:27,570
you might find that you go to the
factor that makes weedies. Okay.

929
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:32,520
And you say, uh, uh, I,
I'd like to buy your wheat.

930
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:36,060
Uh, have noting that, uh, uh,

931
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:39,390
the spot price is really high or
you won't tell him that. I said,

932
01:03:39,391 --> 01:03:44,110
I just want to buy your week, whatever
you've got, I'll buy it at the, uh, um,

933
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,970
uh, at the, uh, and uh,

934
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:52,290
you shouldn't put it that I guess I'm
saying that was not going to work.

935
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:52,950
If you do,

936
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:57,950
why doesn't the weedies manufacturer
sell it's grain on the spot market?

937
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:04,980
The reason is that they need
we to make weedies. And so,

938
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:09,870
uh, for them they want to have
some on hand. They might think,

939
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:12,510
well,
if we didn't have any storage of wheat,

940
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:17,070
we would be at the mercy of delivery.
And who knows when the harvest is out.

941
01:04:17,071 --> 01:04:20,460
Now we might not be able to get any
wheat and we might have to shut our whole

942
01:04:20,461 --> 01:04:25,170
factory down and tell everyone to take
a day off. That costs us a lot of money.

943
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,370
So you know,
we're,

944
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:31,400
we really need to have wheat in storage
at the Wheaties factory and so at when

945
01:04:32,491 --> 01:04:35,600
the market is in
backwardation, uh, the, um,

946
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:40,110
the only grain that stored is, is the, um,

947
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,160
is the grain that's there
for convenience purpose.

948
01:04:45,030 --> 01:04:50,030
So I was just going to go through the
example that Holbrook working gives a in

949
01:04:51,271 --> 01:04:51,751
his reading,

950
01:04:51,751 --> 01:04:56,751
which you have a back then there
was a number two hard winter wheat,

951
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:01,320
Kansas City, a future maybe there
still is, I don't know, but not CVOT,

952
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:06,180
but he's, we're going to do
this 1956 or seven story.

953
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:11,370
Okay. Or here I have it here.
Hard wheat is used for bread,

954
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:16,290
soft wheat for five. Remember
this? A cooking tip. All right. Uh,

955
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:18,090
you can buy flour.
I tell you,

956
01:05:18,091 --> 01:05:22,360
I think grocery store and you
can buy cake flour and um,

957
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:23,413
there are different.

958
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:29,270
So Holbrook working is just talking
about what happens in a typical year for

959
01:05:30,820 --> 01:05:31,840
winter wheat.

960
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:37,140
So we're starting out now with
July to July to a typical year.

961
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:42,130
A spot wheat was a 229 cents a Bushel.

962
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:47,220
That's the price on July to the
September future is 232 cents a Bushel.

963
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:53,270
So the difference between the future
and the spot is called the basis, uh,

964
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:58,580
which is 3 cents a Bushel.
He is another term is a spot premium,

965
01:05:58,581 --> 01:06:02,290
but that would be minus three. But
that's this, just talk about basis.

966
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:06,310
The basis is the futures
price minus the spot price.

967
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:10,990
All right. Uh, so this
just a typical story.

968
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:16,170
So the future's price is
selling for higher as it
should be because between July

969
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:17,800
and September,
this is winter wheat.

970
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:21,130
The harvest is recently and
the harvest came in in May.

971
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:26,020
And so this is when there's a lot in
storage. Uh, and we really should see the,

972
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:28,810
the futures price above the spot price.
And,

973
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:32,800
and indeed we do this spot premium is a,

974
01:06:32,801 --> 01:06:37,310
is the profit that, uh, that
is offered to the warehouser.

975
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:41,530
The Weyerhaeuser looks at this are
the basis the warehouser people in the

976
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:45,600
warehouse business are always watching
this every day. And there's looking, oh,

977
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:49,540
a basis of three. And they're thinking,
are we going to make money on that?

978
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:50,620
Because they have costs,

979
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:55,780
but this is how much more they can sell
it in the future then then they can sell

980
01:06:55,781 --> 01:06:59,110
it today. And so they're the
comparing the basis with their costs.

981
01:06:59,170 --> 01:07:04,000
They do that all the time in the warehouse
business. Now, September for now,

982
01:07:04,001 --> 01:07:07,150
it's still remembered the harvest was
made. We're not anywhere near the harvest,

983
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:11,670
uh, here. Um, now we still have a, a base,

984
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:14,980
but now the basis has gotten smaller.
This is what happens.

985
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:18,430
So the warehouse operator,
it's starting to feel uncomfortable.

986
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:22,000
I was doing really well in July.
I had a basis of three.

987
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:25,000
Now the basis is down to
one. And so, you know,

988
01:07:25,001 --> 01:07:29,440
it's getting kind of iffy for me whether
I can make money, maybe I should sell.

989
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:34,450
Uh, and so they're always watching these
markets and thinking about that. Um,

990
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:40,090
uh, I'm sorry, I take that back.

991
01:07:40,091 --> 01:07:44,200
I forgot. This is both the
September future, right?

992
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:45,873
So,
uh,

993
01:07:45,910 --> 01:07:50,140
the basis should get smaller because we're
getting closer to the expiration date,

994
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:55,840
right? Because now it's only one month
interest. Well, actually it's even less.

995
01:07:55,841 --> 01:07:58,070
We're almost expiring. Yeah. I,

996
01:07:58,071 --> 01:08:03,071
I wasn't thinking when I first saw that
the basis should shrink to zero as the

997
01:08:04,241 --> 01:08:07,720
time as you approach the
expiration of the contract.

998
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,620
So someone in a warehouse,
uh,

999
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:16,250
who's worried about the fluctuation in
the grain will sell it the futures market,

1000
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:21,080
uh, and then expect to
get the basis because, uh,

1001
01:08:21,140 --> 01:08:23,420
it doesn't matter what
the price of grain does,

1002
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:28,460
the spot and the future is probably should
converge. The basis should go to zero.

1003
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:33,670
And the 3 cents a Bushel is the profit
that they make on the futures trade.

1004
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:36,080
Uh, and so, and it's,

1005
01:08:36,190 --> 01:08:40,790
it's riskless for them at the warehouse
because they're hedging the price risk

1006
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:46,160
and that becomes a nice, clean and easy
business. So I'm looking in July too,

1007
01:08:46,161 --> 01:08:49,280
to see what are my costs at the warehouse.

1008
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:54,320
And I'm looking at this basis and I think
if I can keep my costs under 3 cents a

1009
01:08:54,321 --> 01:08:57,010
Bushel, including interest, uh,

1010
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:01,640
then I will make money because this
basis is going to converge to zero at the

1011
01:09:01,641 --> 01:09:05,510
end for sure.
And so are the spot premium.

1012
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,020
We'll go from minus three to zero.
So this is a normal month.

1013
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:13,730
Someone's storing grain had this basis
of 3 cents a Bushel and is doing business

1014
01:09:13,731 --> 01:09:17,360
as usual, storing for less than
that and making money. And if,

1015
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:21,720
if not less than that, they'd
get out of it. Um, and so, um,

1016
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:27,470
then continuing through the year, um, uh,

1017
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:32,500
now they roll into December futures
because I'm still storing grain that I do

1018
01:09:33,111 --> 01:09:36,730
this all year, right? I'm
trading in the, in the,

1019
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,910
the nearest month contract because that's
where the open interest is and that's

1020
01:09:40,911 --> 01:09:45,590
where all the trading is.
And so as soon as the, uh,

1021
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:49,760
September contract expires,
I don't actually want to deliver.

1022
01:09:49,761 --> 01:09:53,900
I'll sell out and I'll make the profit,
which is the change in basis.

1023
01:09:54,740 --> 01:09:57,800
Now when it comes to, uh,
and now September four,

1024
01:09:57,801 --> 01:09:59,930
I've made that profit of 2 cents a Bushel.

1025
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:03,800
The difference between the 3 cents
a Bushel basis and the one sentence.

1026
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:08,540
And now I start a new contract to
now because September is expiring,

1027
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:12,820
I move in, I rolled over into
the December contract, uh,

1028
01:10:12,821 --> 01:10:17,120
and I'm just going to do this
every con every three months, uh,

1029
01:10:17,121 --> 01:10:21,020
I'm going to roll over into the
next contract. So in this case,

1030
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:25,400
I didn't put the basis, the basis was
five and three quarters cents a Bushel.

1031
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,430
So now it's looking even
better here in September,

1032
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:32,150
I'm had jumps around the basis,
jumps around with market conditions,

1033
01:10:32,151 --> 01:10:36,050
but it's looking good now because I
have a basis of five and three quarters

1034
01:10:36,051 --> 01:10:38,910
since.
And so I'll buy,

1035
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:44,020
I'll sell my grain again on a futures
contract and then I will close it out.

1036
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:50,510
December when the, and this is
December one now. Now the price of, of,

1037
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:55,220
of, of wheat has gone up a
lot from two 38 to two 52.

1038
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:59,280
But you know, it's not going to be a
profit for me. I, I'm not, I'm, I'm,

1039
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,510
I hedged it, but I'll make the, for me,

1040
01:11:02,511 --> 01:11:04,640
the profit is the change
in the spot premium.

1041
01:11:04,641 --> 01:11:07,910
So I made five and three quarters
cents a Bushel minus my cost,

1042
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:11,270
and then I'll just stop.
[inaudible] I'm running out of time.

1043
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:16,470
What happens at harvest? I'm doing
this all year. Finally on May,

1044
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:21,330
this is the new harvest is coming
in. And look what happens. Now,

1045
01:11:21,331 --> 01:11:24,020
this market is suddenly,
uh,

1046
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:29,090
in backwardation now look what's happening
in the Spock premium is 18 cents a

1047
01:11:29,401 --> 01:11:33,800
Bushel. The basis is minus
18. If I hold on, if I,

1048
01:11:33,801 --> 01:11:36,510
if I roll into July futures and hold on,

1049
01:11:36,511 --> 01:11:41,250
I'm going to lose really big time.
So I'm out, I'm out of the business.

1050
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:44,040
We sell off everything in
the warehouse and we're done.

1051
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:49,700
So this is the process
by which warehousing is
optimized and we get drained

1052
01:11:50,791 --> 01:11:52,080
smoothly through the year,

1053
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:55,670
but it's a basic principle that
we'll see in the next lecture, uh,

1054
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:59,760
extends as well to other,
um, other kinds of, uh,

1055
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,110
financial futures.

1056
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:06,120
So next period we're going to
talk about other kinds of futures,

1057
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:08,610
uh,
including financial futures.
