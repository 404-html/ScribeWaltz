1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,730
So today I want him to
then, uh, the today,

2
00:00:05,731 --> 00:00:10,540
the title of today's lecture is, um, uh,

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,230
uh, what is it, uh, the universal
principle of risk management,

4
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,070
a pooling and the hedging of risk.
Uh,

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,390
and what I'm really referring
to is I think the, the,

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,500
the very original,

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,090
the deep concept that
underlies theoretical finance.
I wanted to get that first.

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,840
Uh, and it really is
probability theory, uh,

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,960
and the idea of spreading
risk through risk pooling.

10
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,610
So this idea, uh, is, um,

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,510
it's an intellectual construct that, uh,
appeared at a certain point in history,

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,880
uh, and it has had
amazing, uh, number of, uh,

13
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,960
applications and finance is one of these.

14
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,390
Uh, so I, I want some of
you, uh, this incident,

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,830
they will be a more
technical of my lectures.

16
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,040
And so it's a little bit unfortunate
that it comes early in the semester.

17
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,880
For those of you who've had a course
in probability and statistics,

18
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:14,250
there will be nothing new here. Uh, well,

19
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,330
nothing in terms of the mat of the
probability theory, new, uh, others.

20
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:23,160
Though I want to tell you
that, uh, uh, it doesn't,

21
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:27,990
uh, if you're shopping, if I had a student
come by yesterday and ask that, uh,

22
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:31,830
he's a little rusty and his math
skills and should he take this course?

23
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,650
And I said, well, if you,
if you can understand, uh,

24
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,730
two miles elected as today's lecture,
uh, then you should have no problem.

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,310
Uh, but, uh, so I wanted
to start with the, uh,

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,990
the, uh, concept of, of
probability. And, uh,

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,640
you know what a probability
is. Uh, it's a no,

28
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,390
we attach a probability to an event.
Okay.

29
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,700
So what is the probability that the
stock market will go up this year? Okay.

30
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:03,530
Uh,

31
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,530
I would say point my
personal probability 0.45.

32
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,270
And so that's what I'm
a bear. But, uh, that's,

33
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:18,780
you know what that means that 45 times
out of a hundred of stock market will go

34
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:22,470
up and the other 55 times out of 100,

35
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:27,210
it will stay the same or go
down. Uh, that's a probability.

36
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,220
Uh, and now you're familiar
with that concept, right?

37
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,690
If someone says the probability is 0.5,
5.45,

38
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,010
you know what that means.

39
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,290
But I wanted to emphasize that it
always hasn't always been that way.

40
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,250
Uh,

41
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,250
and that probability is really a
concept that arose in the 16 hundreds,

42
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:51,541
uh,

43
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:56,400
before that nobody ever
said that Ian Hacking,

44
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,970
who is a,
uh,

45
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,140
he wrote a history of probability theory
searched through world literature for

46
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:09,541
any reference to a probability and
could find none anywhere before 1600.

47
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,990
So there was an intellectual leap
that occurred in the 17th century,

48
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:17,980
uh,

49
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,980
and it became a very fashionable
to talk in terms of probabilities.

50
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,620
It spread throughout the world, the
idea of quoting probabilities. Uh,

51
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,800
but it was, it's, it's, it's
funny that's such a simple idea.

52
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,250
Hadn't been used before.
Hacking points out that, uh,

53
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,190
the word probability or probable
was already in the English language.

54
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,070
Uh, in fact, Shakespeare used it.

55
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,320
But what do you think it meant
now? He gives an example of, um,

56
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:55,600
a young woman who was describing
a man that she likes and she says,

57
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,950
I liked him very much. I
find him very probable. Okay.

58
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,590
What do you think she means?
Cause I'm going to answer that.

59
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,770
Then he went no Elizabethan English well
enough to tell me what does a probably

60
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,450
young man anyway, I'm
asking for an answer.

61
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,350
Say it sounds like people have no idea.
Right.

62
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:20,910
Okay.

63
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,080
Anyone venture a guess?

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,480
Yeah,

65
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,770
no one wants to venture a guess

66
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,870
that he can father children.
Uh,

67
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,440
I don't think that's what she meant,

68
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:40,860
but maybe now what? Uh, what, uh,

69
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:45,450
apparently she met is trustworthy.
Okay.

70
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,630
That's very important quality
in a person I suppose. Right?

71
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:52,830
So if something is probable, you
mean that you can trust it. Okay.

72
00:04:52,831 --> 00:04:56,740
And so probability means
trustworthiness. And so, uh,

73
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,140
uh,

74
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,880
you can see how they moved from that
definition of probability to the current

75
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:05,150
definition.
Um,

76
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,410
but Ian Hacking being a good
historian, uh, thought, you know,

77
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:15,320
someone must've had some concept
of probability going before, uh,

78
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,320
even if they didn't quote it as a number
the way there must have been in their

79
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:20,490
head or in their idea.

80
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,730
So he searched through world literature
to try to find some use of the term that

81
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,830
preceded the 16 hundreds.

82
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:34,310
And he concluded that there were probably
a number of people who had the idea,

83
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,530
but they didn't publish it. And it
never became part of the established,

84
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,210
uh, uh, uh, literature. Uh,

85
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,270
partly because he said
throughout human history,

86
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,450
there has been a love of gambling and
probability theory is extremely useful if

87
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:56,550
you are a gambler.

88
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:02,230
And hacking believes that there were
many gambling theorists who invented

89
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:06,770
probability theory at
various times in history, uh,

90
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:11,150
and never wrote it down. And
I kept it as a secret. Uh,

91
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,410
and he gives an example.
I like to, um, uh,

92
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,070
he gives an example from a book that,

93
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:24,710
or it's a collection.
No,

94
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,410
this, uh, I think there's a,

95
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,360
this is a collection of epic
poems written in Sanskrit.

96
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,120
Uh, and that goes back, uh,

97
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,250
it actually risen written over a
course of a thousand years, uh,

98
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,650
and it was completed in the fourth
century. Uh, well, there's a story,

99
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:48,600
there's a long story in the Mahabharata,
uh,

100
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,040
about a emperor called Nala.
Uh,

101
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:56,190
and he had a wife named Demante,
uh,

102
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,010
and he was very pure and
very good person. Uh, but,

103
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:02,660
uh, there was an, uh,

104
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,870
an evil demon called Kali who hated
Nava and wanted to bring his downfall.

105
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:14,810
So we had to find a weakness of Nala.
Uh,

106
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:19,670
and he found finally some, even though
Nala was so pure and so perfect,

107
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,530
he found one weakness and
that was gambling. Now,

108
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:26,300
I couldn't resist the
opportunity to gamble.

109
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,720
So the evil demon seduced
him into gambling aggressive.

110
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,160
And you know how sometime
when you're losing,

111
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:38,900
you readable and you keep hoping to
win back what you've lost? Uh, in a,

112
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,730
in a fit of gambling,

113
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:45,790
Nala finally gambled his
entire kingdom and lost,

114
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,660
okay. The terrible story and not a
of them had to leave the kingdom.

115
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:53,720
And his wife and, uh,
they wandered for years.

116
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:56,450
He separated from her
because of dire necessity.

117
00:07:56,451 --> 00:08:00,440
They were wandering in the
forest, uh, and he was in despair,

118
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:03,530
having lost everything.
But then he meets, uh,

119
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,790
someone by the name of a,
who do we have here we have Nala,

120
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,610
and he meets this man to paranoia.

121
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,880
And this is where a probability
theory apparently comes in.

122
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,260
[inaudible] partner tells not lot that
he knows the science of gambling and he

123
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,710
will teach it to Nala,

124
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:31,190
but it has to be done by whispering in
his ear because it's a deep and extreme

125
00:08:32,191 --> 00:08:34,740
secret.
And Nala is skeptical.

126
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,610
How does [inaudible] and know
how to gamble? Uh, and so, uh,

127
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:42,900
too paranoid tries to prove to
him his abilities. And he says,

128
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,430
see that tree there,

129
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,650
I can estimate how many leaves there are
on that tree by counting want leaves on

130
00:08:49,651 --> 00:08:50,484
one branch.

131
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:55,670
So over to paranoia looked at one branch
and then estimated the of leaves on the

132
00:08:55,891 --> 00:09:00,210
tree.
And Nala was a skeptical.

133
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,540
So he stayed up all night and counted
every leaf on the tree and it came very

134
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:11,070
close to what Nala or lot route
two parent. I said, uh, and so,

135
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,470
uh, he next morning believes Nala
and begins I believe for two partner.

136
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,280
Uh, now this is interesting.
Uh, hacking says,

137
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:24,560
because it shows that sampling theory, it
was part of knowledge theory. You could,

138
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,760
you don't have to count
all the leaves on the tree.

139
00:09:26,761 --> 00:09:31,190
You take a sample and you count
that and then you multiply. Um,

140
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,060
so anyway,
they story ends.

141
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,260
Nala goes back and now armed
with probability theory,

142
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:40,650
we assume he goes back and Gamble's again.

143
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,210
He has nothing left to wager
except his wife. So he back,

144
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,900
he puts her and Gamble's her,
uh,

145
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,700
if I remember now he
knows what he's doing. Uh,

146
00:09:50,701 --> 00:09:52,800
and so he really wasn't gambling his wife.

147
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,080
He's really a very pure
and honorable man. But, uh,

148
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,720
and so he won back the entire kingdom.
Uh, and uh, that's the ending.

149
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,100
So anyway, that shows that
I think probability theory
does have a long history,

150
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,350
but it not being an intellectual
discipline, it didn't really inform,

151
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:15,690
uh, uh, a generation of finance.
When you don't have a theory,

152
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,410
then you don't have a way
to be rigorous. So, um,

153
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:26,900
it was in the 16 hundreds that probability
theory started to get written down as

154
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:32,010
a theory and many things
then happen in that century,

155
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,580
which I think are precursors
both to finance and insurance.

156
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,220
One was in the 16 hundreds,

157
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,870
people started constructing life tables.
What does a life table?

158
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,080
It's a table showing the probability of
dying at each age for each age and sex.

159
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,010
Okay, that's what you need to know
if you're going to do life insurance.

160
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,460
So they started to do collecting of
data on mortality and they developed

161
00:10:58,771 --> 00:11:00,690
something called actuarial science,

162
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:05,160
which is estimating the
probability of people, uh, living,

163
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,200
uh, and so, uh, uh, that, uh,

164
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,370
then became the basis for insurance.

165
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,620
Now actually insurance goes back
to ancient Rome in some form.

166
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,030
In ancient Rome, they had
something called burial insurance.

167
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,510
You could buy a policy that
protected you against your family,

168
00:11:31,051 --> 00:11:34,520
not having the money to
bury you if you died, uh,

169
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:39,000
in an ancient culture of people worried
a great deal about being properly buried.

170
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,470
Uh, so that's an interesting concept. They
were selling that, uh, in ancient Rome.

171
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,730
But, uh, you might think, well,
why just for burial, why not?

172
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,100
Why don't you make it into
a full blown life insurance?

173
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,650
And you kind of wonder why they didn't.
Uh,

174
00:11:52,651 --> 00:11:56,140
I think it's maybe because they
didn't have the concepts down. Uh,

175
00:11:56,141 --> 00:12:00,220
in renaissance Italy,
they started writing insurance policies.

176
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,220
But I read one of the insurance policies.

177
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,050
It's in the Journal of risk and insurance.

178
00:12:05,051 --> 00:12:09,110
They translate a renaissance
insurance policy. Uh,

179
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,370
and it's very hard to understand
what this policy was saying.

180
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,810
I guess they didn't have our language.
They didn't, uh, it was, uh, uh,

181
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,160
there were intuitively halfway there,
but they couldn't express it.

182
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:26,140
So I think the industry didn't
get really started. So, uh,

183
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,310
I think it's the invention of
probability theory that really starts,

184
00:12:30,311 --> 00:12:34,210
and that's where I think theory is
very important in finance. And I,

185
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,610
um,
uh,

186
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,190
some people date a fire insurance
with the fire of London in 1666.

187
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:44,520
The whole city burned down,
uh,

188
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:49,150
practically in a terrible
fire and fire insurance.

189
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,560
I started to proliferate right after
that in London. But, uh, you know,

190
00:12:53,561 --> 00:12:57,790
you kind of wonder if that's a good
example for fire insurance because if the

191
00:12:57,791 --> 00:13:01,960
whole city burns down, insurance companies
would go bankrupt anyway. Right? Uh,

192
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,640
London insurance companies would,

193
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:08,620
because the whole concept of insurance
is pooling of independent probabilities.

194
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,570
Uh, and so, uh, but nonetheless,
that was the beginning.

195
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,360
Uh, we're also going to, uh,

196
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,750
recognize however that insurance
got a slow start because,

197
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:27,090
and I believe it is because people
could not understand the concept of

198
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:32,750
probability. They didn't have,
uh, they didn't have the, uh,

199
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,110
concept firmly in mind. There's
a lot of aspects to it. You know,

200
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,690
there's an APP in order
to understand probability,

201
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:45,180
you have to take things as
coming from a random event. Uh,

202
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,800
and people don't clearly have that in
their mind from an intuitive standpoint.

203
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,830
They have maybe a sense that I can
influence events by willing or wishing a,

204
00:13:56,831 --> 00:14:00,370
and if I think that if I have
kind of a mystical side to me,

205
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:05,100
then probabilities don't
have a clear meaning. Uh,

206
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,940
and it's been shown that even today,
people seem to think that,

207
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,710
that they don't really take at
an intuitive level probabilities,

208
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:19,810
uh, uh, very, uh, as objective.

209
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,891
So for example,

210
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:24,580
if you ask people how much they would
be willing to bet on a coin toss,

211
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:25,780
they were,

212
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,780
they will typically bet more if they can
toss the coin or they will bet more if

213
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:34,750
the coin hasn't been tossed yet and
it could have been already tossed in

214
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,030
concealed. And what, why would that be?

215
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,890
It might be this just some
intuitive sense that, um,

216
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:45,940
that I, that I can, I dunno, I can,

217
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,020
I have some magical forces in
me and I can change things.

218
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,650
So the idea of probability
theory is that no,

219
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:55,760
you can't change things.

220
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:59,480
There are these objective
laws of probability out
there that guide everything.

221
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,550
Most languages around the
world have, uh, a different,

222
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,250
uh, uh, uh,

223
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,680
word for luck and risk or luck.

224
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:17,710
And a fortune luck seems to
mean something about you.

225
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:20,990
I'm a lucky person.
I don't know what that means.

226
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:24,560
Like the God or gods favor me.
And so I'm lucky.

227
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,090
This is my lucky day.

228
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,230
A probability theory is really
a movement away from that.

229
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,840
And so we then have a
mathematical rigorous, uh, um, uh,

230
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,290
discipline. So, uh, now I'm going
to go through some of the, um,

231
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:44,760
uh, some of the terms of
probability here and uh,

232
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:50,580
um, this will be review
for many of you, but, uh,

233
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,590
it'll be something that we're
going to use in the, um,

234
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,683
so I use

235
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,500
the symbol p or I can sometimes write it
out as probability to represent a prob

236
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,480
probability.
Okay.

237
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,960
And it is always a number of that lies
between zero and one or between 0% and

238
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,780
100%.
Okay?

239
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,700
Percent means divided by a hundred
in Latin, right? So 100% is one.

240
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,950
Okay. And so this is the probability.
If the probability is zero,

241
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:29,810
that means the event can't happen.
If the probability is one,

242
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,280
it means it's certain to happen.
If the probability is,

243
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:38,240
does everyone see this from over there?
And if I could move,

244
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,660
I can't probably move
this or can I? Yes, I can.

245
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,940
Can you, you're the most disadvantaged
person and you can see it, right?

246
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,900
Uh, so, uh,

247
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,743
uh,

248
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,510
that's the basic idea.
Uh,

249
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,290
now one of the first principles of
probability is the idea of independence.

250
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,573
Okay?

251
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,873
Uh,

252
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:12,160
so the idea is that
probability, uh, is the, um,

253
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,513
uh,

254
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:18,530
measures the likelihood of some outcome.

255
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:22,010
Let's say the outcome of an
experiment, okay? Like tossing a coin,

256
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,990
you might say the probability that you'd
toss a coin that it comes up heads is a

257
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:31,340
half. Okay. Because equally
likely it heads and tails, uh,

258
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,460
independent experiments are experiments
that occur without relation to each

259
00:17:37,461 --> 00:17:38,270
other.

260
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:42,890
So if you toss a coin twice and the
first experiment doesn't influence the

261
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:44,510
second we say they're independent.

262
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,220
And so there there's no relation
between the two and one of the first of

263
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:53,130
probability that theory is
called the multiplication

264
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:55,723
rule.

265
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,150
And that says if you have
independent probabilities,

266
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,040
the probability of two events is equal
to the product and their probabilities.

267
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:13,280
So the probability of a and the

268
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
is equal to the probability of
a times the probability of B.

269
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,250
Okay.
Uh,

270
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,950
that wouldn't hold if
they're not independent.

271
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:37,390
The theory of insurance is that ideally
an insurance company wants to insure

272
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:40,280
independent events.
Okay.

273
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:44,000
And so ideally life
insurance is insuring people,

274
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,610
or fire insurance is insuring
people against independent event.

275
00:18:47,611 --> 00:18:50,440
So it's not the fire of London,
it's the,

276
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,630
it's the problem that sometimes people
knock over an oil lamp in their home and

277
00:18:56,781 --> 00:18:59,270
they burn their own house down.
Uh,

278
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:01,700
and so it's not going to
burn any other houses down.

279
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:03,920
It's this just completely
independent of anything else.

280
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:09,550
So the probability that the whole city
burns down is infinitesimally small.

281
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,820
Right. Uh, this, this will
generalize to probability of a,

282
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:18,040
and B and c is the probability of a times
the probability of B and probability

283
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,820
times the probability of c and so on.

284
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,890
So if their probability is
one in a thousand that a
house burns down and there's

285
00:19:24,891 --> 00:19:26,030
a thousand houses,

286
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,180
the probability that they all burned
down is prob is one 1000th to the

287
00:19:31,311 --> 00:19:34,040
thousandth power,
which is virtually zero.

288
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:39,310
And so insurance companies then basically
if they write a lot of policies,

289
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:44,080
they have virtually no risk.
Uh, and so that is the, um,

290
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:50,810
the fundamental idea,
which may seem simple and obvious to you,

291
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,930
but it certainly wasn't back
when the idea first came up. Uh,

292
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,650
so, uh, one of the, uh,
incident, we have a problem set,

293
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,040
which I want you to start
today and it will be do, uh,

294
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,480
not in a week this time because we have a,
uh,

295
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,390
Martin Luther King Day coming up,
but it will be due

296
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:17,720
the Monday following that. Uh, so the,

297
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,613
um,

298
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,933
uh,

299
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,950
if you follow through from the
independent theory, there's a, uh,

300
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,750
one of the basic relations in
probability theory is called the binomial

301
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:36,290
distribution.
And I'm not going to spend,

302
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,880
spend a whole lot of time on this.

303
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,013
Yes,

304
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,580
but it gives a probability of x
successes in n trials or in the case of

305
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:55,150
insurance, uh, x if you're
insuring against an accident,

306
00:20:55,510 --> 00:21:00,340
the probability that you'll get
x accidents and, and trials.

307
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,690
So, uh, it,

308
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:07,750
the binomial distribution gives
the probability as a function of x,

309
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,030
and it's given by the formula where
p is the probability of the accident,

310
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:14,740
uh,

311
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,740
p to the x times one
minus P to the n minus x,

312
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,823
uh,

313
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,840
times n factorial over
and minus x factorial.

314
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,880
Uh, and so, uh,

315
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,910
that is the formula that insurance
companies use when they have independent

316
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:44,701
probabilities to estimate the likelihood
of a having a certain number of

317
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:51,830
accidents. They're concerned with having
too many accidents, which might, um,

318
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,210
exhausted their reserves to an
insurance company has reserves and they,

319
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:57,590
they,

320
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,810
they have enough reserves to cover them
for a certain number of accidents and

321
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:04,600
they use the binomial distribution,
uh,

322
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,840
to calculate the probability of getting
any specific number of accidents.

323
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,690
So, uh, that is the multiplication,

324
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,240
the binomial distribution.

325
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,870
So I'm

326
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,190
not going to expand the hunters
because I can't get into detail.

327
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:27,190
This is not of course in
probability theory, but, uh,

328
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:31,630
I'm hopeful that you can see the formula
and you could apply it. All right.

329
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,100
Any questions? Is this clear enough
and you read my handwriting? Um,

330
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,550
okay. So, um,

331
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,650
another important concept in probability
theory that we will use a lot is

332
00:22:44,651 --> 00:22:49,330
expected value. Uh, and so, um,

333
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,070
the mean or average,
uh,

334
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,470
those are all roughly
interchangeable concepts.

335
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:58,300
So we have expected value

336
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,980
mean or average.

337
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:13,090
Okay. Um, so, uh,

338
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:17,170
but we can define it in a couple of
different ways depending on whether we're

339
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:22,030
talking about sample mean
or a population mean,

340
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,470
the basic definition,

341
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,440
the expected value of some
random variable x. Um,

342
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,550
I guess I should've said
he ran a variable is a, uh,

343
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:39,090
a quantity that takes on value is x.

344
00:23:39,611 --> 00:23:41,020
If you have an experiment.

345
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,950
And the outcome of the experiment is a
number than a random variable is that

346
00:23:45,951 --> 00:23:49,580
number which comes from the experiment.
So for example,

347
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:54,610
the experiment could be tossing a coin
and I will call the outcome heads the

348
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,590
number one and I'll call the
outcome tails the number zero.

349
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,630
So I've just defined a random variable.

350
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,820
You have discrete random variables like
the one I justified or there are also

351
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,640
con which take on only a
finite number of values.

352
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,910
And we have continuous random variables
they can take on any number of values

353
00:24:16,611 --> 00:24:17,630
along a continuum.

354
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:22,520
Another experiment would be to say
mixed two chemicals together and put a

355
00:24:22,521 --> 00:24:25,070
thermometer in and
measure the temperature.

356
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:30,050
That's another invention of
the 16 hundreds of by the
way, the thermometer. Uh,

357
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:33,920
and they learned that concept in the sig,
perfectly natural to us temperature,

358
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:38,120
right? But it was a new idea
in the 16 hundreds. So anyway,

359
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:42,050
that's continuous, right? When you
mix two chemicals together, uh,

360
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:46,040
it could be any number is an infinite
number of possible numbers and that would

361
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:49,370
be continuous for
discrete random variables.

362
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,040
We can define the expected
value or Musa backs.

363
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,080
That's the Greek letter mu,
uh, is the summation, uh,

364
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,180
I equals one to infinity
of the probability that x
equals x survive times x

365
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,470
rabbi. All right. So, uh, I,

366
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,930
I have it down that there might be an
infinite number of possible values for the

367
00:25:17,931 --> 00:25:22,430
random variable x. In the case of
the coin toss, there were only two,

368
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,790
but I'm saying in general there
could be an infinite number,

369
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:26,690
but they're accountable.

370
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,190
And so we can list all possible values
when they're discreet and form a

371
00:25:31,191 --> 00:25:34,010
probability weighted
average of the outcomes.

372
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,950
And that's called the expected value.
Uh,

373
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:41,000
and it's people also call that the
mean or the average, uh, often,

374
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,080
uh,
but you know that this is based on theory.

375
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,440
These are probabilities a,
okay.

376
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,900
In order to compute using this formula,

377
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:54,530
you have to know the
true pop probabilities.

378
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,570
There's another formula which applies
for a continuous random variables.

379
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:04,220
And it's the same idea
except that I'll also,

380
00:26:04,221 --> 00:26:08,050
I'll call it muse of x,
except that it's an indoor.

381
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:13,780
So we have the inner girl
from minus infinity to plus
infinity of f of x times x

382
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:21,840
Dx. Okay. And that's really easy.

383
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:26,360
It's the same thing because in integral
isn't an analogous to a summation.

384
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,213
Uh,

385
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,170
those are the two population definitions.
F of x is a,

386
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,090
is the continuous probability
distribution for x.

387
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:46,560
Uh, it gives a, I will, uh,
well, yeah, so that's different.

388
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,450
When you have continuous values,
you,

389
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,380
you don't have the probability that x
equals x to buy because it's always zero.

390
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:57,610
The probability that the temperature
is exactly a hundred degrees is zero

391
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:03,090
because it could be a hundred 0.0, zero,
zero one degrees or something else.

392
00:27:03,091 --> 00:27:05,010
And there's an infinite
number of possibilities.

393
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:10,160
So we have instead what's called the
probability density in when we have

394
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:12,830
continuous random variables.
Uh,

395
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,260
you're not going to need to know a lot
about this for this course, but this is,

396
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:18,860
I wanted to get the Jason,
the basic ideas down.

397
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,420
So these are called population measures
because they refer to the whole

398
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,480
population of possible outcome and
they measure the probabilities.

399
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:37,860
So it's, it's the truth, but
there are also sample means,

400
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,120
uh, when you would get,
this is, uh, the two parent.

401
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:46,920
Now counting the leaves on a tree,
you can estimate from a sample, uh,

402
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,990
the population expected values.

403
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:54,470
And so the population mean
is often written x bar.

404
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,060
If you have a sample with an observations,
it's the summation.

405
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,430
I equals one to n,

406
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,010
x of by divided by N. All
right? That's the average.

407
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,260
You know that formula, right? You
add, you get, you can't end leaves on,

408
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,290
you count the number of leaves. Uh, uh,

409
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,090
you have an well, you have
an branches on the tree, uh,

410
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:25,680
you count the number of leaves
and sum them up. Uh, one would be,

411
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,360
there is a, I guess I'm having a little
trouble putting this into the, uh,

412
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,510
the two part in the story, but you
see the idea, you know, the average,

413
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:38,070
I assume that's the most
elementary concept. Um, and,

414
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,700
uh,

415
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,700
and so you could use this to estimate
either a discrete or continuous expected

416
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:48,450
value. Uh, now they're in finance.

417
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,390
There's a often reference
to another kind of average,

418
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:55,770
which I want to refer you to and
which in the Jeremy Siegel book, uh,

419
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,290
there's a lot is made of this.
Uh,

420
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:02,610
and the other kind of average is
called the geometric average. Uh,

421
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,160
and so, um, we'll call that a,

422
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:10,470
I'm the only show the
sample version of it, uh,

423
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,560
g of x equals there's left
parentheses the product

424
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,680
I equals one to n act.

425
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,740
So by there's a one over
n power is everyone.

426
00:29:27,841 --> 00:29:31,200
Can you see that back there?
Um,

427
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:35,280
maybe you have trouble seeing
that, but uh, it's different.

428
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:38,130
Instead of summing them
and dividing by him,

429
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:42,640
I multiply them all together
and the route of them.

430
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,450
Uh, so this is called the geometric
average and it's used, uh,

431
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:53,540
only for positive numbers. So if
you have any negative numbers, uh,

432
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,200
you'd have a problem, right? If
you had one negative number in it,

433
00:29:56,201 --> 00:30:00,100
then the product would be a negative
number. And if you took a route of that,

434
00:30:00,101 --> 00:30:01,900
you might get a, an agile, very number.

435
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:07,000
So we don't want to use
it in that case. But, uh,

436
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,220
uh,
there's a appendix two,

437
00:30:09,221 --> 00:30:14,221
one of the chapters in Jeremy Siegel's
book where he says that one of the most

438
00:30:15,701 --> 00:30:20,701
important applications of this theory is
to measure how successful and investor

439
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:25,780
is. Okay. So, um, uh, if,

440
00:30:25,781 --> 00:30:30,050
uh, suppose someone is managing money, uh,

441
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:34,750
uh, have they done well?
If, so, you would say, well,

442
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,690
they've been investing money
over a number of different years.

443
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,840
Let's take the average over
all the different years. Okay.

444
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:46,410
So suppose someone has been investing
money for n years and rabbi is the return

445
00:30:46,751 --> 00:30:48,940
on the investment in a given year.

446
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,450
What is their average performance was
the natural thing to do would be to

447
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:57,040
average them up. Right. Uh, now, uh,

448
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,910
but, uh, Jeremy says that maybe
that's not a very good thing to do.

449
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,010
Uh, so, um,

450
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:08,550
but he says you should do instead is
take the geometric average of gross

451
00:31:09,431 --> 00:31:11,770
returns.
Okay.

452
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:17,080
That now what is the return on an
investment is how much you made from the

453
00:31:17,591 --> 00:31:20,830
investment as a percent of
the money invested. Okay?

454
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,710
The gross return is the return plus one.
All right?

455
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:31,550
The worst you can ever do investing is
to lose all of your investment Lewis,

456
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:36,160
100%.
So if we add one to the return,

457
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,930
you've got a number that's never negative
and we can then use geometric returns.

458
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,370
Okay. Um, and so, uh, Jeremy Siegel says,

459
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,720
really in finance we should be
using geometric and arithmetic.

460
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:52,390
And why is that? Well, I'll
tell you in very simple term,

461
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:57,391
I think suppose someone is investing your
money and he announces I have had very

462
00:31:58,631 --> 00:31:59,320
good returns.

463
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,240
I have invested and I've produced 20%
of the year for nine out of the last 10

464
00:32:04,241 --> 00:32:08,740
years. And so you think, gee, that's
great. Well, what about the last year?

465
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:14,300
And the guy said, oh, I lost
100% in that year. Okay. Uh,

466
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:16,820
so you might say, all
right, that's good. So I,

467
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:21,830
I would add up 20% a year
for nine years and then,

468
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:24,490
uh, put in a zero, no, 120,

469
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,150
because it's grocery turned for nine
years and put in a zero for one year.

470
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,860
And then maybe that doesn't look
bad. Right? But think about it.

471
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,520
If you are investing your
money with someone like that,
what did you end up with?

472
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:41,480
You ended up with nothing. If they have
one year, when they lose everything,

473
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,990
it doesn't matter how much they
made in the other years. Uh,

474
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,880
so Jeremy says in the,

475
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:51,860
in the text is that the geometric return
is always lower than the arithmetic

476
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:56,780
return, unless all the numbers are
the same. Uh, and so it's a less,

477
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:01,610
uh, it's a less optimistic
version. And so we should use that.

478
00:33:01,611 --> 00:33:05,840
But people in finance resist
using that, uh, because, uh,

479
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:08,720
it's a lower number and when
you're advertising your return,

480
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:13,370
you want to make it look as big
as possible. Okay. We also need,

481
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,400
uh, some measure. Uh,

482
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:20,140
we've been talking here about
measures of central tendency only, uh,

483
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:25,150
and in finance we need as
well measures of dispersion.

484
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,180
Uh,
that's how much something varies.

485
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:34,900
Central tendency is a
manager of the center of a
probability distribution of the

486
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:36,014
light.

487
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,200
But a central tendency is a measure of
variance is a measure of how much things

488
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:46,580
change from one observation to another.
So we have

489
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,953
variance,

490
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:54,860
uh, and it's measured often
represented by sigma squared.

491
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,700
That's the Greek letter
sigma, uh, lower case squared,

492
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:03,560
or especially when talking about, uh, um,

493
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:09,320
uh, estimates of the variance.
We sometimes say s squared,

494
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,670
uh, or, or we say standard deviation

495
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,953
squared.

496
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,780
Uh, the variance, the standard deviation
is the square root of the variance. Okay.

497
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:27,790
Uh, so for, uh, population variance,

498
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,540
the variance of some random variable x,

499
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,020
okay.

500
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,760
A is defined as uh,
the summation,

501
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:43,820
I equals one to infinity
of the probability that x
equals x by times x minus

502
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,040
new squared.

503
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,770
All right? So, um, new subjects,

504
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:07,260
new subjects is the mean.
We just defined it of x.

505
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:11,640
That's the expectation of acts
are also EMX. So it's the,

506
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,620
it's the probability weighted average
of the square deviations from the mean.

507
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,670
If it moves a lot,
either way from the mean,

508
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,580
then this number squared is a big
number. So the more x moves, uh,

509
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:30,390
the bigger the variances.
Okay. There's also another,

510
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:34,440
uh, variance measure a
which we use in the sample

511
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,800
also there. Sometimes he was, um,

512
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,700
so this is sigma squared.

513
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,690
There's also another variance measure,

514
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:51,120
which is where the sample and
when we have an observations,

515
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,240
it's this, uh, the summation,

516
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,810
I equals one to n of x minus
x Bar squared all over n Oh,

517
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,800
this should be squared.
Um,

518
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:15,150
okay,
so that is the sample variance.

519
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:20,070
Now some people will
divide by n minus one. Uh,

520
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:24,750
all right.
I suppose I would accept either answered,

521
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,500
I'm just keeping it simple
here. Uh, that's, uh,

522
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:34,770
they, they've divided by n minus one
to make it an unbiased estimator of the

523
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,540
population variance. But I'm just
going to show it in a simple way here.

524
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,460
So you see what it is. It's a measure
of how much x deviates from the mean,

525
00:36:44,461 --> 00:36:46,200
but it is,
since it's squared,

526
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:50,670
it weights big deviations a lot because
the square of a big number is really big.

527
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,380
And so, um, that's the variance.

528
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:01,650
All Right, so that completes of
central tendency and dispersion.

529
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,570
Uh, we're going to be talking about these
in finance as regards returns because

530
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:11,010
generally the idea here is
that we want high return.

531
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:13,740
So we want a high
expected value of returns,

532
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,330
but we don't like variance.
So expected value is good,

533
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:22,880
variance is bad because that's
risk. That's uncertainty. West part.

534
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,650
This whole theory is about how to avoid,

535
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,180
how to get a lot of expected return
with, uh, without getting a lot of risk.

536
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:35,160
Now another concept that's
very basic here is covariance.

537
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:40,940
Covariance is a measure of how
much two variables move together.

538
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:46,210
Okay? So, uh, so covariants, uh,

539
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,740
is a
covariance.

540
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,120
Uh, we'll call it. Now we
have two random variables.

541
00:37:57,121 --> 00:38:01,670
So the covariance of x and Y,
uh,

542
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:06,390
I'll just talk about it in a sample
term. Uh, it's the summation.

543
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,900
I equals one to n of x minus x Bar

544
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:20,270
Times y minus y bar all over N.

545
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:26,460
Okay. So, uh, ex, uh,

546
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,100
this is the deviation of,
or for the,

547
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:34,320
I thought I subscript,
meaning we have a separate eye,

548
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,450
uh, exit rabbi. And why?
So by for each observation,

549
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,910
so we're talking about an experiment.
When you generate,

550
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,650
each experiment generates
both an x and a y observation.

551
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,980
And we want to know
whether when x is high,

552
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:52,120
why also tends to be high or whether
it's the other way around. If,

553
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:54,070
if they tend to move together,

554
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,960
if when x is high and why is
high together at the same time,

555
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,590
then uh, the covariance will
tend to be a positive number.

556
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:08,140
Or also if x tens when x is low,
why also tends to be low,

557
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,510
then this will be a negative
number. And so, well this,

558
00:39:10,511 --> 00:39:12,880
so their product is positive.
All right?

559
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:18,240
So a positive covariance means that the
to move together and negative covariance

560
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:24,260
means that they tend to move opposite
each other. So if x is high relative to x,

561
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,300
buy, this is positive then why it
tends to be low relative to its mean.

562
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,540
And this is negative.
So the product would be negative.

563
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:36,070
And if you get a lot of negative products
that makes the covariance negative.

564
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:41,290
Okay. Uh, and then I want
to move to correlation.

565
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,193
Okay.

566
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,570
So this is a measure, a,
it's a scaled covariance.

567
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:55,960
Uh, the correlation, how are we tend
to use the Greek letter role? Um,

568
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,010
or if you, um, where do you use excel?

569
00:39:59,011 --> 00:40:03,200
It would be Corel or sometimes I say car.
Uh,

570
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:06,170
that's the correlation. Okay. Uh,

571
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,090
this number always lies between zero,

572
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,120
between minus one and plus one.

573
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,300
Uh, and what it is, uh,

574
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:24,320
is defined as Raul is equal
to the covariance of x and
y divided by the standard

575
00:40:28,771 --> 00:40:31,830
deviation of x times the
standard deviation of y.

576
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,400
Okay. Uh, and uh, that's
the correlation coefficient.

577
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,713
So,
uh,

578
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:44,220
that has kind of almost entered the
English language in the sense that you'll

579
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:48,870
see it quoted occasionally in this papers.
So I dunno how used to it,

580
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,710
you know, uh, where would
you see that, you know,

581
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,720
they would say there is a low correlation
between sat scores and grade point

582
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:01,050
averages in, in college or maybe it's a
high correlation. I know what it, does.

583
00:41:01,051 --> 00:41:05,580
Anyone know what it is? But you can
estimate a car. It's probably positive.

584
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:10,740
I bet it's way below one. Right.
But it has some correlation.

585
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:15,830
So maybe it's 0.3. Okay.
That would mean that, uh,

586
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:20,440
people who have high sat scores
tend to get higher grades. Uh,

587
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,010
if it were neg, it's very unlikely
that it's negative, right?

588
00:41:23,011 --> 00:41:25,680
It couldn't be negative,
it couldn't be a,

589
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:29,760
that people who have high sat
scores tend to do poorly in college.

590
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:34,670
So if you want to quantify how
much they, uh, then you have to,

591
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:39,590
you can look at the correlation. Um, okay.

592
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,890
So, um, I want to

593
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,620
move to regression.

594
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,790
And this is another concept that
is very basic to statistics,

595
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,820
but yet,
um,

596
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,260
has particular use in finance.
Uh,

597
00:41:57,261 --> 00:42:00,770
so I'll give you a financial example.
Okay.

598
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:04,340
So the concept of regression,
uh,

599
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:09,250
it goes back to the math and
efficient and Gauss, uh, who,

600
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:13,880
uh, talked about fitting a line
through a scatter of points.

601
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:18,190
So let's draw a, I took my watch
off and see my time here. Uh,

602
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,370
let's draw a line through a
scatter of points here. So this is,

603
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:27,650
uh,
I want to put down on this axis,

604
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,010
uh,
the return and the stock market.

605
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:39,770
And on this access,
I want to put the return on one company.

606
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,610
Let's say Microsoft,
okay.

607
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:50,030
And I'm going to have each
observation as a year. Okay.

608
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:54,080
I shouldn't put down a name of a company
cause I can't reproduce this diagram

609
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:58,460
for Microsoft. Uh, let's not
say Microsoft. Let's say,

610
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,080
uh, uh, Shiller Inc.

611
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:07,850
There is no such company. So I can
be completely hypothetical. Uh, and,

612
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,870
uh, this put zero here because, um,

613
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,650
and these are not grocery returns. These
are returns. So there are often negative,

614
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:16,723
okay.

615
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,620
And suppose that in a given year and
say this is minus five and this is plus

616
00:43:21,621 --> 00:43:25,640
five is minus five plus five.

617
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:30,500
Suppose that, uh, in, in the
first year in our sample, uh,

618
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:36,380
the company Shiller Inc and the market
both did 5%. So that puts a pie,

619
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,220
a point right there, okay. At, uh,

620
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,580
at five and five. Okay. Uh,

621
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:46,310
and another year, however, uh, the,

622
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:51,311
the stock market lost 5%
and a Shiller ink lost 7%.

623
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:56,870
So we'd have a point say down here,
right at five and seven.

624
00:43:57,740 --> 00:44:02,450
All right?
So this could be a 1979.

625
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,090
This is going to be 1980. Uh,
and we keep adding points. Uh,

626
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,500
so we've got a whole scatter of points.
All right.

627
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:13,700
It's probably upward sloping,
right?

628
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:18,410
Probably when the overall stock market
does well. So does a Shiller Inc.

629
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:22,280
All right,
so what gas dad is said,

630
00:44:22,281 --> 00:44:25,160
let's fill aligned through the point,
uh,

631
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:28,760
this have points and that's
called the regression line.

632
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:33,840
And he chose the line so
that, uh, this is gauss.

633
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,433
Uh,

634
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:41,040
he said he chose the line to minimize the
sum of squared distances of the points

635
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:44,940
from the line. So these distances are
the lengths of these lines segments.

636
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,480
To get the best fitting line,

637
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,820
you find the line that minimizes
the sum of square distances,

638
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,920
and that's called the regression line.

639
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,460
And the intercept is called Alpha.

640
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,300
There is Alpha and the
slope is called Beta.

641
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,550
Okay? So that's maybe a
familiar enough concept to you.

642
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:09,180
But in the context of
finance, this is, uh,

643
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,820
this is a, uh, a major concept.
The way I've written it, uh,

644
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:20,130
the Beta of Schiller Corporation
is the slope of this line.

645
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,230
Okay? The alpha is, uh,

646
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:30,080
uh, is, is just the intercept
of this, of this curb. Um,

647
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:34,980
so, uh, we can also do
this with excess returns.

648
00:45:34,990 --> 00:45:39,060
I will get to this later where I have the
return minus the interest rate on this

649
00:45:39,061 --> 00:45:44,010
axis and the return minus
the market return minus the
interest rate on this axis.

650
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,230
And then that case Alpha is a
measure of how much Shiller Inc,

651
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,520
uh, outperformed, uh,
we'll come back to this,

652
00:45:53,730 --> 00:45:58,300
but Beta of a stock is a measure of
how much it moves with the market, uh,

653
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:02,830
and the alpha of a stock is how much it's
sort of outperforms the market. Well,

654
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:07,020
we'll have to come back to that.
These are basic concepts. Um,

655
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:14,540
okay. So, uh, I wanted
to, oh, and another,

656
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:17,910
uh, so I guess I've been
implicit in what I have is there,

657
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:22,470
there's a distribution called
the normal distribution. Uh,

658
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:27,360
and that is, uh, uh, I'm
sure you heard of this,

659
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:29,330
right?
Uh,

660
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:35,030
if you have a distribution
that looks like this,

661
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,560
it's bell-shaped,
right?

662
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:43,260
This is x and I have to
make it look symmetric,

663
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:47,850
which I may not be able to do that well.
Okay.

664
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,190
And this is after the,
the normal distribution

665
00:46:55,470 --> 00:47:00,470
is equal to the one over square root of
two Pi Sigma e to the minus x bar minus

666
00:47:03,361 --> 00:47:06,060
mew squared over two sigma.

667
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:10,950
It's a famous formula which
is new gauss. Again, uh,

668
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:17,120
we often assume in finance that random
variables such as returns are normally

669
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:18,421
distributed.

670
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:23,421
So this is called the normal distribution
or the Gaussian distribution.

671
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,650
It's a continuous distribution. I
think you've heard of this, right?

672
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:33,120
This is a high school material.
Uh,

673
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:38,080
but I wanted to emphasize that there
are also other bell shaped curve.

674
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:41,170
This is the most famous bell shaped curve,

675
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:46,450
but there are other ones with different
mathematics and a particular interest in

676
00:47:46,451 --> 00:47:50,410
finance are fat tailed alternatives.

677
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:59,140
So it could be that a random distribution.
And I'll,

678
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:01,180
I don't have colored chalk
here, I don't think. No.

679
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:06,181
So I will use a dash line to represent
the fat tail distribution because the

680
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,890
distribution looks like this.

681
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:11,913
Okay.

682
00:48:12,550 --> 00:48:17,140
And then I have to try to do that on
the other side symmetrically as I can.

683
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:20,663
Okay.

684
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,110
These are the tails of the distribution.

685
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,900
This is the right tail
and this is the left tail.

686
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:31,263
Okay?

687
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,300
And you can see that the dash distribution
I drew has more out in the tails.

688
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,130
Okay? So we call it fat tailed. Uh,

689
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,440
this refers to a random variables that
have fat tail distributions are random

690
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:51,010
variables that occasionally
give you really big outcomes.

691
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:55,780
So you have a chance of being way out
here with a fat tail distribution.

692
00:48:56,530 --> 00:49:01,530
And it's a very important observation
in finance that returns on a lot of

693
00:49:02,471 --> 00:49:05,200
speculative assets,
have fat tail distributions.

694
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,920
That means that you can go through 20
years of a career on Wall Street and all

695
00:49:11,861 --> 00:49:16,340
you've observed his observations in the
central region. And so you feel, you know,

696
00:49:16,341 --> 00:49:17,920
a pretty well how things behave.

697
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:22,270
But then all of a sudden there's something
way out here. This would be great.

698
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:27,270
Good luck if you're long and now suddenly
you've just got a huge return that you

699
00:49:27,941 --> 00:49:31,060
just would not have thought was possible.
You've never seen it before,

700
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:34,810
but you can also have an
incredibly bad return.

701
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,590
And this complicates finance because
it means that you never know.

702
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:42,430
You never have enough experience to,
um,

703
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,740
to get through all of these things.
Um,

704
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:50,820
it's a, it's a big complication in, uh,

705
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,620
my friend Nassim Taleb has just
written a book about it called,

706
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:57,280
maybe I'll talk about that
called the Black Swan. Uh,

707
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:01,960
and it's about how every,
so many plans in finance are messed up by,

708
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:02,843
um,

709
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:08,070
by a rare events that suddenly appear
that out of nowhere he called it the Black

710
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:11,380
Swan. Because if you look at
swans, they're always white, right?

711
00:50:11,381 --> 00:50:12,880
You've never seen a black swan.

712
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,660
And so you end up going through life
assuming that there are no black swans,

713
00:50:16,661 --> 00:50:20,620
but in fact, there are a, and
you might finally see one.

714
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:24,670
You don't want to predicate
making complicated gambles
under the assumption that

715
00:50:24,671 --> 00:50:27,740
they don't exist. Um, and, uh,

716
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:32,580
so Tyler who's a Wall Street
professional, talks about, uh,

717
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,950
these black swans as being
the real story of finance.

718
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,890
Uh, I wanted to move away from
statistics and talk about present values,

719
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,570
does another concept in finance that is,
uh,

720
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:53,640
uh, fundamental. Uh, and so let me, uh,

721
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,830
and then this will
conclude today's lecture.

722
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:01,850
What is a present value?

723
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:07,900
This isn't really a statistics anymore,

724
00:51:07,901 --> 00:51:11,560
but it's a concept that I wanted
to include in this lecture. Um,

725
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:17,970
people in business often
have claims on future money,

726
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,570
not money today. Uh, and um, for example,

727
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,780
I may have someone who promises to pay
me $1 in one year or in two years or

728
00:51:29,981 --> 00:51:31,180
three years.
Okay.

729
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,250
The present value is what
that's worth today. Okay.

730
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,790
So I may have a,
a,

731
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:43,060
an IOU from someone or I may own a bond
from someone that promises to pay me

732
00:51:43,061 --> 00:51:46,010
something in a year or two years.
Uh,

733
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,680
according to Time, honored
tradition in finance. Uh,

734
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:53,560
if it says that it's a promise to pay $1,

735
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:58,720
it's not worth $1 today. Uh,
it must be worth less than $1.

736
00:51:59,440 --> 00:51:59,801
Uh,

737
00:51:59,801 --> 00:52:04,801
so what you could do hundreds of years
ago and can still do today is to go to a

738
00:52:05,951 --> 00:52:09,820
bank and present this, um, uh,

739
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,670
bond or Iou and say,
um,

740
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:17,800
what will you give me
for it? Okay. And so, uh,

741
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:21,560
the, uh, the bank, well discounted.

742
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:27,410
Oh,
sometimes we say present discounted value.

743
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:29,673
Yes.

744
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:34,300
So the banker will say, well,
you have $1 a year from now,

745
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:38,200
but that's a year from now, so
I won't give you $1 now. Uh,

746
00:52:38,201 --> 00:52:42,880
I'll give you the present
discounted value for it. Okay? Uh,

747
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:44,680
now I'm going to abstract from risk.

748
00:52:44,681 --> 00:52:47,110
Let's assume that we know that
this thing is going to be paid.

749
00:52:47,111 --> 00:52:50,620
So it's a matter of simple
time, all right? Of course,

750
00:52:50,621 --> 00:52:55,420
the banker isn't going to give you $1
for something that is paying $1 in a year

751
00:52:55,421 --> 00:53:00,100
because the banker knows that a dollar
could be invested at the interest rate.

752
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,400
And so let's say the interest rate is r.

753
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:11,323
Okay.

754
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:16,190
Uh, and um, that, uh, uh,

755
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,520
that would be a number, um, which, uh,

756
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:24,500
like 0.05, which is 5%, which
is five divided by a hundred.

757
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:29,970
Uh,
then the present value of $1,

758
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,900
the present PDV or Pv have $1
equals one over one plus r dollars.

759
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,640
Okay? That's because the
banker is thinking, well,

760
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:49,400
uh, if, uh,

761
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:54,410
if I have this amount right now
and I invest it for one year,

762
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:59,670
what do I have? I Have One plus r times
one over one plus R it's a dollar.

763
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:04,620
So that works out exactly right.
So you have to discount something.

764
00:54:04,621 --> 00:54:08,040
That's one period in the future
by dividing it by one plus R.

765
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,720
Uh,
if it's,

766
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:15,330
this is a present value
of $1 in one time period,

767
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:19,350
which I'm taking to be a year,
but it doesn't have to be a year.

768
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:23,340
The interest rate has units of time.

769
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:28,341
So I have to specify a time period over
which I'm measuring an interest rate.

770
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:30,480
So typically it's a year.

771
00:54:30,481 --> 00:54:33,810
So if it's a one year interest rate
at the time period is one year,

772
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:38,070
the present value of $1 in one
time period is given by this,

773
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,880
the present value of $1 in end periods.

774
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:46,890
Yeah.

775
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:51,660
Is One Oliver,
one plus r to the nth power.

776
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,230
Uh, and uh, uh,

777
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,760
that is uh,
uh,

778
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:05,850
that's the, uh, all all
there is to this. Then, uh,

779
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:08,370
so,
uh,

780
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:14,580
I want to talk about
valuing streams of payments.

781
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:20,510
I suppose someone has a contract that
promises to pay an amount each period over

782
00:55:23,431 --> 00:55:24,330
a number of years.

783
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:29,670
We have formulas for these peasant values,
uh,

784
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:30,930
and these formulas,

785
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:36,890
uh,
uh,

786
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:43,920
are well known. I'm just going to go
through them rather quickly here. Uh,

787
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,250
simplest thing is
something called a console

788
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:51,790
or perpetuity.

789
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,433
Okay.

790
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,820
I perpetuity is,

791
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:03,950
is a asset or a contract that pays a
fixed amount of money each time period

792
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,533
forever.

793
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:10,950
We call them councils because
in the early 17 hundreds,

794
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:16,310
the British government issued what they
called console's are consolidated a debt

795
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:18,700
of the British crown,
uh,

796
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:23,890
that paid a certain amount
of pound sterling every,

797
00:56:23,891 --> 00:56:26,620
I think it was every six months forever.
Uh,

798
00:56:26,621 --> 00:56:31,090
and you may say what audacity for the
British government did promise to pay

799
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:34,900
anything forever. Will it be
around forever? Well, you know,

800
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,780
as far as you're concerned, it's
as good enough as forever, right?

801
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:43,120
Maybe someday the British,
uh, uh, United Kingdom will,

802
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:46,030
something will happen to it.
It will fall apart or change.

803
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:50,230
But that is so distant in the future,
we can disregard that.

804
00:56:50,231 --> 00:56:54,310
So we'll take that as forever in any way.
The government might buy them back too.

805
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:57,090
And so, you know, who cares
if it isn't for everyone.

806
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:58,810
Let's just talk about it as forever.

807
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:04,230
So let's say this thing pays
one pound a period forever.

808
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:08,980
Okay? Uh, what is the
present value of that?

809
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:14,350
Well, the first, uh, each payment
we'll call a coupon. Okay?

810
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:18,940
Okay.
So it pays one pound one year from now.

811
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:23,620
Let's say it's one year, just to
simplify things. It pays another pound.

812
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:27,850
Two years from now, it pays another
pound. Three years from now,

813
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:33,660
the present value is equal to remember
it starts one year from now under

814
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:36,400
assumption. We could, we
could do it differently,

815
00:57:36,401 --> 00:57:37,660
but I'm assuming one year from now,

816
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:42,980
the present value is one over one plus
R it's one pound over one plus r for the

817
00:57:44,051 --> 00:57:48,680
first year, right? Uh, plus, uh,

818
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:53,790
for the second year it's one
town over one plus r squared.

819
00:57:55,150 --> 00:58:00,150
For the third year it's one pound
all over r one plus r cubed.

820
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:02,650
And that goes on forever.

821
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:07,240
So that's an infinite series
and you know how to sum that,

822
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:10,090
I think anyway,
I'll tell you what it is.

823
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:14,920
It's one over r or the one
pound over are generally,

824
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:18,340
if it pays see dollars for every period,

825
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:20,800
the present value is c over r.

826
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,280
And so that's the formula for
the present value of a console.

827
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:30,880
All right? That's one of the most
basic formulas in finance. Uh,

828
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:32,260
so,
uh,

829
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:37,360
the interesting thing is it means that
the value of a console moves inversely to

830
00:58:37,361 --> 00:58:38,194
the interest rate.

831
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:43,180
The British government
issued those consoles in the
early 17 hundreds and while

832
00:58:43,181 --> 00:58:47,200
they were refinanced in the late
19th century, they're still there.

833
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,450
And if you want to go out and buy one,

834
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:54,900
you can get on your laptop right after
this lecture and buy one of them and

835
00:58:55,091 --> 00:58:58,250
you've got something that will
pay you something forever. Uh,

836
00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:02,920
but you're going to know that the value
of that in the market moves opposite

837
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,640
interest rates. So if interest
rates go down, the value goes up.

838
00:59:06,970 --> 00:59:11,500
If interest rates go up, the value
of your investment goes down. Okay?

839
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:16,360
Uh, another formula, uh,
is what if the console,

840
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:20,920
um, doesn't pay? Well, what I sorry.

841
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:24,800
Uh, next thing. It is a growing console.

842
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:26,223
Yeah.

843
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:31,750
I'm calling it a growing console, even
though the British console's didn't grow.

844
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:36,100
Let's say that the British government
didn't say that they'll pay one pound per

845
00:59:36,101 --> 00:59:40,120
year, but it'll be one
pound the first year. Um,

846
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:45,570
and then, uh, uh, it'll
grow at the rate g,

847
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:50,860
uh,
and will eventually be infinitely large.

848
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:56,140
All right. Uh, so you get
one pound for the first year,

849
00:59:56,590 --> 01:00:00,740
you get, uh, uh,

850
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:05,470
uh,
a one plus g pounds.

851
01:00:05,471 --> 01:00:07,690
The second year it stopped Ya,

852
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:11,320
one plus g squared the third year.

853
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:16,360
And so on the present value of this,

854
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:22,300
I suppose it pays,
let's say it's PC pounds each year,

855
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,360
so it would be c times this.
All right,

856
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:29,740
one plus it would be c times one plus
g cubed and the third year, et Cetera.

857
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:35,280
Then the present value is
equal to c all over r minus G.

858
01:00:37,750 --> 01:00:41,320
That's the formula for the
value of it growing. Cancel.

859
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,113
Um,

860
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:48,210
GE has to be less than our for this to
make sense because if g if it's growing

861
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,620
faster than the rate of interest,

862
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:56,080
this infinite series will not converge
and the value will be infinite.

863
01:00:56,770 --> 01:01:00,280
Uh, and you might ask, well, how
does that make sense? What if,

864
01:01:00,670 --> 01:01:04,870
what if the British government
promised to pay 10% more each year?

865
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:09,760
Uh, what would the market value that
with formula doesn't have a number?

866
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,160
Well, I'll tell you why.
It doesn't have a number.

867
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:17,610
The British government will never promise
to pay you 10% more each year because

868
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:22,800
they can't do it and the market wouldn't
believe them because you can't grow

869
01:01:23,111 --> 01:01:25,120
every year faster than the interest rate.

870
01:01:25,650 --> 01:01:29,020
And that's a basic one of the most
basic lessons. You can't do it.

871
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:34,600
Um, okay. Uh, one more thing. I think it,

872
01:01:34,601 --> 01:01:38,410
which would be relevant to the, uh,
oh, there's also the annuity formula.

873
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:44,050
And this is a formula that applies to,

874
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:45,773
um,

875
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:51,810
what if an asset pays a fixed
amount every period and then stops.

876
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:59,100
That's called an annuity. Okay. So, uh,

877
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:00,610
an annuity

878
01:02:06,910 --> 01:02:10,540
it pays. See, I'll go back to dollars.

879
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:15,640
See dollars starting in, uh, t equals one,

880
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:20,890
two, three, and is the last period.

881
01:02:20,891 --> 01:02:21,790
And that stops.

882
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:26,860
A good example of an annuity
is a mortgage on a house.

883
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,290
Uh, you, when you buy a house,

884
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:33,880
you borrow the money and you pay it back
in fixed, it would usually be monthly,

885
01:02:33,881 --> 01:02:36,070
but let's say annual payments.
All right?

886
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:41,670
You pay every year a fixed them out on
your house to the mortgage originator.

887
01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:47,830
Uh, and then after so many n
is 30 years, typically you,

888
01:02:47,831 --> 01:02:52,210
uh,
you would then have a paid off.

889
01:02:52,690 --> 01:02:57,010
It used to be that mortgages had a blue
called a balloon payment at the end,

890
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,890
which means that you'd have
to pay extra money at the end,

891
01:02:59,891 --> 01:03:02,470
but they decided that people
have trouble doing that.

892
01:03:02,471 --> 01:03:06,040
It's much better to pay a fixed payment
and then you're done. Otherwise,

893
01:03:06,041 --> 01:03:08,950
if you ask them to pay more at the end,
a lot of people,

894
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:13,150
they won't have the money.
So we now have a nuity mortgages.

895
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:17,290
What is the present value of an annuity?
Okay.

896
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:22,100
And so that is the
present value of annuity.

897
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:24,580
It is equal to the amount,

898
01:03:24,581 --> 01:03:29,581
what did I say is c times
one minus one over one plus r

899
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:39,180
to the nth power,
all of our r.

900
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,450
And so that is the present
value of an annuity.

901
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:46,283
Um,

902
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:50,760
I wanted to say one more thing because
I realized that you have to your,

903
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:52,900
your first problem set,
we'll cover this,

904
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:58,320
is to talk about a concept that applies
probability theory to economics and that

905
01:04:00,551 --> 01:04:04,710
is expected utility theory.
Uh,

906
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:08,080
and then I'll conclude with this. Uh, the,

907
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:11,500
in economics,

908
01:04:11,830 --> 01:04:16,830
it is assumed that people have a utility
function which represents how happy

909
01:04:20,201 --> 01:04:23,080
they are, uh, within outcome.

910
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:30,900
Okay. And so we typically
take that as you, uh,

911
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:35,880
and uh, uh, so if I
have a monetary outcome,

912
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,880
I have a certain amount of money,
x dollars,

913
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:43,080
how happy I am with x dollars is called,

914
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:47,370
you have x. Okay. Uh,

915
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:52,170
and this I think you've gotten
from other other economics curses.

916
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,350
We have something called diminishing

917
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:59,260
marginal utility.

918
01:05:03,350 --> 01:05:04,183
Okay.

919
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:10,380
Okay. Uh, and the idea is
that for any amount of money,

920
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:16,250
if this x is the amount of
money that I received utility,

921
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:17,950
uh,

922
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:22,950
as the function of the amount of money
I receive is a downwardly concave.

923
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:30,340
The exact shape of the curve
is subject to discussion.

924
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:35,790
But the point of diminishing marginal
utility is that as you get more and more

925
01:05:35,831 --> 01:05:40,450
money, the increment in utility
for each extra dollar, uh,

926
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:44,920
diminishes. Uh, usually we say it never
goes down. We don't have it going down.

927
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:50,200
The trust that that would be where
having more money makes you less happy.

928
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:55,150
That may actually work that way. But our
theory says, no, you always want more,

929
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:57,610
but it's always upward sloping.

930
01:05:57,611 --> 01:06:02,611
But it may be after a while you get close
to satiation where you've got enough.

931
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:06,760
All right. And so, um, uh,

932
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:10,690
the theory that I mentioned this
last time I was talking about,

933
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,330
I was philosophizing
about wealth and I said,

934
01:06:13,331 --> 01:06:14,830
what are you going to do with $1 billion?

935
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:19,060
We have many billionaires in this country
and I think that the only thing you

936
01:06:19,061 --> 01:06:21,970
have to do with it is a philanthropy.

937
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:26,770
They have to give it away because you
are essentially satiated because you can,

938
01:06:26,771 --> 01:06:27,311
as I said,

939
01:06:27,311 --> 01:06:31,330
you can only drive one car at a time and
if you've got 10 of them in the garage,

940
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:34,330
it doesn't really do you much
good because you can't do it.

941
01:06:34,331 --> 01:06:37,660
You can't enjoy all 10 of them.
So it's important.

942
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:42,040
That's one reason why we want
policies that encourage, uh,

943
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:44,800
equality of incomes,
not necessarily equality,

944
01:06:44,801 --> 01:06:49,420
but reasonable equality because the people
with very low wealth have a very high

945
01:06:49,421 --> 01:06:53,980
margin that utility of income
and people with very high wealth,

946
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,650
uh, have very little. So if you, uh,

947
01:06:57,130 --> 01:07:01,600
if you take from the rich and give to
the poor, you make people happier. Um,

948
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:04,780
but um, we're not going to
do that in a Robin Hood Way,

949
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:08,590
but in finance we're going to do
that in a systematic way through risk

950
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:13,180
management. So we're going to be
taking away from lucky peop. You know,

951
01:07:13,181 --> 01:07:17,780
you think of yourself as randomly on
any point of this. You don't want, uh,

952
01:07:17,781 --> 01:07:18,161
you know,

953
01:07:18,161 --> 01:07:22,390
that you'd like to take money away from
yourself in the high outcome years and

954
01:07:22,391 --> 01:07:26,800
give it to yourself in the low
income years. So, uh, what, uh,

955
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:31,810
what finance theory is based on in much
of economics is based on the idea that

956
01:07:31,811 --> 01:07:36,811
people want to maximize the
expected utility of their wealth.

957
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:42,370
Okay? And so the, since
this is a concave function,

958
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:47,470
it's not just the expected value to
calculate the expected utility of your

959
01:07:47,471 --> 01:07:48,100
wealth.

960
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:53,100
You might also have to look at the
expected return or the geometric expected

961
01:07:54,101 --> 01:07:58,830
return or the standard deviation,
or you might look at the fat tail.

962
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:01,930
There's so many different
aspects that we can get into a,

963
01:08:01,931 --> 01:08:06,910
and so this underlying theory motivates
a lot of what we do, but it's not,

964
01:08:07,630 --> 01:08:12,130
uh, it's not a complete theory until
we specify the utility function.

965
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:17,180
Uh, of course, we will also be about
behavioral finance in this course,

966
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:20,690
and we will at times be saying
that the utility function isn't

967
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:26,930
the idea that people are actually
maximizing expected utility may not be

968
01:08:26,931 --> 01:08:31,070
entirely accurate. But in terms of the
basic theory, that's the core cancer.

969
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:36,080
And I have one question on the problem
set that asked you to think about how you

970
01:08:36,831 --> 01:08:40,460
would handle a decision whether to gamble,

971
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:45,050
basically efficient, uh, based
on expected utility theory.

972
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:49,790
That's a little bit of a tricky
question. Uh, um, but, uh, so,

973
01:08:50,110 --> 01:08:54,410
uh, do the best you can on it
and think, try to think about,

974
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,480
uh, about, uh,

975
01:08:56,570 --> 01:09:01,400
what this kind of theory would imply
for gambling or behavior. All right?

976
01:09:01,401 --> 01:09:06,320
So I will see you on Friday.
That's two days from now in this room.
