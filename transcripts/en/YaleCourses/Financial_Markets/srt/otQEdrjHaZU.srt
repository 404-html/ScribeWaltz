1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,270
Okay. So what I want to talk
about today is about, uh,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,280
the places where stocks are exchanged
and or bonds or other securities.

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,860
And it's another huge industry.
Uh,

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,100
I would say it's part of our information
technology or information network

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:22,200
because what we have to do is find a,

6
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,870
a national or international price
for a security. The problem is that,

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,110
uh, when, uh, when, uh,

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,070
securities are traded
without a central market,

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,190
different people will be getting
different prices for the same thing. Uh,

10
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,640
we have what's called
a, maybe the term, uh,

11
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,680
what markets do for us is, uh, important

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,710
term is price discovery.

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,860
That means that,

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,793
uh,

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,440
there is a market price
that an asset would have if
everybody in the whole world,

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,530
we're free to buy and sell the asset on
the same market and at the same time,

17
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,730
uh, but if you don't have an,
uh, an organized exchange,

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,033
uh,

19
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,030
which is open and available to
everybody without a lot of costs,

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,970
then you don't have
effective price discovery.

21
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,090
And that means that nobody knows
what the asset is worth. Um,

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,300
in a, in the whole market, we
take price discovery for granted,

23
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:34,350
but we have to realize that there's a
technology that brought us, that, uh,

24
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:39,351
and it's a technology that I want to
emphasize has been improving over the

25
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,730
years. It's not static. Um, so, uh,

26
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,280
I wanted to start by just
defining some important terms, uh,

27
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,210
regarding exchange of a securities,
uh,

28
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,580
part and calm his broker
and I'll put it over here.

29
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,770
Another one is dealer.

30
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,990
Uh, that's the two kind of people who, uh,

31
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:12,370
who trade a securities, uh, and, uh,

32
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,580
uh, it's important to keep, uh,

33
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,220
the concept. Uh, and so, uh,

34
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,830
one thing that's used to describe it's,

35
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:28,831
we start with the letters B o a see that
sounds like it's very British overseas

36
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:34,560
air corporation. But that's not what I
mean. Now, this is a minimum, an active,

37
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:37,810
remember broker, uh, it says brokers,

38
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,100
uh,
act on behalf,

39
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,540
uh,
for others

40
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,260
as an agent,

41
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,460
uh,
for which they earn a condition.

42
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,200
Okay. So, uh, uh,

43
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:12,700
broker goes between two people,
uh,

44
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,450
and, uh, the two people
trade with each other.

45
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:18,280
The broker makes it happen.

46
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,770
And the broker receives a
fee called a commission, uh,

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,250
for, uh, making,

48
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,050
bringing these people together so that
they could find each other and make the

49
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:36,580
deal and make the trade
for dealer.

50
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:42,130
Uh, we have, uh, different,
uh, it's d h p m.

51
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,540
Okay. Uh, a dealer,

52
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,820
uh,
act

53
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:02,920
for,
we'll say herself or himself,

54
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,110
uh,
as a principal

55
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,580
for a markup.

56
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,560
That's the fundamental difference.
Uh,

57
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,120
in contrast to a broker,

58
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,370
the dealer actually buys
and sell, sells, uh,

59
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,330
himself or herself. And, uh,

60
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:37,670
and that means the dealer, uh,
I read, says hesitant inventory

61
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,330
of whatever it is that a, so that
the dealer is, has something to sell.

62
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,280
If you,
if you go to a dealer and biosecurity,

63
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,330
you're buying it from the dealer
out of the dealer's inventory.

64
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,460
If you sell through a dealer,
you sell to the dealer.

65
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,700
Okay?
So there's a fundamental difference.

66
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:06,701
The mark up is the difference
between the price that the dealer,

67
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,770
uh, uh, buys and sells that.

68
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:13,400
So you'll see that there's a
fundamental difference. Now,

69
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,430
a securities law says that you can never
function as both a broker and a dealer.

70
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,230
In the same transaction,
you've got to be one or the other.

71
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,870
The same person can do both.

72
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,260
You can be both a broker and a dealer,

73
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,600
but not in the same transaction.
Uh, we also have the term,

74
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,153
uh,

75
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,190
and finance broker,

76
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,390
hyphenated dealer,

77
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,460
that's called BD,

78
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,093
right?

79
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:55,350
A BD is a firm that hires the employers,

80
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,190
brokers, and dealers. Okay. Uh, and so,

81
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,910
uh,
the fact that they hyphenate,

82
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,180
I'm doesn't mean that any one transaction
involves both broking and dealing.

83
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,640
Um, so, uh, the,

84
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,780
uh, uh, you can see the difference in,

85
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:20,900
in ordinary life when
you buy and sell a house,

86
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,660
you're a real estate agent is a broker.

87
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,170
But the real estate agent usually
does not buy the house from here.

88
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:29,780
Or if you're selling your house,
uh,

89
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,230
or if you call up a real estate agent
and say, I want to sell your house, the,

90
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,910
the agent doesn't say, okay, I'll buy it.

91
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,190
So that person is operating as a broker.
However,

92
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:47,540
if you go to an antique shop, uh, and uh,

93
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,770
and say you want to buy a chest
of drawers or dining room table,

94
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,770
you will be dealing with a dealer.
Right?

95
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,140
And I guess there's fundamental reasons
and why it works out well and one and

96
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,110
why, why did it tends to break
down differently for the different,

97
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,120
why is it that we have dealers for
antiques and brokers for homes? Well,

98
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:10,010
I think it has something to do with,
uh,

99
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,980
can you tell me why? Why
did we do it that way? Uh,

100
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,400
I was thinking it had something to
do with the information cost of, uh,

101
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,390
since make running a house
is such a big decision. Um,

102
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,900
and you've got to go looking at the
houses anyway, right? Some are antiques.

103
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,750
You wouldn't have an antique
broker. Right. Would you, uh,

104
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,380
the [inaudible] I guess you could,

105
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,580
people could have antiques for sale in
their homes and the antique broker would

106
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:44,870
take you around on a tour.
And what if that's my blackberry?

107
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,550
So wired up here,
uh,

108
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,980
that was my blackberry.
Sorry about that. Um, so,

109
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,873
uh,

110
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,500
okay. So, uh,

111
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,210
okay.
Um,

112
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,340
so the, uh, anyway, uh, the, uh,

113
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:25,600
concept of a broker
dealer, uh, is that, uh,

114
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,580
it is something regulated once again by
the security and Exchange Commission.

115
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:35,270
So that means any broker dealer
must register with the SEC.

116
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:44,640
So in that sense, we have a sort
of licensing for broker dealers.

117
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,010
Broker dealers in turn
are responsible for their,

118
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,873
uh,

119
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,230
for their employees who are acting
as brokers and dealers and, uh,

120
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,240
the employees.
Um,

121
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,810
we'll have to be appropriately licensed.

122
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,670
And so what broker dealers do is,
um,

123
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,130
according to our securities law,
uh,

124
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,920
they would manage their employees,

125
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,793
uh,

126
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,100
exams through Finra. Now,
I mentioned that before.

127
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,470
That's the successor to National
Association of Securities Dealers that,

128
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:31,140
uh, has exams for brokers and dealers. Uh,

129
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:35,540
and so what it is that a broker
dealer is a company that, uh,

130
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,700
that hires people and they become a
licensed as brokers are dealers through,

131
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,910
uh,
their own broker dealer using FINRA.

132
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,360
And so that's the organization
method that we have.

133
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,630
The reason why we have it this way is
that there are so many instances of bad

134
00:09:55,271 --> 00:10:00,100
behavior among brokers and
dealers that have to be, uh,

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,100
that have to be handled.

136
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,570
And this goes back to a basic theme
of this course that human nature is

137
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:08,404
imperfect.

138
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,060
And while economics theory
ties to describe people as
honest and following the

139
00:10:13,061 --> 00:10:16,870
rules, there are so many
opportunities for bad behavior,

140
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,170
uh, that, uh, uh, that, uh,

141
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,953
uh,

142
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,310
that have to be corrected.
So I,

143
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:34,010
I've taken the licensing exams for
Finra because I want myself to do,

144
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,520
uh, to do, uh, we
creating a securities. Uh,

145
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,470
and I think it's actually a
very good program. They have a,

146
00:10:42,471 --> 00:10:46,250
and they have continuing education
that brokers and dealers have to take.

147
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,180
And one thing that they do
and the continuing education,

148
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,470
I was impressed with what
they've come up with.

149
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,950
They have actors and actresses portraying
situations that brokers and dealers

150
00:10:57,321 --> 00:11:01,400
will come up with,
well encounter that are not quite ethical.

151
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:04,830
All right. So, uh, you
know, you'll have the,

152
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,550
I remember there was a scene where a woman
comes up to the broker dealer and, uh,

153
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,390
there is a document that she has a joint
account with her husband and there's a

154
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:15,490
document,
uh,

155
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,970
that requires both of their signatures
and the broker dealer hands it to her and

156
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,740
she signs. And then, uh,
and then he says, okay,

157
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,380
can you get your husband to sign
it? And he said, she said, oh,

158
00:11:27,381 --> 00:11:31,220
he already did look right in
front of the broker dealer.

159
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,120
Uh, and then they show the
broker dealer backing down.

160
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,560
This is in a skip that I saw a
and accepting. Okay. She said,

161
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:42,860
I'm sure it's all right with
him. And so he says, all right,

162
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,300
and then the get goes on and shows how
much trouble he got into for accepting

163
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,560
you. Then there's husband shows up the
next day and they're getting a divorce and

164
00:11:51,561 --> 00:11:53,750
he's furious. And, um,

165
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,400
he tries to cover it up by
pretending he didn't know.

166
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,020
And then she then comes back and admits
that he just told me it was all right

167
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:04,090
that my husband,
I could sign for my husband.

168
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,320
So there's all kinds of moral issues
that arise and I think that the system

169
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:10,490
works as well as it does.
Uh,

170
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,420
because we have institutions,

171
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,200
we recognize that there's a tendency
for all kinds of bad behavior.

172
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,670
So my own experience
with Finra was, uh, uh,

173
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,140
increased confidence in our
broker dealers. I think that, uh,

174
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:31,170
we have a good system that there's
going to be a lot of temptation for bad

175
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:36,720
behavior. We have a pretty good
system in this country for, uh,

176
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:42,050
for educating people not to do that.
Uh,

177
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:46,900
we also actually go after broker
dealers who do things that are seemingly

178
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:49,780
innocent. So for example, churning,

179
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:54,860
I mentioned this before. Churning is, uh,

180
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,060
overtrading a customer's
account. So, um, it's,

181
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:01,730
uh,

182
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:06,550
it's not obvious to an
uninformed investors that it
isn't a good idea to trade

183
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:11,120
stocks every other day.
Okay. He beat, uh, uh,

184
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,270
but it's obvious to anyone in the field.

185
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:16,450
If you're trading stocks that frequently,

186
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,750
there's just no way that you
could make money. He hasn't,

187
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,810
there's nobody who can get a 50%
return on stocks with reliability.

188
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,680
You know, we've know that David Swensen,
we mentioned him before, has got 18%,

189
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,090
but he's the star. Right? And you're not
going to do that. Well realistically.

190
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,980
So if you're a jerk churning,

191
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,860
if you're paying more than 18% in
commissions every year, you, you,

192
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,510
you just don't have a chance.
And so I, you know, I broke her,

193
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:46,900
could try to hide behind some
kind of facade and say, well,

194
00:13:46,901 --> 00:13:48,310
but I think I can learn that,

195
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,410
but unfortunately we have a good enough
regulatory agencies to stop that. And so,

196
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,220
uh,

197
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,220
right now brokers who check to churn
their portfolios will be caught by market

198
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:05,470
surveillance and they will be thrown out
of the profession. It's actually, uh,

199
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,310
you can be disbarred, uh, prevented
from trading for life. Um,

200
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:15,230
so that's the kind of regulations we
have. I think it's a very, you know, the,

201
00:14:15,231 --> 00:14:19,570
the world is more ambiguous and,
uh,

202
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:23,020
faces more of moral dilemmas
than you would imagine.

203
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,100
You have to get out into the business
world and start seeing how often they come

204
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:27,700
up.

205
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:32,470
And it's kind of remarkable that we have
a system that handles these dilemmas as

206
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,890
well as we do. You see a lot
of anger now, like for example,

207
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:40,570
with the subprime crisis and people
who supposedly or allegedly behave very

208
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:44,140
badly and it's certainly some
of them did behave badly,

209
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:47,900
but we have a system
that, uh, I think, uh,

210
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:53,190
has developed over many years
that that works pretty well. Um,

211
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,560
now these are so brokers and dealers
are people who work with the exchanges.

212
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:06,260
Uh, but I want to go on to talk
about the exchanges themselves.

213
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,790
Okay. Um, on which these people trade.

214
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:16,130
And this is unfortunately a difficult
topic to keep up with because,

215
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,510
uh,
the exchanges are changing every year.

216
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:26,280
And I think a big impetus for change is
the advance of information technology.

217
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,480
And I might say also financial technology.
This is a world in rapid change.

218
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:37,750
Uh, it's not a fixed at
all, but, uh, wanted to

219
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,470
talk about different kinds of exchanges.

220
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:48,330
We have traditionally we say
in the U S or four markets

221
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:56,210
and one of them is
called the first market.

222
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,803
Okay.

223
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,650
Uh, and this is traditional. Uh,

224
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,980
and that is New York Stock Exchange.
I'm going to come back,

225
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:11,070
it's now called NYC year or next,

226
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:13,470
but let's just be
traditional for the moment.

227
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,390
New York Stock Exchange is the
old original stock market, uh,

228
00:16:18,391 --> 00:16:22,350
and the dominant one.
And so we call that the first market.

229
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,860
Then there's the second to market.

230
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,650
Uh,
and that is Nasdaq.

231
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,490
Okay. And that's, uh,

232
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,600
that stands for National Association
of Secure Securities Dealers.

233
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,800
Automatic quotation system.
Uh,

234
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:53,080
that was the first electronic exchange.
Uh,

235
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
it was founded.
Okay.

236
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:01,380
New York stock exchange
was founded in 1792.

237
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:07,780
Nasdaq was founded in 1971.

238
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,550
Very different tradition,
uh, between the two. Um,

239
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,170
and um,
oh,

240
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:20,430
I should say the second market I have
to add that is the NASA Nasdaq national

241
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:24,980
market is Nasdaq,
uh,

242
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,240
is divided into two parts.

243
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:32,080
There's the national market
and the third market,

244
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:37,110
so called third market
is Nasdaq small cap.

245
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,373
Okay.

246
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:45,910
Small cap is means companies with
capitalization is low capitalization.

247
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:50,070
Remember is the price per
share times the of shares.

248
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,700
So it's the value of the
whole company. Uh, and, uh,

249
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,550
uh,
the small caps are,

250
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,720
are treated separately on Nasdaq,
and then there was the fourth market.

251
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,600
Uh, and that's, uh, beyond
the exchanges itself.

252
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:15,040
This is as large institutions
trading amongst themselves.

253
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:18,853
Okay.

254
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,730
Uh,
it does happen.

255
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,840
There's no law saying you have
to go through and it an exchange.

256
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,500
You can just buy and sell whatever.

257
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,440
And especially if it's a very large
transaction, uh, it can happen that, uh,

258
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:43,420
as part of some deal, uh,
institutions will trade shares, uh,

259
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:46,650
and they don't have to go
through the market. But, uh, we,

260
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,410
we really think that these are
the most important, uh, markets.

261
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,550
Uh,
so let me incidentally,

262
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:59,720
these are not the first stock ish and
the United United States did not invent

263
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:03,500
the stock exchange. Uh, and I think
maybe I mentioned this before,

264
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:08,120
but [inaudible] who,
who's a professor at Stanford,

265
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,050
uh,

266
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:13,580
has researched the ancient Romans stock
exchange and claims to have identified,

267
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,900
I think I said this before, has a claim
to identify where in the Roman forum,

268
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,850
the Roman stock brokers a work and
it was out of a certain temple.

269
00:19:22,851 --> 00:19:26,610
You can find the location when you
visit Rome. Now I think it's in ruins,

270
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:30,920
but you can find where they traded stocks,
but it was never very big.

271
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:35,720
Uh, and then some people say Antwerp
had the first modern stock exchange,

272
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:40,520
I don't know, like many centuries
ago. Uh, Amsterdam was an early,

273
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,763
uh,

274
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:46,040
London was an early stock exchange so we
came kind of late in the United States

275
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,300
to stock exchanges.

276
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,040
1792 is kind of late in the world history.

277
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,410
Uh,
however,

278
00:19:54,411 --> 00:19:58,910
I think that the u s actually features
somewhat prominently in the history of

279
00:19:58,911 --> 00:20:03,911
stock exchanges because there
was a New York securities law

280
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,530
1811, which, uh,

281
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:20,310
it became a model for securities law
and which made the stock exchange in New

282
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:21,600
York especially important.

283
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:26,820
The 1811 securities law in New York,
uh,

284
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,760
established two important principles.

285
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,120
The first one was that anybody can set
up a corporation and have it traded on

286
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:39,030
the stock exchange.
Anybody who follows,

287
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:44,160
who satisfies some criteria
specified by securities regulator,

288
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,160
but the criteria did not involve,
uh,

289
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:52,480
the state legislature convening
and giving you permission.

290
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,740
It was automatic. Okay. Who
doesn't matter who you were,

291
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:02,130
they would do anybody. But of course
there were, there were restrictions then,

292
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,411
you know,

293
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:05,200
the company may have had a certain
capital requirements and they're like,

294
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:08,560
but it was democratic until then.

295
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,690
It used to be that in many countries,

296
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,590
companies would require an act of
parliament to be founded or the king would

297
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:19,030
have to sign something. Uh, now it
was very clear that it was democratic.

298
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:24,410
The other thing that New York
securities a lot of 1811 did is, uh,

299
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,850
make it law.
That limited liability,

300
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,460
uh,
was always and standard.

301
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,470
And that is that limited liability means
that you as a stock market investor can

302
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:45,670
never be sued for the Miss Doings
of the company you invested in.

303
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,390
This was a very fundamental step in,
uh,

304
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,460
securities law because before 1811,

305
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,070
while there were some limited liability,

306
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,160
the idea was already out there and some
companies put limited liability clauses

307
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:05,590
in their charters.
It was never clear,

308
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,010
never so clear as in New York.
Uh,

309
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:14,011
and so you didn't want a trade and buy a
few shares on some exchange because you

310
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:18,820
had the possibility of getting hit
for that. They could come after you.

311
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,100
Uh, so, uh, with the New
York Security Law of 1811,

312
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,330
uh,

313
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:30,040
the New York stock exchange began to
really prosper because then it became

314
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,520
something that anybody in
the world could come in and,

315
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,310
and buy a share there and have no worries,

316
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,890
except you can only lose your money that
you've put in and nothing more. So, uh,

317
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,620
that turned out to be a
very important innovation,

318
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,810
which came in the u s and accounts, I
think for the importance of New York, uh,

319
00:22:49,811 --> 00:22:54,220
in finance. Uh, it was copied, you know,

320
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,840
later in the 19th century, Oliver Europe,
this, this, this kind of securities law,

321
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:04,480
but it took a long time. Okay. So, uh,

322
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:08,980
the New York stock exchange
was founded in 1792,

323
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,990
uh, outdoors under a buttonwood
tree. I've always wondered what,

324
00:23:13,991 --> 00:23:17,230
what was a buttonwood tree? Uh, the,

325
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:21,130
I guess somewhat some stock
exchanges occurred in coffee houses.

326
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,560
People used to like coffee
just as they do now.

327
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,720
And that's like a good
place to trade stocks.

328
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,760
You'd be it at Starbucks or something in
London for the equivalent of Starbucks,

329
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,860
and it will be a natural place
to trade stocks. Uh, but, uh,

330
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,030
actually the New York Stock Exchange
was founded under a buttonwood tree.

331
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:45,380
I looked it up a buttonwood
tree. It's just a sycamore,
uh, or American plane tree.

332
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,290
And we have them, I'm just wondering
why we have them around here.

333
00:23:48,291 --> 00:23:51,430
They're just outside somewhere.
Um,

334
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,920
and I don't know why they call them button
woods and maybe they've made buttons

335
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:59,780
out of them. Oh, the
wood. Uh, but, uh, so,

336
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:00,614
uh,

337
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,240
the system has gone on now
for well over 200 years,

338
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:14,120
but it's changing, uh, because
of, uh, our technology. Uh,

339
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,900
and, uh, so, um,

340
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:24,010
it's one of the themes of my
book,

341
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,340
new financial orders,

342
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,400
how much technology has advanced our
financial markets and institutions.

343
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,350
So there was some,
uh,

344
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,940
if you look at the number of stocks
traded on the London Stock Exchange,

345
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,970
say around 1800,
it was just a handful.

346
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,790
It was just not very big
or not very important. Uh,

347
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,820
but it was certain kinds of information
technology that really made stock

348
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:57,140
exchanges, uh, take off. I like
to just mention a few of them.

349
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,640
Uh, one was, uh,

350
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,660
we were living in a very
primitive world in 1800. You know,

351
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:09,580
people were actually using
feather pens. Uh, that was,

352
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,910
that's what you would
use. And at that time, um,

353
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,330
also paper, it was very expensive
in 1800, if you bought a newspaper,

354
00:25:19,331 --> 00:25:21,640
if you look at newspapers from 1800,

355
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,290
there'd be a single sheet typically
that folded in half of paper.

356
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,530
And why was that? Well, it's
because paper was so expensive, uh,

357
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:35,260
because in 1800 paper had to
be made out of scraps of cloth.

358
00:25:35,261 --> 00:25:38,950
They didn't have wood pulp paper, and
they didn't have had to be made by hand.

359
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,350
You'd have people, you know, uh,

360
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:46,710
washing the fabric and then laying it on
a screen all by hand and then enrolling

361
00:25:48,941 --> 00:25:53,640
at then. So, uh, it was too
expensive. So, uh, we got, uh,

362
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,920
in the 19th century,
we got cheap paper.

363
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,600
Uh, uh, and then, uh,

364
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,630
we got, uh, uh,

365
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,780
I mentioned think that's important for us.

366
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,380
We got carbon paper.

367
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,750
This came in the 19th century,
a lot.

368
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:17,630
There were some maybe primitive
version allowed you to make copies.

369
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,800
The typewriter that came in, uh, in, uh,

370
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:26,330
19 late 19th century. Uh, so you could,

371
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,510
you could make records much
more accurately with a,

372
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,590
and make copies and that's important to
net copies so that they're backed up.

373
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,573
Uh,

374
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:41,330
we had printed forms, although
those actually go back, uh, to the,

375
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:47,250
in Holland. I think we traced them
back to the, maybe the 17 hundreds,

376
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,450
but the idea is having a document with
spaces to fill in numbers and then you

377
00:26:51,451 --> 00:26:52,500
put it in the typewriter.

378
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:57,560
You've got printed up multiple copies of
this with carbon paper between them and

379
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:02,680
you type. It's very accurate. Uh, it
makes it possible to do business. Um,

380
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,480
we invented filing cabinets
in the eighties and nineties

381
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,380
comparatively recently, isn't it?
You kind of amazing filing cabinet.

382
00:27:14,381 --> 00:27:18,240
We have the drawers that come out and
you put file folders and it wasn't until

383
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:20,000
the 1890s,
uh,

384
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,690
that came in before that you would take
documents and tie them up with ribbons

385
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,050
and put them on bookshelves. Well, it
may have been other systems as well,

386
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:30,180
but we didn't have the
modern filing cabinet.

387
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,760
But the really important thing
was electronic technology. Uh,

388
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,270
and we had the telegraph,

389
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,970
which came in, uh, by Samuel Morris. And,

390
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,020
um, when was the 1840s,
I think I might have it.

391
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,563
Uh,

392
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:57,060
Samuel Morris graduated from
Yale University in 18, 10.

393
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,260
Uh, and he patented the Telegraph, uh,

394
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:06,580
in 1837 so it was 1837.
Uh,

395
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:12,180
so as I mentioned, there's also a college
here or any of you from Morse College?

396
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:17,040
Yes. Go only one. Nobody else from
Morris. Oh, there's a good number. Yeah.

397
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:22,530
Uh, so, uh, he did something
very important. Uh,

398
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,020
incidentally,
he lived,

399
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,730
his house is a 58 Trumbull,

400
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,280
which is a three blocks from here.
And if you want to,

401
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:39,240
you can walk over there
and see Moore's house.

402
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:43,920
He used to have a inventions,
uh, parked out on his front lawn,

403
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,860
but they're not there anymore.
They've taken the, taking them in.

404
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,720
But this is a very important invention
because electronic communication, uh,

405
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,390
instantly or at the speed
of light essentially, uh,

406
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:59,400
is what now underpins our exchange.
Um,

407
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,860
and, uh, but the next thing
that happened, and that's, uh,

408
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,320
a little bit later in the
technology was the ticker machine.

409
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:18,600
Uh, and it's not entirely
clear who invented it, but, uh,

410
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,190
because there's various versions.

411
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:25,191
But apparently it was
invented by Thomas Edison.

412
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:30,120
Uh, and the, uh, this was, um,

413
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,040
he was, uh, he, this was his first event.

414
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:38,970
You've heard of many inventions and
Thomas Edison quite remarkable that his

415
00:29:38,971 --> 00:29:43,660
first invention was in
the area of finance.

416
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,750
And so that was in 1867.

417
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:51,100
And how old do you think he was
when he invented the ticker machine?

418
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,990
He was 23.

419
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,300
So that's just so those of you
who are thinking of your careers,

420
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,100
some people get started at are good
young age, uh, and doing this was a,

421
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:06,070
this was a, the Annie, you can't
even know what a ticker machine is.

422
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:09,250
Uh, do you know what I'm talking
about? I take her machine,

423
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:14,350
if some of you do anyway,
uh, what it was was, uh,

424
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,210
like a computer printer. I mean, he
was just like way ahead of his time.

425
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:22,920
We have these printers. You have one
in your room or somewhere that, uh,

426
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,610
when the electronic signals come to
it and it prints out a on the paper,

427
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,500
uh, well he didn't, he
invented one in 1867.

428
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,740
Uh, what, uh,

429
00:30:34,741 --> 00:30:38,800
did you remember the telegraph from
machine that Morrison invented?

430
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:43,240
Uh,
was it required humans on both hands?

431
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,950
One person would be tapping on the Morse
code on one end and there'll be another

432
00:30:47,951 --> 00:30:50,800
person listening on the other end
who would transcribe it by hand.

433
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:55,840
So Edison thought, well, there's no reason
why it shouldn't be done mechanically,

434
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,860
uh, at the receiving
end. So he invented a,

435
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:04,890
a sort of automatic typewriter that
printed out and the initial application of

436
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,250
it was to a stocks because that was,

437
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,110
that's the kind of information people
needed continually on a big basis.

438
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,260
So he invented this printer. Uh, and uh,

439
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,410
it's a little different from modern,
we have a standard paper size now,

440
00:31:23,411 --> 00:31:27,340
which is eight and a half by 11. Right.
But he didn't want to use all that much.

441
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,500
Remember, paper was more expensive and
he didn't need to get a lot he wanted.

442
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,040
So he changed the shape of it.

443
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:37,120
So the paper instead of being
that wide was like that wide, uh,

444
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:41,070
because all he had to do port
was put symbols for stocks, uh,

445
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,730
abbreviations for their names and
then the price at which it traded.

446
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:50,260
Uh, and he wanted to get a lot
of these in rapid succession out,

447
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:53,290
so he didn't need a wide width.
Right. It's very all very logical.

448
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:56,530
So it was basically a computer
printer with a narrow, with,

449
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,810
I forgot to bring it today.
I should have,

450
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,160
I was telling someone at the New York
Stock Exchange that I was telling my

451
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:06,580
students about the ticker
machine and students didn't,

452
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,930
my students didn't seem to know anything
about it. So then he sent me as a gift,

453
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,350
a ticker tape. Uh, it was
just the roll of paper tape.

454
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:19,620
So they were using a ticker tapes at
the New York Stock Exchange until 1964 I

455
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,050
think it was a, and he said, well,

456
00:32:23,051 --> 00:32:26,350
we still have some in the attic
here and he gave me a role.

457
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,700
They don't try to bring
it. So, uh, um, this,

458
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:35,010
this is just maybe a curious history
about, uh, communications. But, uh,

459
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,710
do you know what a ticker tape parade is?
Some of you are,

460
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:41,860
uh, the, um,

461
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,453
uh,

462
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:49,440
these ticker machines used to be
printing out stock prices. Oh,

463
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,540
constantly. And so this tape was
just constantly running and sorry,

464
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:57,230
it would pile up in these
huge wads of, uh, you know,

465
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:59,940
of paper tape. And so, uh,

466
00:32:59,941 --> 00:33:04,700
they had always dispose
of it at the drawbridge is
cause all this paper tape had

467
00:33:04,701 --> 00:33:06,620
to be thrown away and it
was a disposal problem.

468
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:10,250
Whenever there was a parade down
Wall Street, people would, uh,

469
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,960
they would use this ticker tape like
confetti and they would tear it up and do

470
00:33:13,961 --> 00:33:16,670
the shorter legs and they
would toss it out the windows.

471
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:21,270
And so you'd see all this paper
tape coming down. So we still are,

472
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,890
this is all obsolete now, but
it's in a sense, it's, it's,

473
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,260
it is electronic communication
technology, uh, that, um,

474
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,810
uh, and I guess we're still
wasting a lot of paper, right?

475
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:38,220
And we just change the width. So we
don't call it tape anymore. Uh, uh,

476
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,690
we call it printer paper or
something like that. So it's not the,

477
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,040
not exactly the same. Uh, uh, so,

478
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,090
uh,
okay.

479
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,770
So, uh, the, uh,

480
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,200
is the idea that we should
have one market, uh,

481
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:06,040
w w when we have a ticker tape machines,
uh,

482
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,120
we still use the word ticker symbol
for the short abbreviation of a stock.

483
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:17,040
Okay. So, um, every stock
has a, a abbreviated name.

484
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:21,600
We don't need abbreviations
anymore because our printers
are much more effective,

485
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,480
but we still have them. Uh,
and so that's the official,

486
00:34:24,481 --> 00:34:28,950
the ticker symbol is the
official name for a stock, uh,

487
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,910
or other security that's
traded on an exchange.

488
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:39,540
Uh, so, uh, when you have
electronic communication,

489
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:44,370
it should create a national
market, uh, uh, that,

490
00:34:44,371 --> 00:34:48,570
uh, uh, is where everyone
is getting the same price.

491
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:54,030
However, it doesn't necessarily
work automatically. Uh,

492
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,230
in 1975,
uh,

493
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:03,290
people made a number of complaints to
our lawmakers in Washington that in fact,

494
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:08,360
while we have ticker machines and
we have a lot of tea, actually,

495
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,960
they were already gone by 75. But, uh,

496
00:35:10,961 --> 00:35:14,310
there were a lot of electronic
communications, but we're,

497
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,250
some people were not always getting
the same price. Someone would say,

498
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:22,290
I placed my order and the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange and I got a bad price.

499
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,460
Uh, I realized later I could have traded
at some other estate. Nobody told me,

500
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,960
uh, at at the same time. And
so, um, so congress created, uh,

501
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:37,580
it was the securities act of 1975
wanting to create a national market

502
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,543
system.

503
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:47,621
Uh,

504
00:35:47,621 --> 00:35:52,540
and so congress mandated that securities
brokers set up some kind of electronic

505
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:57,541
system that would allow people to trade
on whichever exchange has the best

506
00:35:58,211 --> 00:35:59,044
price.

507
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:03,160
So it was a center of a challenge to the
monopoly of the New York Stock Exchange

508
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:08,140
because you're a broker. If you place
an order with your broker, uh, this,

509
00:36:08,141 --> 00:36:10,030
we would have a new electronic system.

510
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:15,040
So they broker would look over all the
different exchanges and see which one has

511
00:36:15,041 --> 00:36:18,070
the best price.
And so that's what you want as a customer.

512
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,760
So it was implemented
with something called the,

513
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,420
its a her market trading system,

514
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,453
uh,

515
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:36,130
uh, which allows a broker to look over
all the changes and find the best price.

516
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,050
And that was set up with
computers in 1970 in the early 70,

517
00:36:41,051 --> 00:36:44,710
[inaudible] 1975, uh,
or shortly after 1975.

518
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,650
And so it's been in place,
uh, ever since. Uh, however,

519
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:55,530
um, it was because it was
mandated by Congress. Uh,

520
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:00,400
the computer system was up to date and
modern in the early seventies or late

521
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,250
seventies, but it hasn't kept up. Uh,

522
00:37:03,251 --> 00:37:07,360
and it's become considered a
slow as they sort of dinosaur,

523
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,990
uh, and uh, um,

524
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:14,920
people want to avoid trading
in it. So, uh, in, um,

525
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:21,460
2006 all the major exchanges,
uh,

526
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:23,380
propose that we replaced the,

527
00:37:23,381 --> 00:37:28,381
its with something called and s linkage,

528
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:37,490
which is just a more modern version
of the computer technology. But,

529
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,590
uh,
I don't,

530
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:44,210
I haven't heard anything about
it being implemented. Now again,

531
00:37:44,211 --> 00:37:45,170
since I don't trade,

532
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:50,180
I maybe if some of you knows what's
happened with this NMS linkage system when

533
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,380
we put this NNS linkage was from host.

534
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:01,440
But you see what's happening when the
government tries to mandate a linking of

535
00:38:01,441 --> 00:38:02,274
exchanges,

536
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,170
that's not the same thing as having a
market impetus for linking of exchanges.

537
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,770
Uh, and so, uh, uh,

538
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:15,690
what's actually happened is really
ignoring the national market system.

539
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:19,980
Computer technology has
advanced so rapidly.

540
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:25,490
It starts to create opportunities for
people to set up their own competing

541
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:30,711
systems and who cares about the its
which is a dinosaur which nobody likes.

542
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,710
Uh, and so that, that's
something we have to,

543
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,400
that there's different approaches and
there was going to be clever people who

544
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:44,170
come up with new ideas about
how to trade stocks. So,

545
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:48,640
um,
this brings us to the so called e c ends.

546
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:52,870
Uh,
they were called the electronic

547
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,600
communications

548
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:04,030
networks.
Uh,

549
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,710
and what happened was with the advent
of the Internet in the mid 1990s,

550
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:15,130
people started setting up websites that,
uh,

551
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:20,720
they look like stock exchanges, but
maybe they weren't. Uh, the, uh,

552
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,483
um,

553
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,050
I guess the first one was instant that,

554
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,290
uh,
I'm not sure it's the absolute first one,

555
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,580
but instant that was, uh,

556
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,440
now understand that the exchange
has to register with the SEC.

557
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,730
And the SEC has all kinds of requirements.
Uh,

558
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,300
and if you're setting up some website,

559
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:51,000
you probably can't satisfy all those
requirements. So instant that set up a,

560
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:55,450
an electronic bulletin board I call it,
which was not an exchange,

561
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,250
but it was a place where people interested
in buying and selling shares could

562
00:40:00,251 --> 00:40:04,780
post their interest. It was like
an electronic bulletin board. Uh,

563
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,120
and uh,
uh,

564
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:14,010
so it will be especially important for
people who are placing really big orders,

565
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,200
uh, because, uh, they might want to, uh,

566
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:23,500
not just put it on the floor of
the exchange, but to, uh, uh,

567
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,380
they might want to
say something on the,

568
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,850
on the thing about,
you know,

569
00:40:30,851 --> 00:40:33,820
under what conditions I would
buy this or something like that.

570
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:38,860
So it became more flexible and became
very popular among institutional traders.

571
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,253
Uh,

572
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,440
then there are a number of other easy
and now the FCC allowed them to be,

573
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:52,720
to function as ECM, which
is a separate category. Uh,

574
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,850
and they start to look like exchanges.

575
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:59,060
And I guess the legal history
of this is very complicated. Uh,

576
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,880
they ended up merging with exchanges.

577
00:41:00,881 --> 00:41:05,881
This is in the 1990s
and early two thousands.

578
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:12,730
I remember one that impressed
me because I heard in the 90s,

579
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:17,080
the talk from the founder island was a,
uh,

580
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,890
exchange that was created
when you see this, um,

581
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:26,290
that was created, uh, for small investors.

582
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:31,740
Uh, and uh, it actually started to
look a lot like an exchange. Uh,

583
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,480
what I found interesting about island,
they,

584
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:38,700
the person that I heard speak
about it in the 90s, uh,

585
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,700
spoke of this as democratizing
institutions and it was
the web culture taking

586
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:47,090
over what the stock exchanges had done.
Uh,

587
00:41:47,091 --> 00:41:52,091
and so what island did is it posted it's
limited so-called order book order book

588
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,980
on the web to the whole
world to see, uh, and uh,

589
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,070
uh, it, uh,

590
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:08,960
it was kind of challenging stock
exchanges which had kept the order books,

591
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,330
uh,
more or less in secrecy.

592
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:16,760
So let me just step back and let's go
back to what happens on an exchange and

593
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:20,300
how instant that in Ireland are different.

594
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,650
There was another one,
another big one was called archipelago.

595
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:27,980
That sounds like Ireland
archipelago

596
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,200
was another website that you used to be
able to get on and you could read these

597
00:42:33,201 --> 00:42:35,840
order books for any stock
and you see some, but let me,

598
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,270
let's step back and
talk about what goes on.

599
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,460
Traditionally at the New York Stock
Exchange, and it still goes on today,

600
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,670
the New York Stock Exchange,

601
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:50,230
which is the biggest
stock exchanges in the US,

602
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,960
but also in some ways
the most old fashioned,

603
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:57,620
they still have a floor trading floor.

604
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:04,490
Most dark exchanges, um, have uh, uh,

605
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,960
abolish their trading floor. I
just gave a talk in Moscow, uh,

606
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,190
at their stock exchange and
I was mentioning something
about trading floors and

607
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:16,040
someone raised his hand and your
audience that you're talking it,

608
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:19,750
the Russians stack exchange trading for,
that's where my Tarko,

609
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:24,710
I didn't even know I was in it.
Uh, I was in the German, uh,

610
00:43:24,711 --> 00:43:29,600
Frankfurt Stock Exchange, uh, and I
was, uh, uh, they said, let's show,

611
00:43:29,601 --> 00:43:31,070
I'll show you our trading floor.

612
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,600
So I walk in and I just see a bunch
of school children. And they had,

613
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,380
there was nobody there
except schoolchildren. And
it turned into a museum.

614
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:42,620
That's what's happening all over the
world. Everything is going electronic.

615
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:47,480
But the New York Stock Exchange and the
Toronto Stock Exchange and the American

616
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:52,160
stock exchange of a few, uh, x
versus the Montreal, I forget now.

617
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:57,080
Anyway, there's very few that still do
it this way, but we still have a floor.

618
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:01,860
Okay. And so, um, you have, um,

619
00:44:03,290 --> 00:44:08,290
for each stock you have a specialist who
stands and a post on the floor of the

620
00:44:11,961 --> 00:44:16,220
exchange. So each stock
has a specialist. Okay.

621
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:20,790
Uh, and then, uh, you have, uh,

622
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,290
trainers who roam around
the floor and go to, uh,

623
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,740
these are, uh, brokers are
dealers who are, um, uh,

624
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:34,470
who are trying to buy and sell stocks.
Uh,

625
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:38,550
and they go to the various posts,
uh, and they make their rounds.

626
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:41,940
They have so many stocks they want to buy
and someone that they want to sell and

627
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:46,530
they go around, uh, uh, on
the floor of the exchange.

628
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:49,890
And if they want to buy a
particular company, they go to,

629
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:53,640
they know where that specialist is
and they go there on the floor of the

630
00:44:53,641 --> 00:44:56,550
exchange.
They can either

631
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:03,470
buy and sell from the specialist who is
a dealer who maintains an inventory or

632
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,810
they can buy and sell from anybody else.

633
00:45:06,811 --> 00:45:09,780
They meet at the post because
everyone there is licensed.

634
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,580
It's not open to the public.

635
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,240
So what happens is there is a crowd that
develops at each specialist post and

636
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,020
the crowd, uh, consists of, uh,

637
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:24,270
people who,
uh,

638
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:29,490
who decided to go to that
specialist post to look, uh,

639
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:34,290
uh, at what they want, uh,

640
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:37,740
the passively by herself so that they
can buy and sell with from anyone.

641
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:42,090
The specialist is sometimes just standing
there watching and it's all happening.

642
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:47,490
But the specialist and the New York Stock
Exchange maintains that the specialist

643
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:51,150
fulfills an important function,
which is to create an orderly market.

644
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:56,550
So the specialist has a
responsibility as well as a,

645
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:01,110
an opportunity the other people at the
crowd or just doing their own business,

646
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:06,150
but the specialist is supposed to be
obligated to preserve a good market.

647
00:46:06,151 --> 00:46:10,410
So if for some reason the
price prices dropping rapidly,

648
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,920
uh, and the specialists
thinks something's wrong,

649
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:19,310
the specialist is supposed to come in
and buy a on his or her own account to do

650
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:24,180
it. That's an obligation. Uh, and so, uh,

651
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:29,760
uh, there've been, there have
been problems. For example,

652
00:46:29,761 --> 00:46:33,600
in 1987, when the stock
market dropped precipitously,

653
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:37,890
there are criticisms of the specialists
for not buying to support the market,

654
00:46:37,891 --> 00:46:39,990
but then specialists said
in their own defense,

655
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,390
what can we do with
the market is crashing.

656
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:46,590
So it's not clear that specialists
make a huge difference, but,

657
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:51,180
uh, that's the presumed
advantage. Now, it used to be,

658
00:46:51,181 --> 00:46:55,680
this is an interesting historical
thing that, ah, in the,

659
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:59,850
before the 1930s, uh, there were,

660
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:05,010
um, there were two crowds
on the stock exchange.

661
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:10,260
There was the, um, the buy sell crowd. Uh,

662
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:14,580
and there was another part of the floor.
Uh, I can't find this in my notes,

663
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:17,250
uh,
where stocks would be rented.

664
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:23,040
I had the dates here and I don't remember.
I can't find it in my notes.

665
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:24,503
Um,

666
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:32,080
well, uh, shares are,

667
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,730
it's called the lone crowd.

668
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:42,250
There used to be a special part of the
floor of the New York Stock Exchange

669
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:47,290
where stocks would be lent
rather than sold, right?

670
00:47:47,291 --> 00:47:49,050
There's two things. You can do
it, there's two kinds of trades,

671
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:52,360
but you got to a real estate broker.
You can say, I want to buy a house.

672
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:53,403
Or you can say,

673
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,240
I want to rent a house and the broker
can do both of those for you. Uh,

674
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:02,920
same thing with stocks. You can say,
I want to buy a stock. Or you can say,

675
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,660
I want to rent a store,
or you can go the other way.

676
00:48:04,661 --> 00:48:07,840
I want to sell a stock and I'd like
to rent out. And I started, well,

677
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:12,060
why would anyone want to rent a
stock? Uh, or rented, uh, well,

678
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:16,300
that's called short sales, right?
They would rent to stock and sell it.

679
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,400
And so, uh, uh, it used to be that, uh,

680
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,190
uh, they, of course, if
you're lending out of stock,

681
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:29,190
you might demand some compensation
for that. So they used to, uh,

682
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:30,990
argue at,

683
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:35,560
there'll be a specialist crowd called
the there to be a crowd that would argue

684
00:48:35,561 --> 00:48:39,910
about the rental costs,
which is an interest cost for loaning,

685
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:44,680
for borrowing a security. And The
Wall Street Journal used to publish,

686
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:46,390
there were two stocks sections,

687
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:51,200
there was the price section and
there was the loan section. Uh,

688
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:57,110
and that however disappeared in the
after the stock market crash of 1929 and

689
00:48:59,861 --> 00:49:04,861
apparently it disappeared because of
a concern that shorting stocks was the

690
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:09,040
cause of the 1929 crash.

691
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,300
And the story was at j Edgar
Hoover who was head of the FBI,

692
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,340
thought that shorting stocks had
caused the crash and he didn't like it.

693
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:22,360
And if j Edgar Hoover didn't like
what you were doing back then,

694
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,760
you were afraid and worried.

695
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:28,300
So the New York Stock Exchange without
ever publishing it just shut the whole

696
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:32,380
thing down. And to this day we
don't have a loan crowd anymore.

697
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:35,710
We do still lend out shares,
but it's uh,

698
00:49:35,711 --> 00:49:39,970
it's not done on the floor
of the exchange. Uh, anyway,

699
00:49:39,971 --> 00:49:43,630
the specialist at the floor
of the exchange has a book,

700
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:49,460
uh, and it used to be a
big thick paper book. Uh,

701
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,080
and what the specialist
would do. Uh, who would, uh,

702
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:57,510
specialists would a record in the book,
uh,

703
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:01,030
offers and uh, uh, uh,

704
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:05,110
bids and the bid and ask prices.

705
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:08,550
There will be people who would tell them,
um,

706
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,110
the specialist that uh,

707
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:16,830
I want to sell so many shares at such
a price or buy so many shares at such a

708
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:18,640
price.
Uh,

709
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:23,780
and the book would show a list
of orders that were outstanding.

710
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:28,790
Um, now this back to, um,

711
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,000
I should clarify kinds of orders.

712
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:42,000
When you call up a broker and say,
I would like to buy or sell shares,

713
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,880
there's different, you can, you can give,

714
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:46,980
you're giving her a brook Roker and order.

715
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,980
You can give the broker a market order.

716
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,600
If you give a market order to your broker,

717
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:00,140
you're saying you only have
to give the broker one number,

718
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:01,790
which is a number of shares.

719
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:06,020
So I can have a buy order or
a sell order market order.

720
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,910
If it's a buy or all I do is say I
want you to buy for me is let's say a

721
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:15,410
thousand shares of this company
and whatever price is out there,

722
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:20,390
it just, you know, get the best price
you can, but they execute it right now.

723
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:25,700
Okay.
So it only gives me a number of shares.

724
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:30,880
MMM.

725
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,510
Another kind of order,
however, is a limit order.

726
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,493
Okay.

727
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,930
And with this order,

728
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:43,970
you have to tell the broker both
the number of shares and the price,

729
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:49,130
uh, and uh, there is a,
either a buy or a sell.

730
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,870
So, uh, if it's a buy limit
order, you want to say,

731
00:51:53,871 --> 00:51:58,871
I want you to buy the stock at any
price up to the one I mentioned.

732
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:01,543
So I would give,

733
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:06,620
I would say like a thousand
shares at $30 this year.

734
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:11,990
Okay. And that means that
if it's a buy order, uh,

735
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:16,100
you wait until you don't execute
it immediately, you execute it.

736
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,150
When the price falls below $30,

737
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:25,220
a person would do this. Who thinks? I
think the stock is a good buy at 30,

738
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:30,140
but not where it's trading now at 35. So
I just put it in, just tell my broker,

739
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:31,363
I'm placing,
I want,

740
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,900
I want you to take this limit order and
I don't expect you to fill this order.

741
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,520
Maybe you'll never fill it,
you know,

742
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:40,790
but I just want it to be
there until I correct it. Uh,

743
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:44,030
you're disposed to be standing ready
and you're supposed to notice when the

744
00:52:44,031 --> 00:52:47,000
price falls below 30th,
and then you, then you buy,

745
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:52,670
if it was a sell limit order, you
would say, uh, I want you to sell it.

746
00:52:52,671 --> 00:52:56,470
If the price gets up to
40, uh, and again, if it,

747
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,140
if it's above the current market
price, it won't be executed. Now.

748
00:53:00,141 --> 00:53:03,140
It might never be executed.
Uh,

749
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:08,120
then there's another kind of
order call the stop loss order.

750
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,073
Uh,

751
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:16,010
and with a stop loss order,
like a limit order,

752
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:20,720
you have to both give a quantity and the
price to your broker when you place the

753
00:53:20,721 --> 00:53:25,370
order. But, and it's similar to
it, but it's in a different, uh,

754
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:29,420
stop a cell. You can have
the same numbers here. Uh,

755
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:34,260
you can say 1,030, uh, for again,

756
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:35,940
but it would have a different meaning.

757
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:41,510
A stop loss order says to sell when
the price hits 30 in this game,

758
00:53:43,310 --> 00:53:46,560
if it were a stop loss order
for a thousand shares at 30,

759
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:50,760
it would be to sell. Uh, if,

760
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:55,710
if the price today is
35, all right, not by it,

761
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,830
it's a different motivation that
you would do a stop loss order.

762
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:03,410
You see the difference. If it's a
limit order, I'm saying, I think I,

763
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:05,130
the stock is only worth 30.

764
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:09,000
I want to buy it when it gets
down to 30 with a stop loss order.

765
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:12,810
If the actual price today is 35 a share,
I'm saying,

766
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,870
I'm worried about the
stock crashing on me.

767
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:20,760
So I want you to get me out if it's
crashing. And when the broker has to know,

768
00:54:20,761 --> 00:54:25,380
well, when do I get you out? Well, you
have to say when, so that's, this is when,

769
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:29,700
so you'd be telling if it's a sell order,
you would be selling,

770
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,390
telling your broker, sell the stock
if the price falls below 30. So He's,

771
00:54:34,391 --> 00:54:37,770
he has a fundamental difference, you
know, limit order and the stop loss order.

772
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:42,420
There's also a buy stop order.
You can tell your broker, uh,

773
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,800
I want you to buy the stock.
If the price rises above 40.

774
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:49,800
All right. Now, why would someone do that?

775
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:55,080
Why would you hell have an order to buy
the stock? Only if it gets expensive. Uh,

776
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,140
well, the people who would do that,
or people who've shorted the stock,

777
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,560
and if you've shorted the stock and
the stock price starts going up,

778
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:05,670
you're in potentially in big trouble.
And so if you worry about that,

779
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:09,480
then you can take a buy stop order
in place that with your broker.

780
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:15,330
Uh, so what island did,
uh, I'm going back to.

781
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:18,120
The brokers used to have these,

782
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:22,410
all these orders for the market orders
wouldn't end up on their book because it

783
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:24,480
would just be executed immediately.
It would be gone.

784
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:28,710
But these limit orders and
stop loss orders would be, uh,

785
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:33,930
would be on the book of the broker.
And the broker would then know the mar,

786
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:37,500
the specialist at the exchange
would have this book, uh,

787
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:40,740
which recorded customers' orders,
uh,

788
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,600
and sort of the specialists
would understand the market
because it would have a

789
00:55:45,601 --> 00:55:48,910
whole bunch of these orders on the books.
Uh,

790
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:53,850
nice thing about island when it
became part of our web culture,

791
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,190
uh, in the, um, in the 1970s is,

792
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:04,020
uh, they created their own
book on the web. And, uh,

793
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:08,930
so, uh, you could get a,

794
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:13,950
and you can actually, and it
was free open to everyone. Um,

795
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:18,210
and so, um, so, so you have the, um,

796
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:20,183
uh,

797
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:25,560
you'd have my orders and sell orders.

798
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,530
Uh, and this would be something
you could see on the web. Actually.

799
00:56:29,531 --> 00:56:32,630
You can see things like this
on the Webinar too, but, uh,

800
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,570
not through Ireland anymore.
But let's say this is some company.

801
00:56:37,571 --> 00:56:42,010
Let's say it's IBM.
All right. Uh, and, uh,

802
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:46,540
you would see something like
this, uh, the buy orders,

803
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:50,320
would you see how I get this?
Right? It will be the first one.

804
00:56:50,321 --> 00:56:54,310
We'd say for $90, a share, 100 shares,

805
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:59,260
someone's willing to buy a hundred shares.

806
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,680
At 90 a and over here you
would see something like
someone is willing to sell at

807
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:12,400
$92,
let's say 200 shares.

808
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:17,500
All right? So, um, there's
no trade here, right?

809
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:22,530
If somebody is willing to buy at 90 and
someone else was willing to buy at 92,

810
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:26,590
there was no trade,
then you'll see other orders.

811
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:31,030
Somebody else is willing
to buy at 89 and a half,

812
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:35,470
say 200 shares.
And you can see these descending,

813
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:40,240
I'm just making up numbers,
88 for a thousand shares and so on.

814
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:43,330
And so we didn't see other people,

815
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:48,480
someone who's going at 92
and a quarter for 300 shares.

816
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:54,670
I'm showing all the purchases in round
lots around a lot as a hundred chairs.

817
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:58,120
Uh,
but you could also have odd lots,

818
00:57:58,121 --> 00:58:02,230
but most of the time people put
round lots on as their trade.

819
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:07,840
Uh, and so this book would then sit
there. There's no trade here, right?

820
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:12,700
This is the, uh, this is
the inside spread that is,

821
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:15,580
that is the,
on the limit order book.

822
00:58:15,581 --> 00:58:19,930
Those are the trades that
are closest to execution,

823
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:23,830
but it's not a, it's not
an executable trade. Yeah.

824
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:29,650
Uh, so what would happen
then? Uh, and it was his,

825
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,600
he would watch the book. It says it's not
electronic. It corrects itself quickly.

826
00:58:34,601 --> 00:58:38,470
I don't know what the specialist had
to do with a feather pen. Originally.

827
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:41,770
They would have to cross these
things out with ink and, uh, uh,

828
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,820
the book was probably hard to maintain,
but now it's all automatic.

829
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:51,180
So suppose someone comes in
with a buy order for a hundred,

830
00:58:51,851 --> 00:58:55,010
at 90, I mean, a sell
order for a hundred at 90.

831
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:57,430
So someone's willing to
sell at a lower price.

832
00:58:57,910 --> 00:59:00,400
What happens immediately on this,

833
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:05,190
this thing you can execute
it in disappeared. Uh,

834
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:11,620
and uh,
so you see that happening on the book.

835
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:16,350
And so it's fun to watch,
uh, an electronic book. Uh,

836
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:19,990
this is what a broker is. See who, uh,

837
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,350
are members of Nasdaq and they
see the electronic trading system,

838
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:26,910
uh, or, uh,

839
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:31,640
of course there's many such
books now that are available.

840
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:35,600
Uh, so, uh,

841
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:41,240
the dealer at the specialist on
the exchange also has his own,

842
00:59:41,570 --> 00:59:45,230
his or her own bid ask
spread, uh, which is a,

843
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:50,231
also an offer you're by herself on the
exchange incident island would only allow

844
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:56,220
one kind of order. Original. Originally
it was only limit orders, uh,

845
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:57,110
because they didn't,

846
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:01,010
they had a system where you had to put
it onto their book and so everything had

847
01:00:01,011 --> 01:00:05,480
to appear on the book. Uh, and so it was
just the limit order book originally.

848
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:10,450
Uh, so the history of this, or let me see,

849
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,520
I guess one thing I wanted to,
uh,

850
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,890
when I was leading up to
is that the EEC hands are,

851
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:17,930
are history now.

852
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:22,730
They've been generally merged and acquired
notably the New York Stock Exchange,

853
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:27,700
which has been a holdout doing
floor trading, uh, bought, uh,

854
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:30,710
archipelago because archipelago,

855
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:34,490
it was growing so fast doing this
kind of electronic trading was,

856
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:36,140
was really catching on.

857
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:41,440
And New York Stock Exchange began to
worry that it was a starting to get behind

858
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:44,540
the times.
So New York stack,

859
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:49,680
these things which were started by kids
and by a young college students in the

860
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,790
late nineties just grew so fast and
they got so big that archipelago,

861
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:58,850
we're starting to look like it was
going to get bigger than New York Stock

862
01:00:58,851 --> 01:01:00,440
Exchange.
So finally,

863
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:05,360
New York Stock Exchange merge with them
and they changed the name after 200

864
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:08,850
years in business.
They changed the name to n y.

865
01:01:08,851 --> 01:01:13,590
S e r Arca X.
Rkx is short for archipelago exchange.

866
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:16,790
Uh, but that didn't last long. I'm
going to change their name again.

867
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,820
They just merged.
New York Stock Exchange,

868
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:22,790
merged with the European
stock exchange euro next.

869
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:27,110
And so now it's called NYC Euronext.

870
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:32,300
Everything happens so fast. It
seems fast to me. Maybe, uh,

871
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:33,930
uh, the, uh,

872
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:38,630
New York stock exchange is in the process
we think of merging with the American

873
01:01:38,631 --> 01:01:42,650
stock exchange. Uh, and
that's happening right now.

874
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,670
Um, but I, uh,

875
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:49,170
I wanted to just finish
with just a little bit, uh,

876
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:54,200
of a thoughts about what it means
to be a dealer in this market. Uh,

877
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,570
and,
uh,

878
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:00,950
what is it that if you are a dealer
operating on one of these exchanges,

879
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:06,470
you are placing orders effectively
in somebody's book and, and,

880
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:09,860
uh, uh, uh,

881
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:15,160
and standing ready to buy or sell a
dealer is someone who is trading every day

882
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:21,510
and, uh, who has an inventory of stocks,

883
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:24,490
uh, fraternity. Uh,

884
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:29,540
and I wanted to just maybe close with a
little thought about what it's like to

885
01:02:29,701 --> 01:02:31,250
be a dealer.
Uh,

886
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:36,070
I've never been a dealer and I don't
know the emotional thing, but, uh,

887
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:40,500
the problem with being a
dealer, uh, of any kind,

888
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,250
uh, and maybe it takes
a certain moral stamina,

889
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:49,140
mental stamina to do this kind of thing,
is that you're trading every day, right?

890
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:52,560
You're not someone who's
managing the Yale portfolio.

891
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:58,190
What you're trying to do is make money
every day by buying low and selling high.

892
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:01,350
Uh,
and you have to be ready to stand,

893
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:05,310
ready to take orders because
people come to you, right?

894
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:09,450
Someone will come to you or maybe someone
in a specialist crowd who wants to

895
01:03:09,451 --> 01:03:13,560
place an order, uh, or by herself,
and you have an inventory.

896
01:03:13,561 --> 01:03:18,150
You're like an antiques
dealer. Uh, and uh, uh,

897
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:21,620
the problem, one problem is that, uh,

898
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:27,320
your life's work unfortunately as a
dealer is summarized by your portfolio and

899
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:32,310
your inventory. Uh, that's why I didn't
become a dealer. Actually. I don't,

900
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:34,853
uh,

901
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:39,690
I guess you have to have the right
her stomach of steel or something.

902
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:44,880
But the thing that I wanted to invest on
you is that no matter how well you do,

903
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:45,560
uh,

904
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:50,560
your cumulative score is there in your
portfolio and it's a competitive business

905
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:55,560
and so you run the risk of being
ruined at anytime in your life.

906
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:57,720
Uh,
and so this just,

907
01:03:57,721 --> 01:04:02,721
I wanted to remind you of the what's
called the gambler's ruin problem because

908
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:08,310
being a dealer is a little bit like
being someone who goes to the gambling

909
01:04:08,311 --> 01:04:13,020
casino every day. If you enjoy
your visit to the gambling casino,

910
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:16,530
maybe you want to be a dealer. A,
actually, I don't really enjoy it,

911
01:04:16,531 --> 01:04:19,550
so I just not the right person to do this.
Uh,

912
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:23,940
but I really wouldn't like about it is
that you always stand the chance of being

913
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:27,810
ruined. That is losing everything.
So I just wanted to review it.

914
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:32,830
This is a little bit of mathematics that
is in a market microstructure theory.

915
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:35,653
Um,

916
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:43,630
okay. Um, so, uh,

917
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:46,500
suppose you're a dealer and uh,

918
01:04:46,590 --> 01:04:51,120
you have a way of either winning or
losing money on each transaction,

919
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:55,290
okay? Uh, and suppose the probability

920
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,713
of winning

921
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:04,290
on a transaction is equal to p.
Uh,

922
01:05:04,590 --> 01:05:06,720
okay.
Um,

923
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:10,860
that's the probability of
winning on one of your trades.

924
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:15,060
And to simplify this thing,
let's say that you either win or lose.

925
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:20,140
If you win, you get $1. Uh, if you,

926
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:23,620
if you lose,
you lose $1.

927
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:29,910
So you win $1 with probability P
and you lose $1 with probability,

928
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:34,150
one minus P.
Okay?

929
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:42,870
Uh, so I want to know what, what is
your life life career going to look for?

930
01:05:42,871 --> 01:05:47,380
Like if you're just doing this
every day for the next 30 years.

931
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,550
Okay. Um, well the first
question is, uh, what, what does,

932
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:56,290
what does the probability of
your being ruined and let,

933
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:59,170
let's start with the case.
P equals a half.

934
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:04,960
And let's not say 30 years
is close enough to infinity,

935
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:08,200
but let's just say you're going
to do this forever cause I don't,

936
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:11,800
I don't want to have to figure
out the effect of that last day.

937
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:14,410
What do you think is the
probability of being?

938
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:18,160
Remember being ruined means having
your inventory fall to zero.

939
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,070
You start with a s dollars.

940
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:29,170
That's capital s dollars. All
right? Which is an integer.

941
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:33,670
When s falls to zero,
you are quote ruined.

942
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:36,250
You don't have any money left
here out of the game and,

943
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:40,510
and you will be dismissed from the
exchange. You can't trade anymore.

944
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:44,230
You don't have anything. All right?
So you have to start with something,

945
01:06:44,231 --> 01:06:48,310
otherwise you can't trade it all.
And so acid, something like $100.

946
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:51,130
If p is a point,
does any of you know the answer?

947
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:55,120
What's the probability that
I will eventually be ruined?

948
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,890
This isn't something that you got
in your probability theory. Oh,

949
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:09,700
you got it right. Yeah, I know who
said that. That's right. It's 100%,

950
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:14,200
uh, you will with
certainty, uh, be ruined.

951
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:19,510
Uh, and in fact, the
probability of ruin is, uh,

952
01:07:20,230 --> 01:07:24,760
is one minus p divided by P

953
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:28,300
two.
The s power,

954
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:33,070
if he is great with them,

955
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:38,080
0.5 or greater than equal to 0.5.

956
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:44,680
Uh, that's because, uh, if
you, if you substitute in 0.5,

957
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:49,330
this is one. So the probability
of ruin is one, but, uh, if it's,

958
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:52,480
if the probability is greater than 0.5,

959
01:07:52,990 --> 01:07:56,890
then the probability of ruin will
be something less than one. Uh,

960
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:01,940
this is actually easy to derive
because think of it this way,

961
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:03,330
uh,

962
01:08:03,330 --> 01:08:08,330
we call this the probability
of ruin if you have s dollars.

963
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:13,990
And the reason it has this is because,
um,

964
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:19,250
if I start with s dollars, uh, there,

965
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,490
there are two possibilities,

966
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:27,530
either gain one or lose one. So, uh,

967
01:08:27,531 --> 01:08:32,531
this probability of ASCE has to equal
to p times the probability of s plus one

968
01:08:35,990 --> 01:08:40,990
plus one minus p times the
probability of s minus one.

969
01:08:41,830 --> 01:08:44,510
Right?
Uh,

970
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:51,170
that is the probability.
This is the probability of
ruin. If you have s plus $1,

971
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:54,740
and this is the probability of
ruin if you have s minus $1.

972
01:08:55,280 --> 01:09:00,140
So the function determining probability
I've asked has to satisfy this equation.

973
01:09:00,910 --> 01:09:02,480
And also we have the restraint.

974
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:08,090
Probability of ruin if you
have $0 million is one. And so,

975
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:12,980
uh, this is a difference equation. If
you solve it, you get this. Um, so,

976
01:09:13,610 --> 01:09:14,443
uh,

977
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:19,540
what it means is that you had better have
a probability of winning substantially

978
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:25,430
above one or else have an awful
lot of of dollars to start with.

979
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:27,260
Uh,
uh,

980
01:09:27,261 --> 01:09:32,261
unfortunately it's hard
to get the probability of
winning in any one trade much

981
01:09:32,630 --> 01:09:36,740
up above a half because you're
living in a competitive marketplace.

982
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:40,910
Uh, and so, uh, if uh,

983
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,570
if p is close to a half,
it's just a little bit above a half,

984
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:50,110
then you will be standing for your whole
life always with a probability that the

985
01:09:50,721 --> 01:09:54,170
rest of my life is going
to end up in ruin. Uh,

986
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:59,000
so you may have been very successful and
you now have a a thousand s as equal to

987
01:09:59,001 --> 01:10:03,580
a thousand by the probability keeps going
down, but it never hits zero. Yeah, art.

988
01:10:05,290 --> 01:10:06,123
Okay,

989
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:10,070
well that's what you have.
That's what people do.

990
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:20,200
Well, they are taking money off or maybe,
yeah, because they are doing that, uh, uh,

991
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:24,440
you, you, you live your life
and you, you take money off. Uh,

992
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:26,271
yeah,
you're right.

993
01:10:26,271 --> 01:10:30,710
I don't have to play it out
to the bitter end like this.

994
01:10:31,230 --> 01:10:33,650
Um,
but I wanted to show,

995
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:38,660
this is actually this mathematical model
is something that you will find in the

996
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:39,500
page,

997
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:44,500
one of chapter one of a micro market
micro structure textbook because you're

998
01:10:46,161 --> 01:10:50,690
right, there's strategies that
can prevent ruin like that. Uh,

999
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:55,010
but this is the basic, this is just, I'm
presenting this as a very simple model,

1000
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:59,660
um, uh, of what underlies
the restriction on a,

1001
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:04,820
on a broker. A broker has to, has to um,

1002
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:06,283
uh,

1003
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:11,460
main to create a strategy such that this
p is sufficiently probable that this

1004
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:17,370
ruin problem doesn't become a
catastrophic. And the way they do that,

1005
01:11:17,371 --> 01:11:21,830
they set the,
the bid ask spread that a dealer has a,

1006
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,840
with a consideration of this ruin problem,

1007
01:11:24,841 --> 01:11:28,110
which has to be the focal
point of their attention. Uh,

1008
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:32,760
and they have to set the bid ask
spread wide enough so that they feel

1009
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:37,560
comfortable enough with this
probability of ruin. Uh, and,

1010
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:39,180
uh,
if you don't,

1011
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:44,520
of course it's a competitive market and
so you can't get this probability up too

1012
01:11:44,521 --> 01:11:47,910
high. Um, and so if you don't like this,

1013
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:51,090
don't become a dealer.
That's the way it is.

1014
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:56,270
So the people who are in this business
are people who can tolerate this prospect

1015
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:01,470
of ruin. Uh, um, but yeah, in
other hand, ruin isn't death.

1016
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:02,730
And that's nothing you were saying,

1017
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:05,940
I can make a living doing
this for awhile and, uh,

1018
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:09,390
I am taking money out and
that's part of the strategy. Uh,

1019
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:13,060
so maybe I'm just being too
much of an academic here. Uh,

1020
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:17,880
I live in great comfort in academia
and these beautiful surroundings.

This university has been
around for 300 years, you know,

1022
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:24,100
I have no worries.
Uh,

1023
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:28,890
and so you might want to consider an
academic career instead of you career and

1024
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:30,720
finance. All right. Uh,

1025
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:34,620
so I hope to see you again then on Friday.

1026
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:36,930
I think we'll have a good
time with Schwartzman.
