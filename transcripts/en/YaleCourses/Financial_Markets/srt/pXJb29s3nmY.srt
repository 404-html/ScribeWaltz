1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:05,480
I want to talk today about the
efficient markets hypothesis.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:08,980
Uh, and, uh, uh,

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,820
let me just first say a last
lecture was about insurance. Uh,

4
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,870
and I was telling you about the theory
of insurance and how it's evolved over

5
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:25,130
the years, uh, and how it's
produced some real benefits.

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,683
Uh,

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,940
um,
is that better?

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,880
It says Mike Volume.
Did that go up?

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,100
Okay. So, um,

10
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,940
I wanted to just tie this in,
uh,

11
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,000
the advantages of insurance that we
have to some big events that occurred.

12
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,570
Uh, and that will, I think, uh,

13
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,740
point out the strengths and
weaknesses of our institutions.

14
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,070
So we had a terrible hurricane a
couple of years ago in Los Angeles.

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,780
Uh, Hurricane Katrina, uh, damaged,
uh, the city of, I'm sorry,

16
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:09,740
did I say Los Angeles?

17
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,010
You have to stop me when I say
things that are, uh, obviously wrong.

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:16,970
Uh,

19
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,970
my mind lapses sometime New Orleans and
Los Angeles doesn't have to worry about

20
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,030
hurricanes as far as I know, unless
there's some major change. Uh,

21
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:31,360
in New Orleans, uh, there
was a hurricane Katrina, uh,

22
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,710
it, uh, broke the, uh,

23
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,380
levies that were surrounding the city
and cause a flooding of the city. Uh,

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,310
and, uh, what, what saved
the people of the city?

25
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,930
Mostly I would say it's actually
the insurance institutions because,

26
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,330
uh,
the city was heavily damaged,

27
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,550
but homes were generally insured.
Uh,

28
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,520
there was some conflicts that
happened when this huge disaster came.

29
00:01:58,521 --> 00:02:03,470
Some people had wind insurance and
some people had flood insurance.

30
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,680
Uh, and, uh, it would be, became,

31
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,340
you came difficult whether this was
a wind or a flood problem, right,

32
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:15,020
because the wind caused the flood.
So if you had only wind insurance,

33
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:19,100
are you covered? So there was a lot
of bickering and arguments afterwards,

34
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,310
but I think it worked out well there.
Uh, there, there were surveys of, uh,

35
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:27,770
customer satisfaction,
uh, after the, uh, event.

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,540
And I think generally people were
happy with their insurance companies.

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,110
Of course there were some that were not,

38
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,450
who may have found out that they weren't
covered. But, uh, uh, on the whole,

39
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:41,930
the experience worked well. So, uh,

40
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,210
the other thing I wanted to say
about the last lecture is that, um,

41
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,170
as,
as financial progress moves on,

42
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,790
the distinction between insurance and
other forms of risk management may get

43
00:02:55,791 --> 00:03:00,300
blurred. And one very interesting thing
that's been happening is that, uh,

44
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,340
we are starting to see development of
another institution called the catastrophe

45
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:09,400
bond, which is a, uh,

46
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,600
another way that people have of protecting
themselves against catastrophes.

47
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,450
And it's not insurance.
So I,

48
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:21,451
catastrophe bond is a bond that the issuer
doesn't have to pay off if there's a

49
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:26,170
catastrophe. All right?
So you can have hurricane.

50
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,380
The city of New Orleans could
raise money with catastrophe bonds,

51
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,980
uh, that, uh, uh, they have to
pay back if there's no hurricane,

52
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,900
but, uh, they don't have to pay
back if there is a hurricane,

53
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,750
uh, or it could be some
mixture. They'd pay back.

54
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:47,470
Part of it if there is a hurricane
that that's like insurance, isn't it?

55
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:51,160
But it doesn't operate through
an insurance company. Uh,

56
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,770
it operates through the securities market.

57
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,340
So a good example of that
is a couple of years ago,

58
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,670
the government of Mexico issued
catastrophe bonds against earthquakes.

59
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,480
Uh,

60
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,480
Mexico City was hit by a terrible
earthquake about 20 years ago.

61
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,730
Uh,
and it's vulnerable to being hit again.

62
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,580
So what does Mexico do about this?

63
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,140
Mexico could wait until there is a
hurricane and hope that there's some

64
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:23,800
international relief
effort. Uh, but you know,

65
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:28,570
that's not a very good way to perceive.
We want to arrange it in advance. So,

66
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,240
uh, what Mexico did, his
issue, cat bonds, uh, that, uh,

67
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,900
have to be repaid in the absence of a
hurricane and have a lower repayment if

68
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:40,990
there is, I've said it, a hurricane
and not at my desk to form today.

69
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,790
Earthquake in Mexico City does not
have to worry about hurricanes either.

70
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,700
Every area is different and they
have their own, um, their own, uh,

71
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,930
individual, uh,
characteristics. So right now,

72
00:04:55,931 --> 00:04:59,590
the insurance industry
is a bit challenged, uh,

73
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,710
because in terms of some risks,

74
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,600
because the risk seems to be changing
through time, uh, and notably, uh,

75
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:11,430
it looks like hurricane
risk is increasing. Uh,

76
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,560
and so people who are insured in it
seems to be increasing because of global

77
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:20,020
warming. Although I don't know if
all scientists are agreed on that.

78
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,350
But if you live in a
coastal area of Florida,

79
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,500
it does appear that your risk
is increasing through time.

80
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:31,320
So insurance companies want
to raise your rates. Uh,

81
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,700
and this is a huge issue down in Florida.
Well,

82
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:38,200
the government has kind of taken
over, uh, for the time being, uh,

83
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,050
insurance, uh, in Florida because, uh, we,

84
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,630
we have problems,
uh,

85
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,880
people that are having problems paying
the increased insurance premium. Uh, so,

86
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,770
um, I don't think we've figured
out finally how, uh, uh,

87
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,500
insurance will ultimately
look in a matter of years.

88
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,810
But I think that the important thing is
that it's protecting us against already,

89
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,980
maybe in perfectly,

90
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:08,350
but it's already protecting us
against some of our worst fears, uh,

91
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,250
like hurricanes and earthquakes.
Uh,

92
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,180
and that I think the system is evolving
and we're getting new developments like

93
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:18,560
cat, like cat bonds that are
changing the way we're doing things.

94
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,730
And in the future,

95
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:24,500
I think these will develop more and
make us even better able to handle,

96
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,610
uh, uh, catastrophe risks. Anyway,

97
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:33,611
that's the last lecture today I wanted
to talk about back to a securities

98
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:38,150
markets are actually more
general asset markets.

99
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:43,310
And I want to talk today about
the efficient market's hypothesis,

100
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,490
uh, which is, uh,

101
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,520
a very important intellectual construct,
uh,

102
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,610
that has guided a lot of,
uh,

103
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,850
a lot of theory in finance.
Uh,

104
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,100
I want to talk first about
the history of the hypothesis.

105
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:03,530
I haven't defined it yet for you,
but maybe you already have heard of this.

106
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:08,470
But a history of the hypothesis
and the arguments for it, uh,

107
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,190
and then the arguments against it.

108
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,230
And I want to talk about
technical analysis and uh,

109
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,730
empirical evidence in the literature
about technical analysis. Uh, and other,

110
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:22,670
uh, uh, other, uh,

111
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,660
schools of thought that
doubt of market efficiency.

112
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:30,380
Talk somewhat about behavioral economics.
Um,

113
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,710
and then finally we have a homework
assignment. Actually it's coming up.

114
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:37,130
I'll start talking about
it now. So, uh, uh,

115
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,170
it'd be an assignment for you to try
to forecast the stock market using

116
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:45,110
statistical methods. So, uh,

117
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,440
you don't have to look at the screen yet.
It just blinked off.

118
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,210
I'll come back to that. Uh, so the,

119
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:57,390
uh, what is the efficient
market's hypothesis? Uh,

120
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,690
the term actually is a
fairly recent, uh, origin,

121
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:06,110
uh, that is, um, a few decades ago.

122
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,920
But the idea it goes back much further.
Uh,

123
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,180
the idea is that in,

124
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,840
in asset markets that have a good,

125
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,840
uh, uh, they have good, uh, uh,

126
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,010
uh, regulations and, uh, uh,

127
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,430
market makers and develop markets that
have a lot of depth and liquidity in

128
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:38,270
these markets.
The prices that you see are

129
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,010
perfect indicators of true value.
In other words,

130
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:49,040
efficient markets says that the market
efficiently incorporates all information

131
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,870
and the prices are like
the best information,

132
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,630
uh, about the value of
something. In other words,

133
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:05,130
the efficient markets hypothesis
tells you trust market,

134
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,880
don't trust people, trust markets. Uh,

135
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,940
so, uh, I've been trying to find
out who said that first. Uh,

136
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,680
and, uh, the earliest, uh,

137
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,430
statement of the efficient
markets hypothesis,

138
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,490
although it doesn't call it the
efficient market's hypothesis.

139
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,680
The earliest statement that I
could find comes from a book, uh,

140
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,880
written in 1889, uh, by George Gibson,

141
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,950
uh, and it's called, um, the
stock exchanges of London,

142
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,630
Paris and New York. Uh,
and, uh, a quote him,

143
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,360
uh,
he said,

144
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,380
when shares become publicly
known in an open market,

145
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,690
the value which they acquire there may
be regarded as the judgment of the best

146
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:59,580
intelligence concerning them. So, uh,
I kind of interested to see this book.

147
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:04,330
I found it in the mud library actually
by accident, looking through old,

148
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:09,180
uh, stock market books.
Uh, and, uh, the, uh,

149
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,050
the book had some
interesting observations.

150
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,370
One observation which took
my interest was that, uh,

151
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,940
he points out that in this
modern electronic age, uh,

152
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,910
information speeds around the
globe at the speed of electricity,

153
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,800
uh, or the speed of light. Uh, when I,
when I first read that, I thought from it,

154
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,670
wait a minute, 1889, that
sounds like 1989 or something.

155
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:39,260
Are we going to interrupt the,
uh Huh?

156
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,293
Just a moment.

157
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,100
We found the microphone. Why didn't
want him, it was right there.

158
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:53,280
Sorry about that.
There you go.

159
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,770
No, I'm free from my, from my tether.

160
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,710
Um, in 1889, uh,

161
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:11,950
they had already invented the Telegraph,
right. That goes back decades earlier. Uh,

162
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,320
and the telephone was,
was starting to appear.

163
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,700
And so it really was true that,
um,

164
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,110
information would speed around the globe.
Uh,

165
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,190
and so information that became publicly
known would be entered into market price

166
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:32,080
almost immediately. And so the
conclusion that Gibson had was that,

167
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,720
uh, uh, there's no, uh, there's,

168
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,430
there's no hope and trying
to beat the price or, or, or,

169
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,990
or beat the market because the price
already has all of the information in it.

170
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,250
It, let me elaborate on that
theme a little bit. Actually.

171
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:49,960
It goes back before telegraph.

172
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:55,020
There was a famous story of a Mr
Writers who had a information service,

173
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,630
uh, before the Telegraph was
invented, uh, and he, uh,

174
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,370
wanted to help his clients,
uh,

175
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,200
get the information first so
that they could trade on it. Uh,

176
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,320
and he had the idea of using a,
what you call a carrier pigeons, uh,

177
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,640
what you do because you get
these birds and you raised them,

178
00:12:15,641 --> 00:12:16,840
you know what I'm talking about,
right?

179
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,170
You raised them in once place and then
they're going to want to go back there.

180
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:22,600
So then you take them away
in a cage to another city,

181
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,730
and when you need to get a message across,

182
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:27,820
you tie the message to the
pigeons foot and release it,

183
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:32,130
and then it will fly back and it
will beat any other method of a,

184
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:36,550
of a message. Transmission.
Uh, so writer, incidentally,

185
00:12:36,551 --> 00:12:40,540
riders information service is
still in business today. Uh,

186
00:12:40,541 --> 00:12:45,040
and now they use computers that way.
Everyone else does. But the hope,

187
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:49,290
the whole principle precedes
the invention of computers. Uh,

188
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,770
the idea is that the only way you can
beat the market is to get information that

189
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:58,090
nobody else has. The way
it works today is that, uh,

190
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,310
uh, the, we can't actually improve
on the speed from 1889 right?

191
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:07,000
Because they were already going at
virtually the speed of light with their

192
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:11,350
information. But we can improve
on the, uh, our access to it.

193
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,130
So now many people have
beepers or, uh, you know,

194
00:13:15,131 --> 00:13:19,360
something like this in their pocket
that wakes up and tells them a news is

195
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:22,420
announced. So what happens when
there is news about a stock?

196
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:27,760
So let's say it's a drug company that
just makes an announcement that it has a

197
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:30,280
new drug, let's say good news, uh,

198
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,730
or it has gotten FDA approval
to market some new drug.

199
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,740
What would put that out?
Um, over, uh, over the, uh,

200
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,430
network of information.
And some people would have their,

201
00:13:42,431 --> 00:13:45,280
their things beep on the
men alert them immediately.

202
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,550
There are analysts who try to keep up
with the news about stocks. And so, uh,

203
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,670
these analysts then,
uh,

204
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,720
would jump to action when
they hear that news like that.

205
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,060
That's because they know that markets
move really fast information, uh, to,

206
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:04,900
uh, important new information. Uh,
and they've got to be there first.

207
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:09,520
So what happens when the drug company
announces that they have some news

208
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,260
important news?
Well,

209
00:14:11,261 --> 00:14:14,920
the guys who are with their beepers
immediately spring to action and try to

210
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:19,240
figure out what the news and within
seconds they're trading, because you know,

211
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:22,600
you've got to be there first.
Uh, otherwise you don't,

212
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,950
you can't benefit from the news.

213
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:27,220
So what happens that they said they've
announced they've got approval for this

214
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:31,810
new drug and then they did maybe maybe
do a quick call to their drug company

215
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:36,160
expert and say, quick, how much should
I change the valuation of the stock?

216
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,380
Uh, and the guy will give a
quick guests, you know, twenties,

217
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,950
this is now 20 seconds
after the announcement,

218
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,940
and then immediately you place a big
trade for a million shares or Flusser

219
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,890
mounted. And then the guy calls
back 30 seconds later and says,

220
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,940
oh, no, you know, I wasn't
exactly right on it.

221
00:14:53,941 --> 00:14:58,490
I've had 30 more seconds to think
about this, so let me change it again.

222
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,650
Uh, so over the next few
minutes, the price, a lot of
people are trading like that.

223
00:15:03,651 --> 00:15:06,620
So the price is jumping around rapidly.
Uh,

224
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,720
then after maybe five minutes,

225
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,260
these people that have had time to
assimilate it and think about it and check

226
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:14,540
their thinking and the
price starts to settle down.

227
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:16,730
Maybe I'm exaggerating
how fast it sells them.

228
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,070
Maybe an hour later you have a committee
meeting and the experts are arguing

229
00:15:22,071 --> 00:15:25,940
about, uh, about what this
really means and trying to, uh,

230
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,500
assimilate other information and
coordinate with it. But after two hours,

231
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,120
it started to really settle down.

232
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,540
So suppose you then the next day read in
the Wall Street Journal about this new

233
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:38,624
announcement.

234
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:43,460
Do you think you have any
chance of beating the market
by trading on it? I mean,

235
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:47,850
you're like 24 hours late, but I hear
people tell me, I hear, you know,

236
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,650
I read in Business Week that
there's a new announcement.

237
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,110
So I'm thinking of buying and I say,
well,

238
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:59,030
business week that that information
is probably a week old. Uh,

239
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:03,810
even other people we'll talk about trading
on information that's years old. Uh,

240
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,670
and so you kind of think that maybe
these people are, are naive. You know,

241
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,510
first of all, you're not a drug company
expert or whatever it is that's needed.

242
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,560
Uh, secondly, you, you
don't know the math.

243
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,360
You don't know how to calculate present
value is probably, and then, uh,

244
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:24,590
and then thirdly, you're a
month late. Uh, and so, uh,

245
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,730
you get the impression that a lot of
people shouldn't be trying to beat the

246
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:33,440
market. Uh, and that, uh, you
might say to a first approximation,

247
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:38,090
the market has it all right.
And so don't even try.

248
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,710
Uh,
so the efficient markets hypothesis is a,

249
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:47,580
a hypothesis that one should
respect financial markets. Uh,

250
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,070
very much so. Your Textbook, uh, by, uh,

251
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,350
for Bozi at Al mentioned,

252
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,670
I looked it up in the index to see
what they say about efficient markets

253
00:16:58,671 --> 00:17:02,040
hypothesis. They define it. Uh,

254
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,850
according the textbook for Bozi,
uh,

255
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:09,910
publicly available relevant information
about the issuers will lead to correct

256
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,490
pricing of freely traded securities
in properly functioning markets.

257
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:20,180
That's their definition of the
efficient markets hypothesis.

258
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,310
Uh, they didn't say it was right.
They just said that's the hypothesis.

259
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,120
What for Bozi et Al Said is that the,
uh,

260
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,780
the hypothesis has informed
a lot of regulation.

261
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,950
The Securities and Exchange Commission
and other agencies that regulate

262
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:38,670
financial markets,
uh,

263
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:43,930
have shown some faith in the efficient
markets hypothesis and therefore they

264
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:46,220
feel that their, um, their,

265
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,580
maybe their primary mission is to regulate
the flow of information to make sure

266
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:57,111
that it's an even playing field so that
everyone has access to information at

267
00:17:57,631 --> 00:18:00,390
the same time. Uh, so for example,

268
00:18:00,391 --> 00:18:04,320
the Securities and Exchange Commission
requires that when a corporation

269
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,860
publishes information that's
relevant to the value of their stock,

270
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:13,130
they have to put it out
to everyone at once. Uh,

271
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,030
well there's rules about what that means,

272
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,710
but typically they'll have a webcast or
something like that and it's announced

273
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:24,080
in advance. So everyone who is really
interested can, can listen in. Uh,

274
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,070
but I don't find a
whole lot of enthusiasm.

275
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,980
And if avast he'd work for the
efficient markets hypothesis.

276
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:35,490
And maybe that's because it's not
exactly right, which is my view.

277
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,990
It's a half truth. And I'll come back
to that. I wanted to quote another,

278
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,440
uh, bestselling textbook,
not your own. Uh,

279
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:48,240
but there's another textbook Breely
and admires, uh, which is a textbook,

280
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,650
a of corporate finance.
Uh,

281
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,600
and they are much more enthusiastic
about efficient markets hypothesis.

282
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,010
At the end of their textbook, they
have a concluding chapter, uh,

283
00:18:59,011 --> 00:19:03,030
and the concluding chapter is built
around what they call the seven most

284
00:19:03,031 --> 00:19:05,460
important ideas in finance.

285
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:10,200
And one of those seven ideas to
them is efficient markets. Uh,

286
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:15,360
and, uh, they don't call it a hypothesis.
He just say efficient markets,

287
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,720
which they define as the,
the theory that I'm quoting them.

288
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,850
Security prices accurately
reflect available information
and respond rapidly to

289
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:26,640
new information.
As soon as it becomes available,

290
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,780
then they have a little qualifier. I
think there's interesting, they say,

291
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,660
don't misunderstand the
efficient market idea.

292
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:37,080
It doesn't say that there
are no taxes or costs.

293
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,340
It doesn't say that there aren't some
clever people and some stupid ones.

294
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,020
It merely implies that competition
in capital markets is very tough.

295
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:51,410
There are no money machines and security
prices reflect the true underlying

296
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:55,850
value of assets. Uh, well that's, uh,

297
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:00,360
that's a pretty enthusiastic
endorsement of efficient markets. Uh,

298
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,760
I said I have some doubts
about it. I guess I, I, uh, uh,

299
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,650
I don't, I guess what I don't like,
is there a concluding statement?

300
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:14,700
Security prices reflect the
true underlying value of assets.

301
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,170
I don't think that's a really true,
uh,

302
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:22,800
but I guess I agree it's tough to make
money reliably and quickly in financial

303
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:27,480
markets. And so if that's what efficient
markets means, uh, there, right.

304
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,250
Um, so, um, but you know,

305
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:37,200
efficient markets is not so
easy to define. Uh, there,

306
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:41,360
uh, we go back to, um, in, uh,

307
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:42,801
the terminal,

308
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:47,801
he goes back to 1967 and it was professor
Harry Roberts at University of Chicago

309
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,690
who defined three different
efficient market's hypothesis. Uh,

310
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,440
there is the
weak form,

311
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,710
the semi strong form,

312
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:13,750
and then the strong form,
uh,

313
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,980
the weak form.

314
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,540
These differ only in terms of the amount
of information that is assumed to be

315
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,550
efficiently incorporated into prices.

316
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The weak form says that
Info of past prices

317
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:35,620
is already in the incorporated
into price. So, uh,

318
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,040
uh, but, but only past prices.

319
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,300
What it means only is that you can't
predict stock prices, but noting that,

320
00:21:43,301 --> 00:21:47,110
say if it goes up today, it'll probably
go up tomorrow or if it goes up today,

321
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:51,310
it'll probably go down tomorrow.
That would be relying only on past prices.

322
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,170
And so Harry Robert felt most confident
that this a form of the hypothesis was

323
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,040
was uh, it was good. So he
call it a week. For him,

324
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,770
it's the least criticized of
a form of efficient markets.

325
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,280
Semi strong form says that market
prices incorporate all public info

326
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,853
information.

327
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,680
Anything that's known to the public is
already incorporated into the price.

328
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,210
So don't bother to trade on it.

329
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:24,640
The strong form says all information,
whether public or not,

330
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,230
is it incorporated into price?
This is a really strong,

331
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:34,470
it's the least likely to be true because
every time you increase the information

332
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:35,304
set,

333
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:40,430
what strong form says is that
no information is private.

334
00:22:40,771 --> 00:22:45,390
Really, it all gets out into
price. Uh, companies keep secrets.

335
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,280
And so that's not public information.

336
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,230
The Securities and Exchange Commission
insists that companies keep secrets

337
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,040
because they have to disseminate
information in an orderly way.

338
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:01,370
And so there has to be a secret until a
certain hour in which it's announced to

339
00:23:01,741 --> 00:23:02,574
everybody.

340
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,290
But the strong form efficient markets
hypothesis is cynical about that and said,

341
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,580
you know, nobody keeps
secrets. It all leaks out. Uh,

342
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,430
I think that when we refer to
the efficient markets hypothesis,

343
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,810
it's the semi strong form that we're
usually referring to because the strong

344
00:23:18,811 --> 00:23:22,560
farm is a bit, uh, a bit strong. And, um,

345
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,680
okay, so, um,

346
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,850
the definitions of efficient markets
that I gave you a are intuitive but not

347
00:23:31,851 --> 00:23:36,470
very precise because then you have to
ask, well, what does it mean to say that,

348
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,430
uh, price incorporate all information? Uh,

349
00:23:40,431 --> 00:23:44,660
what does it mean to incorporate
information? Uh, so, uh,

350
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,590
there's not one answer to that question.
Uh,

351
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:53,720
and so I'm going to give
the simplest answer. Uh,

352
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,280
what does efficient markets
mean? Uh, and, uh, I might,

353
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,390
I'll have to raise,

354
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:07,610
this is the simplest version,
but it's often the one that's

355
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:13,640
often the one that is referred to most.

356
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,660
And that is that price
is the expected value,

357
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,140
the expected present value of
future dividends paid on the stock.

358
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:27,410
Okay. Uh, and so, uh,

359
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,513
the,
uh,

360
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,160
the efficient markets hypothesis,

361
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:38,540
it says the true value of a stock
comes from the dividends that it pays.

362
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:43,870
That's a cash flow that is valued by the
market and the market values it as the

363
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:49,940
present value of the optimally
forecasted future dividends.

364
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:52,100
Okay. So, uh,

365
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:57,310
and the theory that's most
often referred to is the simple,

366
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,360
uh, I, I've already talked in the second
lecture about present value of 400 rows.

367
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,620
We had a growing perpetuity models.
Uh,

368
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,950
remember that I said
that the present value,

369
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:15,550
the present discounted value of a
growing perpetuity that pays an amount d,

370
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,140
uh,
if it pays,

371
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:25,610
if the pant is d times e to the GT,

372
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,543
mmm.

373
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,420
Are these subzero either
the GT is the dividend,

374
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,200
so it's growing at rate lowercase g there.

375
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Then the formula we had for the
present value was d over r minus G.

376
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,370
I remember that.
Um,

377
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,350
and uh,

378
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:52,550
this assumes of course that the growth
rate of dividends has to be less than the

379
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,050
discount rate are.

380
00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:00,790
So the simplest version of the efficient
markets hypothesis says price is equal

381
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:05,510
to the dividend all over the,

382
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,640
in the discount rate minus the
growth rate of dividends where, Gee,

383
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:13,010
the growth rate of dividends is a,

384
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:17,750
is an optimally forecasted growth rate
of dividends. And so that gives us,

385
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:23,330
uh, evaluate a model
for the, uh, uh, price.

386
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:24,803
Uh,

387
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,360
another way of writing more generally
as if I don't assume the constant growth

388
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:32,960
rate of dividends is to write
just a present value formula.

389
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:37,390
It's another, uh, less strong form of, uh,

390
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,720
writing down the efficient markets
hypothesis because it doesn't say how

391
00:26:41,721 --> 00:26:43,350
dividends are thought to grow,

392
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,710
but you can write the price is equal
to the summation of the expectation at

393
00:26:50,281 --> 00:26:52,950
time.
T of dividends at time.

394
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,950
T plus k all over one plus r to the
Keith Power k equals one to infinity.

395
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,840
This is another incarnate that that's
just the present value formula.

396
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,980
I have the price,
I'm sorry.

397
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:18,140
They should be the expectation at yeah,
Tang t

398
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,700
the price at time.

399
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:25,500
T is the expectation of
the dividend at time.

400
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:30,480
People pay discounted by,
uh, a discount factor are,

401
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,993
uh,

402
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:36,960
and that's just the present value formula
where I've substituted an expectation,

403
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,510
uh, for the future dividend. So, um,

404
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,230
uh, that's the efficient market
theory in this incarnation.

405
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,940
There's other ways to envision the
efficient markets, what it means,

406
00:27:50,941 --> 00:27:52,680
but let's consider this simple story.

407
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,030
What this means then is that, uh, the, uh,

408
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,393
price

409
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:05,220
is a forecast of future dividends
to be paid on the stock.

410
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:10,830
This, this would be a of the present value
of future dividends to be paid on the

411
00:28:10,831 --> 00:28:15,440
stock. And this means
then that, uh, price, uh,

412
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,300
relative to dividends, uh, is, uh,

413
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,580
related to expected future
growth rates of dividends.

414
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:28,770
If you expect dividends to grow a lot,
if g is high,

415
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:33,810
then price will be high
relative to dividends because
this is subtracted off the

416
00:28:33,811 --> 00:28:38,580
denominator. It makes the denominator is
smaller and it makes the price higher.

417
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:42,450
Uh, on the other hand, if you expect
dividends to do poorly in the future,

418
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,120
then price will be low
relative to dividends.

419
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:49,950
That's what the efficient markets
hypothesis would say. Uh, and so,

420
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,960
uh, um, I would give
you an example of that.

421
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,000
Um, I talked last year about a
company that I read in Business Week,

422
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:05,360
uh, read about in Business Week. Um, so
this is a year old story in Business Week.

423
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,290
Uh, there was a company
called first fed financial,

424
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,860
which was a company that issues mortgages.

425
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,360
And already this was in January of 2000
and said actually the business week

426
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:20,820
story.
It was in December of 2006,

427
00:29:20,821 --> 00:29:25,821
but I was still reacting to it
in a year ago in January of 2007.

428
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,660
Uh, and so, uh, uh, the, uh,

429
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:34,200
businessweek story,
this is first fed financial,

430
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,480
uh, was referring to the fact that, uh,

431
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,850
the price dividend ratio, actually
they talked about price earnings ratio,

432
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:52,420
but the, the, the price
earnings ratio for this company,

433
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,020
uh,
was very low.

434
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,520
It was only 8.5 in, um, in, uh,

435
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,360
in December,
2006.

436
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,320
That's 8.5 and right that very clearly,

437
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,120
typically price earnings ratios
of companies are very high,

438
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:17,810
much higher than that,
typically like 15. So, uh,

439
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,960
the price of first fed financial
relative to its earnings was very low.

440
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,610
And so some people might be inclined
to think, well, that looks cheap.

441
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,760
I can buy by buying first fed financial,

442
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:35,910
I can buy the stock at a low
price relative to its earnings.

443
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:40,030
But if you believe in efficient markets,

444
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,410
you wouldn't think that this is
any reason to buy the company.

445
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:49,890
Because efficient markets would say that
if the price is low relative to either

446
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:51,160
dividends or earning,

447
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:56,700
it must mean that people think that
bad things are going to come to the

448
00:30:56,831 --> 00:30:58,390
dividends are earnings.
In other words,

449
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,840
the first fed financial has a
low expected growth rate of,

450
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,730
of dividends in the future.
Uh,

451
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:11,170
and so I was interested in this particular
story because Business Week wrote an

452
00:31:11,171 --> 00:31:13,090
article about them,
uh,

453
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,360
and noted the low price
earnings ratio and said,

454
00:31:18,361 --> 00:31:23,160
uh, what does this mean? Uh, uh, and what,

455
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:28,210
what businessweek presented a year ago
was an argument why g was likely to be

456
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:30,070
low.
Yes.

457
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,753
Right?

458
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,380
Uh, yes. If they don't pay dividends,
you can't use this formula.

459
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,330
And I'm not sure what the
dividends were first fed financial.

460
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,660
I only know the price earnings ratio, uh,
at that time. But you're, you're right,

461
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:57,690
you cannot use this formula if they're
not paying a dividend today because,

462
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,300
uh, the, uh, um,

463
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,760
this formula I erased it,

464
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:08,761
but it was up here assumes that dividends
are following a growth path and your,

465
00:32:09,371 --> 00:32:13,450
and if they're not paying dividends
then that we were very clearly,

466
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,210
that's not inappropriate assumption.
Yeah.

467
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,740
Right. So for Berkeley,
incidentally, if you know,

468
00:32:24,741 --> 00:32:29,720
Berkshire Hathaway is the company that
Warren Buffet a owns and it's a very

469
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:32,540
famous company cause
it's done extremely well.

470
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:37,650
And Warren Buffet is regarded as by
many people as a financial genius. Um,

471
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,630
but if Berkshire Hathaway
is not paying a dividend,

472
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,460
we have to revert to this formula.
So the efficient market theory would say,

473
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,530
well, they're going to pay a dividend
eventually. And so the price reflects, uh,

474
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,900
these future terms.
If you spell this out,

475
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:57,230
this is the expected dividend next year,

476
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,240
plus the dividend in two years,

477
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:03,140
just divided by one plus r squared plus
the expected dividend and three years

478
00:33:03,141 --> 00:33:08,100
divided by one plus r cubed, et cetera.
So this theory would say that, uh,

479
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:13,210
the dividend that Berkshire Hathaway
has value only because they investors

480
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:20,180
expect them to pay dividends
in the future. Um, and that,

481
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:24,350
that sounds right because if Berkshire
Hathaway is never going to pay dividends,

482
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,680
why would you hold it?
You might say,

483
00:33:27,681 --> 00:33:31,790
I'll hold it because I could sell to
someone else at a higher price. Uh,

484
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,450
but then you said, well, why
would anyone else buy it? Look,

485
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:38,630
if they're never going to pay a dividend,
what good is it?

486
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,700
It's just a piece of paper.
Write it.

487
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:46,280
Unless I can sell to a greater fool.
But anyone who buys it,

488
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,630
it's either would be buying either on
the assumption that there is some greater

489
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:55,340
fool coming or they would be the fool,
a fool of themselves.

490
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,180
So this theory says that the value,

491
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:02,000
if Warren Buffet,
cause he can't even say this,

492
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:06,290
but let's somehow say the company could
say, we will never pay a dividend.

493
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,820
This company is going to give
it away to charity. Someday.

494
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:13,520
You won't get a penny as a
stockholder. Well, if that happened,

495
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:18,410
the price should be zero. It would convert
into a nonprofit like Yale University.

496
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,000
So what's the price of a share in Yale
University? I mean it's undefined.

497
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:27,020
I guess it's zero, right? Because
Yale is not paying, I'll write,

498
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,640
I'll write a piece of paper for you and
said, this is a share on my, my authority.

499
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,020
This is a share in Yale University.
Um,

500
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,660
and it might just as well be that
because it also says in my fine print,

501
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,440
you will never get a dividend on
this. So what's the point? Right? Uh,

502
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:48,440
so, uh, incidentally Microsoft for
many years never paid a dividend.

503
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,520
It's often common for young
companies not to pay dividends,

504
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:55,850
but they did start paying
a dividend. And, uh,

505
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,990
the whole theory of efficient
markets theory says that that's what,

506
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:03,630
that's what people are looking for.
That's why the,

507
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:08,210
the value of a company is related
to its activities. Otherwise,

508
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:10,100
even if the company never paid a dividend,

509
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:12,860
that what would you care
what the company is doing?

510
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,430
You only care about it because someday
they're going to give you money.

511
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,590
A lot of investors forget that.
That's a very naive thing, attitude.

512
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:26,030
They think that somehow it's docs
generate capital gains, prices go up.

513
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,750
But you have to realize in efficient
markets, theory is saying this,

514
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:34,220
that prices only go up because there's
new information about future dividends.

515
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:39,870
Um, okay, so, um, the first financial,

516
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:43,230
anyway,
this is an efficient market story.

517
00:35:43,231 --> 00:35:47,250
First financial had a low PE and so
people were wondering, is this a bargain?

518
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:51,640
This is a cheap stock. Pe
means price earnings ratio. Uh,

519
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:52,710
and uh,

520
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:57,710
the business week article pointed out
that 40% of first federal had been sold

521
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,830
shorts.
40% of their stock had been sold short.

522
00:36:01,831 --> 00:36:04,920
This is a very high level of short
shortages. Do you know what that means?

523
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:08,520
That means a lot of investors said,
uh,

524
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:13,500
I don't like first fed financial. I don't
want to invest in it worse than that,

525
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,970
I want to go and short them.

526
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:19,020
So that means you borrow shares and sell
them and hope that the price goes down.

527
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:22,500
When you have 40% of
the shares sold short.

528
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:26,070
That means that there's a lot of
people who didn't believe in first fed

529
00:36:26,071 --> 00:36:30,310
financial. So business weekend,
it's article pointed out that uh,

530
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:35,160
this first fed financial, it
was a, a small mortgage lender.

531
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:39,120
This is the before the mortgage crisis
that we're in and started in Santa Monica,

532
00:36:39,121 --> 00:36:43,920
California. Uh, and that
it was particularly, uh,

533
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,170
innovative in a chance in its lending,

534
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,950
notably 80% according to
the business week article,

535
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:55,070
80% of the mortgages it's
issued were no doc mortgages.

536
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,840
And you know,
the no doc mortgage,

537
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,550
it's something that appeared
recently in the housing frenzy.

538
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,930
A No doc mortgage is a mortgage
where you walk in and say,

539
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:07,650
I want to borrow money to buy this
house. And the company says, fine,

540
00:37:07,651 --> 00:37:11,320
we'll give you a mortgage.
We won't even ask you to send a,

541
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,550
have your employer sends a letter
saying that you have a job.

542
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,850
We won't even ask you to prove
that you own anything or have,

543
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:22,410
we'll just give you the mortgage.
Uh, that's considered by many people,

544
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:27,150
risky behavior, but it was done
during the housing boom. Also,

545
00:37:27,151 --> 00:37:27,421
they,

546
00:37:27,421 --> 00:37:32,400
they issued a unusually high proportion
of what are called option arms.

547
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:35,760
These are mortgages that
are adjustable rate,

548
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:41,570
but also the person doesn't have to pay
the full payment every time you have the

549
00:37:42,331 --> 00:37:46,800
option of paying. And if you don't want
to pay, you can delay it for a while.

550
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:50,700
And these are also controversial because
it thought they would attract borrowers

551
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:52,800
who are unreliable,
uh,

552
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,940
borrowers who thought that they could
afford the house because they didn't have

553
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,810
to pay now,

554
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,870
but of course it's all going to come
later and then they might default.

555
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:01,951
So business,

556
00:38:01,951 --> 00:38:06,951
we thought that the low price earnings
ratio was because the market expected

557
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:12,150
earnings to go down, uh, and
dividends to go down. So I,

558
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,190
a year later,
that is,

559
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:18,360
this morning I wanted to see what
first fed financial is doing.

560
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,280
Uh, and actually it's still in
business. Everything's alright.

561
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,420
It has positive earnings,
uh, but it's price.

562
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:30,990
The price was $70,
uh,

563
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,530
in beginning of 2007,

564
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,640
and now it's down to about $40.
A 2008.

565
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:45,160
So, uh, this is a testimony
to efficient markets. Uh,

566
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,400
the market was expecting
the price earnings ratio.

567
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,310
They gave it a low PE because
they were worried about,

568
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,450
they had information that there was
something going badly in this company.

569
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,420
And indeed they were
right. Uh, it, you know,

570
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,380
it's not as bad as you might've
thought with the business week story,

571
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:06,790
but it is bad. So, uh,
uh, I guess the lesson,

572
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,380
are you following what I'm talking?

573
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:13,250
So what happened was they did
get into trouble. Uh, the, uh,

574
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:18,100
uh,
the low PE was indeed a forecaster of,

575
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,760
of, uh, of bad performance later.

576
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,160
Uh, but, um, uh,

577
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,543
so,
um,

578
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:34,810
now I guess this isn't exactly efficient,
efficient markets wouldn't,

579
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,130
in this case,
the,

580
00:39:36,131 --> 00:39:40,960
the people who sold first fed financial
short made a lot of money, uh,

581
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,700
when the price went down so much.

582
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:46,660
That's not really consistent
with efficient markets
because it makes it sound

583
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:48,940
like I, as a matter of fact, I could have,

584
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:53,620
I could have reading the business
week article at the beginning of 2007.

585
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:58,010
I could have called my broker and
I could have told my broker, uh,

586
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,200
short please,

587
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:03,610
I want to short first fed financial
and I could have done that.

588
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,520
And I looked like I've made a lot of
money right by shorting it because the

589
00:40:06,521 --> 00:40:10,660
price went down a lot. Efficient
markets theory, uh, would,

590
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:15,760
would have to say, uh, that that was an
anomaly, that that was just good luck.

591
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:20,200
Those people who shorted
first fed financial did make
a lot of money, but hey,

592
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:22,920
they were just lucky this time.
Another word,

593
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:27,190
efficient markets theory would say that
the price was already down as far as,

594
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:27,730
you know,

595
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:32,730
basically as far as it would go in
2007 and that earnings would fall,

596
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,960
uh, and dividends would fall later and
that would explain why the price was low,

597
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:42,580
but it wouldn't allow you to predict
the price. So this and this anomaly,

598
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,200
uh, uh, uh, the, the,

599
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:52,201
the fact that it worked out so well is
really not test two short investors,

600
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:55,180
uh, is really not testimony
too efficient and markets

601
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:02,530
efficient market. You know, in some
sense I think I, I'm sympathetic,

602
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,500
efficient mark.
We have to be sympathetic to some extent.

603
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,120
If I were to try and I actually did not
short first fed financial when I read

604
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:13,260
this last year and it was because
I guess I had my doubt, you know,

605
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:17,670
I had my feeling you read a business
week article, you know, and it's a,

606
00:41:17,671 --> 00:41:21,580
it's everyone in the world knows it now
that a lot of people doubt first fed

607
00:41:21,581 --> 00:41:26,340
financial. So if I come in late as a short
seller, am I going to do well? You know,

608
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,620
I start to doubt myself because there's
so many people looking at it and so many

609
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:34,460
people who are more knowledgeable
about first fed financial, I am so,

610
00:41:34,461 --> 00:41:34,671
you know,

611
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:38,780
maybe I won't try shorting it and that
that's what efficient markets is all

612
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:42,980
about. Um, so, uh,

613
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,590
the efficient market theory became
very popular in finance, uh,

614
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,260
in about, um, about, uh,

615
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,300
w w when Iran in 1970 and it became a,
uh,

616
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,570
uh, a prominent theory and finance, uh,

617
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,980
it has a particular incarnation
that I wanted to emphasize, uh,

618
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:09,860
called random walk. Uh, and
so the random walk theory,

619
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,580
uh, which follows loosely from
this formula that I have to

620
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,281
qualify it.

621
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:21,281
But let me talk about random
walking as a theory in itself.

622
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,020
The random walk theory

623
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,510
says that under efficient markets,

624
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:35,260
stock prices and other a speculative
asset prices are random walks.

625
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:42,050
And that term goes back to Carl Pearson,
uh,

626
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,130
in an article in nature in 1905.

627
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,760
So this idea is about, uh,
about a hundred years old. Uh,

628
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:55,250
and what, uh, Pearson wrote about was

629
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,270
where the example he gave was a drunk.

630
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:05,080
Imagine the person who is so drunk that
every step that person takes is random

631
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:10,820
and independent of the preceding
step. Okay. And so suppose we,

632
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:15,550
uh, this is 1905 story.
Suppose we had, uh,

633
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:19,460
a lamppost and we had a drunk
standing at the lamp post.

634
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,450
I've had drawn a picture that's
a lamppost and that's a drunk,

635
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:27,650
this person is so intoxicated that
steps are completely around them.

636
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:32,630
And your object is to predict where
will this person be in one minute,

637
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:37,400
in 10 minutes and 20 minutes. Okay,
well Pearson wrote about this.

638
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:41,360
It said that the optimal prediction is to

639
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,730
assume that the person in 10 minutes,

640
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:51,910
the best forecast is the person
will be here in 10 and 20 minutes.

641
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:56,630
What's the best forecast person who will
be here? Of course they probably want,

642
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,940
because they're randomly
staggering around.

643
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:02,510
But the point is that if it's a
true random rock, there's no bias.

644
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:05,420
It's equally likely to
go this way or this way.

645
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:10,250
The most likely place for the person
is right where that person is now.

646
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,780
And so,
uh,

647
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:16,310
Pearson and other people following him
thought that speculative prices are like

648
00:44:16,311 --> 00:44:20,900
that. That that sounds like the
markets are crazy. They're drunk,

649
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:22,050
but they're not drunk. It's, it's,

650
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:25,370
it's because they respect
all need to new information.

651
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:30,830
And so new information is by
its essence and forecastable.

652
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:35,310
And so it has to look like the
market is driven by a drunk,

653
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:40,490
when in fact it's very precise and
responding optimally to new information.

654
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,220
So that's one of the paradoxes
that confuses people. Uh,

655
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:48,990
so our statisticians develop
the theory of a random one.

656
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:50,800
And let me define it for you.

657
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:55,690
A random walk occurs when you have,
uh,

658
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,650
a very,
uh,

659
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:02,310
variable x at time t
is equal to x at time.

660
00:45:02,311 --> 00:45:05,280
T minus one plus epsilon,

661
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:08,970
sub t where epsilon to be is noise.

662
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,830
Unforecasted forecastable noise.
Okay, so this is a random walk.

663
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,480
X would be here.

664
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:21,450
How far the person is from the
lamppost. Here's zero. Let's say,

665
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,720
okay,
x is the distance from the lamppost.

666
00:45:24,870 --> 00:45:27,180
So at every time interval we have x of t,

667
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,240
which is how far the drunk has
deviated from the lamp post.

668
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,340
This is the random step. This is where
the drunk was last period and we're,

669
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,580
this is where the drunk is this period.
Okay?

670
00:45:38,581 --> 00:45:42,540
So that's a random walk. Uh, and the, uh,

671
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:44,970
in the heyday of efficient markets theory,

672
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:50,280
people said that efficient markets
is working very well. In other words,

673
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:53,770
the random walk hypothesis,
uh,

674
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,260
uh,
describes stock prices very well.

675
00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:02,750
So let me go to my spreadsheet,
which I have up here. Uh,

676
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,340
and uh,
uh,

677
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,740
I'll put this spreadsheet
up on the web for you. Uh,

678
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:14,100
what I have here is shown,
uh, there's two lines shown.

679
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:18,870
One is a blue line, uh, which is, um,

680
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,520
the,
uh,

681
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:25,700
the Blue Line is the actual standard
and poor composite stock price index.

682
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:31,470
Uh, going back to 1871,
this is a series that I,

683
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:35,000
well actually it got this theories
from standard and Poor's. Uh,

684
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:38,980
I emphasize it a lot in my
book. It's a hundred. Uh,

685
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:44,510
it's a a 130 year long stock price series
money monthly for the United States.

686
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,160
It's now called the s and p 500.
Um,

687
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:51,840
because starting in 1957
standard and poor, well,

688
00:46:51,841 --> 00:46:56,670
they kind of reorganized the index
and they kept it at 500 stocks.

689
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:01,200
So this is the second most famous
stock price index after the Dow Jones

690
00:47:01,201 --> 00:47:02,940
industrial average.
Uh,

691
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:07,260
but I think it's better than the Dow
Jones industrial average because the dow

692
00:47:07,261 --> 00:47:10,320
has only 30 stocks.
And this has 500,

693
00:47:10,321 --> 00:47:14,640
it's representative of most of the
market. So that's history. That blue,

694
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:17,440
that Blue Line there is history.
Okay.

695
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:22,370
Now what I did on excel is I,
um,

696
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:27,840
I generated a random mark because there's
a random number generator on excel.

697
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,030
I used the random number and
plugged it into this formula.

698
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,950
A X of t equals x of t
minus one plus Epsilon T.

699
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:38,590
And that pink line is a true random lark.

700
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,700
It was generated by a random
number generator. Okay.

701
00:47:42,701 --> 00:47:46,630
And the point here is don't
they look kind of similar.

702
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:52,140
Okay. Uh, when you look at, uh,
when people look at stock pricing,

703
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:55,480
they get an a, it's an illusion.
This is a psychological illusion.

704
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,820
They get the sense that,
uh,

705
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:01,990
there are bull markets when the market
is going up and there are bear markets

706
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:05,650
when the market is going down and it must
be some force pushing it up for awhile.

707
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:10,180
Um, but, uh, so you can see, for
example, I'm looking at the Blue Line,

708
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,260
there was a bull market in the
1920s, a famous boat market, right?

709
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,210
The roaring twenties.
Uh,

710
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,900
and so you would say that
can't just be a random walk.

711
00:48:19,901 --> 00:48:23,920
It was just going up all the time.
And then this is the 1929 peak.

712
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:28,840
And look at there is the crash
from 1929 to 1932 big crash.

713
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:32,500
That can't be a random walk,
right? That's what people think.

714
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:35,710
They have this intuitive idea.
But if you look,

715
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:40,540
this random walk seems to do the
same thing. The pink line, uh, has,

716
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:45,090
uh, look, there was a nice bull market
there and there's another crash. Look at,

717
00:48:45,091 --> 00:48:48,760
look at this whole period here. This was
really strong and then it leveled out.

718
00:48:48,761 --> 00:48:51,420
We had bad bet. They kind
of look similar, don't they?

719
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:55,870
This is pure chance because that random
mark that I generated was pure random

720
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:57,880
walk.
But that there's the bull,

721
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:02,920
the actual bull market of the 1950s
and sixties. And my random walk,

722
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:04,780
it comes out pretty close to that.

723
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,180
So the random walk theory says that people
are operating under the illusion that

724
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:14,620
there really is no trends or uh,
there's no way to predict the market.

725
00:49:14,621 --> 00:49:18,520
It is just completely and
forecastable. Now, incidentally,

726
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:23,560
a nice thing about excel is I can generate
a new random walk for you on the spot

727
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:27,790
by pressing f nine if you
know that key on excel.

728
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:31,180
So I will press f nine and
history is going to stay the same.

729
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,890
The Blue Line is going to stay the same,

730
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:35,270
but the pink line is going
to change and I'm going to,

731
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:40,180
I can generate whole hundred year history
pseudo histories with the press of a

732
00:49:40,181 --> 00:49:44,440
button. So let's see if this
works. Okay. We just got,

733
00:49:44,441 --> 00:49:46,480
what does that thing?
Okay.

734
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:51,630
I put an upward trend to
the random walk there, uh,

735
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:53,800
because I think there's an
uptrend to the stock market.

736
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:55,930
So it's a little different than this.
I just added a time trend.

737
00:49:55,990 --> 00:50:00,610
Otherwise it's exactly that random
walk formula that I use. Okay.

738
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:06,100
That looks pretty much like history too.
Except we would be in a bear market for,

739
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:10,210
for quite a while, right? We have
quite a bear market in the pink line,

740
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:13,830
but I can correct that by
pressing f nine again. Well,

741
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:18,370
well, this is bad luck. Uh,

742
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:23,380
the stock market crashed and
it went off the chart. Uh,

743
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:28,540
here, uh, that's bad luck,
but I can try again. Oh, look,

744
00:50:28,541 --> 00:50:31,640
looking at that one.
Isn't that a beauty that almost,

745
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:37,610
that almost a well, it really,
it really looked like the market.

746
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,030
Yeah.
Um,

747
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:45,170
so I can just go, it's just amazing
how fast this thing generates.

748
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:46,303
Look at that.

749
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,680
Well, I should stop. Tell me when
one looks really interesting.

750
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:52,710
Okay.

751
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:55,230
That's an interesting one.
That's, that's if that,

752
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:58,110
if that was the history
that we randomly had,

753
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,620
Jeremy Siegel would write not
just stocks for the long run,

754
00:51:01,621 --> 00:51:04,800
he would be jubilant
their returns on stock.

755
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:07,260
He would say for a hundred years.
This is like,

756
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,930
this is 130 years for 130 years.

757
00:51:09,931 --> 00:51:14,931
Stocks have wonderfully outperformed
the market outperformed us.

758
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:18,090
Other things like that, that, that
is looking pretty good, isn't it?

759
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:22,500
And I just pressed the button and
get like, getting many bad ways.

760
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,710
That's how I have an uptrend in it.

761
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,513
Uh,

762
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:30,520
but they all look similar right now.

763
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:35,170
The other thing I wanted to talk about
was a, uh, another thing called a ar one,

764
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:39,940
which is a different
story. Uh, and the Ar one,

765
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:41,743
uh,

766
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,330
this is the random walk here.

767
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:52,220
The other idea is, let me
do it intuitively. First,

768
00:51:52,370 --> 00:51:56,930
I'm going to tie in elastic cord
around the ankle of the drunk.

769
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,220
Okay. And target to the
lamp Paul. And okay,

770
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,260
you see my elastic cord?

771
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:08,270
It's very lucid beginning so the
drunk can move freely. But if, if it,

772
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,690
if it starts to get stretched and when
the drug makes it all the way over here,

773
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:15,890
then it's really hard for, it's
pulling the drunk back. Okay.

774
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:20,430
So that means it biases the
drunk back towards the uh,

775
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,440
starting point.
Uh,

776
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:28,790
and that's called a ar one or first

777
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,860
order
auto regressive,

778
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,613
a

779
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,073
model.

780
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:46,820
And so that means that there is something,
the random walk has no center.

781
00:52:46,821 --> 00:52:49,940
It just has a starting point.
It doesn't tend to go back anywhere.

782
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:53,270
But here we have a center,
uh, what do I call that?

783
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:57,230
I'll call it the x bar is this point here,

784
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:58,640
not necessarily a zero.

785
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:03,890
And it says that x sub t minus x bar

786
00:53:05,630 --> 00:53:10,630
is equal to x bar plus row times x sub
t minus one minus x Bar Plus Epsilon T.

787
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:24,110
Okay.
And row a row lies between

788
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:31,440
minus one and plus one. Usually it's
positive. All right, you see that?

789
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:35,880
So row is the smaller row is
the tighter the elastic cord is.

790
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:38,510
So, um, it, it,

791
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:43,540
it gets pulled back by one minus row
the way back to the x bar in every time

792
00:53:44,281 --> 00:53:48,300
period. But then there's new noise that
Alexander it. If there were no new noise,

793
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:53,340
then the drunk would we just
be gradually pull back. But uh,

794
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:58,020
but there's new Norris and so the uh,
the drunk is not so,

795
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:02,460
uh, uh, the drunk is not so predictable.

796
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,790
Okay? So that's another
model of the stock market,

797
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:08,440
but it's not an efficient markets model.
Uh,

798
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:11,120
the random walk is
efficient markets model.

799
00:54:11,121 --> 00:54:16,121
It says you can't profit
by trading because you just
cannot predict a change in

800
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:19,680
price.
But with the first order auto regressive,

801
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,860
you can predict the change of
price at least a little bit.

802
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,320
Well when it's, when, when what
goes up comes down. If the,

803
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,440
if the drunk is over here,
it tends to get pulled back here.

804
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:34,620
If the drunk is over here,
he tends to get pulled back up.

805
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:39,540
And so that's the random walk man. So
I programmed into this program, uh,

806
00:54:39,541 --> 00:54:42,990
and ar one,
so I go down here and click on it.

807
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,940
That looks very different doesn't it?

808
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,880
Maybe I didn't get the parameters exactly
right, but let me just hit f nine.

809
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:55,160
I'll get to it looks better. Well,
it looks a little different, right?

810
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,250
You see a difference in this?
That's because I chose,

811
00:54:58,310 --> 00:55:00,590
I chose row equals 0.95

812
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:06,530
for that diagram. So it's going
to getting tug back to the trend.

813
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:10,760
Um, but at sometimes it's hard
to tell. I mean, I thought,

814
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:13,940
can you tell the difference between
a random walk and an ar one?

815
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,520
It seems to be coming back faster.

816
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:19,580
So, uh, that, that looks different.

817
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:25,880
Well, with Roy 4.95, I guess it, it
does look noticeably different, right?

818
00:55:25,881 --> 00:55:26,714
Because,

819
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,193
uh,

820
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:30,890
it's coming back pretty fast.

821
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:35,930
I have 130 years observations and it's
coming back 5% of the way every year.

822
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:40,700
So in five years it's 25% of the way back.
I've got the cord too tight.

823
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:43,040
So it's not fooling you,
right?

824
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:47,750
You can see a difference between this ran
this ar one and the true stock market,

825
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:52,220
the stock. So this is revealing some
truth to the efficient markets hypothesis.

826
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,040
But what if I made real equal 0.99?

827
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:58,070
Then I think I should have
done that instead of 0.95.

828
00:55:58,071 --> 00:56:00,230
And then it gets harder for
you to see the difference.

829
00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:02,150
And if I make row equals one in the US,

830
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:05,330
what happens if I plug roe
equals one into this expression?

831
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:08,170
It comes back to the random walk,
right?

832
00:56:08,171 --> 00:56:13,171
Cause the x bar is drop out because
you've got one times x bar and you've got

833
00:56:13,201 --> 00:56:14,510
one minus x bar over here.

834
00:56:14,511 --> 00:56:17,780
So they drop out of the equation
and you'd come back up here.

835
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:22,900
So a random walk is just a one
with a coefficient of a row of one.

836
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:27,830
Uh,

837
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,880
now the point is then that we can
easily see that the stock market is not

838
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,470
strongly mean reverting
or trend reverting,

839
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:41,500
but it's somewhat maybe
somewhat trend to be run.

840
00:56:41,501 --> 00:56:46,450
It's very hard to tell whether
it's row is one or 0.99.

841
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:51,810
And so that's, that's the point
of, of my little analysis here, uh,

842
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,920
of random walk versus ar one.

843
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,700
So I'm okay now, uh, the, the homework,

844
00:57:00,701 --> 00:57:04,930
the problem set, uh, that you
will have a next time. Now,

845
00:57:04,931 --> 00:57:06,940
you still haven't turned
in your second problem set,

846
00:57:06,941 --> 00:57:09,760
but I want to work ahead now to the,
to the third one.

847
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:14,170
But I want you to do is to try
forecasting the stock market.

848
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:19,600
Uh, and so let me show you what I did
here and I want you to do something.

849
00:57:19,601 --> 00:57:20,920
You could use this spreadsheet,

850
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:24,580
but I'm also encouraging
you to find your own data.

851
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:29,290
So here is my spreadsheet,
um, which uh, uh,

852
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,980
has stock prices back to 1871.
Can you see all this?

853
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:39,400
Uh, I have this on my website all the
time. I've had it on my website. Um,

854
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:44,590
how long? It must be 20
years. I've, I've been just,

855
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:48,120
I give it away because I,
I'm,

856
00:57:48,121 --> 00:57:52,480
I'm the person who updates s and p data,
uh,

857
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,160
for,
uh,

858
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,680
1871 to the present and s and p I now
have a relationship with SNP cause there

859
00:57:58,710 --> 00:57:59,800
are publishing our indices,

860
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:03,670
but they still don't provide updates
of this hundred year long series.

861
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:07,900
So here it is, uh, all
the way back to 1871.

862
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:10,480
So what do I have here?
Uh,

863
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,260
I have in column one is the essence,

864
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:19,320
the standard and poor composite dark
price index today called the s and p 500.

865
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,553
Okay.

866
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:26,160
This is the dividend on the s and p 500
even paying a dividend consistently.

867
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,270
It's never missed a year.

868
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:32,740
Maybe some companies have missed a year
like Berkshire Hathaway or Microsoft,

869
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:35,830
but the, but the whole aggregate
has never missed a year.

870
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:41,030
This is the earnings reported on the
companies. All right? It's all per share.

871
00:58:41,031 --> 00:58:44,850
All right, so this is a
first year earnings. Uh,

872
00:58:44,851 --> 00:58:48,640
and I have here the consumer
price index in this column. Okay.

873
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,660
And then, uh, and I've got long
term interest rate and I can,

874
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:56,440
I can convert it to a real price,
uh,

875
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:00,300
by dividing by the consumer price index.
Uh,

876
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:04,030
and this is the change in the
real price. Okay. I don't, it's,

877
00:59:04,031 --> 00:59:07,750
it's between this year and
the next year. And so, uh,

878
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:11,410
what I wanted to do is this
is your homework assignment
and maybe I'll come back

879
00:59:11,411 --> 00:59:13,780
to this or maybe your tas
will come back to it as well.

880
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,030
I want you to try to forecast
the stock market. Okay? Uh,

881
00:59:19,031 --> 00:59:21,980
and so that means, but remember
what you're trying to forecast.

882
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:24,830
You're trying to forecast epsilon,

883
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:29,960
you're not trying to forecast x.
We already know x is easy to forecast.

884
00:59:29,961 --> 00:59:32,170
It's close to what it was last period.

885
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:35,660
That's the hard thing is to predict
where the next change will be.

886
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:40,820
So I had to generate a column
of data here, uh, which is the,

887
00:59:40,821 --> 00:59:44,720
um, uh, which is the change in the price.

888
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:48,490
So you see up here it says,
uh,

889
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:52,130
J 10 minus day nine,
uh,

890
00:59:52,550 --> 00:59:57,450
is the change in the price. That's what
you want to try to forecast. All right.

891
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,290
And so, um, uh,

892
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:05,291
I created this column going all the way
back to 1871 showing for each year how

893
01:00:06,741 --> 01:00:07,790
much the,
uh,

894
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:11,760
s and p composite index
in real terms change.

895
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:15,320
I did it in logs. I took the
change in the log, the real price.

896
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:20,450
So that's essentially the
percentage change that is
going to be hard to forecast.

897
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:24,680
Obviously it's going to be hard to
forecast because there's some truth to the

898
01:00:24,681 --> 01:00:28,100
efficient markets hypothesis.
If that were easy to forecast,

899
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:31,610
you could have been rich. However, this
fear, somebody could have been written,

900
01:00:31,611 --> 01:00:34,580
it can't be that easy. Uh, nonetheless,

901
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:38,930
the problems that for you is to try
to do that, to try to forecast it.

902
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:44,260
So you have to do is go to regression
analysis and you don't have to use excel,

903
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:47,660
but that's just what I'm suggesting
here because that's the easiest thing.

904
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,800
So to run a regression,
uh, you go up to tools,

905
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:57,140
uh, and uh, let me see data, oops,

906
01:00:58,130 --> 01:01:01,820
data analysis,
you can't even find it down here.

907
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:06,350
Uh,
and then you got to regression.

908
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:13,170
Uh, I guess I have to say. Okay. And
then it asks you to fit fill in Europe,

909
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:16,930
uh,
x range and your y range.

910
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:22,390
So the x variable is the, remember
the regression model, uh, is,

911
01:01:22,391 --> 01:01:25,660
um,
it's m

912
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:34,410
y equals Alpha plus Beta x plus
some error term epsilon or you,

913
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:41,590
I know, I call it you. So we
don't get mixed up. All right?

914
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:45,440
So it's asking you to say
where are your y variable is a,

915
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:50,120
and I've got my wive
variable is in column K,

916
01:01:50,830 --> 01:01:55,660
right? Because that's what I've generated.
That the change, uh, in, uh, the k,

917
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:01,630
oh wait, I've lost it. I can't,
it's not column k. It's a,

918
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:07,400
and if I can do it,
it's a,

919
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:11,700
I'm trying to find it here.
It's calm.

920
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:14,460
I isn't it,
the move this,

921
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:15,680
okay.

922
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:20,040
That's the change in price. Uh, and then
the x variable, I can pick some variable.

923
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:22,950
The forecast, what I did is I
just took column a, which is time.

924
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:26,820
It's just the year. Uh, and
I ran the regression, uh,

925
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:30,570
since 1950 and I got the results here.

926
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,920
Uh, right here. Whoops.
Let's get rid of it.

927
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:39,450
I'm just going to show you the
results from what regression I man.

928
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:46,100
That's how excel prints out
regression results. Uh, and uh,

929
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:50,000
the Alpha, the Alpha, which
is the intercept is, um,

930
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:56,070
it's shown here.
So the intercept was 0.05.

931
01:02:57,270 --> 01:03:00,810
The Beta, uh, is, uh,

932
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:05,870
the coefficient of the variable is minus
two times 10 to the minus fifth power.

933
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:09,840
Uh, you can see it. Now I've struck out,

934
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:14,550
it doesn't like time as a forecast.
It's a very small coefficient.

935
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:17,100
Uh,

936
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:22,100
the key statistic is a measure
of statistical significance
and the t statistic

937
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:28,130
should probably be over to first just to
go significant and insignificant piece

938
01:03:29,451 --> 01:03:34,180
statistics for both Alpha
and for Bayer. So, um,

939
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:39,440
the r squared is a measure of what
fraction of the dependent variable y is

940
01:03:41,491 --> 01:03:42,900
variance I have predicted.

941
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:48,840
And so it comes out with
a fraction of 0.00014,

942
01:03:48,841 --> 01:03:51,870
seven. All right, this is not a success.

943
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:55,200
This is not a get rich
quick story because, uh,

944
01:03:55,360 --> 01:04:00,300
I'm explaining a one 10000th of
the variance of the stock market.

945
01:04:00,810 --> 01:04:02,760
So, uh, I've, I struck out,

946
01:04:04,140 --> 01:04:09,060
I wasn't really trying that hard. I
just regressed the returns on time. Um,

947
01:04:09,330 --> 01:04:14,090
so the problems that for you
is to, uh, think about, uh,

948
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:18,920
seeing if you can forecast the market.
Uh, you don't have to use my data set.

949
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:23,130
You can use others. Uh, and uh,
you can go online and find them.

950
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:27,900
For example, finance dot.
yahoo.com has a lot of indexes, uh,

951
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,370
but you can find them on other sites.
Um,

952
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:35,190
so if you find some other data and
you can try to see if you can beat me,

953
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:39,840
I not setting up a very high
standard for success. Uh,

954
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:43,470
if it were this bad efficient markets,
well,

955
01:04:43,471 --> 01:04:48,120
this looks good for efficient
markets theory. So, um, uh,

956
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:52,980
uh, so, but, uh,

957
01:04:57,570 --> 01:05:01,650
what I thought you might
do for the problems that is
to try to think creatively

958
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,700
about how to forecast the market.
And let me say this, uh, I'm not, uh,

959
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:10,260
I'm going to have to go and continue
with my doubts about efficient markets in

960
01:05:10,261 --> 01:05:13,540
another lecture. But, uh, I,

961
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:17,380
I think that the story has a
good element of truth to it.

962
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:19,810
It has to be hard to beat the market,

963
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:24,820
but it's oversold as well,
especially in academic circles.

964
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:29,010
I think us professors who are poor are,

965
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:31,630
you know,
it's kind of a wishful thinking by us.

966
01:05:31,631 --> 01:05:36,070
We're not making much money
and you can't. Anyway. Uh,

967
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:37,600
and so,
uh,

968
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:41,620
we kind of over at tend to overstate
efficient markets hypothesis and the other

969
01:05:41,621 --> 01:05:46,180
hand relative to your expectations
as naive young people, uh,

970
01:05:46,181 --> 01:05:49,960
it may be a good thing to do to
overstate efficient market's hypothesis.

971
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:54,700
There seems to be a life cycle effect
where young people think I can surely

972
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:59,260
predict the market. Uh, and then
they get beaten down. Um, uh,

973
01:06:00,040 --> 01:06:03,310
Brad, Barbara and Terry Odn
who are professors at UC,

974
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:07,690
at different campuses of California,
teamed up with, uh, economists from,

975
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:11,500
uh, Taiwan, uh, and looked at data of,

976
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:15,730
they got really good data from
Taiwan about day traders, uh,

977
01:06:15,731 --> 01:06:19,990
and their actual returns that they traders
are people who trade every day in the

978
01:06:19,991 --> 01:06:24,040
markets. Uh, and they found that there
was a really predictable pattern.

979
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,370
The young people, they started
out as a day trader, uh,

980
01:06:27,390 --> 01:06:32,390
and they quickly lose it and then they
lose badly cause they're trading too much

981
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:36,040
and they really can't predict the market.
There's like 1% of them though,

982
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:38,740
who seem like they can
actually beat the market.

983
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:42,280
This looks like really good
for efficient markets. Uh,

984
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:47,460
but they found that there are some
Taiwanese people who know how to beat the

985
01:06:48,521 --> 01:06:52,090
market.
1% survives and stays in.

986
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:54,970
So is that contrary to efficient markets?
Well,

987
01:06:54,971 --> 01:06:58,990
it does seem contrary because they found
a small number of people did find some

988
01:06:58,991 --> 01:07:03,090
forecasting rule and succeeded.
On the other hand, none of, uh,

989
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:07,240
hardly any of them got really rich.
And so it's very rare.

990
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:11,140
Warren buffet is an extremely
rare outcome. And so it's,

991
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,600
I guess when I talk about
efficient markets, I want to, uh,

992
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:19,650
help prevent you from suffering under
any delusions about your forecasting

993
01:07:19,721 --> 01:07:20,260
ability.

994
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:24,670
But I don't mean that Warren Buffet can't
do it or that you can't do it if you

995
01:07:24,671 --> 01:07:29,320
develop yourself into a Warren buffet.
So the next,

996
01:07:29,590 --> 01:07:34,590
the problem set number three asks you
to think creatively about how you would

997
01:07:36,641 --> 01:07:41,170
forecast the market and to take a
stab at it by running a regression.

998
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:43,660
And I expect you all to fail,

999
01:07:43,930 --> 01:07:47,860
or almost all of you to fail your grade
will not depend on your success in

1000
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,110
forecast.
It may even depend inversely,

1001
01:07:50,470 --> 01:07:53,350
because if you show a big
success in forecasting,

1002
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:58,740
you're a teaching assistant will look at
it very carefully and try to find some

1003
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:03,640
mistake you made because if you do
succeed, uh, it's probably a mistake.

1004
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:07,930
Uh, on the other hand, I don't want to
tell you that you can't because as I said,

1005
01:08:07,931 --> 01:08:09,010
we're going to come back to this,

1006
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:14,340
but I have doubts about efficient markets
and I think that you just might be

1007
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:16,540
able to do it if you're smart about it.
