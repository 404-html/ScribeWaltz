1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:05,190
The fundamental point that I
want to make today is that,

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,320
well, economic theory
describes, people has managing,

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,450
they're maximizing their own utility
and subject to constraints. Uh,

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,790
most people have a lot
of trouble doing that,

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,870
particularly as regards
investing in financial markets.

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,040
Most people are confused and,
uh, find it just very difficult.

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,820
So,
um,

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,220
we have an industry of people who
help people with their investments,

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,960
uh, and we moreover have a
whole array of regulations,

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:40,860
uh,

11
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,860
regulating the industry of people who
help others with their investments.

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,950
The problem is that most people are
not that good at dealing in financial

13
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:58,460
markets. They're mysterious,
they're difficult. And Moreover, uh,

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,720
there's a tendency of psychological
biases that cause people to get into

15
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,180
mistakes.
Uh,

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,390
we talked about overconfidence that
most people think they're smarter than

17
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:13,080
others,
and it seems like people can easily get

18
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,580
overconfident about their
ability to beat the market. Uh,

19
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,910
and what naturally
happens if not regulated,

20
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,870
is that there will be others who will
victimize and exploit these people.

21
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,470
So the classic story is some
kind of stockbroker who,

22
00:01:33,481 --> 00:01:38,160
uh, promises to make
great wealth for you, uh,

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,380
by trading your portfolio.
Uh, and, uh, in fact, uh,

24
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,520
doesn't really know anything.

25
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,780
The guy is just a showman
who is just pretending.

26
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,153
Uh,

27
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,740
there was a 1940s book called
where are the customers yachts,

28
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,310
which, uh, it was a best selling book.

29
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,430
The title refers to the
fact that stockbrokers give
the impression that oh idea

30
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:05,760
with a very wealthy,

31
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:10,761
successful crowd of people and you are
now one of the chosen people that I'm

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,360
managing for.

33
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,530
And so some stockbrokers will
pretend to be very wealthy,

34
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,820
create the appearance of that,
like are associated with the rich people.

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,360
And it draws people in.
But in fact,

36
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:29,250
the customers often don't do very well
because the stockbroker make churn,

37
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:34,251
their portfolio keep coming up with new
trades and the broker is making money

38
00:02:34,501 --> 00:02:38,120
from commissions and, um, uh,

39
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,130
that's the kind of problem that arises.
So as a result,

40
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:45,060
a lot of people recognize the
importance of giving help to people.

41
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,400
Uh, and so that's what we're talking
about. I want to talk mostly about,

42
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,900
uh,
portfolio managers,

43
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,940
uh, but I first talk about, uh,

44
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,330
financial advisors,

45
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,200
uh,
and also financial planners.

46
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,583
Um,

47
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,850
and then I'll move to a fiduciaries
or institutional investors.

48
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,763
Uh,

49
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,870
so we do not live in a world where people
freely do business as they would like.

50
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,000
The financial world is especially
heavily regulated. Okay.

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,040
So the first thing is
financial advisor. Uh, again,

52
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,310
most people don't know
about these markets.

53
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,930
They need someone to give them advice.

54
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,580
So people set themselves up
as financial advisers. Um,

55
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,710
and uh, in most countries, these are
heavily regulated by the government, uh,

56
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:03,480
in the United States. Now what does
that, what does a financial advisor,

57
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:04,770
I should define that for you?

58
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,920
It's someone who gives advice about
investments for some kind of fee or

59
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:13,080
commission. All right? Uh,

60
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,690
it excludes lawyers,
bankers,

61
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:24,060
insurance salesmen,
reporters for newspapers,

62
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,860
professors. Even though these people
may all give financial advice,

63
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,360
it's not considered as part of law
to be a central to what they do.

64
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,480
And so there are excluded from the
definition of financial advisor.

65
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,720
Uh,
it also excludes broker dealers.

66
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,950
If someone presents himself
or herself just as a broker,

67
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,290
that's someone you can call up and say,

68
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:53,100
I want to buy a hundred
shares of GM or whatever.

69
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,890
And the person does the deal,
does the trade for you.

70
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,830
That is also not a financial advisor.

71
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,620
Even if that person,
uh,

72
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,590
occasionally dispenses advice,
it's only incidental to the business.

73
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:13,760
Financial advisers includes people who
present themselves as offering advice to

74
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:18,120
individuals and also includes analysts.

75
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,190
So,
uh,

76
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,190
these are regulated and there's something
called the National Securities Markets

77
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,530
Improvement Act of 1996.

78
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,220
National Securities Market Improvement
Act says that all financial advisors with

79
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:39,861
less than 25 million under
management must regulate,

80
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,220
must register with the state regulator.

81
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,710
And if it's greater than 30 million,

82
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,680
they must register with the SCC in
Washington Securities and Exchange

83
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,030
Commission. If it's between,
they can choose either.

84
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:02,800
Uh, so they're all regulated.
Okay. And, uh, the, uh,

85
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,850
government,
uh,

86
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,900
wants to be sure that
financial advisors are, uh,

87
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,050
no, uh, what good practice is.

88
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,680
And so that means they have to take an
exam and the exam is administered by a,

89
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,090
what's called Finra should
know. Um, that is, uh, was it,

90
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,180
uh, financial institutions
regulatory authority,

91
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:34,400
formerly called an ASD.
See how this is getting complicated.

92
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,120
And a s D is National Association
of securities dealers.

93
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,730
And they started the
Nasdaq Stock Market index,

94
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,380
which you hear about all the time.
Nasdaq is Nisd automation,

95
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,150
automated quotation system,

96
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,840
but NISD merged with the New York Stock
Exchange Regulatory Authority last year.

97
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,790
And so they've been renamed as Finra.
Okay.

98
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:03,860
These are all these institutional details.
I want you to know because it,

99
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,070
it's, it's boring maybe, but I think
it's what's true. It's what's happening.

100
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,000
This is what drives so much that happens.

101
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,680
So Thinra says that if you want
to become a financial advisor,

102
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,440
you have to pass a series.

103
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:24,170
They call it series 65 or 66 exam and
then you are eligible according to Finra.

104
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,020
Uh,
it,

105
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:35,021
Finra is an example of a s a
self regulatory organization.

106
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,590
The government in the United States
doesn't want to be making all the rules.

107
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:45,010
So they allow industry groups to form
their own self policing organizations.

108
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:45,981
Uh,

109
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:50,981
and so Finra is the Organization for
financial advisors and that is a,

110
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,240
an SRO and the SEC
accepts their licensing.

111
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,160
So that's what you have to do to
become a financial advisor. Uh,

112
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,920
you have to take these exams, join
Finra, then you go to the sec,

113
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:08,570
and then you register as
a financial advisor. Um,

114
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,170
and so the exams would warn you
about all kinds of bad practices. Uh,

115
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:17,750
for example,
uh,

116
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,840
about churning a portfolio.

117
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,330
I just mentioned what they did,
but repeat it.

118
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,000
That's when you call the guy
up every day and you say,

119
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,930
I just got a hot new idea for you.
Of course, yesterday you bought,

120
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,880
you bought Microsoft, Oh,
sell that, move to this. Uh,

121
00:08:37,881 --> 00:08:41,090
and they just keep calling you
up. And that's, that's, uh,

122
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,820
it's a way to get licensed if you,
if you're,

123
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:49,030
if you are caught doing that because
it can't work if you trade every day,

124
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,300
there's no,

125
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:55,300
it's virtually impossible to make money
because the commissions will eat you

126
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:58,740
alive and less, you know, you know,

127
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:03,741
these guys who are attorney or fakes
because they can't be getting a new idea

128
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:07,140
every day. So that's
the kind of thing. Now,

129
00:09:07,141 --> 00:09:11,640
financial planners are,
um, are a little different.

130
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,260
Uh, they, uh,

131
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,610
the designation of financial
planner is not regulated directly,

132
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,220
but we do have, is self
regulatory association. Uh, that,

133
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,870
uh, manage manages them. Uh,

134
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,850
so,
uh,

135
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,770
we have the financial
planning association,

136
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,170
that's their website. Uh, but uh,

137
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,270
fpa.org, uh, and they,

138
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,880
uh, license where they provide their
own designation. This is how it works.

139
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:52,960
Uh, in the u s particularly, uh, they,

140
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,070
they will,
uh,

141
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:59,090
certify someone as a certified financial
planner and FPA will require that every

142
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:05,540
financial planner first become
a financial advisor. Uh,

143
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,920
so that's,
uh,

144
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,240
this is a big organization that
incidentally, if anyone ever asks you,

145
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,360
I need investment advice.
Where do I get it? Uh,

146
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:21,470
it might be a good idea to direct them
to that website because they'll help you

147
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,610
get a financial planner,

148
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,060
which is more than a broker is supposed
to actually be planning for your life.

149
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:32,420
And that that's the essential
economic problem that we faced.

150
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,990
A stock brokers will often this,

151
00:10:36,991 --> 00:10:41,350
it comes back to what a Henry
Paulson said in his proposal for rec

152
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,610
reorganization of our financial markets.
He thought,

153
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,460
and I think this may reflect
some essential wisdom,

154
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,580
that we should have
objectives based regulation.

155
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,970
Each organization should
be focused on an objective.

156
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,120
I think the objective of the
organization affects what you do.

157
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,890
So if you are a stock broker and if you
present yourself as someone who will buy

158
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:03,150
and sell stocks for you,

159
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,380
you're probably not going to get into
financial planning with your clients.

160
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,790
But if it's, if it's on your title, if
you're, you write this after your name,

161
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:16,110
your John Doe CFP,
then it says planner in your title.

162
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,750
I think that affects what you do.
And it helped.

163
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,510
What financial planners do is they say,

164
00:11:21,511 --> 00:11:25,530
let's sit down and think about
your life goals and you know,

165
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:30,490
do you expect to have children, are
you going to send them to college? Uh,

166
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,840
and you know, this kind of thought,
which is very important. Um,

167
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,330
there's another one called
isn't for financial advisors,

168
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,170
napfa.org National Association
of Personal Financial Advisors.

169
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,230
And if someone asks you a,
where should I go for advice,

170
00:11:52,231 --> 00:11:55,620
this is another good website
to go to because, uh,

171
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,780
what I like about nafa.org is that
they have all of their advisors sign a

172
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:06,571
statement that they will be fee only
advisors and they will never steer someone

173
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,620
towards an investment that provides a
kickback to them that that's a problem.

174
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:17,900
Is that often a financial advisor,
uh,

175
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,930
we'll be really trying to make money
selling you things that, uh, provides,

176
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:27,130
uh, um, money. They're not unbiased,

177
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,570
but NAPFA,
uh,

178
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:34,660
it's part of their code of ethics that
they're completely separate from any,

179
00:12:34,661 --> 00:12:36,550
uh,
any organization.

180
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,560
They're pure financial advisers and
they don't make money from commissions.

181
00:12:41,681 --> 00:12:46,060
It's only from the hourly
fee. So anywhere. What else?

182
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,530
So that's basically what I was going
to say about, um, financial advisors.

183
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,240
Uh, it's a big industry
and it's important. Uh,

184
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,620
and actually in my new
book, uh, I have, I have no,

185
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,070
I shouldn't say I have no connection
to this industry whatsoever,

186
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,750
but I actually was, uh, uh,

187
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,030
ad saying that I think as a national
policy we should subsidize this industry.

188
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,450
I think people need more financial advice.
Uh,

189
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,650
most people are just not with it enough.

190
00:13:17,651 --> 00:13:21,460
They're not getting the
basic wisdom, uh, that, uh,

191
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:25,000
and so I think if, if we need more
of this, we should subsidize it.

192
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,780
I was just in Mexico,
uh, or over the weekend,

193
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,030
and I had the opportunity to meet the
president of Mexico, which was exciting.

194
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,063
And I,

195
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:40,150
I also heard him say that he thinks
Mexico needs more development of financial

196
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,813
culture.

197
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:48,010
And this seems to be the thing that
not enough Mexicans are really used to

198
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:51,460
dealing with sophisticated
financial institutions.

199
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,200
And so that's where we have to go
with Mexico. But I was saying, well,

200
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,100
it's just the same in every country.
I think there's a problem.

201
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,960
So, uh, uh,

202
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:11,200
but the other thing, so
that's, I won't say more about
financial advisors, but, uh,

203
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,780
uh,
let's move now to,

204
00:14:13,781 --> 00:14:18,781
the other way that happens is
that people will turn over there.

205
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,470
Uh, uh, actually I'm going to
come back to trust and then later,

206
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:24,530
but the other,

207
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,380
the really big industry that manages
people's financial problems for them,

208
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,780
our institutional investors,
and these are groups that, uh,

209
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,230
organizations that pool
money for many people and uh,

210
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,830
invest the portfolio for them.
Uh,

211
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,960
and I wanted to start by
emphasizing how important they are.

212
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,070
Uh,

213
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:56,070
and I wanted to just present you with
the balance sheet for households and

214
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:01,490
nonprofits, uh, as, uh,

215
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:05,330
and just get some idea of how
important institutional investors are.

216
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:09,200
They're more important than
these financial advisors
because most of people's

217
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:13,270
wealth is really managed by institutions.
You don't have to ask any questions,

218
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:18,230
you don't have to do anything.
It's all done for you. Uh, so, uh,

219
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,150
just to, um, I wanted to
show the balance sheet

220
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,373
okay.

221
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,160
Of households

222
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,270
and nonprofits,

223
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:43,770
and that's table be 100 of
the flow of funds account.

224
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:44,880
This is for the United States,

225
00:15:44,881 --> 00:15:48,180
but I think it would be
similar in other countries. Um,

226
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,220
and uh,

227
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,340
so we have assets on one side and
we have liabilities on another.

228
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,200
So we'll have assets and
then we'll have liabilities.

229
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,510
You might wonder, why do we put
households and nonprofits together?

230
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,940
It's really because there are three
types of persons that own things.

231
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,210
There's individuals are natural persons,

232
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:24,320
there are nonprofit organizations which
are like individuals because nobody owns

233
00:16:24,961 --> 00:16:26,880
them.
They own themselves.

234
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:31,770
They're like people in
contrast to corporations that
are owned by individuals.

235
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,710
And then we also have the
government is the third.

236
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,960
So this is the non government balance
sheet. And so it's just about everything,

237
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,320
uh, in this country. And
I just wanted to review,

238
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,100
this is from the Federal Reserve and these
are estimates of course in subject to

239
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:49,080
error,
but uh,

240
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:54,081
and this is for 2007 fourth quarter,

241
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,690
which is the latest data.
Okay.

242
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:03,410
So assets are things that people own
and liabilities are things that people,

243
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,340
oh,
okay.

244
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:10,360
And your net worth is your assets
minus your liabilities. Um,

245
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,940
so let's start with assets. What
do you, I won't ask you to guess.

246
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,673
Uh,

247
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,950
the biggest asset that people own Indian
and I did state that households own is,

248
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:27,150
and nonprofits, this is almost
entirely households are nonprofits.

249
00:17:27,151 --> 00:17:31,680
I small compared to household.
Real estate is the biggest thing.

250
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:37,530
And that is 22, uh, four,

251
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:37,741
eight,

252
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:42,741
$3 billion or $22 trillion.

253
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,670
Uh, and people own this
directly. It's their house.

254
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,280
But the second most,

255
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,670
the second biggest thing is pension funds.

256
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,140
And that is a
12 billion.

257
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,790
I mean it's 12 trillion,
12 billion,

258
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,230
twelve thousand seven hundred
and seventy nine billion. Okay.

259
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,790
So that comes after right
after real estate. Uh,

260
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,260
then we have equity in
non corporate business.

261
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:26,640
That is, um, seven, three, eight,

262
00:18:26,641 --> 00:18:31,480
nine. I'm sorry, I'm reading
the wrong line. Seven, eight,

263
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:33,820
nine to almost 8 billion.

264
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,580
What, what is non corporate business?
It's business is run by individuals,

265
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,930
so it's like the low, you know, if a
family runs a little grocery store, uh,

266
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,490
then their ownership of
that is represented here
as non corporate business.

267
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,710
Or if you, if you're a barber and
you've got your little barbershop, um,

268
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:55,640
it all adds up.

269
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,640
They valued all of these businesses and
they valued them up totally as worth $8

270
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,990
trillion.
Uh,

271
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,800
and that we have corporate equities

272
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,680
that's star. Uh, and, and uh,

273
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:15,800
that is five, four, four,

274
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,000
7 billion or about 5 trillion.

275
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,880
Um, that's stocks owned
directly by household. Uh,

276
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,330
and then, uh, we have mutual funds.

277
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,373
Okay.

278
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,120
And mutual funds are institutional
investors that invest in stocks or bonds.

279
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:42,560
Uh,

280
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,560
but usually it's mostly stocks
five oh eight to a trillion.

281
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:53,710
So it's almost as big as corporate
equities hell directly. Um,

282
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:57,400
and then there's consumer durables.

283
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,520
That means your car, your furniture. Uh,

284
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,210
that's four oh eight,
I'm sorry,

285
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,700
four oh three 5 billion,
uh,

286
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,283
bonds.

287
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:23,300
I'm running out of room
here to seven. Three. Oh,

288
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:29,710
not so much. Not as big a insurance. Um,

289
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,710
I have everything ranked by size,
so we're going down the scale.

290
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:39,290
Insurance is, um, this is life
insurance one, two oh five.

291
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:43,100
Um, and then I'm running out
of room at the bottom of this.

292
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,920
There's some other minor
categories, uh, but the is,

293
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,070
I'll write it up here and since I
would normally put it at the bottom,

294
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,780
but I've out of room with the bottom.
The total assets total

295
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,310
is 72

296
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,450
oh nine, $3 billion. So $72 trillion

297
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,980
liabilities of households.
Um,

298
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,790
our mortgages,
home mortgages,

299
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,790
and that's 10,
five or nine.

300
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,030
Um,
consumer credit,

301
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,270
that's a credit cards,

302
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,370
installment credit, various
types, two, five, five,

303
00:21:33,371 --> 00:21:37,030
1 billion, uh, loans

304
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:43,360
and other
one,

305
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:46,150
three,
one 5 billion.

306
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:51,420
And the tall and the total liabilities is,
um,

307
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,990
14
three one five.

308
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,790
So people own 72 trillion.

309
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:05,030
They owe 14 trillion.
The difference is net worth,

310
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,300
uh, is um, uh, 57,

311
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,590
seven one 8 billion.

312
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:23,330
So that's about $192,000 per
person in the United States.

313
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:27,100
It's unequally how light.
This is just consolidating everybody.

314
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,300
It's unequally held, uh, because, uh,

315
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,230
uh, rich people are more
this than poor people.

316
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,030
But in the average family
of four has about 800,000.

317
00:22:40,031 --> 00:22:44,140
I'm just multiplying by 192,000 by four.

318
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,850
So we have a lot of wealth,
but the point here is what form is it in?

319
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,410
But real estate is very unmanaged.
People own their own homes, uh,

320
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,490
and there's not much institutional
involvement except through the mortgage.

321
00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,210
Not that they owe about half.
They only own about half of their home.

322
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:04,600
The average person,
oh, is on the mortgage,

323
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,170
almost half the value of the home.
Okay.

324
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,850
So if you took net worth in
real estate, it would be, uh,

325
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,580
only like 12 trillion, right?
Assets minus real estate liability.

326
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,680
So by that account,

327
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:24,730
the biggest asset that people have
is apparently their pension fund.

328
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,890
Uh, that's huge. And that
is institutional investors.

329
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,780
The thing I wanted to make,

330
00:23:31,781 --> 00:23:35,380
the point I wanted to make about this
is that institutional investors dominate

331
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,340
just about everything. I mean, you've got
real estate and non corporate business,

332
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:43,960
which are not easily managed by
institutional investors. Beyond that, uh,

333
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,140
it's mostly institutional
mutual funds,

334
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,330
well, and insurance. So, uh, we,

335
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:56,030
we live in a country
where things are done,

336
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:01,560
are managed by a professional investors.
Uh,

337
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,680
so maybe I'll just start on this board.
Uh,

338
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,530
so, uh, so let's just talk about
a mutual. What does a mutual fund,

339
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,070
a mutual fund refers to a
structure of an investment company.

340
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,540
Uh, they're much more
important than hedge funds.

341
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,510
Hedge funds are,
we talked about those before,

342
00:24:26,511 --> 00:24:29,870
are designed for a small
group of wealthy investors.

343
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,970
Mutual funds are for the general public,
uh,

344
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,250
and the reason they're called mutual is
that the fund is owned by the investors.

345
00:24:40,131 --> 00:24:42,780
In it. Uh, and, uh,

346
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,830
the first mutual fund
was called Mit,

347
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,780
uh, no connection with Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.

348
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:57,950
This was the Massachusetts
Investors Trust, uh,

349
00:24:57,951 --> 00:25:00,750
in the 1920s.
Uh,

350
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,570
and at that time there were
a lot of investor funds,

351
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:09,340
uh, that were not
relatively unregulated. Uh,

352
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,980
and they were offering investments
to people that were, uh,

353
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:16,560
oversold often and often.
Uh,

354
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,830
there were classes of
shareholders. There was a, uh, uh,

355
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,790
class of prime shareholders who got
the profits from the enterprise.

356
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:30,310
And then there was a class of other
shareholders who were the Hoi Polloi who,

357
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,560
um,
and after 1929,

358
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:38,561
many of the investment funds crashed
and burned and people got very upset.

359
00:25:39,021 --> 00:25:39,831
They were very upset,

360
00:25:39,831 --> 00:25:44,630
particularly that the investment fund
was really being run for the profit and

361
00:25:44,631 --> 00:25:49,310
benefit of the guys who started the fund,
not all the people who were in there.

362
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,320
And so after 1929,

363
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,340
there was looking around is how should
the investment funds really be organized.

364
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:00,670
And then attention became focused on
MIT because it was an honest fund.

365
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,560
Uh, and they thought this
should be the model for, uh,

366
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,520
our investment fund industry.

367
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:11,540
But what Massachusetts Investment
Trust did is they said,

368
00:26:11,541 --> 00:26:15,350
everybody is equal and we're
completely open about what we do.

369
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,830
We publish our portfolio.
Uh,

370
00:26:18,831 --> 00:26:21,890
and most investment funds were
secret. They were saying, well,

371
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:24,410
we're going to beat the market. We're
not going to publish what we're doing.

372
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,690
The Mit published its portfolio.
It had only one class of investors.

373
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:34,550
In fact, the fund was owned by
the investors. It's a mutual fund.

374
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:39,470
So if you put money in, you join
the crowd, we invest for you.

375
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,750
Uh,
and if you want to take your money out,

376
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:46,140
we'll share your proportion of the
whole portfolio. That was the concept.

377
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:51,560
So the concept, uh, became very, uh,

378
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,440
widely respected and
the whole industry grew.

379
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,940
The Investment Act of 1940,

380
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,820
uh,
the Investment Company act,

381
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,810
uh,
1940,

382
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,710
it doesn't actually define mutual funds,

383
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:18,090
but it defines structures that are
used by mutual funds. And so after, uh,

384
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,130
after the Investment Company
act, uh, starting in the 1950s,

385
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,090
mutual funds began to grow
and grow. Uh, and, um,

386
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,820
uh,
they are regulated in such a way that,

387
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,830
uh, the, as I've said, all,
everyone is equal in the fund.

388
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:42,360
Everyone benefits from the portfolio
in an, uh, in an equal way.

389
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:47,810
And the rule is that if you don't buy
and sell shares in the Mutual Fund,

390
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:51,300
this fund owns shares.

391
00:27:51,301 --> 00:27:55,920
You're putting money into the fund and
if you want to get money out of the fund,

392
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:59,460
you call him up for,
or maybe you can do it on the web and you,

393
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,430
you say you place an order to
withdraw money from the fund.

394
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:08,100
And what they will do when you withdraw
money is they wait until 4:00 PM,

395
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:14,040
uh, on the day of your
order. Uh, and then, uh,

396
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:19,070
they calculate what your share of the
fund would be based on 4:00 PM is when the

397
00:28:21,031 --> 00:28:25,200
stock market's closed.
Uh, and so at 4:00 PM,

398
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:28,560
you would get out at those prices.
Uh,

399
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:33,240
and that was considered a fair
and honest thing, uh, to do.

400
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:37,230
They don't charge high management fees.
Uh,

401
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:41,670
there's rules about that. Uh, and so, um,

402
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,930
uh, they have their own Srr, uh,

403
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:51,110
called ICI a investment company institute
that was created I believe in the

404
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:57,210
1940s. So this has become the structure
for the way most people, well, I,

405
00:28:57,211 --> 00:29:01,770
half people, most small investors do
not own corporate equity directly.

406
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,380
They own mutual funds.
Uh,

407
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,850
there have been some scandals
about mutual fund, um,

408
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:13,890
that emerge in the last decade or so.

409
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,110
My spirit scandals, uh, there's
something called late training.

410
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,080
What was happening is,
uh,

411
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:31,710
sometimes there's mutual funds didn't
enforce the rules well enough. Uh,

412
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,820
you would, you would tell your broker, uh,

413
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:38,210
I'd like to withdraw money from the
mutual fund and the broker would then

414
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:43,110
sometimes call, um, after 4:00 PM and say,

415
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,280
uh,
uh,

416
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,100
my client really asked me to sell
this at 10:00 AM this morning.

417
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:54,390
I know it's 5:00 PM, but you know,
trust me, I'd like to get out.

418
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,220
Uh, and mutual funds would let this
happen. Then it turned out to be abused.

419
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,590
Why is that abusive?
If you're a mutual fund,

420
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,160
then you get this call from
my broker saying, trust me,

421
00:30:05,161 --> 00:30:09,310
my client asked me to get out
at 10:00 AM I know it's five.

422
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:13,080
Can we get out? Uh, well,

423
00:30:13,081 --> 00:30:17,070
that turns out to be a bad practice
because what ended up happening is people

424
00:30:17,071 --> 00:30:17,491
are abused.

425
00:30:17,491 --> 00:30:22,491
That they would wait until five or 6:00
PM and they would observe what seems to

426
00:30:24,271 --> 00:30:27,120
be happening in the markets.
And if it's going up,

427
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,510
then they would say we wanted to
put money into the mutual fund.

428
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,580
And if it's going down,
they would say,

429
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,030
we're trying to take money out of
the mutual fund. You see how that,

430
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:40,440
that hurts the other mutual fund
investors because you do it strategically.

431
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,330
You do. If you know the market
is up, you're trading on,

432
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:49,140
on steel prices and old prices, obviously
you can make money doing that. Uh,

433
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:53,440
and this got a lot of attention in
the newspaper, the late trading. Um,

434
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,133
and uh,

435
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,373
uh,

436
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,120
there was another, uh, another
variation on that called market timing,

437
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,290
but it's basically the same
thing where a mutual funds,

438
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:10,260
we're not enforcing the rules properly.

439
00:31:10,261 --> 00:31:15,261
And so some people were trading at that
4:00 PM price effectively after it.

440
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,690
Uh, and so, um,

441
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,073
uh,

442
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,660
but, uh, they've cleaned up this act.
And so I think that a mutual funds,

443
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:32,590
our most trusted way of investing in
the stock market and most people won't

444
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:37,690
invest in individual stocks anymore.
Uh, they just go through mutual funds.

445
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,100
There is another kind of thing
that has developed more recently,

446
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:48,040
uh,
and it's called an exchange traded funds,

447
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:59,980
R, n e t. A.

448
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:04,520
And these were created first.
These are relatively new.

449
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:05,720
Uh,

450
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,430
these were created first at
the American Stock Exchange

451
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,210
and 1993.
Uh,

452
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,180
and they're different from a mutual fund.
Uh,

453
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,690
I did was show them separately on
this. They're much smaller, uh,

454
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,990
then mutual funds, I believe they're
less than a trillion dollars.

455
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,800
They must be in one of these other
categories up there. But, um,

456
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:34,130
exchange traded funds are different than
a mutual fund in that they are traded

457
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:39,220
on a stock exchange. Uh,
and so the first, uh,

458
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,383
uh,

459
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:45,040
the first exchange traded fund
with a company called a spider,

460
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,920
that's standard in toward
depositary receipt.

461
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:53,290
But now there is a proliferation
of, of uh, exchange traded funds.

462
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:58,060
So what is an exchange traded fund? I
said, this is louder than you hear me.

463
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:00,940
All right, right. Uh, uh,

464
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,710
exchange traded fund, uh, is uh,

465
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:11,230
as epitomized by the,
this is the s and p 500.

466
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,900
It's a port folio that is
managed according to rules.

467
00:33:17,901 --> 00:33:22,370
It's not judgmental. Uh, and uh,

468
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:28,130
you cannot call up the exchange traded
fund and say, I want my money back.

469
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,440
It's different from a mutual fund.
If you get in,

470
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:36,170
you would buy or sell an exchange
traded fund on the Stock Exchange.

471
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,520
Uh, and so the uh, uh,

472
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,000
the fund is traded on the exchange
traded fund holds a portfolio.

473
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:50,840
I like the spider holds the portfolio
equivalent to the s and p 500.

474
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:55,520
Uh, and they pay out dividends
on that. But in the meantime, uh,

475
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:00,080
you can buy or sell shares in
the fund on the Stock Exchange.

476
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:03,500
They also have what are
called creation units,

477
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,170
uh, which are, uh,

478
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,390
in large denominations
like millions of dollars.

479
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,320
And institutional investors can either
create or redeem shares in the ETFs,

480
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:25,120
but you as an individual cannot.
All right.

481
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:29,110
So if the creation unit is $1 million,

482
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:34,480
then an institutional investor who is
an authorized participant and it has

483
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:38,590
signed the right papers, you can
say, can you go to the AMX and say,

484
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,820
I want to create a $10
million of new spiders.

485
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:47,350
And then the Amex, we'll say, that's
10 creation units. I'm saying, I don't,

486
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:50,860
I forget what it spiders creation unit is,
but let's say it's $1 million.

487
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:54,130
Then the AMX would say,
all right,

488
00:34:54,131 --> 00:34:58,180
you have to give us the
stocks in the s and p 500, uh,

489
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,240
in the proportion that they are in
the s and p 500 equal in value to $10

490
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:07,990
million. Uh, and that becomes, uh,

491
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,790
uh, one creation and then they'll give
the institutional investors the shares to

492
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:15,040
sell.
Conversely,

493
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:19,420
the institutional investor can go to the
AMX and say, I want to go the other way.

494
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:23,650
I've got a 10,000 shares of these ETFs,
I want,

495
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,600
I want this stocks back.

496
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:30,601
So the institutional investor can present
the shares to the AMX and AMX will

497
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:33,610
then give them the shares
in the s and p 500.

498
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:39,120
That enforces the price of the ETF equal
to the price of the underlying stocks.

499
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:45,530
So ETFs were designed so that the price
of the ETF tracks tracks the price of

500
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:50,550
the underlying stocks,
uh,

501
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,540
in contrast to things
called close down funds, uh,

502
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:59,660
which are similar, but they don't
have the creation units closed down.

503
00:35:59,661 --> 00:36:00,241
The funds,

504
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:04,500
the price of the fun and the stock market
tends to go through either a premium

505
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:06,630
or a discount depending on the market,

506
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:11,410
but ETFs tend to track well.
That is the price of the unit.

507
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,323
TF,

508
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,380
uh, tends to correspond to the
price of the underlying stocks,

509
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:22,390
whereas close a closed end.
Mutual funds,

510
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,390
I say close down funds track poorly.

511
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:32,480
And so ETFs is the new
thing, uh, that, uh,

512
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,860
uh,
that has developed.

513
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:42,850
I said, I would talk about, uh,
personal trusts, uh, and I thought, oh,

514
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:47,590
this is something that, um, uh, is,

515
00:36:47,591 --> 00:36:51,260
um, I've less, somewhat less important,

516
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,930
but it's about a trillion dollars
in our modern economy. Uh,

517
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,740
so what is a trust is another
form of institutional investing.

518
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:07,540
Ah,
okay.

519
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,390
Trust is a, uh, uh, it's often, uh,

520
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,040
the department of a
bank that manages money,

521
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:26,550
uh, on behalf of a, uh,

522
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:31,610
uh,
of a individual or family.

523
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,620
Uh, and, uh, for example,

524
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,330
suppose a,

525
00:37:38,331 --> 00:37:43,331
your parents are concerned about
you and they don't trust you.

526
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,450
They trust the banker, not you. Uh,
and there's a family fortune. Uh,

527
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:53,210
maybe it doesn't have to be that big,
but let's say it's $1 million. Uh,

528
00:37:53,211 --> 00:37:57,020
they could give it to you.
Uh, but they might not,

529
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,490
I don't know about your parents are doing,
they're doing this behind your back,

530
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:05,190
maybe not telling you in
great detail. Uh, but, uh,

531
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,580
a particular importance as an example
of something called a spendthrift

532
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:15,430
trust.
I'm not spelling it right.

533
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:16,800
T h.
R.

534
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,321
Okay.

535
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:25,790
Well what does a spend thrift and someone
who can't save money and squanders it.

536
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:31,210
So your parents can go to a bank and set
up a spend thrift trust on your behalf

537
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,160
and the spend trust will then
pay you an income for life.

538
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,470
Or they could even go beyond your life.

539
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:46,390
They could go to your children
or whatever, uh, but, uh,

540
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:50,950
that prevents you from squandering
the money from going to the casino and

541
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:55,810
gambling it away. If your parents
don't trust you, uh, and so, uh,

542
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,070
you see the idea of the bank,

543
00:38:57,071 --> 00:39:01,250
then we'll manage it for the rest
of your life and your parents will,

544
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,400
will die and you'll outlive him.

545
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,800
But that money will be stuck in that trust
and you can't get it out because they

546
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:12,820
set it up and it's there.
Uh, and so, uh, uh, then,

547
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:13,220
uh,

548
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:18,220
the manager of the trust is a fiduciary
who is by a contract is supposed to be

549
00:39:19,751 --> 00:39:24,460
managing in the interest of the
child, the spendthrift child. Uh,

550
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:28,870
and, uh, of course everyone, all these
people will be dead before you are.

551
00:39:28,871 --> 00:39:32,260
Your parents will die.
The first thing they talk to at the bank,

552
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:36,220
setting up the trust and will die.
Uh, but when you're 90 years old,

553
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:40,630
there'll be someone at that bank
person is much younger than you who was

554
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:44,740
appointed in succession to manage your
trust and will continue to pay you that

555
00:39:44,741 --> 00:39:47,140
income out of your trust.
Now,

556
00:39:47,141 --> 00:39:50,380
if there's another reason why your
parents might be doing this, uh,

557
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,860
which he might not, you might be angry
with your parents if they did this right?

558
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,710
Uh,
but they might do it for another reason,

559
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:00,520
and that is you could get
married and get a divorce. Okay?

560
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,380
And they're worried about this.

561
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:07,810
A really awful person you married taking
half of the family money when you get

562
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:12,430
divorced, right? So they lock it
up in a spend thrift trust. Uh,

563
00:40:12,431 --> 00:40:17,290
and then after the divorce, the trustee
will say, no way, I'm, you know,

564
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:20,620
I'm bound to pay this person,
not the wife or husband,

565
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:23,890
the amount of money for life.
And it apparently works.

566
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,890
So that's another reason why families,

567
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:30,220
we'll do this because they don't want to
give them money to the awful person you

568
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:34,510
married. Uh, uh, so, uh,

569
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,310
in common law countries,
trusts are,

570
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:43,420
that's like the u s in the UK.
Uh,

571
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:48,450
trust are well defined in law and
a trustee has well defined rights.

572
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,860
Uh, if you are, and it doesn't
have to be a bank, we allow, uh,

573
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,880
you can have a friend of yours become
a trustee. Uh, in common law countries.

574
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:00,690
There's a nice segregation of the,
uh,

575
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,730
assets in the trust and
the assets of the trustee.

576
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:08,940
So suppose you ask your brother-in-law
to serve as a trustee for your children

577
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,300
and then your brother in law gets into
some bad financial situation and goes

578
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:14,134
bankrupt.

579
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:19,770
Courts will not be allowed to take the
trust that the brother-in-law is managing

580
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:22,570
for your children.
Okay.

581
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,900
This wasn't so clear in a civil
law countries such as in Europe,

582
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,830
the typical trust in Europe has
been that you would go to a,

583
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,240
and the bank would manage the trust
for you, but if the bank went under,

584
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,660
you might lose the money. Uh, and uh,

585
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,290
maybe there's more trusting
of their banks in Europe.

586
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,850
I think this is also changing.
The law is always changing.

587
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:55,820
Um, okay, now I wanted
to come to pension funds,

588
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:58,600
which are,
uh,

589
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:04,240
the most important kind of,
uh,

590
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,180
institutional. You can see up
there that the $12 trillion,

591
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,010
it doesn't include, this pension fund
here does not include social security,

592
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,990
which is of comparable magnitude.

593
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:20,360
The government runs its own pension fund
in effect called the social security

594
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:23,520
system. And that's not shown here. So, uh,

595
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:28,660
there's a lot of pension funds are private
funds managing a portfolio of assets.

596
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:35,600
The social security system does not
manage a substantial portfolio of assets.

597
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,610
Uh, the social security system,
which is a, it's not on here,

598
00:42:40,611 --> 00:42:42,020
I'm just mentioning it as an aside.

599
00:42:42,350 --> 00:42:47,300
We set up by US Congress in
1935 to provide for the elderly,

600
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:51,980
uh, and also for a disabled and uh, um,

601
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,480
orphan children.

602
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,670
But this main social security
provides for the elderly, but it does.

603
00:42:58,671 --> 00:43:00,950
So without investing it,

604
00:43:00,951 --> 00:43:05,090
there is something called the Social
Security Trust Fund managed by the

605
00:43:05,091 --> 00:43:05,511
government,

606
00:43:05,511 --> 00:43:10,511
which invests in assets to help the
government pay out on social security.

607
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:11,931
However,

608
00:43:11,931 --> 00:43:16,640
the Social Security Trust Fund is only
last time I heard about $1 trillion.

609
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,570
So the government is not
investing much compared to, uh,

610
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:25,730
these pension funds.
The pension funds are much bigger.

611
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,580
And these are our agencies,

612
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,350
private agencies that invest,
uh,

613
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,850
on behalf of people for their retirement.
Uh,

614
00:43:36,830 --> 00:43:39,740
and they are very important
element of our economy.

615
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,900
They help us solve the essential problem
that everyone goes through the life

616
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:48,020
cycle. You're young, you're healthy
for a while, you're working,

617
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:53,030
and then your health starts to deteriorate
and then you have years or decades

618
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:58,270
when you are either not
inclined to work or cannot work.

619
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,390
Uh, and this happens with such
regularity that, uh, it, it, uh,

620
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:08,810
requires some kind of
professional management and
that's what pension funds do.

621
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:14,400
So I wanted to talk about these
in some more detail. The, the,

622
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:17,840
uh, it wasn't until the 19th
century that we had them,

623
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:21,410
which is kind of surprising because
it's such an important problem.

624
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:26,510
And even in the 19th century, they
were few and rare. Uh, but, um,

625
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:31,070
the, uh, the first us, I think they go,

626
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,940
they go back earlier in the UK
and in places in Europe. But,

627
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,620
uh,
in the United States,

628
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:43,190
the first corporate pension funds
was American Express in 1875.

629
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:50,980
American Express then was not a
credit card company. It was a,

630
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:56,580
it was a shipping company
or a transportation company.

631
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,190
Uh,
and uh,

632
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:03,410
it's first a pension fund was for the,

633
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,180
was for the employees of American Express.
Uh,

634
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:12,300
and the original terms where you had to
work there for 20 years and past the age

635
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:16,660
of 60, and you had also
to be disabled. Uh,

636
00:45:16,661 --> 00:45:20,860
and if you satisfied though,
if you were over 60,

637
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:25,570
you had worked at American Express
for 20 years and also were disabled,

638
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,261
uh,

639
00:45:26,261 --> 00:45:31,261
you would get 50% of the average pay
for the last 10 years you worked there.

640
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,440
This is the earliest model in the u s

641
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:45,440
uh, and that, uh, gradually they
became copied by more companies.

642
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:49,990
Uh, it became more and
more important as the 19th.

643
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,660
And we moved into the 20th century
because life expectancy was going up.

644
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,880
There were relatively few people with
the life expectancy at 1900 was something

645
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:01,250
like 45 years.
I don't have the exact number.

646
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:05,770
So 60 was a milestone that a lot of people
didn't reach. Oh, of course. Others,

647
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,610
many did as well. So it's not a,

648
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:14,120
this was important even
then, but, uh, it wasn't,

649
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,890
the original pension funds tended to be
done for the benefit of the employer in

650
00:46:18,891 --> 00:46:21,170
the sense that like the American Express,

651
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:25,820
you had to work there for all of 20
years, uh, in order to get anything.

652
00:46:25,821 --> 00:46:29,250
It was all or nothing. If you
work there for 19 years, uh,

653
00:46:29,251 --> 00:46:32,960
then too bad and you've got nothing.
It didn't seem well designed,

654
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,290
but it was designed to keep people there.
They didn't want people leaving.

655
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,930
And so once he signed
onto American Express,

656
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,920
you were kind of stuck there because
you didn't want to get out, uh,

657
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:47,330
you'd lose your pension. Um, so, uh,

658
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:52,880
the, uh, it wasn't very big, but, uh, uh,

659
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:58,250
big institution in the
Carnegie Steel Pension,

660
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:06,930
a pension plan was 1901.
Andrew Carnegie,

661
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:11,010
uh, which was a milestone
because it started to, uh,

662
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:13,030
establish the principle on there.

663
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:17,930
This was the first big company
to establish a pension fund. Uh,

664
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:22,940
and it grew through the first
few decades of the 19th century.

665
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:29,490
Uh, and by 1929, there were
many pension funds. Uh,

666
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,080
they started doing union pension funds.

667
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:36,430
So there were the cigar makers,
uh,

668
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:40,230
that was a union,
um,

669
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:45,360
or granite cutters and
cigar makers in 1905, uh,

670
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,650
locomotive engineers,

671
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:54,080
that was 19, 12. Uh,

672
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,580
many of these funds failed in 1929

673
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:03,550
and they were offered by companies
for their employees or unions,

674
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:05,860
uh, for their members. Uh,

675
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:09,490
when companies offered
tensions for their employees,

676
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:14,320
that was a risky thing because companies
go bankrupt. It happens all the time.

677
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:19,450
And if they go bankrupt, how are they
going to pay the pension plan? Well,

678
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:23,080
that was tough luck for the employee.
He's, that was a lesson enlightened time.

679
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:24,070
They didn't,

680
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:29,070
the point was that they rarely funded
the pension funds in the early decades of

681
00:48:29,891 --> 00:48:33,880
the 20th century.
Carnegie steel just ran about Carney,

682
00:48:33,881 --> 00:48:37,090
but generally they just promised to pay.
They just said,

683
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:42,040
we will pay you when you retire.
And out of what you might ask, well,

684
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:44,710
that wasn't explained,
but it had to be out of profits.

685
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,800
And what if they weren't making
any profits? Well, they didn't ask.

686
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:54,670
People didn't seem to
anticipate this. After 1929, uh,

687
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:56,480
these, these, um,

688
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:01,290
pension funds became discredited
because so many of them failed.

689
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,870
Uh, and that led to, uh, a,

690
00:49:04,871 --> 00:49:08,890
a idea that we had to
do something different.

691
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,323
So,
uh,

692
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:15,750
the big milestone in pension history
is the General Motors Pension Fund,

693
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:19,280
uh, which, uh,

694
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,690
g m pension,

695
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:28,460
which was created in 1950.

696
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:32,320
Uh, and, uh, it was, uh,

697
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,050
promoted by GM chairman Charles Wilson.

698
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:36,943
Uh,

699
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:41,780
I visited them recently.

700
00:49:41,781 --> 00:49:45,830
They were in that building
right across the street,

701
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:51,080
what is the Plaza Hotel at the
corner of central park. Um,

702
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,860
and they're, uh, a very
big organization now,

703
00:49:54,861 --> 00:49:59,390
but the thing that GM pension
fund did is it, it invested,

704
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:00,830
it funded.

705
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:08,010
And so they started investing money on
behalf of the pensioners so that if GM

706
00:50:09,191 --> 00:50:13,710
were to ever go bankrupt, they would
still be money in the fund. Uh,

707
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:16,840
and not GM stock.

708
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:19,420
This was the most amazing thing.

709
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:24,770
The people that Ge General Motors was
investing money for its pension fund and

710
00:50:25,571 --> 00:50:28,610
of all things, it wasn't buying
GM stock. Seville thought,

711
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:31,760
why wouldn't they buy their own stock?
They would push the price up,

712
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,810
but of course it's not enlightened to
buy their own stock because that would be

713
00:50:35,811 --> 00:50:39,680
stupid to invest the pension fund in
your own stock because the stock would

714
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:43,730
become worthless in the same circumstance
that you would be unable to make good

715
00:50:43,731 --> 00:50:47,050
on the pension. So it wouldn't
do any good. So it was odd.

716
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:52,110
It seemed obvious that companies should
fund their pension funds and should

717
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:57,230
invest in something other than
their own stock. Uh, and so,

718
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:01,820
uh, uh, that may seem obvious,

719
00:51:01,821 --> 00:51:03,590
but it took until 1950.

720
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:08,710
One thing that strikes me about financial
history is that it seems like we go

721
00:51:08,841 --> 00:51:13,490
for such a long time doing things
that are obviously not right.

722
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,990
Uh, and as long as there is no
crisis, nobody pays attention to it.

723
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:22,640
Then we have this huge crisis,
like the 1929 stock market crash,

724
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:26,480
and then it's an only an after the
crisis that anyone thinks about it.

725
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:31,370
So I don't know what was happening for
the first 30 years of the 20th century.

726
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,690
They had all these pension funds, but the
whole idea seemed to be faulty. Right.

727
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:39,260
Why would you think that your company
can support you in your old age?

728
00:51:39,261 --> 00:51:41,570
That's decades in the future.
You know,

729
00:51:41,571 --> 00:51:45,830
the chance that your company would go
under. It has to be substantial. Uh,

730
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:46,551
but you know,

731
00:51:46,551 --> 00:51:50,240
people don't seem to see these risks
and they don't think about them until

732
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:51,200
there's a big crisis.

733
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,980
That's where I think that we are at an
opportune time right now with another

734
00:51:54,981 --> 00:51:56,090
financial crisis.

735
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:00,050
And it's a time when people might be
willing to think about how to do things

736
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:03,080
differently. Um, so, uh,

737
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:08,230
the next big crisis in pension fund
history was the Studebaker default.

738
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:16,490
1963.
Have you ever heard of Studebaker?

739
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:20,870
No. You were heard of them. They are
made cars. They were one of the big,

740
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:25,880
and how many car makers in
the fifties and sixties?

741
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:29,480
Uh,
you probably still see these on the road,

742
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:34,010
but they're getting quite rare
because that's 45 years ago. Uh,

743
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:39,140
they were big for a while. Uh, anyway,
they, the company went bankrupt,

744
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,770
uh, in 1963. And, uh,

745
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:46,340
now they claimed to have
funded a pension plan.

746
00:52:47,090 --> 00:52:51,680
They were learning from GM and they
were investing a pension plan or their

747
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:56,630
employees in assets that should have
survived the bankruptcy. So they thought,

748
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:59,300
uh,
but uh,

749
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:04,630
after the bankruptcy it found out that
they had underfunded the pension plan.

750
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,113
Okay.

751
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:13,450
That means that they didn't put enough
money to pay what they promised to pay so

752
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:19,820
that while they had it, they just
didn't, they didn't put enough in.

753
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:24,860
So then people started getting angry.
Obviously people at work,

754
00:53:24,861 --> 00:53:28,710
their lives at Studebaker promised that
they were told that they had a funded

755
00:53:28,711 --> 00:53:31,620
pension fund and when they went there,

756
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,370
they found that they got nothing
or at least very much reduced.

757
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:41,490
So people started looking at the union,
the United autoworkers.

758
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,970
Isn't the United auto workers supposed
to stand up for the rights of the men,

759
00:53:47,010 --> 00:53:47,940
the employees,

760
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:52,440
and shouldn't they be looking at the
pension fund and demanding that Studebaker

761
00:53:52,441 --> 00:53:56,250
funded adequately? Well, they were,
they were asleep. They were not,

762
00:53:56,251 --> 00:54:01,251
they were asleep at the switch or some
people accused the UAW of complicity with

763
00:54:01,651 --> 00:54:02,484
Studebaker,

764
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:08,060
that basically the UAW was not paying
attention to the distant future because

765
00:54:09,601 --> 00:54:12,300
they didn't think that
their members really cared.

766
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,480
So you UAW wanted it when they
had negotiations with Studebaker,

767
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:19,860
they wanted big pay increases.

768
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:24,540
Now they didn't care about funding the
pension fund. Why didn't they care? Well,

769
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:28,860
because the workers at Studebaker
didn't know or understand this.

770
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:32,190
And so the workers were
not attuned to this.

771
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:37,191
So the union thrives on getting something
that looks valuable to the employees,

772
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:42,000
but the employees were being deceived so
that both Studebaker and the union were

773
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,730
in it together against
the employees in a sense.

774
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:48,340
So this created a lot of
them anger, uh, about,

775
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,600
about failures of pension funds.
Uh,

776
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,840
I'm talking about financial
crises of years past. Uh,

777
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:00,370
we're going through a
subprime crisis right now. Uh,

778
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:04,450
and this is one of a series.
Every time we have a financial crisis,

779
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:09,790
we make fixes. And so in reaction to
the Studebaker it took, took 10 years,

780
00:55:10,540 --> 00:55:15,540
but the Studebaker default set in law
enforce a dialogue about how pension

781
00:55:16,391 --> 00:55:20,850
should be managed. And that led to, uh,

782
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:25,270
Arista, uh, 1974,

783
00:55:25,271 --> 00:55:29,120
actually 11 years later.
And, uh, Rissa, uh,

784
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,540
stands for employment,

785
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:36,400
retirement income security
act, all right. Employment,

786
00:55:36,401 --> 00:55:41,050
retirement income
Security Act, uh, and, uh,

787
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:46,210
it then required funding.
So it required a

788
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,650
adequate funding.
You know,

789
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,020
Studebaker had a funded pension
plan, but it was under, uh,

790
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:01,480
underfunded.
So that's what Rissa created.

791
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:06,760
Um, and, uh, they also created, uh, the,

792
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,273
uh,

793
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,510
pension benefits guaranty corporation.

794
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:18,210
PBGC this is a government,
uh, core, well, it's,

795
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:22,830
it's a government sponsored
enterprise that, uh,

796
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:27,760
uh, insurers, so pension benefit

797
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,870
guarantee corp

798
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:37,840
the deal is, it's likely federal
deposit Insurance Corporation,

799
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:42,640
which guarantees your bank deposit.
It guarantees ear pension plan.

800
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:47,820
So the PBGC then receives dues from a
pension plans and the pension plans.

801
00:56:50,831 --> 00:56:54,880
Then if they were to fail, uh, would get,

802
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:56,090
uh,

803
00:56:56,090 --> 00:57:00,610
the pensioneers would get
a payment from the PBGC.

804
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:01,780
All right.

805
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:06,780
So the PBGC is supposed to monitor
the funds of pension plans,

806
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:11,220
make sure that they're
adequately funded, and then, uh,

807
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,380
if they are not adequately funded,
then

808
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,430
they would make up the
difference. Uh, now,

809
00:57:18,431 --> 00:57:23,431
ultimately the PBGC has a portfolio of
assets which it accumulates from the fees

810
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:27,100
paid to it by the pension funds.
Uh,

811
00:57:27,730 --> 00:57:32,730
that portfolio of assets might
not be adequate in a huge crisis.

812
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:33,641
Uh,

813
00:57:33,641 --> 00:57:38,560
and so congress might have to
step in to support the PBGC.

814
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,700
Otherwise the PBGC is not
taking taxpayers' money.

815
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:48,390
Recently the PBGC has come under some
attack because after the stock market,

816
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:52,480
it's very hard to know whether a pension
fund is adequately funded or not. Right?

817
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:55,810
Because it all depends on
assumptions about asset prices.

818
00:57:56,320 --> 00:58:00,190
During the run up of stock
market in the 1990s, uh,

819
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:04,210
for firms started cutting back on
the amount they contributed to their

820
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:09,130
retirement funds because the,
the stock market had made them,

821
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:14,620
had made their plans look
very rich. Uh, and so, uh,

822
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:18,700
there are people like me claiming that it
was a bubble and that, so the price is,

823
00:58:18,701 --> 00:58:20,290
we're not going to stay at this level,

824
00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:23,800
but it's kind of hard to
make that prove that point.

825
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:27,030
So companies in the late nineties,
uh,

826
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,200
were not,

827
00:58:29,201 --> 00:58:32,520
they were putting their
money in risky stocks and,

828
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:35,920
and saying they were adequately funded.
Uh,

829
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:39,310
when there were people like
me who are doubting that,

830
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:44,790
and the PBGC being a government
organization didn't protest.

831
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:49,030
I, after the stock market
came down after 2000,

832
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:52,030
it put the PBGC and jeopardy.
Fortunately,

833
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:56,300
the market went back up again and
kind of avail them out. But, uh,

834
00:58:58,510 --> 00:58:59,020
uh,

835
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:04,020
the Erisa act also embodied something
called the prudent person rule.

836
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,130
Actually in 1974,

837
00:59:12,430 --> 00:59:15,920
they called it the prudent man rule.
Uh,

838
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,230
that was because 74 was just before
we tried to use nonsexist language.

839
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:23,570
So the prudent man rule
is now the prudent person.

840
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:27,140
But I'll read what the Arista
said. The act said, um,

841
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:31,340
investments must be made with the care,
skill,

842
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,190
prudence and diligence
under the circumstances.

843
00:59:34,191 --> 00:59:39,191
Then prevailing that a prudent man acting
in a light capacity and familiar with

844
00:59:40,071 --> 00:59:44,870
such matters would use in the conduct
of an enterprise of a light character.

845
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:49,670
And with like ames, well that's lawyer
ease, but basically what they're saying,

846
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,340
the fundamental problem is that even
if you get beyond the deliberate

847
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,020
underfunding of a pension plan,

848
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,880
you still get the possibility that the
pension managers will do something wild

849
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:03,830
like put everything in the stock market.

850
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:07,220
Or they could put leverage investments
in the stock market and they could say

851
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:11,750
we're funded enough because with
this huge, hugely leverage portfolio,

852
01:00:11,751 --> 01:00:15,350
we should have enough money, but
that wouldn't be prudent. Right?

853
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:20,740
And so if the government is guaranteeing
pension plans as they're going, as they,

854
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:25,190
they started doing with the PBGC,
then they've got to prevent that.

855
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:29,720
Uh, and so because they can't let
companies just do wild investments.

856
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:34,130
But this put the government in a funny
circumstance because it was Darren to

857
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:36,410
tell these funds that they,

858
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:41,450
that they had to be doing sensible
investing. But what is sensible investing?

859
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:44,150
It actually,
it was a difficult thing to define.

860
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:47,260
Look at Yale University back in 19,

861
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,670
when David Swensen came to Yale,

862
01:00:50,510 --> 01:00:53,240
most universities put
their money in sensible,

863
01:00:53,241 --> 01:00:57,860
safe government bonds and
stocks were considered risky,

864
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:00,830
but Swenson said, no, let's not do that.

865
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:05,120
Let's put into these strange alternative
investments. And after the fact,

866
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:08,150
he turns out to be right.
Right. Was he not prudent?

867
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:13,190
Do you want to tell investment companies
that they shouldn't do that? It's a,

868
01:01:13,191 --> 01:01:15,170
it's a difficult question.
And the question is,

869
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:19,910
how far should it be pension plan go
in taking on risk risky investments.

870
01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:23,360
So the law created the strange,
prudent person rule,

871
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:28,100
which says that an investment company
should do whatever a prudent person would

872
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,270
do.
Um,

873
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:34,130
and I created an unfortunate
environment for pension fund management.

874
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:38,210
Basically they're telling pension fund
managers do, don't use your own judgment.

875
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:43,050
Do what somebody else would do.
And you manage the portfolio. Uh,

876
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:45,680
right. I mean, that's law. I
mean, you've got to do this.

877
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:50,180
It's in the law as a
manager. Uh, and so, uh, uh,

878
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:55,970
it's a, it's a slippery business
to be in. So, um, I have on the,

879
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:58,430
it's actually, I don't expect you to
go to read this because it's, it's,

880
01:01:58,431 --> 01:02:01,940
it should be in the library,
but Obar and commonly, uh,

881
01:02:02,090 --> 01:02:07,090
wondered how tension funds deal with
this strange situation they're put in.

882
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:11,990
Uh,
so this is oh,

883
01:02:11,991 --> 01:02:16,970
Var and calmly work. One of these, uh,

884
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:20,830
is an anthropologist. So we're getting
a little bit of insight from it.

885
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:23,910
I mentioned I like to take insights
from all the different social sciences.

886
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:29,300
Anthropologists like to go into some
primitive village somewhere in the world

887
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,150
and interview people,
uh,

888
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:36,180
who live in a very different
culture and try to learn about them.

889
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:41,250
And what an anthropologist does.
It goes into some village, uh, and,

890
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,060
uh, it doesn't disturb their,
tries not to disturb their culture,

891
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:47,010
doesn't start explaining things,

892
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:51,960
just listens and tries to understand
how they think it has to learn their

893
01:02:51,961 --> 01:02:53,360
language and listened to their,

894
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:57,800
and presumably to get insights
about human behavior, uh,

895
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:02,810
from the experience of immersing
oneself in some other culture.

896
01:03:03,570 --> 01:03:05,040
Uh, so, uh,

897
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:10,340
these people went to interview a pension
fund managers with the same techniques

898
01:03:11,011 --> 01:03:15,840
that anthropologists use
in a primitive villages.

899
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:21,030
Uh, and, uh, they concluded, uh, that,

900
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:24,310
uh, pension funds, uh,

901
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,430
are there, uh, there, there are
rather critical of pension funds.

902
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:34,260
The pension funds are living in this
strange world created by Arista,

903
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,860
which requires that they
behave as somebody else would.

904
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:43,200
And so it kind of separates them
from any real sense of their mission.

905
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,080
They're regulated so heavily.
Uh,

906
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:53,940
and so what Obara unkindly found is
that they engage people in discussion.

907
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:59,140
They listened to what managers
have pension funds would
say on their own without

908
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:02,640
suggesting that topic of conversation.

909
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:06,240
And what they found was that managers,
uh,

910
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:10,560
we're very much aware of
the prudent person rule, uh,

911
01:04:10,590 --> 01:04:15,180
and that they were always looking
to shift blame, possible blame.

912
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:20,310
They're always thinking of some lawsuit
that they could eventually be embroiled

913
01:04:20,311 --> 01:04:22,440
in. And they, they're always saying, well,

914
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:25,530
this is what a prudent person would do.

915
01:04:25,590 --> 01:04:30,590
They talk a lot about the law and
relatively little about economics or,

916
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:31,980
uh,

917
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:36,540
or the objectives that they're supposed
to have about how do we get to,

918
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:38,760
uh,
the management of a,

919
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:44,630
how do we manage this portfolio to provide
for the benefits to our employees in

920
01:04:44,761 --> 01:04:48,210
the future? Uh, and, uh,

921
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:50,970
it's interesting that as anthropologists,

922
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:55,410
they took note of what anthropologists
have noted in many primitive societies,

923
01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:00,180
that if you let people living
in some isolated culture talk,

924
01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:05,510
they tend to come up eventually
with a creation myth.

925
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:10,530
Okay. So this is the term
the anthropologist, every
primitive society. We can,

926
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:15,090
you can ask them where did it
all start? Right. And they would,

927
01:05:15,180 --> 01:05:20,180
they will generally have a story about
the creation of their little village or

928
01:05:20,951 --> 01:05:22,690
their people,
uh,

929
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:27,800
which involves some great man or God that,
uh,

930
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,980
founded everything. Uh, and there
some story about this person,

931
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:38,280
uh, and, uh, a sense that we are
the chosen people that were the, uh,

932
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:40,220
we have some values are,

933
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:46,060
and it's built around a story of
some great man or woman, I suppose.

934
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:48,790
Uh, but, uh, uh,

935
01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:51,760
what they said is that that's one of
the things they heard most commonly,

936
01:05:51,761 --> 01:05:52,690
the creation myth.

937
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:57,430
So they would say are a pension fund
was started by so and so 40 years ago.

938
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:02,350
And this person had great insights and
we're living in this tradition ever since.

939
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:07,000
Uh, so, um, but, uh, so,

940
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:09,580
uh,
uh,

941
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:16,370
so, uh, anyway, uh,

942
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:20,960
Rissa came in at more or less
the end of an era. There's,

943
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:23,740
there are really two
kinds of pension plans.

944
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,890
There is a defined benefit

945
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,780
and defined contribution.

946
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:43,350
There's a fundamental difference.

947
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:48,710
A defined benefit pension plan
tells you that the pension,

948
01:06:49,201 --> 01:06:52,860
we'll pay you a certain amount.
For example,

949
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,240
I mentioned the very first us
pension from American Express.

950
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:02,600
It promised to pay you 50% of your
average pay for the last 10 years that you

951
01:07:03,301 --> 01:07:06,870
were employed. Okay. So
you were told this, uh,

952
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:10,560
when you started the job
that this was your plan. Uh,

953
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:15,630
and so that define the benefit.
You would get a,

954
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,520
until 1974,

955
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:22,830
virtually all pension plans
were defined benefit. Uh,

956
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:25,500
there were some exceptions,
but it was the overwhelming norm.

957
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:30,950
Labor unions liked defined benefit, it
sounded right to them. But the, the,

958
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:31,980
the contrary,

959
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:37,060
the Chi is called defined contribution
in a defined contribution plan.

960
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:42,450
The pension plan does not promise you
anything about what your retirement income

961
01:07:42,451 --> 01:07:47,010
will be. They merely say that
we are going to contribute your,

962
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,660
a fraction of your salary,
uh,

963
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,920
to a portfolio that will be managed
to provide you income when you retire.

964
01:07:56,670 --> 01:08:01,670
But the amount you get will be
determined by the portfolio and not by,

965
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:05,580
uh, any arbitrary rule.
There's nothing like, you know,

966
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:08,010
50% of the last 10 years of your income.

967
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:14,000
The defined contribution plans
got their biggest impetus in 1981.

968
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:15,831
So that's what,

969
01:08:15,831 --> 01:08:20,831
seven years after a Rissa with the advent
of what was called four o one k plans,

970
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:28,810
four o one k is a paragraph in the
Internal Revenue Service Code Code.

971
01:08:31,131 --> 01:08:31,964
That's the tax.

972
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:37,400
That's the IRS that the agency
of the government that taxes,

973
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:38,510
uh,

974
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:43,510
everyone and rule section
four o one k of the IRS code,

975
01:08:45,110 --> 01:08:47,210
um,
uh,

976
01:08:48,230 --> 01:08:52,580
defined circumstances in which,
uh,

977
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:57,410
money held in trust for others
might not be taxable. Uh,

978
01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:02,000
and in 1981, uh, for the
first time a company,

979
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:02,940
uh,

980
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:07,940
invoked this clause to get asked that
the defined contribution plan that they

981
01:09:08,751 --> 01:09:13,100
were setting up would not be text.
Uh,

982
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:16,370
the, uh, well actually what make it clear,

983
01:09:16,371 --> 01:09:21,371
what it would be is if the employer or
employee made contributions to the plan,

984
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:28,870
then there would be no tax that would
be a tax deduction for the amount of the

985
01:09:29,871 --> 01:09:34,820
contribution until later
after the person retires.

986
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:39,820
It would be taxed many years later as
ordinary income when they received it.

987
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:43,580
But by postponing the tax,
it was a significant tax advantage.

988
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:49,040
So after 1981, there was a
tremendous revolution in our tax,

989
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:53,660
in our pension system because,
uh,

990
01:09:54,230 --> 01:09:55,970
it led, uh, first of all,

991
01:09:55,971 --> 01:10:00,530
people like tax breaks and it sounds
good to get a tax break. But secondly,

992
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:01,613
um,

993
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:05,990
people start unions were declining unions,

994
01:10:05,991 --> 01:10:10,250
which had always advocated
defined benefits were
declining as a force in the u s

995
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:15,050
and people were developing in the United
States more of an investment culture.

996
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:20,480
And they liked the idea that they would
have a defined contribution plan where

997
01:10:20,481 --> 01:10:23,390
there would be a
portfolio which is theirs,

998
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:28,100
which is being invested for the retirement
rather than trust the company to

999
01:10:28,101 --> 01:10:30,260
provide a benefit in retirement.

1000
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:35,590
So the general public showed a strong
preference for defined contribution plans

1001
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,980
after 1981.
And so that is a big force.

1002
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:44,330
The U S was a leader in
defined contribution plans,

1003
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:47,930
but it is now spreading
all over the world. Uh,

1004
01:10:47,931 --> 01:10:51,350
and I think it again reflects
the change in our world culture.

1005
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:56,460
So they're growing in Europe and
uh, and other, I guess Mexico,

1006
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,460
a Chili there.

1007
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:03,700
There's so many of the pension plans
now are of the defined contribution

1008
01:11:04,610 --> 01:11:08,990
variety, even a government
pension plans. So the government,

1009
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:11,630
social security planning Chile,
uh,

1010
01:11:11,631 --> 01:11:15,330
allows you invest for you.
Uh,

1011
01:11:15,331 --> 01:11:18,300
and if there's a portfolio
and you can get on a website,

1012
01:11:18,301 --> 01:11:20,130
I understand I've never done it in Chile,

1013
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:23,460
but you can see what the
balances in your account.

1014
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:27,870
Another thing that defined contribution
plans began to do with the advent of

1015
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:32,871
401k is they would allow you as a
employee or as the pensioner to choose the

1016
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:40,080
general categories of investments.
So they would,

1017
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:44,190
they would typically in a defined
contribution plan, after 1981,

1018
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:49,490
there will be a number of mutual funds
that you could invest your money in.

1019
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,710
And now you couldn't take
it out until you retired.

1020
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:56,970
You could choose which from a
selected list of mutual funds,

1021
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:00,570
you could invest your money.

1022
01:12:00,571 --> 01:12:04,380
And so this helped promote
mutual funds dramatically. Uh,

1023
01:12:04,381 --> 01:12:08,520
and it also created more of an
investment culture in our society.

1024
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:13,890
So, uh, so, uh, that's where we are now.

1025
01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:18,900
Uh, the defined benefit pension
plan is declining rapidly.

1026
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:22,440
Ressa is, it's still not irrelevant
because they're still important,

1027
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:27,600
but a Rissa is becoming less and less
important and we're moving on toward a

1028
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:31,860
country. When you get your first job, the
first thing you will get, I can predict,

1029
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:35,190
will be a four o one k plan. And, uh,

1030
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:39,600
you will probably not be given a,
a defined benefit pension.
