00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.540
Firstly,
I wanted to just do what I forgot to show you.

2
00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.760
I don't know how exciting this is.
Mine,
this is a ticker tape.
Um,

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.380
and uh,
they weren't brown.

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.180
This tape is about a half century old.
Uh,

5
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.990
it came from the attic of the New York Stock Exchange.
Uh,

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.990
when I was at a conference there a year ago,
I mentioned to,

7
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:26.991
I'm the vice president there that I told my class about ticker tape machines and

8
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:30.780
they'd never heard of them,
didn't know what they were.
Let's see.

9
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.730
Some of them had,
so he sent me this,
this is never used.
Uh,

10
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.800
but normally it would go into a machine and it would print out stock prices at

11
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:43.710
trades.
Uh,
but then I,
I was,

12
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.230
I was giving a talk yesterday at the New York stock.
I met him again and I said,

13
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.210
thank you for this.
My class was happy to see him.
And he said,

14
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.260
well,
I could've given you a whole ticker tape machine.
And he said,
well,
he said,

15
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:01.500
well,
the attic at the New York Stock Exchange,
it was filled with them,

16
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:04.870
but they finally threw them out.
So it's too late.
Um,

17
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.890
but I think it is,
this is evidence that,
uh,
that,
uh,

18
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.790
information technology really has dominated stock prices.

19
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.950
We didn't really have active stock markets before the electronic age.

20
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:24.420
It does an interesting thing to think about because the ticker tape machine was

21
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:29.370
invented by Edison in 1867 and in 1867,

22
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.870
there were hardly any,
there were stock markets,
but they were very small.

23
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.660
It was really the electronic communications that made it what it is.
Um,

24
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.230
and uh,

25
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.250
it's exciting to think about the future and where electronic communications is

26
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:49.020
going to take markets,
uh,
going forward.
Uh,

27
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.570
so I wanted to,
uh,
uh,
continue today about a futures markets.

28
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.430
Uh,
let me just step back and think what is a futures market.

29
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.350
And today I'm going to talk about how it has expanded to cover,
uh,

30
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.050
lots of other things,
notably financial,
financial instruments,

31
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.200
but let's just think what is a futures market.
And the,
um,

32
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.680
uh,
if you read Holbrook working,
who's on your reading list,
uh,

33
00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:21.090
and his old half century old paper back in these days and he was writing,

34
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.353
um,

35
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.720
he says that the name futures is a bit misleading because that suggests that

36
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.210
it's talking about the future rather than today.

37
00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.780
But if you listen to the news about any commodity price,
uh,

38
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.270
it's always talking about futures.
Pr.
They don't talk about the price today.

39
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.370
Uh,
and,
uh,

40
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.420
the futures price is the interesting and the point that we're working made.

41
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.290
It's not so much that it's in the future is that it's well defined and

42
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:54.090
standardized.
Uh,
it's on,
uh,
so for agricultural futures,

43
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.770
uh,
it's true that the contract doesn't mature for a month or so.

44
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.470
But,
uh,
as working points out,
you know,

45
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:07.471
any contract for delivery of something has some term they don't deliver it

46
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:08.974
instantly.

47
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.930
And working says there are times when the so-called spot price is actually

48
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:17.120
further in the future,
then the future is priced.
Uh,

49
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.020
and so if you look at the way things are traded for,

50
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.880
I'm going to be talking a lot about oil,

51
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:23.770
but let me just talk generally about oil.

52
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.550
What is the price of oil and how does anybody know what it is?

53
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.860
If you go to people who buy and sell oil,
they will tell you,

54
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.400
well,
we don't just sell oil.
You know,
we don't just have it ready to go.
Uh,

55
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.910
almost all of the oil is sold in longterm contract.

56
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.240
So an oil company will sell a contract to deliver regularly to some,

57
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.370
uh,
refinery,
uh,
oil.

58
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:54.790
They will have these tankers appear and we sign out,
you know,

59
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.600
a five year contract or whatever.
Uh,
and it has all kinds of terms.

60
00:03:58.601 --> 00:03:59.680
If you read the contract,

61
00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:04.090
it'd be 50 pages long and it would specify all kinds of what we'll do if we

62
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:08.290
don't deliver it.
What happens if we can't deliver the grade we promised?

63
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.980
Um,
and you know,
lots of uncertainties or just define.

64
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.020
So who knows what the price of oil is when it's being part of a longterm

65
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.863
contract.

66
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.520
So that's why you need a futures market in the futures market is,

67
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.080
is the market,
uh,
that's free of it has a standardized contract.

68
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.190
And so we know exactly what the price means.
And,

69
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.230
and attention focuses on the futures market because the trade there is,

70
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:37.980
um,
everybody understands it.

71
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.320
Everyone knows exactly what's being traded in the minute to minute changes

72
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.140
reflect something and they reflect something real,

73
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.210
namely that change in the market,
not any change in what's being delivered.

74
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.740
So,
uh,
uh,
so anyway,

75
00:04:53.741 --> 00:04:58.741
it used to be that the only futures markets were for commodities for things

76
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.680
typically that it was thought that futures markets are good to have for things

77
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:08.860
that are not standardized,
that are difficult to define.

78
00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.000
So we want rice futures and we want wheat futures because there's so many

79
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:17.170
different kinds of rice in different areas and different.
And so,
uh,

80
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.880
we want to have a standardized price.
Uh,
and so,
uh,

81
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.670
there were no financial futures until the 1970s.
And people,
uh,

82
00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.020
felt back then that we don't need a futures contracts because,
uh,

83
00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.560
there's a standardization of,
of shares.
Every share,
uh,

84
00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.090
in a given company is exactly identical,
right?
When you say,

85
00:05:40.091 --> 00:05:43.220
I'd like to buy a hundred shares of a company,
a,

86
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.910
you're not going to ask the broker,
well,
which shares did I get?

87
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.470
And can I look at them in the broker would say in disbelief,
look,

88
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.720
you've got shares,
they're all absolutely identical.
Uh,

89
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.020
and so you might think there's no need for a futures,
uh,
because it's,
uh,

90
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.540
prices are already standardized in the cash market.
Moreover,

91
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:06.440
the prices that you see traded on the stock exchange floor,

92
00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.370
you know exactly when the trade took place so they're not future traded.

93
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.480
So why did we get futures markets?
Um,
well let me come back to that.

94
00:06:14.481 --> 00:06:18.320
Let me just first,
why did we get stock futures markets?
The,

95
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:22.310
let me come back to that and talk about just that.
Let's be clear what,

96
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.310
what they are a stock index.

97
00:06:25.311 --> 00:06:29.870
Futures markets came in around 1980.
Uh,

98
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.310
and,
uh,

99
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:36.790
one of the very first was the standard and poor 500 stock index futures market

100
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.130
traded at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Uh,
it,

101
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.540
it was a radical innovation when it came in,
uh,

102
00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.900
because people thought,
what's the point?
You know,

103
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.390
I can see farmers delivering their corn or their oats or whatever,

104
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.610
but stocks,
what's the point?
Well,

105
00:06:58.611 --> 00:07:01.640
it turned out to be absolutely right because,
uh,

106
00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.820
the CME was absolutely right to create this market because within a few years

107
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.270
there was more trade on the futures market than there was on the stock market

108
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:13.790
itself.
So let's be clear what they created.

109
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:17.030
And this is the terms of the contract as it is today.

110
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.660
The S and p 500 is an index of stock prices produced by standard and Poor's

111
00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:27.110
corporation.
Uh,
and it's,

112
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.970
they take the prices of 500 stocks and they form a weighted average.

113
00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.370
It's an arithmetic average,
uh,

114
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:38.000
with the weights correspond to the amounts outstanding of the various stock.

115
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:42.860
So it's evaluated index.
It's just a number published by the,

116
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:45.950
uh,
uh,
American soccer.

117
00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.440
My Standard and poor,
I'm sorry.
Uh,
and all it is at,

118
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:56.390
uh,
just as with,
um,
agricultural futures.

119
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.560
I don't know how clear I was about this yesterday.
If you,

120
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:01.890
maybe I didn't say this.

121
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.320
Let me say anything that applies both to agricultural futures and financial

122
00:08:06.321 --> 00:08:10.490
futures.
If you want to trade in the futures market,

123
00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.780
you have to put up margin.
Okay.
Uh,

124
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.500
and there's a margin requirement for each contract.

125
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.990
That margin is there to eliminate counterparty risk with other contracts.

126
00:08:26.721 --> 00:08:30.070
When you sign a contract with another person,
uh,

127
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:33.830
you have to worry whether that person will come through.

128
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:37.550
But with the exchange it's uh,

129
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.950
that counterparty risk is eliminated.

130
00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:45.250
And the way the exchange eliminates it is it takes the other side itself of

131
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:47.540
every contract.

132
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:52.630
So it stands between you and the counterparty and it protects itself by

133
00:08:53.001 --> 00:08:54.470
demanding margin.

134
00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:00.130
So you a have to upfront put up margin for any futures contract.

135
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:05.280
And the margin is settled daily.

136
00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:11.270
Every day they look at your margin account and they adjusted.

137
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.190
Okay.
So if,
uh,

138
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.220
let me go back to wheat futures because that's the simpler,

139
00:09:17.221 --> 00:09:20.490
I don't think I really explained this well.
If you buy,

140
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:25.080
when we say buy wheat futures,
what does that mean?

141
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:30.590
That means it's the word buy or sell has a different meaning in futures markets.

142
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:35.100
When you buy wheat futures or for that matter s and p 500 futures,

143
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.830
it means that you put up margin,

144
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:42.180
you did not pay the price for the contract.
You only paid margin,

145
00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.440
which might be 5% or less than the price.
Okay,

146
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.540
so if it's a,
uh,
if you're buying wheat futures,
what are you doing?

147
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:56.541
You're putting up margin and standing ready to see your margin account credited

148
00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:02.730
or debited depending on the change in the futures price from day to day.

149
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:08.260
So if the price of wheat in the futures market goes up and you bought futures,

150
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:12.780
they will increase your margin account by the amount that it went up.

151
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.870
And if the price of wheat goes down,

152
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.770
they will decrease your margin account balance by that amount.

153
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.200
How do they get the money?
Well,

154
00:10:22.201 --> 00:10:25.800
that's because for every buyer there's a seller in the futures market.

155
00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.660
So somebody else sold futures.
Both of you put up margin.

156
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.920
If you are buying,
you put up margin,
if you are selling,
he put up margin.

157
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:39.690
And so the result is that they have a place to get the money.

158
00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:45.350
So if the price goes up and you bought your margin account will go up the

159
00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:46.111
exchange.

160
00:10:46.111 --> 00:10:50.880
We'll get the money by taking it from the margin account of the guy who sold and

161
00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:54.210
they've always fixed it so that the number of buyers always equals the number of

162
00:10:54.211 --> 00:10:56.160
sellers.
Okay.

163
00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:00.330
So you see how the exchange can't lose and you can't lose.

164
00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:02.530
This is a guaranteed thing.
Um,

165
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:08.060
the only problem is that what if a margin account runs dry?

166
00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.080
Okay.
So,
uh,

167
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.760
both buyer and seller have put up margin and then the price,

168
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.480
let's say the price drops a lot,
the futures price drops a lot.

169
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.250
Then that means that the,
uh,
the,
the,

170
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:28.470
uh,
the buyer's margin account is wiped out.

171
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.540
What'll happen then is that the future's commission merchant will go to the

172
00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:36.150
person who bought the futures and say,

173
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.710
do you want to post more margin or do you want me to close you out?

174
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.280
Okay.
Uh,
and,
uh,

175
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.240
that person has a decision to make a,

176
00:11:47.241 --> 00:11:49.980
and if he or she puts up more margin,

177
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.370
then that replenishes the margin account and the person can keep trading.

178
00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:55.930
That's,

179
00:11:55.930 --> 00:12:00.930
that's how the exchanges eliminate counterparty risk by daily resettlement of

180
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:05.860
the contracts.
All right,
so it's an invention actually it goes back to Japan,

181
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:07.480
although it's slightly different in form.

182
00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:12.810
It's an invention that eliminates any risk of the counterparty not performing,

183
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.630
so that risk doesn't affect price.
So it's the same,

184
00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.950
I you clear on that now how the margin account work,
you might not enjoy this,

185
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.690
this,
uh,
it depends on how,

186
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.050
how much of a gambling instinct you have or how much fun is it?

187
00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:28.360
If you buy or sell futures,

188
00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.250
you can expect a phone call from your broker as sooner or later.
Well,

189
00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:37.930
not necessarily,
unless you have incredibly good luck.
Um,
so,
uh,

190
00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:41.250
Hillary Clinton,
when she invested in the futures market,
uh,

191
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.630
she had incredibly good luck.
You know this story,
uh,

192
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:49.240
when her husband Bill Clinton was governor,
uh,
she,
um,

193
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:54.630
got a call from a friend recommended to her very good broker who knew how to

194
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:57.100
trade in and commodity futures.

195
00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:02.290
And so she put up something like $1,000,
uh,
of her own money.

196
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.240
Uh,
and then the,
uh,

197
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:09.470
the broker kept calling her and asking her what she wanted to do.
Uh,

198
00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.890
and you know,
she just never lost anything.
She turned it into $100,000,
uh,

199
00:13:14.891 --> 00:13:18.340
within a year.
Uh,
and then she stopped.

200
00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.450
And we don't know why I'm not,
I'm not anti Hillary Clinton.

201
00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:25.750
This is just a futures market story.
I liked her a lot.

202
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.030
But what do you think happened there?

203
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.690
Her margin account just kept going up and up and up.
I mean,

204
00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:36.691
it went up amazingly so you could conclude that she is a brilliant trader and

205
00:13:37.331 --> 00:13:39.370
she ought to be president of the United States.

206
00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:44.700
But then the next question is why did she stop or why did she run it for a

207
00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.350
hundred fold increase in stop?
Anyone have any idea?

208
00:13:47.351 --> 00:13:51.580
What is this common knowledge to this story?
Well,
the story ends there.

209
00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:53.900
Nobody knows what happened.
Uh,

210
00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:59.070
futures traders are willing to exercise a guess of what happened.

211
00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:05.090
Anyone have any guests?
What,
what,
what,
what do you think happened?
Well,
uh,

212
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.570
I shouldn't say things.
So political,
I do like Hillary,

213
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.090
what likely happened is some future's commission.

214
00:14:13.091 --> 00:14:17.600
Merchant was thinking of bribing the governor.
Uh,
maybe he didn't,
you know,

215
00:14:17.601 --> 00:14:19.510
I never actually did it,
but you know,

216
00:14:19.511 --> 00:14:22.480
let's do a little favor for his wife and then maybe I can,

217
00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:26.560
maybe I can ask him for something later.

218
00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:32.100
And so the future is merchant just didn't listen carefully to what she said.

219
00:14:32.261 --> 00:14:33.220
He just,
well,

220
00:14:33.221 --> 00:14:38.221
he sort of cooked the books and gave her money by making it look like a trade.

221
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:45.160
Uh,
and when she found out what,
what finally likely happen is someone said,

222
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.280
do you think you're making so much money in the futures market?

223
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.920
Remember who your husband is and this guy,
do you trust him?
So she might add,

224
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.800
this is a likely guest.
She finally wondered what is going on here?

225
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.770
And she stopped because she didn't know what was happening either.

226
00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:04.210
Somehow money was coming in.
And uh,

227
00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:06.820
so that's the very,

228
00:15:06.821 --> 00:15:10.910
and now maybe she was just very savvy and her investing ability,

229
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
but usually your futures accounts go both up and down and you get margin calls.

230
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:21.950
Uh,
so,
uh,
uh,
anyway,

231
00:15:21.951 --> 00:15:26.070
the last day of the contract,
there was a settlement.
And,
and it,

232
00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:30.200
well in agricultural futures,
the last day there was delivery.

233
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:35.270
If you're still in the contract,
if you are a seller on the last day,

234
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:40.340
you must deliver the specified number of barrels are bushes,

235
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.880
bushels of whatever it is.
Or if you are a buyer,

236
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.950
you must take delivery of them.

237
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
But with stock futures it's different because nobody expects you to deliver

238
00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:53.270
shares of stock.

239
00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:58.630
So what happens on the last day is there's a final settlement,
uh,

240
00:15:58.631 --> 00:16:01.640
and that is in dollars in this case,

241
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.970
250 times the s and p 500 index at the,

242
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.790
on the last day,
minus the futures price,
uh,

243
00:16:12.791 --> 00:16:17.320
of the preceding day.
And that's the settlement.
Uh,

244
00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:22.340
of course you have been gaining the changes in the futures prices every

245
00:16:22.341 --> 00:16:26.060
preceding the,
if you,
this is what you receive as a buyer.

246
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:30.920
If you bought the contract and this is what you pay if you sold the contract.

247
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.030
All right?
And so,
uh,
uh,

248
00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.920
every day between the time you originally bought,
you've been getting,

249
00:16:39.921 --> 00:16:44.780
if you were a buyer,
the change in the futures price and at the end you get this.

250
00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.670
If you sum all those up,

251
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:52.220
all the settlements you got since you bought the contract until the expiration

252
00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:53.054
of the contract,

253
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:58.510
you would be getting the index at time t minus the futures when you bought.

254
00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.540
Okay.
And so that,
that defines it,
right?

255
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.930
Every day you get the change in the future price,

256
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:09.890
those all add up into your margin account.
And on the last day you get this.

257
00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.300
So what does it really you're doing if you could say,

258
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:17.810
and they wouldn't like to say,
put it this way,
at the IX futures exchanges,

259
00:17:17.811 --> 00:17:22.360
they don't like gambling analogies,
but I make ya gambling analogy analogy.

260
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:26.500
It's freely in this course.
It's like placing a bet on the,

261
00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:31.310
on the stock market.
If you think the stock market is going to go up,

262
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:36.380
you buy the futures and if you think it's going to go down,
you sell the futures.

263
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:41.060
If you buy one contract,
how much money do you get?

264
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:46.040
You get in total over the toll interval between the purchase date and the

265
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:47.570
expiration of the contract.

266
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.540
You get the stock minus the initial futures price.

267
00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:55.920
You paid times $250.
Okay.
And that's,

268
00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.550
that's the gamble.
And if you sell,
it's just exactly the opposite.

269
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:07.040
<v 1>So,
uh,
and so,
uh,
now</v>

270
00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.900
<v 0>there's something called fair value and you'll see this talked about a lot in</v>

271
00:18:11.901 --> 00:18:16.610
futures.
This is what the future is.
Price should be okay.

272
00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.460
Uh,
and we talked about it in terms of wheat.

273
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:24.730
Remember the fair value of a wheat futures was equal to the price of wheat today

274
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:31.040
times one plus the interest rate plus the storage costs.

275
00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.050
That was the formula we had last time.
Right?

276
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:38.120
And that was the fair value because we concluded that somebody who is storing

277
00:18:38.121 --> 00:18:40.730
grain has to make their expenses.

278
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:44.600
They have to make the interest cost and they have to make the storage costs.

279
00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.560
So this,
the futures price should be equal to fair value.

280
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.850
It's the same here with stock index futures.

281
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:58.090
The fair value F of a futures contract is equal to the stock price.

282
00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:01.320
<v 1>Uh,</v>

283
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:06.320
<v 0>plus the stock price times the interest rate plus the storage cost and the</v>

284
00:19:07.441 --> 00:19:12.441
storage costs for stocks is negative because it doesn't cost you anything to

285
00:19:13.171 --> 00:19:14.010
start a stock.

286
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.490
We don't even have to store certificates anymore though your name will be held

287
00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:22.170
electronically.
It's negative because you get dividends.

288
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.360
Okay.
And so why is the dividend yield that you get on the stock?

289
00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.720
So our minus why a is the adjustment you have to make,

290
00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.070
but you see this to get from the stock price to fair value.

291
00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:41.690
You see this as the same formula that we had for wheat except that you

292
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:46.750
understand that storage costs or stocks are negative because they pay a

293
00:19:47.991 --> 00:19:51.080
dividend.
So all I've done is I've doubled the way I wrote it before.

294
00:19:51.081 --> 00:19:55.400
It was p times one plus r plus s and the pre preceding lecture.

295
00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:00.560
Now it's p times one plus r minus y because s equals minus y.

296
00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.930
<v 1>But that is,
that's the fair value,
uh,</v>

297
00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:10.720
of a,
of a stock index futures.
And,

298
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:11.920
uh,
hmm.

299
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:17.150
<v 0>Now we said last time that sometimes prices deviate from fair value,</v>

300
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.850
uh,
or maybe they don't,
depending on how you define fair value.

301
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:26.330
But if you define fair value as one plus r plus s where s is just the cost of a

302
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:30.870
warehouse,
then sometimes that formula doesn't work because,

303
00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.560
uh,
we talked about last time at the end of the growing season,

304
00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.380
nobody is storing wheat anymore.
Uh,
and so the,

305
00:20:38.381 --> 00:20:42.950
the wheat market falls into backwardation in the futures price gets low.
Whoa,

306
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:48.280
<v 1>okay.
Uh,
uh,
but,</v>

307
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.210
<v 0>uh,
other than that,
so normally we just being stored.</v>

308
00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:56.830
And so normally wheat prices,
uh,
are essentially equal to fair value,

309
00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:02.080
but stocks are always being stored.
So there's,
there's no,
uh,

310
00:21:02.081 --> 00:21:06.730
it would be unusual to see backwardation in this market would be abnormal

311
00:21:07.150 --> 00:21:08.970
because we're always storing stars.

312
00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.300
That's what we do with them is we hold them dividend yield.
Uh,
uh,

313
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.250
you can have backwardation.
However,

314
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:20.590
if the dividend yield is greater than the interest rate because then the

315
00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:24.580
adjustment would make the futures price below the cash price.

316
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.320
All right.
Otherwise you can't have backwardation in this market.

317
00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:34.060
So price should always equal fair value.
Uh,
uh,

318
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:36.243
so,
um,

319
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:42.510
right now we're in an unusual circumstance where the interest rate and the

320
00:21:44.201 --> 00:21:46.210
dividend yield or about the same,

321
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.840
right now the Fed has cut short term interest rates,

322
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.230
the federal funds rate to two and a quarter percent.

323
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:58.660
That's very close to the dividend yield on the s and p 500.

324
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:04.350
So at this point of time the futures price is very close to the spot price and

325
00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:09.500
so we fair value of calculations are relatively unimportant.
Alright,

326
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:14.500
are there any questions you understand this?
I have a a clipping from,

327
00:22:14.530 --> 00:22:17.820
I took it from yesterday's Wall Street Journal.
Uh,

328
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:21.580
and this is to prove that the Wall Street Journal is still publishing financial

329
00:22:21.581 --> 00:22:25.480
data even though they've cut way back.
Uh,

330
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.190
this used to be a longer interview,

331
00:22:27.191 --> 00:22:32.170
but this is what they have a as of yesterday.
So,
uh,

332
00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.200
now this says the standard and poor 500.
This is under a future's prices,

333
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.390
Chicago Mercantile Exchange,

334
00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:45.100
and they're reminding you that the settlement is 250 times the index,

335
00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.030
and they show two contracts,

336
00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:51.280
one expiring in June and one expiring in December.

337
00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:56.550
Okay.
And these are the prices.
This is the opening price.
Uh,

338
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:57.670
at the beginning of the day,

339
00:22:57.671 --> 00:23:01.120
this is the highest price for the day that the contracts traded.

340
00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:05.800
And this is the lowest price or traded at the day.
And this is the settled price,

341
00:23:05.801 --> 00:23:10.610
which is essentially the last price of the day.
Uh,

342
00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:15.430
okay.
And this is the change in the settle from the preceding day.
Uh,

343
00:23:15.431 --> 00:23:20.230
and this is the open interest.
It's 550,000 contract.

344
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:24.560
Do you understand what all this means?
Uh,

345
00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:27.010
so if you,
uh,
now interesting.

346
00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:30.970
It looks like there's backwardation because the December futures at open is

347
00:23:30.971 --> 00:23:34.930
lower than the June futures,
but I,
I think this must be,
it's not much lower.

348
00:23:34.931 --> 00:23:39.370
I think,
um,
it may have something to do with timing of the trades,

349
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.680
but if you look at the settled price over here,

350
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:47.060
they are almost exactly identical between June and December.
Uh,

351
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.160
and that there is,
it's not backwardation,

352
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:53.120
it's contango the futures price is above the,
uh,

353
00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:57.980
it's going up as the horizon.
It goes out.
So,
uh,

354
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:03.830
uh,
uh,
that,
uh,

355
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.030
that's where we are today.
And they're talking an awful lot about futures,

356
00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:12.980
stock index futures.
Uh,
and so if you,
if you watch CNBC,

357
00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.840
they're always talking about it.
Uh,
and,
uh,
the reason is,

358
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:21.980
is that it's such a big and liquid market.
In fact,

359
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:25.730
the futures market,
s and p futures market,
as I said,

360
00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:29.330
it's gotten bigger than the,
than the stock market itself,

361
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:33.980
at least at certain times.
Uh,
it's also just a more trustworthy number,

362
00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:39.440
uh,
and it's,
it moves faster.
So it's,
it's gotten very,

363
00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.110
um,
uh,
a great deal of attention.

364
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:47.710
Why does the futures market moves so fast and why is it such a popular

365
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.540
instrument?
Uh,

366
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:55.700
I think that the main reason is that it is a market that,

367
00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:56.913
um,

368
00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:02.380
it's like a wholesale market for antiques rather than the local antique dealer.

369
00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:04.011
Okay.

370
00:25:04.011 --> 00:25:08.600
So if you went to an antique dealer in new haven to try to buy some furniture

371
00:25:08.601 --> 00:25:12.740
for your apartment,
uh,
who knows what price you'd get,
right?

372
00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.690
It would be very erratic.
Uh,
and you'd be dealing with one on one with a dealer.

373
00:25:17.691 --> 00:25:21.590
Well,
that's what happens in the future.
It's in the,
in the stock market as well.

374
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.890
Uh,
so,
uh,

375
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:28.670
remember I was telling you that a dealer has to have a bid ask spread of an

376
00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.010
antique dealer.
They,
they,
they,

377
00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:35.720
they'll buy the chest of drawers at a lower price,
then they'll sell it.

378
00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.770
And the difference between bid and ask is there bid ask spread.

379
00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:41.720
And that's their profit.
Uh,

380
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:46.930
dealers have to keep a wide bid aspirin because they have a lot of expenses and

381
00:25:46.941 --> 00:25:47.830
they have the risk of,

382
00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:52.310
of being ripped off by more knowledgeable people who really know antiques and

383
00:25:52.311 --> 00:25:55.190
will buy their best stuff and leave behind the junk.

384
00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:58.220
And because they're constantly exposed to this risk,

385
00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.840
antique dealers keep wide bid,
ask spreads.
Uh,

386
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.830
so it's the same with the stock market.
The people,

387
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.030
this specialist or the,
uh,

388
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:14.050
dealers who trade on the stock market with customers have the same concerns.

389
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:17.390
So they keep relatively wide bid ask spreads.

390
00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:21.110
But in the futures market there is,
it's cleaner,

391
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.630
there's a huge volume of trade,

392
00:26:23.631 --> 00:26:28.631
it's very competitive and there's less fear about being ripped off by someone

393
00:26:29.391 --> 00:26:32.510
who has special knowledge because who knows what this index is going to do

394
00:26:32.511 --> 00:26:37.370
anyway.
So dealers have narrow bid ask spreads in the futures market.

395
00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:41.960
Alright.
And,
and as a result,
the futures market is where the action is.

396
00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:46.370
Uh,
and so the people who doubted that back in 1980,

397
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.060
who doubted that financial futures would ever take off.
We're really wrong.

398
00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.420
Even though stocks are perfectly standardized,

399
00:26:54.421 --> 00:26:58.030
every share is the same as every other.
Share the,
uh,

400
00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.880
we do need a futures market.
Uh,
and so the future's market,

401
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.880
uh,
is,
is very important.

402
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:11.640
Uh,
anyway,
I wanted to talk about,
or is there any questions about oil,

403
00:27:11.670 --> 00:27:16.590
about stock futures?
I went through it kind of quickly,
but it is a,

404
00:27:16.591 --> 00:27:20.700
um,
the important thing though is just to understand fair value.

405
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.830
It's actually a very simple market to understand.
Once you know this formula,

406
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:29.490
you pretty much know the price for any future date.

407
00:27:29.790 --> 00:27:34.790
Remember the r again as in the preceding lecture is not the annual interest rate

408
00:27:35.551 --> 00:27:40.460
unless we're talking about a contract that matures in one year.
Uh,

409
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:45.600
it's the interest between now and expiration date.

410
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.310
Okay.
Uh,
and the same thing with dividends.

411
00:27:50.311 --> 00:27:53.910
This is the dividend yield where we're not talking about annual dividend yield,

412
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:59.240
but the dividends as a fraction of the price between now and maturity of the

413
00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:04.140
contract.
And so that's the only formula that we really need.

414
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:06.420
Uh,
so let's think of it.

415
00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.680
The stock index futures market is where you really look to see where the stock

416
00:28:10.681 --> 00:28:11.520
market is moving.

417
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:17.780
It's faster than the stock price index itself that the SNP publishes.

418
00:28:18.151 --> 00:28:23.151
The S and p 500 is a little bit behind the thing that's trading on.

419
00:28:23.761 --> 00:28:25.100
And why is that?
Well,

420
00:28:25.101 --> 00:28:30.101
it's because some of the stocks in the s and p 500 index don't trade really

421
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:34.860
minute by minute with the same speed that you think.
Uh,
and,
uh,

422
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:40.260
and so the s and p 500 is always catching up on itself,
the actual index.

423
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:44.000
But this market has all the smartest traders trading it,

424
00:28:44.001 --> 00:28:47.540
and they kind of know when the s and p 500 is lagging.
And so they,

425
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.830
they immediately corrected in the futures price.

426
00:28:49.831 --> 00:28:54.450
So the future is priced is the place to look for what the stock market is really

427
00:28:54.451 --> 00:28:59.340
doing.
Um,
or I'll move to oil future,

428
00:28:59.341 --> 00:29:04.050
which is a matter of great interest right now because of the turmoil and the oil

429
00:29:04.051 --> 00:29:08.660
market.
Uh,
and oil futures actually go back,
uh,

430
00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:11.860
they're not so old either.
Uh,

431
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.290
compared to wheat or corn they developed in the early 1980s.

432
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.740
Um,
do I have,

433
00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:24.800
<v 2>yeah.</v>

434
00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.270
<v 0>Uh,
so,</v>

435
00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:28.630
<v 2>okay.</v>

436
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:32.650
<v 0>This is the Nymex oil futures market.</v>

437
00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:37.360
Uh,
and,
um,
there are many futures markets for oil,

438
00:29:37.361 --> 00:29:40.900
but the Nymex is the most important one.
And they are,

439
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:46.960
this is different.
It's a physical delivery,
oil futures market,

440
00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:51.310
no different from the agricultural futures.
So,
uh,

441
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.080
they define a particular grade of oil and,
uh,

442
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.960
they call it light sweet crude oil.

443
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:04.940
Sweet oil is better than sour oil.
Uh,
I wouldn't try tasting it,
but,

444
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:10.210
uh,
the refiners like it better.
Uh,
generally.

445
00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:15.400
Uh,
and so it's a grade of oil or it's also called West Texas intermediate.

446
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:18.950
Uh,
and you have to,
if you,

447
00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:24.330
if you buy a contract and you hold it to maturity,

448
00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:30.060
you are going to have to take delivery of 1000 barrels of light sweet crude oil

449
00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.970
in Cushing,
Oklahoma,
and they picked Cushing.

450
00:30:36.971 --> 00:30:39.700
Oklahoma is kind of central to the country,

451
00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:44.620
so you could call your broker and buy a contract today.
Uh,
and then,

452
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.670
uh,
you could get the May contract.
Uh,

453
00:30:48.671 --> 00:30:53.671
and then in May you'd have to take a trip down to Cushing and get your 1000

454
00:30:53.951 --> 00:30:58.460
barrels a,
or you could sell in the futures market.
Uh,

455
00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:00.070
and that would mean that you would have,

456
00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:04.930
you would be promising to deliver 1000 barrels.
As I said last time,

457
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:10.110
almost nobody who trades these contracts actually takes delivery or makes,

458
00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.120
uh,
delivery,
uh,

459
00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:17.230
because almost everyone closes out their contract before that.
Uh,

460
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:21.540
but,
um,
so,
uh,
uh,

461
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.920
but it's the same idea as all the other oil contracts.
Uh,

462
00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:29.990
so you,
uh,
uh,

463
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:34.330
you have contracts maturing and each month is one.
We're already,

464
00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:38.530
we've already passed the expiration of the April contract.
Uh,

465
00:31:38.531 --> 00:31:43.330
so it's made June,
July,
August,
etc. Uh,
and uh,

466
00:31:43.331 --> 00:31:47.020
this is the price there.
These are,
uh,
well actually the,

467
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:51.400
they make a distinction between last and settle.
The settled prices,

468
00:31:51.401 --> 00:31:52.930
the important price,

469
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:58.150
because that determines the changes in your margin account.
So the,
uh,

470
00:31:58.270 --> 00:32:00.340
settled price,
uh,
as,
uh,

471
00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:05.020
yesterday reached $113 and 44 cents per barrel,

472
00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:10.040
uh,
which is a record high.
Uh,

473
00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:11.530
uh,

474
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:16.330
and you can see that as delivery dates go out,

475
00:32:17.050 --> 00:32:19.540
the uh,
settled price goes down.

476
00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:23.860
So the oil market is currently in backwardation.

477
00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:25.443
All right?

478
00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:30.900
Now remember what we said about futures is that normally they're in contango.

479
00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:36.840
Remember the futures price fair value tends to equal the price today times one,

480
00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.060
plus the interest plus storage costs.
Okay.

481
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:45.620
Storage costs for oil are substantial.
This is a thick,

482
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:49.250
bulky commodity.
You've got to have one of those storage tanks.

483
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:53.380
You see them out there and new haven harbor,
they cost money.
Uh,

484
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:58.190
it's expensive to store.
So storage costs are not negligible for oil.

485
00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:00.500
Plus interest rates are positive.

486
00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:05.300
So we would think that oil should have contango.

487
00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:07.610
Normally it should price,
it should be going up,

488
00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:13.030
but very frequently oil is not in contango and right now it is not.

489
00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.000
You can see that oil prices are lower by October according to the futures

490
00:33:20.091 --> 00:33:22.530
market.
Uh,

491
00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.740
and so I wanted to reflect a little bit on what oil,
uh,

492
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:32.330
what,
what is going on in the oil market.
Um,

493
00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:38.150
and the thing you have to understand in terms of what you understand the

494
00:33:38.151 --> 00:33:40.580
contract,
it's exactly the same as a week contract.

495
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:44.840
It's just a contract to deliver a thousand barrels or receive it.

496
00:33:44.841 --> 00:33:48.530
And if you do that,
you don't have to come up with oil today.

497
00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.000
You've probably never come up with her.

498
00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:54.290
You'd have to come up with margin today and your margin account will reflect the

499
00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:58.340
change in oil prices.
This is the number you see in the newspaper.

500
00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:03.140
This is when they talk about the price of oil in the newspaper.
This is it.

501
00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:08.150
Uh,
there's also something called Platts,
which is a company that,
uh,

502
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:13.010
I guess it's a Mcgraw Hill company that,
that does cash prices of oil,
but,

503
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.480
uh,
it's,
uh,

504
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:19.700
it's not coded as much because I don't think it's as reliable as this.
Uh,

505
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:24.110
the problem with,
uh,
with,
uh,
uh,

506
00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:28.190
you might say this is a month in the future,
uh,

507
00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:31.070
isn't that it,
that's not today's price,

508
00:34:31.071 --> 00:34:35.030
but that's what people are coding as today's price because it's the most

509
00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:37.770
accurate price.
Uh,

510
00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:43.030
and so now why is it going into backwardation?
Uh,

511
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:47.150
so I wanted to think about storage of oil because we were saying that everything

512
00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:51.140
should be generally in contango.
Um,
isn't,

513
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.560
aren't they storing oil?
As I said,
if you drive out to new haven harbor,

514
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.170
you see all these storage tanks and don't they have oil?
And,
um,

515
00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:02.990
uh,
and so I wanted to think a little bit about where the oil is.

516
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.400
Most of the oil is still on the ground,
uh,
in,
uh,
you know,

517
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:11.160
in the Persian Gulf and Mexico and Russia and places.

518
00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.590
But we don't count that as storage of oil because it has to be extracted and

519
00:35:15.591 --> 00:35:19.670
it's not just there for a sale.
There's a,
there's a lag.

520
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.290
So we have to consider oil that's above ground and ready to go.
Uh,

521
00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:28.730
and so it is stored and it's stored here in new haven.
Uh,
in fact,

522
00:35:28.731 --> 00:35:32.750
the government of the United States has created what they call a strategic

523
00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:37.840
petroleum reserve and it has taken oil and it's storing it in caverns,

524
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.903
in caves.

525
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.590
And this is in case of a national emergency where we've suddenly really need
oil.

526
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.580
Uh,

527
00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:49.580
but that isn't going to affect this market because it's being held by the

528
00:35:49.711 --> 00:35:54.030
government for some war or some terrible event and it's not on the market.

529
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:57.210
So that doesn't affect,
uh,
the,

530
00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:01.200
even though the market is in backwardation and the government is not going to

531
00:36:01.201 --> 00:36:05.010
sell off this oil,
uh,
so it's not affecting the market.

532
00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:10.640
The other thing that's happened is there's a heating oil reserve and this was

533
00:36:10.891 --> 00:36:15.510
created by President Clinton,
uh,
uh,
in,
uh,

534
00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:19.950
in the year 2000.
And that is actually in two places.
It's in New York.

535
00:36:19.951 --> 00:36:24.860
And New Haven.
So we,
we are the storage place for heating oil.
Uh,

536
00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:27.720
and this is not a strategic petroleum reserve,

537
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:31.740
but it's the reserve that the government can use to stabilize the heating oil

538
00:36:31.741 --> 00:36:32.131
market.

539
00:36:32.131 --> 00:36:36.960
They were concerned about spikes and heating oil affecting people who are in

540
00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:42.120
difficult economic circumstances.
So that reserve,
uh,

541
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.750
could,
uh,

542
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:46.830
could ultimately affect the market if the government chooses to sell it off.

543
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:51.180
Uh,
but they only have 2 million barrels,
so it's not big.

544
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:55.800
I think the first thing to recognize about the oil market is that there isn't

545
00:36:55.801 --> 00:36:59.410
much storage compared to the,
uh,

546
00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.790
flow through basically what we have in oil.

547
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.140
As we have those wells all over the world pumping oil,

548
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:09.000
they put it into tankers,

549
00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:14.190
the tankers take it across the ocean to various countries where it goes into

550
00:37:14.191 --> 00:37:18.270
temporary storage at harbors,
but it doesn't stay there long.

551
00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:21.780
It keeps flowing through and then it puts,
put on oil trucks and it's driven.

552
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:27.030
It's different.
The refinery,
he's,
and then,
uh,
and it ends up in the gas stations.

553
00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.960
Uh,
so,
uh,
there's not a lot of oil in storage.

554
00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:36.560
And so that's why the oil market is very often in backwardation because the

555
00:37:37.201 --> 00:37:42.060
price of oil reflects the temporary scarcities of oil.
Uh,

556
00:37:42.061 --> 00:37:46.120
and if there's any shortage of oil,
if something happens,
then,
uh,

557
00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:51.000
the oil price can jump up.
Uh,
and everybody knows it's going to come back down.

558
00:37:51.001 --> 00:37:52.460
And so it,

559
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:57.160
so you can have backwardation basically you don't have,
uh,

560
00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:01.470
people selling off their stores when there's a backwardation like we talked

561
00:38:01.471 --> 00:38:04.770
about last time,
it's not like at the end of the harvest,

562
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:09.890
people know when the wheat harvest is coming and people know that wheat prices

563
00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:13.320
should go down and they sell off the stores.
It's not like that.

564
00:38:13.321 --> 00:38:17.100
Here are the stories that we have of oil are,

565
00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.290
have a convenience yield.
Uh,

566
00:38:19.291 --> 00:38:24.291
and so there it's something that doesn't backwardation doesn't quickly correct

567
00:38:25.471 --> 00:38:26.304
itself.

568
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:31.430
So I think that what this means here is backwardation in the oil market is that

569
00:38:31.651 --> 00:38:33.600
people think that oils have spiked up,

570
00:38:33.601 --> 00:38:37.720
there's a temporary shortage and that prices are going to come down somewhat,

571
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:43.030
although not a whole lot here.
Um,
uh,

572
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:48.100
this is,
uh,
uh,
a futures term structure.

573
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.760
I haven't plotted for a number of years.
Uh,

574
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:54.460
and I should have made this a little bigger.
It's a little hard to read,

575
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:59.470
but this is today.
Uh,
so what this is,

576
00:38:59.471 --> 00:39:04.471
is for all of these are from today's news all on this top line.

577
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:10.350
And what it shows is for every maturity out to six years what the futures price

578
00:39:11.531 --> 00:39:16.360
is.
So right now we're at $114 a barrel.
Uh,

579
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.910
but the market is predicting a decline,

580
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:24.570
not a whole huge decline that back to something like $108 a barrel in six years.

581
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:31.740
Uh,
and uh,
you can see that,
uh,
um,

582
00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:37.410
the futures market has often been predicting either increases or declines and

583
00:39:38.471 --> 00:39:40.180
you can look at different times in history.

584
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.890
A particular interest here I have Hurricane Katrina,
uh,

585
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:49.920
and uh,
I can't,
uh,
right,

586
00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:54.920
this is December.
This is Hurricane Katrina.
Uh,

587
00:39:55.630 --> 00:40:00.630
and so,
uh,
right after the hurricane,
uh,
in,
um,

588
00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.030
in,
uh,
August of 2005,

589
00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:09.660
the hurricane destroyed some of our refining capability and some of our storage

590
00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:15.540
tanks could because New Orleans is a oil center were tankers come and they go,

591
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.360
they go up the Mississippi River.
Uh,

592
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:24.460
and so we destroyed the hurricane,
destroyed a part of our infrastructure.

593
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:29.080
So everybody in the market knew that that means that oil prices are temporarily

594
00:40:29.081 --> 00:40:33.310
high.
And so you can see the,
the backwardation in the market,

595
00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:37.360
but we see even more backwardation right today.
So that,
that's,

596
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:42.390
that's an indication that there's something going on in the short run in our

597
00:40:42.641 --> 00:40:46.310
market.
If you believe the market,
uh,

598
00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:50.830
what do I have?
I have here,
this goes way back.

599
00:40:50.831 --> 00:40:55.300
This one is 1990 and he knows it stops after 18 months.

600
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:59.230
That's because in 1990,
the futures market wasn't as developed as it is.

601
00:40:59.231 --> 00:41:03.850
Not only went out 18 months,
but you can see there was strong backwardation.

602
00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:08.620
Uh,
this was when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.

603
00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.240
Uh,
and,
uh,

604
00:41:10.241 --> 00:41:14.620
it caused tremendous disruption of oil supply and everybody knew that's

605
00:41:14.621 --> 00:41:17.680
temporary.
And so the future's price were lower.

606
00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:22.480
That was about the most backward dated futures market we've seen in oil.

607
00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.420
Oh,
today it's pretty backwardated so,

608
00:41:25.421 --> 00:41:30.290
but not so not as dramatically percentage wise.
It was after Katrina.
Um,

609
00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.960
this is a plot of,
uh,
oil prices,
uh,
in the United States.

610
00:41:35.961 --> 00:41:38.660
This is West Texas intermediate.
Uh,

611
00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:42.560
well actually I'm not sure it's all the way back.
Is West Texas?
No,

612
00:41:42.561 --> 00:41:47.150
it's not all the way back with cause Texas oil wasn't discovered until around

613
00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:50.390
1900,
I think.
I'm not sure about that date exactly.

614
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:54.830
This is Pennsylvania oil back here.
I've got it going way back.

615
00:41:55.550 --> 00:42:00.110
Uh,
but the interesting thing about this,
this is of interest at the moment.

616
00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:04.040
The oil prices now are higher than they've ever been.

617
00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:09.050
And this is in real terms,
a real inflation correct in terms.

618
00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:14.150
Uh,
so very interesting what this means for our lives.

619
00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:18.770
Uh,
just 10 years ago,
oil was at a record low,

620
00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:22.370
uh,
that,
uh,
we were,
uh,

621
00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:27.080
like a little over $10 a barrel.
So what is going on here?

622
00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:30.050
We've seen the oil price jump up something,
uh,

623
00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:34.070
close to 10 fold in 10 years.
Uh,

624
00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:38.420
it's a huge surprise.
Uh,
so,
uh,

625
00:42:38.421 --> 00:42:41.780
but there are other support.
One thing I wanted to do was to go through,

626
00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.560
uh,
just a few,
um,

627
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:52.700
uh,
see where am I going to go here?
Uh,

628
00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:56.320
go through a few stories about oil prices here.
I,

629
00:42:56.990 --> 00:43:01.160
this was a period when oil was stable,
generally very stable.
Uh,

630
00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:04.210
in the post World War II period.
Uh,

631
00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.030
there was a Texas railroad commission that was stabilizing oil prices.

632
00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.880
At that time.
The US was not a big importer of oil.

633
00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.080
We had our own oil supply.
And,
uh,
we,
uh,

634
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:18.330
we tended to,
uh,
uh,
we,

635
00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:22.700
we had a sort of a monopoly that tried to stabilize the price and they were

636
00:43:22.701 --> 00:43:27.050
pretty successful for this long time period.
The huge shock came,

637
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:29.300
and this is called the first oil shock.

638
00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.500
And that was in 1973 74,
uh,

639
00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:39.910
oils,
oil went up.
It went up more than doubled,
right?

640
00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:44.600
That's like almost three times increase in oil price all of a sudden.
Uh,

641
00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:48.890
and that was associated with,
uh,
uh,
with the particular,

642
00:43:48.891 --> 00:43:51.290
it's called the first oil crisis.
Uh,

643
00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:56.440
and it coincides with the Yom Kippur war between Israel and her Arab neighbors.

644
00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:01.310
Uh,
and it caused the,
uh,

645
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:04.160
Israel quickly triumphed in that war,

646
00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:09.940
but it left a lot of bad feelings among the surrounding Arab Arab countries who

647
00:44:10.251 --> 00:44:12.740
were sympathetic with the Palestinian cars.

648
00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:18.110
And so they cut back on their oil production.
We have,

649
00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:22.790
um,
a,
uh,
an organization called OPEC.

650
00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:26.000
Uh,
so,
uh,
this is,
uh,

651
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:29.540
you can see this oh pack,

652
00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:35.930
that's the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and it was established

653
00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:39.540
in 1960

654
00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.680
with a small number of Arab countries,

655
00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.620
but they've grout gradually grown and has more and more,

656
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:51.950
<v 1>uh,
more and more,
uh,
uh,</v>

657
00:44:53.260 --> 00:44:54.400
<v 0>countries that are members.</v>

658
00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:59.080
So it was oh pack that construct constrained the supply of oil for the first oil

659
00:44:59.081 --> 00:45:03.820
crisis.
This is the second oil crisis here.
And that was,

660
00:45:03.821 --> 00:45:07.570
um,
in,
um,
1979 80.

661
00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.920
And this again,
had its origin,
at least the common story.

662
00:45:11.921 --> 00:45:13.600
And it must be some truth to this story.

663
00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:17.780
It had its origin in another crisis in the Middle East.
Uh,

664
00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:22.330
and that was the war between Iraq and Iran.
Uh,

665
00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.640
and so,
uh,
uh,

666
00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:30.180
there was a Iranian revolution in 1979 where the Shah of Iran was thrown out and

667
00:45:31.691 --> 00:45:34.600
the Ayatollah Khomeini came in Iraq.

668
00:45:34.601 --> 00:45:39.220
Use this as an opportunity to try to grab some oil from Iran.

669
00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:44.680
This war completely disrupted oil supplies and we had this huge spike in oil

670
00:45:44.681 --> 00:45:47.920
prices then,
uh,
and,

671
00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.113
<v 1>uh,</v>

672
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.670
<v 0>a lot of these spikes seem to have political causes.</v>

673
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:57.910
This spike in the oil price is caused by the 1991.

674
00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.530
A invasion of the,
uh,

675
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:05.990
the United States was the primary inventor of Iraq.

676
00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:11.210
This was after September 11th.
Uh,
and this,
uh,
uh,

677
00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:13.670
disruptive oil supplies,
again,

678
00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.690
all of these times were periods of backwardation in the oil market because

679
00:46:17.691 --> 00:46:22.691
people saw them as crises that was limiting the supply of oil for now,

680
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:28.600
but would eventually correct itself.
Um,

681
00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:31.730
uh,
so,
uh,

682
00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:32.850
<v 1>yeah,</v>

683
00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:37.530
<v 0>so what's happening now?
This is just an amazing spike of oil right now.</v>

684
00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:41.070
There isn't,
I mean,
we have this war in Iraq,

685
00:46:41.071 --> 00:46:44.180
but it's not sudden intense thing that,
uh,

686
00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:47.640
it's not disrupting oil supplies.
Uh,

687
00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:51.360
so why are we seeing this huge spike in oil?

688
00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.820
And that is an interesting question.

689
00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:59.060
Part of it has to do with the fact that we have a rapidly growing world economy

690
00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:05.490
and developing countries are moving forward faster than was anticipated.

691
00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:08.370
So there's a lot of demand for oil from India,

692
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.600
China and other rapidly developing countries.
Um,

693
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:19.160
so they say that,
uh,
China,
uh,
builds a new city the size of Houston,

694
00:47:19.161 --> 00:47:23.320
Texas every month.
And so,
uh,
uh,

695
00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:27.280
they are consuming an awful lot of energy to do this.
Um,

696
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:32.380
the other side of it is,
uh,
discoveries of oil have been disappointing.

697
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.380
So I was just down in Mexico,
uh,

698
00:47:35.381 --> 00:47:40.381
and the President Calderon is talking about privatizing the Mexican oil or this

699
00:47:41.471 --> 00:47:46.180
part of it,
uh,
oil industry because have been disappointing,
uh,

700
00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.940
in their exploration I had,
they're not finding oil.

701
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:53.560
So the reserves that Mexico has has been actually declining rapidly.

702
00:47:54.090 --> 00:47:56.510
Um,
and uh,
oh,

703
00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:59.410
this brings up another thing about the ownership of all hell.

704
00:47:59.411 --> 00:48:03.250
I just wanted to mention,
uh,
nationalization.

705
00:48:04.290 --> 00:48:07.170
Uh,
it used to be that,
uh,

706
00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:12.460
most of the oil in the world was owned by private companies or individuals,

707
00:48:12.970 --> 00:48:17.970
but a nationalization began in 1938 in Mexico where a left leaning government

708
00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:27.370
defined.
It decided that all the oil,
uh,

709
00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:31.840
Mexican oil that was owned by foreigners really belonged to the Mexican people.

710
00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:37.150
Uh,
and so,
uh,
the Mexican government just said it's hours.

711
00:48:37.151 --> 00:48:40.520
That was an outrageous thing to say then.
But,
uh,

712
00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:45.400
it was greeted by shock about international law.

713
00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:50.110
Uh,
they just took the oil in their country saying that it wasn't fair that way.

714
00:48:50.111 --> 00:48:51.380
It was so,
uh,

715
00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:56.700
it was followed up by in 1951 by Iran and other countries followed as well.

716
00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:04.720
Uh,
but now we're seeing a reverse.
So it,

717
00:49:04.721 --> 00:49:07.420
Mexico nationalize its oil in 1938,

718
00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:12.470
but now that the supply is dwindling,
the president called her own,

719
00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:16.300
wants to reverse the process.
This is controversial now,
uh,

720
00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:20.620
in,
in yesterday's newspaper.
And if you read the Wall Street Journal,

721
00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:23.410
it had a story saying that,
uh,

722
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:28.470
Russian for the first quarter of 2008 Russian production of oil declined for the

723
00:49:29.651 --> 00:49:31.000
first time in 10 years.

724
00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:34.810
And there's worry now that Russia is running out of oil.

725
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:39.640
So I think it's these,
uh,
this,
uh,
impact of,

726
00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:44.410
of news like this is having a psychological effect on the market and it's

727
00:49:44.411 --> 00:49:49.300
causing a huge robot.
You might consider it as a bubble in oil prices,
uh,

728
00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:54.140
but I'm not so sure that it's available.
Uh,
it's,
uh,

729
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:57.040
it's certainly unprecedented.

730
00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:00.940
It seems like we're entering a period of great market volatility.

731
00:50:00.941 --> 00:50:05.941
We've seen an unprecedented bubble in home prices and now the economy is reeling

732
00:50:07.961 --> 00:50:11.260
from this,
from the effects of this bubble.

733
00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:15.550
But look what's happening as well in oil prices.
And once again,

734
00:50:15.551 --> 00:50:17.050
there's no war right now.

735
00:50:17.051 --> 00:50:21.100
There's nothing really dramatic how well we do have,
you know,

736
00:50:21.790 --> 00:50:23.680
you make,
you could call it a war,

737
00:50:23.681 --> 00:50:27.440
but it's not something that has shut down the Persian Gulf,
uh,

738
00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:32.240
and closed off oil supplies.
So it seems like it's something,
uh,

739
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:36.470
something more,
um,
uh,
systemic.

740
00:50:36.471 --> 00:50:41.330
It's something more to do with the economic situation then before or it's

741
00:50:41.331 --> 00:50:42.530
something speculative.

742
00:50:43.650 --> 00:50:45.570
<v 1>Uh,
and um,</v>

743
00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:51.130
<v 0>we have,
so we,
we have backwardation but it's not a whole lot of backwardation.</v>

744
00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:56.680
They're still predicting oil prices to come down to something like,
they're like,

745
00:50:57.010 --> 00:51:00.660
well over a hundred in eight years.
So it's not,
uh,

746
00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:02.240
it's not a,
um,

747
00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:08.410
it's not something that's related to a particular crisis that,

748
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:15.460
uh,
that is going to end quickly.
Uh,

749
00:51:15.461 --> 00:51:20.140
so I wanted to go,
I,
uh,
this is,
uh,
this just as a clipping I got from,

750
00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:23.210
uh,
this is the day that,
uh,

751
00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:27.370
Saddam Hussein announced an oil embargo.
Uh,

752
00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:31.150
this was in his reaction to the United States,

753
00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:37.290
<v 1>um,
uh,
pressure on him.
Uh,
and so,</v>

754
00:51:37.291 --> 00:51:39.900
uh,
oil prices spiked up.

755
00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.030
<v 0>It seems dramatic.
When I made this clipping.</v>

756
00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:48.220
Now oil is $100 a barrel.
You know,
that's just only,
that's only what,

757
00:51:48.370 --> 00:51:50.980
six years ago.
But at that time,

758
00:51:50.981 --> 00:51:55.960
people thought the market thought that oil prices were coming back down by oh

759
00:51:55.961 --> 00:52:00.940
three,
they were really wrong.
If people didn't get it all this time,

760
00:52:00.941 --> 00:52:03.530
people thought that oil,
they,
you know,

761
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:05.980
a large part of the time it was in backwardation,

762
00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:09.880
they thought that there's some special event occurring.
This is Saddam Hussein.

763
00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:15.070
Uh,
but it turns out that there was something driving it up.
This is again,
oh,

764
00:52:15.071 --> 00:52:17.110
this is natural gas on that same date.

765
00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:21.220
This is still in contango because the prices are going up to time.

766
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:25.420
So that kind of explains that if Saddam Hussein was selectively hitting on the

767
00:52:25.421 --> 00:52:30.190
oil market and not the natural gas market explains those two markets.

768
00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:35.330
I want to talk briefly about other futures.
There's a gold futures market,
uh,

769
00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:39.550
and the gold futures market.
Uh,
this is a clip and old clipping I had of it.

770
00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:43.930
It's a very steady contango market.

771
00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:48.970
That's because gold is very different from oil.
Gold is in storage.

772
00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:54.200
Uh,
there's nothing to do with gold.
I said,
hold it.
You don't burn it.

773
00:52:54.201 --> 00:52:56.380
That's a different oil.
You burn it and it's gone.

774
00:52:56.590 --> 00:52:58.840
So we don't have much around and we're,

775
00:52:58.841 --> 00:53:02.500
we're always vulnerable to some supply interruption.
That was gold.

776
00:53:02.501 --> 00:53:04.750
There's no supply and we don't burn gold.

777
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:07.870
It just sits there and we're holding this stuff.

778
00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:09.790
We don't know what to do with that.

779
00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:16.050
It can't really be in contango for very long because someone who's holding gold

780
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:19.900
is going to say,
hey,
if it's going down in the futures market,

781
00:53:19.901 --> 00:53:23.740
I'm not going to sit on this stuff.
I'm going to sell it.
So it,

782
00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:26.700
it stays in a dress.

783
00:53:26.701 --> 00:53:29.640
I can tango efforts in backwardation people would sell it.

784
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:35.150
So it stays very nicely in contango and it's going up at the rate of interest,

785
00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:37.920
the storage.
But there's a storage costs as well.

786
00:53:37.921 --> 00:53:39.720
But I don't know how big that is for gold.

787
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:45.170
I guess you'd have to pay for police force to defend your gold,

788
00:53:45.360 --> 00:53:48.990
something like that.
So it must have some storage costs.
But,
uh,

789
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:52.240
it's a very simple market,
uh,
because it,
uh,

790
00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:54.960
it stays in contango all the time.

791
00:53:57.330 --> 00:54:01.920
Copper futures.
Now copper is different from gold because,
uh,
it's not,

792
00:54:01.921 --> 00:54:04.710
this is a,
this is a 2004 clipping.
Again,

793
00:54:05.310 --> 00:54:09.150
copper is an industrial commodity that gets used up.

794
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:13.530
And so it suffers from supply disruptions.
And it can,
uh,

795
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:18.120
like oil,
it can fall into backwardation.
So here,
uh,

796
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:23.600
I should,
I should write these.
Did I ever write these down?
And Tango,

797
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:25.740
it's just doesn't make sure his wins,

798
00:54:25.741 --> 00:54:30.741
futures prices are going up as the maturity with maturity,

799
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:34.200
higher prices for more future dates.

800
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:38.970
Backwardation is when it's going down.

801
00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.920
Okay.
So,
uh,

802
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:48.090
this is an example of a backward backwardated market.

803
00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:51.030
The prices as we go out to further and further,

804
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:55.560
this is 2004 when we go out to December of that year,

805
00:54:55.590 --> 00:55:00.300
it's down from 139 to 136.
And when we go out to,

806
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.410
uh,
December of the following year,

807
00:55:04.411 --> 00:55:08.490
it's down to 118.
Uh,
goal by the way,

808
00:55:08.491 --> 00:55:09.640
has gone up a lot too.

809
00:55:10.590 --> 00:55:14.610
There's been a lot of commodity price increases that surprises this is the

810
00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:16.530
federal funds future.
Another clipping,

811
00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:21.720
there's a futures market for the federal funds rate,
uh,

812
00:55:21.721 --> 00:55:26.430
and it's a cash settled,
uh,
because you can't deliver a federal funds.

813
00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:30.450
The settlement,
uh,
uh,
the,
the price shown,
uh,

814
00:55:30.451 --> 00:55:34.860
is a hundred minus the federal funds rate.
Uh,
and so,

815
00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:39.450
uh,
back then in a,
this is 2004,

816
00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:43.400
the federal funds rate was about 5%.
So this is a,

817
00:55:43.570 --> 00:55:47.610
looks like five and a quarter percent.
Uh,
and so,
uh,
uh,

818
00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:51.750
100 minus 94.74 is five and a quarter percent.

819
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.650
That's what the federal funds rate was expected to be,
uh,

820
00:55:55.651 --> 00:55:58.500
in March of 2004.
Uh,

821
00:55:58.501 --> 00:56:03.501
and here you see that the federal funds rate was expected to continue to decline

822
00:56:05.011 --> 00:56:07.030
at that time.
Um,

823
00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:11.550
this market can go either way because you don't store a federal funds,

824
00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:16.410
so there's no fair value calculation like there are with the other markets.
So,

825
00:56:16.411 --> 00:56:20.490
uh,
it reflects expectations of future interest rates.

826
00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:24.520
Um,
right now I don't,
I should have gotten today's,

827
00:56:24.521 --> 00:56:29.521
but I think the federal funds futures market is predicting right now with the

828
00:56:29.921 --> 00:56:34.360
federal funds rate at two and a quarter percent,
the federal funds market,

829
00:56:34.361 --> 00:56:37.090
this would be 97.75.

830
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:41.950
Now a hundred minus two and a quarter or be close to that and it would be going

831
00:56:41.951 --> 00:56:45.610
down with time.
People are expecting the Fed to cut interest rates and sorry,

832
00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:48.940
growing these numbers would be going up.
Uh,

833
00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:51.490
but I don't have the flipping for today.

834
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:57.400
I just finally wanted to talk about a home price futures,

835
00:56:57.401 --> 00:56:58.660
which is a,

836
00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:04.500
and a market that I've gotten involved with creating a at the Chicago Mercantile

837
00:57:06.490 --> 00:57:09.820
Exchange.
Uh,
so I got involved with them because I have a price index.

838
00:57:09.821 --> 00:57:13.900
My colleague and I,
Carl Case,
who's a professor at Wellesley College,

839
00:57:14.490 --> 00:57:15.040
um,

840
00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:20.040
he and I in the late 1980s created a home price index.

841
00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:25.360
Uh,
this was our research and put it out as a working paper here at Yale,

842
00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:29.380
uh,
20 years ago.
Uh,
and,
uh,

843
00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:33.880
but from the beginning we thought that the real importance of having a home

844
00:57:33.881 --> 00:57:35.740
price index is for trading.

845
00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:41.700
We live in a world where people don't trade.
Uh,

846
00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:46.000
there's no international market for real estate.

847
00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:49.450
Uh,
and it's quite remarkable that there is not,

848
00:57:49.451 --> 00:57:52.060
because real estate is a huge

849
00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:55.660
asset class.
Uh,

850
00:57:55.661 --> 00:58:00.661
the value of single family homes in this country is about 30% bigger than the

851
00:58:02.891 --> 00:58:07.760
value of the stock market in the u s um,

852
00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:12.520
yet we see so much talk about the stock market.
Uh,

853
00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:14.710
when we started in 1988,

854
00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:19.980
we realized not only was there no market for a single family homes except the

855
00:58:20.411 --> 00:58:23.160
very,
the very local market.
Um,

856
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:28.390
there was also no price index for single family homes.
Uh,
Eh,
you know,

857
00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:31.240
it's just sometimes amazing how undeveloped things are.

858
00:58:31.540 --> 00:58:33.670
Here we are in the 20th century.

859
00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:37.630
Everything is computerized and all that,
but you just want,

860
00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:42.490
I just want to know what home prices have been doing in the United States,
uh,

861
00:58:42.491 --> 00:58:47.020
in the late 1980s.
And you couldn't find out where there were some indexes,

862
00:58:47.021 --> 00:58:52.000
but they were rather poor.
Uh,
we thought.
And so,
uh,
and uh,

863
00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:56.410
not very reliable.
So we did our econometric work,
uh,

864
00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:02.380
and devise a method of a repeat sales method of home price indexes.

865
00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:06.600
Uh,
I wrote a book in 1993 about,
uh,

866
00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:12.010
called macro markets about,
um,
it talked a lot about index number construction.

867
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:16.630
And I said in the book that we need to devise a home price index,

868
00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:21.040
that it's as close as possible to something like the s and p 500,

869
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:22.670
which is a stock price index.

870
00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:27.770
But the problem with home prices is we have a much bigger non trading problem.

871
00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.510
Uh,
uh,

872
00:59:30.020 --> 00:59:35.020
the s and p 500 is not very out of date because docs usually don't go untreated

873
00:59:36.410 --> 00:59:40.310
for more than a few minutes or maybe a few hours at times.

874
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:45.590
But with homes,
the typical home doesn't trade every 10 years.

875
00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.050
And so we have a huge non trading problem.

876
00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:52.910
Then what we did is we created an index that was as close as possible to a stock

877
00:59:52.911 --> 00:59:57.290
price index so that it could be traded on a,
on a financial market.

878
00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:03.020
And then I had a student here,
uh,
Alan Weiss who said,

879
01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:06.300
why don't we get going and get,
my student was graduate,

880
01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:10.540
he actually was an som student Mba student.
Uh,
and he said,
uh,
he was,

881
01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:15.600
he was graduating and he thought we should produce these indexes for sale,

882
01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:20.690
for use in financial markets.
Uh,
and so he wanted to do it.

883
01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:25.790
And he set up our company case Shiller Weiss Incorporated,
and he ran it.

884
01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:29.360
And,
and Casey and I were just on the advisory where we were on the board of

885
01:00:29.361 --> 01:00:32.420
directors,
but we were just advising operation.
So my,

886
01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:34.580
I was so proud of him for my student,

887
01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:38.390
created the case Shiller home price indexes.
Uh,

888
01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:43.280
and we started publishing them.
Um,
and then in 19,
early 1990s,

889
01:00:43.281 --> 01:00:48.080
we traveled to all the futures markets and it's proposing to them that they

890
01:00:48.081 --> 01:00:52.910
create home price futures based on our indexes.
Um,
and,

891
01:00:52.911 --> 01:00:57.320
uh,
it was a disappointing,
we couldn't get anyone to do it.

892
01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:01.730
Uh,
I thought we had such a strong case.
It shouldn't,

893
01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:05.590
shouldn't there be a market futures market?
I,
we,
we went to the,
uh,

894
01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:09.290
I mentioned the coffee sugar coco works and we tried them.
All right.

895
01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:13.940
So we go to these guys and they're trading coffee and sugar and cocoa.

896
01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:18.380
And I said,
look,
you know,
coffee is nice.
I mean,

897
01:01:18.381 --> 01:01:20.000
everyone wants their cup in the morning,

898
01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:25.480
but we're talking about $20 trillion of unhedged risk.

899
01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:27.980
Most households in the United States,

900
01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.640
that's what they all in a typical household.
They don't own much stock,

901
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:36.320
they own real estate and they can't hedge it.
So we,
we,

902
01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:41.810
uh,
we,
I think we had the most progress with the Chicago Board of trade.

903
01:01:41.811 --> 01:01:45.140
They actually did some research with us.
Uh,

904
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:49.910
the funny thing that happened that Cvot did research in 1994 and whether they

905
01:01:49.911 --> 01:01:54.230
should set up a futures market for single family homes and the basic conclusion,

906
01:01:54.231 --> 01:01:57.740
they made a lot of phone calls.
It's how they did research,
asking people,

907
01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.940
are you worried about your home price falling and would you like to be able to

908
01:02:01.941 --> 01:02:06.260
hedge the risk in the futures market the way farmers do in the agricultural

909
01:02:06.261 --> 01:02:10.880
market?
And basically the answer was no.
And people,
uh,

910
01:02:10.881 --> 01:02:14.810
said,
uh,
I don't worry about my home price falling.
Uh,

911
01:02:14.830 --> 01:02:17.870
and so they didn't want to start a market cause they thought,

912
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:21.420
but was going around saying,
don't you know,

913
01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:26.220
there's no love economic saying home prices don't fall.
They did.

914
01:02:26.310 --> 01:02:30.300
They have fallen,
they fought,
they fell a lot in the depression.
Uh,

915
01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.470
and they could do it again.
And so a lot of people want to,
you know,

916
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:38.730
have a market that they don't just go steadily up.
Uh,
but people said,

917
01:02:38.731 --> 01:02:42.360
well,
the depression,
that was so long ago,
we can't remember that.
Uh,

918
01:02:42.361 --> 01:02:45.750
and so we couldn't seem to get anyone focused on it.

919
01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:50.970
I think there's something about this that we learned about the origins of our

920
01:02:50.971 --> 01:02:54.630
current economic situation.
Uh,

921
01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:59.520
so we went around to a lot of people trying to get them interested in hedging

922
01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:01.470
real estate price.
Remember,

923
01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:06.060
the purpose of future's market is not gambling,
it's hedging.

924
01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:10.050
It's protecting yourself.
I should write that term on the board as well.

925
01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:15.300
Hedging.
Okay.

926
01:03:15.301 --> 01:03:19.230
I hope I made this clear.
If you are running,
let's go back to wheat.

927
01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:21.960
If you have a warehouse full of wheat,
okay?

928
01:03:21.961 --> 01:03:26.961
You are a wheat Weyerhaeuser and you were like a stable business.

929
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:31.530
So what do you do?
Uh,
you don't know what the price of wheat is going to do.

930
01:03:31.531 --> 01:03:34.260
It goes up and down internationally.
So what do you do?

931
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.900
You sell it in the futures market,

932
01:03:36.901 --> 01:03:40.410
and that means you've hedged your risk of wheat prices.

933
01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:43.200
If wheat prices go down,
true,

934
01:03:43.201 --> 01:03:46.380
the value of the stuff in storage that you own is going to go down.

935
01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:50.990
But offsetting that is your futures contract price will go up.
And that,
that,

936
01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.130
that hedging we'll protect you.

937
01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:58.260
And so you have reduced risk of your business.
And this is done a lot.

938
01:03:58.490 --> 01:04:02.760
Holbrook working in the reading talks about that.
So farmers also can head,

939
01:04:02.770 --> 01:04:06.360
they've got wheat growing in the fields,
uh,

940
01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:08.460
and they're worried about the price they can sell it at.

941
01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:13.200
So let's lock it in today.
Let's sell in the futures market.
Uh,

942
01:04:13.201 --> 01:04:16.170
and the,
the,
uh,
if the price of wheat declines,

943
01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:21.090
your short position in the futures market will appreciate and offset your loss.

944
01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:24.870
So you want to hedge your risk.
So we went around asking people,

945
01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:29.940
don't you want to hedge your risks in the real estate market?
Uh,
and,

946
01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:32.190
uh,
uh,

947
01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:36.840
unfortunately people are rather confused about that and they're not used to

948
01:04:36.841 --> 01:04:40.020
hedging that.
Uh,
but anyway,
uh,

949
01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:44.340
with the recent boom in home prices,
we were able,

950
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:49.400
we finally approached the Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 2006,

951
01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:54.210
uh,
and,
uh,
and,
uh,

952
01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.980
so we want to work with you to create,

953
01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:59.890
try to create a futures market for single family homes.
Uh,

954
01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:04.140
and they said,
okay,
let's try it.
And so this was a,

955
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:07.590
what we did in May of 2006,

956
01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:13.020
we created a futures market.
Uh,
the,
uh,
not the very first,

957
01:05:13.021 --> 01:05:16.020
there was an attempt in London in 1991 that failed,

958
01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:20.800
but we were essentially the first of our futures market for single family homes

959
01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:26.110
in the United States.
Uh,
and,
um,
this market,

960
01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:26.830
uh,

961
01:05:26.830 --> 01:05:31.830
has been in backwardation almost from the first day when we opened the market in

962
01:05:33.041 --> 01:05:37.120
May of 2006 are market maker,
uh,

963
01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:42.430
who was brought in by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange thought like everyone else

964
01:05:42.431 --> 01:05:46.240
who reads the newspapers.
Well,
home prices just always go up.

965
01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:51.490
And so they,
the,
the market maker,
uh,
put out a bid,

966
01:05:51.491 --> 01:05:55.690
ask that implied contango in the market that home prices would go up.

967
01:05:56.350 --> 01:05:57.430
But the,
uh,

968
01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:02.460
the market maker quickly learned that there was no market contango market.

969
01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:06.940
Uh,
and he,
after losing a huge amount of money,

970
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:09.160
he pushed his bid,

971
01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:14.220
ask spreads into the backwardation range and left it there ever since.

972
01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:19.300
And so this is,
this shows the backwardation in the futures market,
uh,
recently,

973
01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:22.180
but it's been this way for a couple of years now.

974
01:06:22.181 --> 01:06:24.190
So what's going on in the housing market?

975
01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:29.730
I think that what has been happening is that newspapers and real estate agents

976
01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:34.860
and lots of commentators,
uh,

977
01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:39.580
people you see on the news have been telling us that home prices always go up.

978
01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:44.710
They've never fallen.
Uh,
and uh,
don't worry.
Okay.

979
01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:47.470
So a lot of casual people have believed that,

980
01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:51.670
but the kind of people who trade in futures markets didn't believe it.

981
01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:56.790
Even going back to early 2006 people who are ready to put their money on the

982
01:06:57.641 --> 01:07:01.630
line had been predicting a decline in home prices now for two years.

983
01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:07.660
And you can see what dramatic declines are being predicted in our futures
market.

984
01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:11.860
Uh,
so I have it for various cities.
Boston,
Chicago,
Denver,
all,

985
01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:15.790
we have separate markets for each of the 10 of these 10 cities.
Las Vegas,

986
01:07:15.791 --> 01:07:19.690
Los Angeles,
Miami,
New York,
San Diego,
and San Francisco.

987
01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:24.580
So I'm the worst market of the mall is Miami.
Uh,

988
01:07:24.581 --> 01:07:29.140
and this market is predicting almost a 35% home price decline,

989
01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:33.980
uh,
by November of 2012.
Um,

990
01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:38.770
and the second worst,
what is the second worst?
I can't quite read it.

991
01:07:38.771 --> 01:07:39.940
They kind of merged here.

992
01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:45.160
There's a bunch of cities where the prediction is for a 20 to 25% drop.

993
01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:50.530
Uh,
and the best,
the best city of all is Chicago.

994
01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:53.200
But even there,
there are predicting a 7% drop.

995
01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:56.900
So we've seen a lot of backwardation in that market.
Uh,

996
01:07:57.070 --> 01:08:02.060
I think this is reflecting the,
the unusual economic circumstance where im fine.

997
01:08:02.110 --> 01:08:06.760
This is my last slide.
This shows the,
uh,
the,
the s and p case,

998
01:08:06.761 --> 01:08:09.790
Shiller home price index.
Uh,

999
01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:12.490
that line is the actual home price index.

1000
01:08:12.730 --> 01:08:17.570
And it has these jumps in it every month because it's a monthly index if we only

1001
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:21.500
publish it every month.
But you can see that it's been very smooth.

1002
01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:26.390
It was increasing until around the time we started the futures market.
Uh,

1003
01:08:26.391 --> 01:08:29.420
and then it's been declining at an accelerating rate.

1004
01:08:29.780 --> 01:08:34.400
So we are now down in real terms about 15% a nationwide,

1005
01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:38.990
uh,
on home prices,
which peaked in early 2006.

1006
01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:44.060
This is the futures price that we've had and that's for the closest futures

1007
01:08:44.061 --> 01:08:48.500
contract,
the nearest to expiration.
And so,
uh,
we're,

1008
01:08:48.501 --> 01:08:51.740
we're hoping to get a lot of publicity for this cause we thought this was a very

1009
01:08:51.741 --> 01:08:52.640
interesting number.

1010
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.000
This is a futures market price for homes and it moves around day by day.

1011
01:08:58.101 --> 01:09:01.780
You all those little wiggles reflect new information that came in on,

1012
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:04.190
on a particular day.
Uh,

1013
01:09:04.191 --> 01:09:08.900
unfortunately we have not been able to get much attention for this number.
Uh,

1014
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:13.430
but there's been a lot of attention to our are the s and p case Shiller home

1015
01:09:13.431 --> 01:09:17.950
price index is now,
uh,
in fact,
uh,
we're getting,
uh,

1016
01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:22.430
uh,
uh,
newspaper stories all the time written about our indexes,

1017
01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.780
but they don't write about our market.
Uh,

1018
01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:28.940
and so we've had trouble getting a futures market started.
Uh,
it's going,

1019
01:09:28.941 --> 01:09:31.010
but it's going only at a low level.

1020
01:09:31.610 --> 01:09:34.760
But I think that in the future this will take off eventually.
I,

1021
01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:38.800
I think that we'll have futures markets for many more things.
Uh,

1022
01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:42.710
but eventually we'll have a futures market for new haven as well.

1023
01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:46.940
Right now new haven is too small to warrant its own futures market.

1024
01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:50.660
So I was thinking of,
well someone in new haven could just buy two,

1025
01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:52.580
or if you wanted to hedge your house,

1026
01:09:52.581 --> 01:09:57.460
you'd sell to New York contracts and one Boston conjugation verb interpolated

1027
01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:01.940
between New New York and Boston.
But eventually we have to do better than that.

1028
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:03.163
Uh,
and I,

1029
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:07.880
I'm hopeful that there will be a day in my lifetime we will see all cities of

1030
01:10:07.881 --> 01:10:12.320
the world traded on futures market.
And in my new book,

1031
01:10:12.321 --> 01:10:15.320
sub prime solution,
I also complaint,
I also claim,

1032
01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:18.590
I think I have some faith in basis to say this,

1033
01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:22.370
that it will help reduce bubbles and help reduce the kind of instability.

1034
01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:26.210
Next period we're going to talk about options.
Uh,

1035
01:10:26.211 --> 01:10:28.130
and then we have only one more lecture.

1036
01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:33.410
The last lecture on the democratization of finance.
