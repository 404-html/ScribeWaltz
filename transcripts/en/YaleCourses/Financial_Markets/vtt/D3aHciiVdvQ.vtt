1
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.850
This is economics to 50 to a financial markets.

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.480
Uh,
and,
uh,

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.110
Bob Schiller and let me begin by introducing the teaching fellows for this

4
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:21.150
course.
And so I have them up here.

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.700
Uh,
we have,
uh,
five teaching fellows at this time.
Uh,

6
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.600
and uh,
they're from all over.

7
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.890
I'd like to put their pictures up so you'll know who they are.
Uh,

8
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.640
uh,
the teaching fellows are very international,
uh,

9
00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:43.200
and that the reflects my intention to make this a course,

10
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.620
which is also very international because finance is something about the whole

11
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:51.360
world today,
not just the United States.

12
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.720
So we cover the world very well with our tas.

13
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.730
A Westmont Ali is from Pakistan,
Lahore,

14
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.910
uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
graduated from the,
uh,

15
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.750
Lems Lah Hor University of management science.

16
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.420
He's a phd candidate now in economics,
uh,
and uh,

17
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.670
is doing his doctoral dissertation on a stock analysts recommendations and the

18
00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:19.500
relation to returns in the stock market.

19
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.440
He's also interested in behavioral finance,

20
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:27.060
which is the application of psychology to finance.
Um,

21
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.030
the second teaching assistant,
I see him right there.

22
00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:35.031
You could raise your hand is Santosh honor [inaudible] who is a representative

23
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:37.630
of the United States.
Uh,

24
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.750
although he seems to have connections to India as well.
Uh,

25
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.790
he's uh,
uh,

26
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.890
he actually has a publication already in the American Economic Review on the

27
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:50.640
return to capital with Ghana.

28
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.590
And he did this jointly with the chairman of the Economics Department here.

29
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.320
Chris,
you'd be,
and he has spent time in India looking at the,

30
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.980
the village economies and you were going to be giving away cows.

31
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.350
Did you do that?
Okay.

32
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.380
That's the last time you'll hear about cows in this course.

33
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.300
But the idea was to give cows away to village farmers into observe the outcome.

34
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.120
It's a big change in some of these very poor villages to get a cow,
uh,

35
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.350
a Christian,
oh,
Wilco Boudou is from Ghana Accra,

36
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.990
but he again went to college in the United States at Morehouse college and he is

37
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:38.520
also a phd candidate,
a and economics at Yale.

38
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.890
Uh,
and he's been doing research on financial markets in developing countries.

39
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.320
Uh,
yeah,
machine dawn,
uh,
is,
uh,
uh,

40
00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.000
from China.
Uh,

41
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:55.910
she got her undergraduate degree from Nanjing University.
No,

42
00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.250
you are from Nanjing.
Did I get to detail wrong?
Where did you go to college?

43
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.860
Okay,
well,
so,
um,
I'm sorry about that.

44
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.880
Uh,
she,
uh,

45
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:14.881
is also a phd candidate and economics is doing research on the behavior of

46
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:18.910
options prices in a phenomenon called the options smile.

47
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.440
And she's smiling at me right now.
Uh,
and uh,

48
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.380
she is,
uh,
also interested in behavioral finance,

49
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:31.180
which is a great to me because that's one of my,
uh,
she has shown here,

50
00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.240
uh,
standing for carelessly on a cliff.
Uh,

51
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.910
it makes me nervous to look at it overlooking Machu Picchu in Peru.

52
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.300
Uh,
and she also loves astronomy,

53
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.480
which is incidentally an interest of mine too,

54
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.420
but you won't hear about it again in this course.

55
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.820
And behind the Chalan Ju,
uh,
is,
uh,

56
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.680
our fifth,

57
00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.330
a teaching assistant and she's also from China who bay province,

58
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.553
uh,

59
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.650
when you graduated from Wu Han University and a phd candidate in economics at

60
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:13.540
Yale and is doing a research on bank mergers.

61
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.970
Okay.
So,
um,
I'll,
let me see.

62
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.390
I've been teaching this course now for over 20 years,

63
00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.100
and I'm very proud of all of my alumni.

64
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.350
Many of them are in the field of finance.
Uh,
in fact,

65
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:38.500
I liked sometimes when I give talks,
I give a lot of public talks.

66
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.130
When I give a talk on Wall Street or even somewhere else in the world,

67
00:04:42.131 --> 00:04:46.360
I sometimes ask my audience,
did you take my course?
Uh,

68
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:50.620
and it's not infrequent that I'll get one or even two people raising their hand

69
00:04:50.621 --> 00:04:55.180
that they took,
uh,
economics to 52 from me.
So,
uh,

70
00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.810
but I'm also proud of my alumni in this course who are not in the world of

71
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:04.420
finance.
I think this course is,
it goes beyond,

72
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.970
it's not just for people who are planning careers in finance,
um,

73
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.770
because,
uh,

74
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.240
finance is a very important technology and it's very important to know finance

75
00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.170
to understand what happens in the real world.

76
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.650
Just about any human endeavor involves finance that you might say,

77
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.610
I could be a poet.
And what does that have to do with finance?
Well,

78
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.870
it probably ends up having something to do with finance because as a poet,

79
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.810
you probably want to publish your poetry,
right?

80
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.530
And you're going to be talking to publishers and before you know it,

81
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.880
they're going to be talking about their financial situation and how you fit into

82
00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:53.620
it.
So I believe it's fundamental and very important.
And so I think,

83
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.340
uh,
you,
uh,

84
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.300
we'll find this course as not a vocational course,

85
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.630
not primarily a vacational vocational course,

86
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:07.220
but an intellectual course about how things work really work.
I mean,

87
00:06:07.221 --> 00:06:10.610
I see finances the underpinning of so much that happens.

88
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.330
It's a powerful force that goes behind the scene.
Uh,

89
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:16.820
and I hope we can draw that out in this course.

90
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:22.490
There is another course in that we have two basic courses in finance for

91
00:06:22.491 --> 00:06:24.560
undergraduates at.
Yeah.
Uh,

92
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:28.940
the other one is economics to 51,
uh,

93
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.200
financial theory.
This is financial markets.
That one is financial theory.

94
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.370
Last year,
uh,
it was taught by Raphael Romo.
Uh,

95
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.200
that was because John John Accomplice,
who usually teaches the course,
uh,

96
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:44.590
was on leave.
And so,
um,

97
00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.540
and so we had to find someone else,

98
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.780
but I assume that next for John John Accomplice will be again teaching two 51.

99
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.890
So what happened?
Why do we have these two courses?
Well,

100
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:02.891
it was something like eight years ago that we reached the present,

101
00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:05.103
uh,
um,

102
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.510
situation with two finance courses and John John Akopoulos and I had a meeting

103
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.620
and we tried to divide up the subject matter of finance into two courses.

104
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:20.250
And so we thought financial theory and financial markets would be the two.
Uh,

105
00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.780
but the problem was that both John and I are interested both in theory and a

106
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.270
there and applications.
Uh,

107
00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.300
John John Accomplice is actually chief economist for a large investment company

108
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.210
called Ellington Capitol in Greenwich,
Connecticut,

109
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.960
which you'll see a lot in the news.
It's been very successful.
Uh,

110
00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.370
and so he's very much interested in the real world.
Uh,

111
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.730
and so am I interested in financial theory?

112
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.530
And so we find it,

113
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.040
we decided after talking about it that we really can't divide up the subject

114
00:07:57.801 --> 00:08:02.801
matter of finance into separate courses on theory and practice.

115
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.670
Uh,
the either one,
if you tried to do one alone,
it would not work.

116
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.560
Uh,
so what we decided to do was to divide it up in perfectly,

117
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:16.070
and there may be some repetition between our two courses.

118
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:20.810
Both of them are self contained courses.

119
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.930
So you could take either two 51 or two 52 or you could take both.

120
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:27.980
Uh,

121
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.570
and I think maybe the best option is to take both if you're really interested in

122
00:08:32.571 --> 00:08:36.830
the subject matter.
Um,
but,
uh,

123
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:42.460
it is true though that his core is more tuned into theoretical detail than mine.

124
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.810
Uh,
and,
uh,
John is a mathematical economist.
Uh,

125
00:08:50.811 --> 00:08:53.240
and,
and I,
we both loved mathematics,

126
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.390
but maybe John is going to do more of it than,
than I am.

127
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.970
This course actually will not use a heavy amount of,

128
00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:05.870
of mathematics.
Um,
uh,
I'll,

129
00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.920
I'll try to keep it so that people who are not comfortable with a lot of math

130
00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:14.970
would take this course.
Uh,
and so,
um,

131
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.130
but,
uh,
so I wanted to emphasize that this is,

132
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.390
um,
I,
I've said that it's,

133
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:31.590
I think this course is vocational preparation in a sense.

134
00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.980
I pride myself on the fact that people who've taken this course find it useful

135
00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.040
in their subsequent lives.
Uh,
but on the other hand,

136
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:45.210
I think that it's a really interesting,

137
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:49.710
at least I find it really interesting.
Uh,
and so,
uh,
I hope that you will too.

138
00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:52.260
Now,
I don't know,
I may be different than other people.

139
00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:55.290
I think organic chemistry is really interesting.

140
00:09:55.650 --> 00:09:58.730
How many of you have that feeling?
Uh,

141
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:04.310
you got a show of hands who's interested in organic chemistry or not getting a

142
00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:08.610
lot of hands raised?
Uh,
unfortunately,
uh,

143
00:10:08.611 --> 00:10:09.930
I've never taken a course in it,

144
00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:14.931
but I've started reading it lately out of just my broad intellectual interest.

145
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.550
Uh,
that is a course that has a bad reputation,
doesn't it?
Because people say,

146
00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:24.810
I've got to take that if I want to be a medical premed.
Um,

147
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:28.380
but you know,
to me,
uh,

148
00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:33.390
there's a lot of detail in organic chemistry to me when you read the detail,

149
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.190
you're getting into,
uh,

150
00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.000
something deep and important about the way everything works.

151
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.310
And so I start to find it interesting.

152
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.980
So I don't know how people feel about taking bigger.

153
00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:45.950
I'm turning you off by saying this.

154
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.600
There's going to be a lot of detail in this course,

155
00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:52.990
but I never made a big mistake by likening it to an organic chemistry course.

156
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:55.650
I don't mean to turn you off.
Uh,

157
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.000
the idea in this course is that,
uh,

158
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.840
it being a financial markets course is you have to know how the world works.

159
00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:08.250
We're going to be thinking about that in connection with financial theory,

160
00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.760
but we have to get into the details.
Uh,

161
00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:14.730
and so we are going to be,
um,

162
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.530
we are going to be learning about a fact.
Uh,

163
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.840
and so,
um,
so let me,
uh,

164
00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:28.380
let me start by talking about the textbook.
So the,
uh,

165
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:33.450
the principal textbook,
uh,
is,

166
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.500
uh,
frank for Bozi,
uh,
uh,

167
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.950
the other authors are Modigliani Jones and fairy,
um,

168
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.210
and,
uh,

169
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:51.570
foundations of financial markets and institutions.
Uh,
this textbook,

170
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:56.650
uh,
is,
uh,
very detailed and,

171
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:59.980
uh,
it,
uh,
it may be some,

172
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:04.570
I've had some reaction to students that's more than I wanted to know.
Uh,

173
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.760
but,
uh,
I actually had a great experience reading it.

174
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:10.960
I actually,

175
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:14.650
it was an earlier edition when I first assigned this book in the year 2000.

176
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.510
I took it with me on vacation.

177
00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:21.400
I was going to The Bahamas with my family and with Jeremy Siegel's family,

178
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.220
but we'll come back to Jeremy Siegel in a minute.
Uh,

179
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:28.500
and I sat down by the pool with this book.
Uh,

180
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:32.950
other people were reading novels and I don't know why,
but I was reading,
um,

181
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.670
for Bozi et al and I had such a great time with it.

182
00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.910
So I'm telling you that was my experience.

183
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:43.570
Maybe it was because it was filling in gaps in my knowledge and things I've

184
00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:46.790
always wanted to know and was always curious about.
Um,

185
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.240
that's part of what you have to develop when you get interested in the field to

186
00:12:50.241 --> 00:12:53.170
some sense of curiosity about all the details.

187
00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:58.450
So I read the whole book,
uh,
it's 650 pages,

188
00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.870
uh,
on our community.
I kind of speed read it cause I knew a lot of it.

189
00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.440
They might take you a little longer to get through it.
Um,

190
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:09.130
and so I wanted you to have the same experience.
Um,

191
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.440
so I'm going to sign this book now.

192
00:13:11.441 --> 00:13:16.441
It's now a in another edition and for Bozi is working on a fourth or next

193
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:22.360
edition.
I forget what number.
Uh,
and uh,

194
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:23.890
so I'm going to sign you,

195
00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:28.640
I'd gotten some complaints from students that this book is tough going,
uh,

196
00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.610
because there's so much information in it.
Uh,

197
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:34.990
I used to tell people that I'm assigning the whole book and you have to know

198
00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.910
everything in the book.
Okay?
Uh,
and that's a little ambitious.

199
00:13:39.911 --> 00:13:44.020
I finally backed down because I met a man on Wall Street,

200
00:13:44.021 --> 00:13:47.540
a very prominent Wall Street person.
And he said,
you know,

201
00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.610
my son started to take your course.
Uh,
and I said,

202
00:13:51.611 --> 00:13:54.520
what do you mean started to take your course?
And he said,
well,

203
00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:59.521
he dropped out when he saw this book and my requirements and I didn't like that.

204
00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:01.720
I don't want students to drop out.

205
00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:07.410
So what I decided is to say that you need to know the whole book in the sense

206
00:14:08.111 --> 00:14:12.610
that you need to know all the key terms and key points.
Now,

207
00:14:12.611 --> 00:14:14.500
if you look at the structure of this book,

208
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.190
it has sections that say key points and key terms.
Okay.

209
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:23.410
That anything that's mentioned there is fair game for me in an exam.

210
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.410
And so,
uh,
that's the way I've done it.

211
00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.140
So there are key points and key terms also,
anything in my lecture,

212
00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.500
of course it's fair game for the exam.
Uh,
and uh,
oh,

213
00:14:35.501 --> 00:14:36.580
let me also add,

214
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I've got a reading list that has clickable things on it and also things that are

215
00:14:43.181 --> 00:14:47.860
unresolved in the library.
Anything that's clickable is required reading.

216
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:52.340
Okay.
I don't expect you to go to the library,
however,
uh,
cause I don't,

217
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:56.450
I think that we're moving into an age where,
uh,
you,
uh,

218
00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.630
tend to want to be online.
Right?
So,
uh,

219
00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:03.560
the library books are all optional,
um,
background.

220
00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:10.130
Uh,
so for Bozi,
a faculty member here at Yale,

221
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:10.701
uh,

222
00:15:10.701 --> 00:15:15.701
has offered to give me at least we have at least one chapter from the new

223
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:21.050
addition that's hasn't come out yet and I'm going to put that on reserve,
uh,
uh,

224
00:15:21.051 --> 00:15:23.180
in the library.
Uh,
but again,

225
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:26.460
I think that the addition that you have is,
uh,

226
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:30.620
is reasonably uptodate.
And so that's all that I'm expecting you to read.

227
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:36.320
The other author of Franco Modigliani,
uh,
in the book,
the second author,

228
00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:40.820
uh,
was a,
was my teacher at Mit.
Uh,

229
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.860
he died in 2003.
Uh,

230
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.910
he also is a Nobel Prize winner,
uh,

231
00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:49.400
and I think is a remarkable intellect.
Uh,

232
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:52.970
so this book for Bozi et Al,
uh,

233
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:58.030
for those for Bozi Modigliani Jones and ferry is a very solid book about

234
00:15:58.731 --> 00:16:01.170
financial markets.
Uh,

235
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.380
the second book that I'm assigning is,
uh,

236
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.780
Jeremy Siegel,

237
00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:15.370
uh,
stocks for the long run.
Uh,
so,
uh,

238
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.850
this is an old friend of mine.
I met him in graduate school.

239
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:24.680
A funny story.
I met him because at MIT they,
they,
uh,

240
00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.430
signed us all up for chest x rays alphabetically.

241
00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:30.710
That's the way MIT does things in an orderly way.

242
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.060
And Schiller and seagull are next to each other in the alphabet.

243
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:39.560
So I was standing in line with him for an x ray and I got to talking with him

244
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.600
and I've known him ever since.

245
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.720
It's a funny coincidence is that since our books,

246
00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.120
our names are close in the alphabet,

247
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:52.280
you often find our books right together in bookstores because Shiller and
Siegel,

248
00:16:52.281 --> 00:16:56.210
if their shelving alphabetically would end up together.
Uh,

249
00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.600
he wrote a book called stocks for the long run starting in 1993 and it's just,

250
00:17:01.791 --> 00:17:06.140
just came out with the fourth edition.
Uh,
and so,
uh,

251
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:10.760
that book was a bestseller.
I think it's sold over a half a million copies.

252
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:15.260
Uh,
I'm not sure where it is up now,
but,
uh,
it has done very well.

253
00:17:15.261 --> 00:17:18.940
It's been a perennial classic,
uh,
and it's really,
uh,
it's,

254
00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:23.800
it emphasizes the long run performance of the stock market,
but it's really a

255
00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:30.500
general treatise on financial markets.
Uh,

256
00:17:30.501 --> 00:17:35.050
and I,
I get a very good reaction from this students for this book.

257
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:39.920
This one is very readable.
It's not so intense as full Bozi et al.

258
00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:44.840
Uh,
Jeremy Siegel has the unique distinction.
Businessweek,
uh,
asked,

259
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:49.680
did a poll,
asking a Mbas who is their favorite professor?
Uh,

260
00:17:49.681 --> 00:17:50.940
this is about 10 years ago.

261
00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.230
And they rank business school professors according to their popularity.

262
00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:59.220
He came out number one in the United States as a business school professor.

263
00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.110
And uh,
so I think you'll like this book.
The next book is my own,

264
00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:09.240
uh,
called irrational exuberance.
And this is the last book,

265
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.943
uh,

266
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:16.000
that's a phrase that was coined by Alan Greenspan,
uh,

267
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.000
in 1996.
Uh,

268
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.760
and it refers to the stock market boom of the,
uh,
two thousands,

269
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:28.410
uh,
of the 1990s and the boom and the bust.
Well,

270
00:18:28.411 --> 00:18:32.130
I think it's related to the bus that came out later after 2000.

271
00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.140
I wrote this book in 2000,
uh,
right at the peak,

272
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.680
fortunately right at the peak of the stock market.
Uh,

273
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:46.020
and but what I'm assigning to you is the second edition,
which came out in 2005,

274
00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:49.900
uh,
pretty much at the peak of the housing market.
Uh,

275
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.130
and so we're going to talk about,
uh,

276
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:57.120
both the housing market and the stock market in these different books.

277
00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.400
These books are all on sale at labyrinth books,

278
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:07.860
which is an independent bookstore here in new haven.
I put it there because,

279
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:09.940
uh,
well I think,
uh,

280
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:14.610
the major chain bookstores fulfill an important function,

281
00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:17.940
but I like also to support independent bookstores.

282
00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:22.020
And I don't know if you know the story labyrinth books,
uh,
is independent.

283
00:19:22.021 --> 00:19:25.650
It's not a chain a and independent bookstores are trying to,

284
00:19:25.651 --> 00:19:30.300
struggling to survive.
This is finance in the book business.
Uh,
there's something,

285
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.120
uh,
difficult,
uh,
about maintaining an independent operation.

286
00:19:34.121 --> 00:19:37.680
So labyrinth was at Columbia University and Yale,

287
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.370
for some reason they shut down their Columbia bookstore,

288
00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.720
but they've opened up now in Princeton.
Uh,

289
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:48.930
there was this famous bookstore on Princeton on Nassau street called makeovers,

290
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.920
which is a wonderful bookstore and I've been in there the number of times,

291
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.080
but they just went out of business.
Uh,

292
00:19:55.470 --> 00:20:00.030
so labyrinth has moved in to take their place.
Uh,
anyway,

293
00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.930
that's where the books,
all the books are and uh,
um,

294
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:09.360
and they are,
I check they're available now then.
Um,

295
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.150
so,
uh,

296
00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.210
we're going to have these lectures are Monday,

297
00:20:21.211 --> 00:20:25.500
I Wednesday we're going to have ta sections on the second part of the week.

298
00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:30.890
We're going to ask you to look at your schedule sometime before our next lecture

299
00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.640
and think about when you can come to a teaching assistant section.
Uh,

300
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:39.990
but they will be Wednesday,
Thursday,
and Friday.
And we have six problem sets,

301
00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.250
the six problems sets or do a on generally on Mondays.

302
00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:49.270
And so we'll go over the problem sets in the teaching,
uh,
sections,

303
00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:54.880
uh,
uh,
a couple days,
several days after you turn them in.

304
00:20:55.770 --> 00:21:00.730
Um,
this is one of the biggest classes at Yale,
but I think,
uh,
we've got,

305
00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.740
uh,
uh,
I think we've got it.

306
00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:05.470
So it will be a good and satisfying experience with you.

307
00:21:05.471 --> 00:21:07.990
We have a very qualified,

308
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.660
I'm very impressed with our teaching assistants.

309
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:15.730
The important thing is for you to,
uh,
stay with them and get to know them.

310
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.600
Uh,
and I urge you to attend the ta sections.

311
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.340
The course is going to be graded.
Uh,
we have,
uh,

312
00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:28.390
two midterms and one final.
The in class midterms,

313
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:33.780
the grades will be roughly 10% problems sets 20% first midterm,

314
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:39.820
30%,
second midterm,
40% final.
Uh,
but nonetheless,

315
00:21:39.821 --> 00:21:41.170
we will also use judgment.

316
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:46.500
And I'm going to appeal to the TA's to help me on judging the degrading.

317
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.970
Uh,
and,
um,
so I,

318
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:52.960
uh,

319
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.610
also I asked the teaching assistants to give me a little capsule descriptions of

320
00:21:56.611 --> 00:21:59.980
you so that 10 years or 20 years from now,

321
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:05.310
and I get a call from a reporter asking about this illustrious person who was

322
00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:10.060
once my student,
uh,
I can have something to proud my memory.
Uh,

323
00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:11.680
so,
uh,

324
00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:15.310
that's what I hope you'll stay with you each find a teaching assistant and we'll

325
00:22:15.311 --> 00:22:19.930
stay with that person.
Um,
so,

326
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:23.330
uh,
I wanted to say something,
uh,
about,
uh,

327
00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.840
uh,
a particular interest of mine,
uh,

328
00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.600
because it is part of this course as well,

329
00:22:31.601 --> 00:22:36.130
not the entire course.

330
00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:41.580
Behavioral finance refers to a revolution in finance that's occurred,

331
00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:47.560
uh,
over the last 10 or 20 years.
Uh,
and that is,
uh,

332
00:22:47.561 --> 00:22:52.561
incorporate behavioral finance is the theory of finance mixed in with the

333
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:58.150
theories of other social sciences.
Uh,
notably a psychology,

334
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:02.980
sociology,
political science,
anthropology.
Uh,
it's,

335
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:04.000
um,
and it's,

336
00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:09.060
I think it's the most important revolution in finance of the last couple of

337
00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.450
decades.
Uh,
maybe I'm biased because I've been very much involved in it.

338
00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:18.780
I've been organizing workshops in behavioral finance at the National Bureau for

339
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:24.310
Economic Research now since 1991 with a Dick Thaler at the University of
Chicago.

340
00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:29.360
Uh,
we think that we're on the vanguard of a major revolution.
Uh,

341
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.220
the unity of the social sciences is,

342
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.850
I think very important.
It's,

343
00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.430
it's a mistake to try to consider finance in isolation.

344
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:44.710
There is a whole array of other information related to finance.

345
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.140
So this will be a theme of my course.
And of course,

346
00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:52.190
it's also a theme of this book here.
Irrational exuberance.
Uh,

347
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.293
that's what it,

348
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:57.650
what exuberance refers to is a psychological term.

349
00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:02.640
So,
uh,
that's um,
uh,
an important element of,

350
00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:04.980
of this course.
Um,

351
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:10.210
another thing that I will be talking about is less important to discourse,

352
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.610
but
you've heard of this,

353
00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.720
the subprime crisis.
Uh,

354
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.660
this is the big financial event,

355
00:24:20.661 --> 00:24:25.460
which is hitting the United States and the entire world right now.

356
00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:29.660
Uh,
and,
uh,
I'm actually writing another book about,

357
00:24:29.661 --> 00:24:33.530
this is not done in time for you to read,
but,
uh,

358
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:38.420
I think I will have it done at some time during this semester.
Uh,

359
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.130
what does this mean?

360
00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:44.530
Sub Prime refers to the,
uh,

361
00:24:45.860 --> 00:24:50.860
mortgages that were made much mostly over the last 10 years or so to subprime

362
00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:54.860
borrowers.

363
00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.760
A subprime borrower is somebody who has a poor credit history or some other

364
00:25:02.271 --> 00:25:07.271
indication that would suggest that they might not be able to repay the mortgage.

365
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:14.120
They might default,
uh,
the industry,

366
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:19.480
subprime lending has grown dramatically over the last 10 years and as you

367
00:25:20.361 --> 00:25:22.580
probably know,
uh,

368
00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:27.610
it's in big trouble now what's happening is the housing market is dropping home,

369
00:25:30.081 --> 00:25:35.081
prices are falling and people are defaulting in record numbers and there are

370
00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.770
foreclosures.
What happens if you don't pay your mortgage?

371
00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:41.690
You buy a house and you don't pay the mortgage.

372
00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:46.520
The contract says you lose the house.
You're out,
you got to pay.

373
00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:51.320
Or it goes back to the,
uh,
mortgage originator.
Uh,

374
00:25:51.321 --> 00:25:52.220
and,
uh,

375
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:58.240
this crisis is very interesting to me because it's had so many ramifications

376
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.070
throughout the financial world.

377
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:06.260
It's exposing defects in many of our biggest financial institution.

378
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:10.370
And we,
every day we see more news about failures,

379
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.170
a huge losses,

380
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.650
resignations or firings of top of finance people.

381
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:19.160
So it's a very interesting time,
uh,
in finance,

382
00:26:19.161 --> 00:26:20.960
these things happen from time to time,

383
00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:24.350
but they happen with enough regularity that there's something that we really

384
00:26:24.351 --> 00:26:27.860
want to understand as a systematic,
uh,

385
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:33.290
as a systematic,
uh,
uh,
phenomenon.

386
00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:38.340
So that's another thing that I will be talking about.
Um,

387
00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.050
the make another point.
But technology,

388
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:45.003
alright,

389
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:51.530
finance I believe is a technology and that means it is a way of doing things.

390
00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.920
It has a lot of detail.

391
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:04.340
A financial instrument is like,
uh,

392
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.110
an engineering device here.

393
00:27:07.111 --> 00:27:10.020
I'm tying and none of the engineering's anyone here from engineering?

394
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.060
A couple of you.
Okay.
Well this could be,
in fact,

395
00:27:15.061 --> 00:27:20.010
some engineering schools offer courses in finance and you know that engineers

396
00:27:20.011 --> 00:27:24.210
find it congenial because they have a way of thinking constructively about the

397
00:27:24.211 --> 00:27:28.380
world.
Uh,
that,
uh,
is kind of parallel to finance.

398
00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.490
It's a,
we have theories,

399
00:27:32.491 --> 00:27:37.491
mathematical theories that lead us to devise a device.

400
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:39.060
Uh,

401
00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:44.060
financial structures and financial structures are complicated devices just like

402
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:49.380
engines are,
or nuclear reactors are.
Uh,
they have a lot of components.

403
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:54.390
They have to work right.
When people first devise some new financial instrument,

404
00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.330
it typically has trouble,
uh,

405
00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:01.980
and just like when they revise the first engines or the first nuclear reactors,

406
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:03.720
it didn't work so well at first.

407
00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:08.490
And then from experience of many people working on it over many years,

408
00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.690
a body of knowledge emerges.
And that's what we call technology.

409
00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:18.410
So technology is a powerful force in our society and I respect power of this

410
00:28:19.651 --> 00:28:23.530
kind.
Uh,
and that's where I like to follow it up.
Uh,

411
00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.130
but technology is also dangerous.
Uh,

412
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.850
so nuclear power,
for example,

413
00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.710
it may be our salvation when we run out of oil,
uh,
or virtually run out of oil.

414
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:39.000
It seems to be coming up over the next few or several decades.

415
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.570
We're going to have to do that.
We're going to need nuclear power,

416
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:45.740
but it's also dangerous as you know.
Uh,

417
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:51.390
the same thing is true about finance.
And I think that,
you know,
in a sense the,

418
00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:56.500
the subprime crisis that we have is an example of the dangers of new technology.

419
00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.880
We have been seeing financial technology advanced,
uh,

420
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:05.640
in recent years and this advancement of technology,

421
00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:11.160
uh,
has brought us some problems.
Uh,
some people want to go back,

422
00:29:11.161 --> 00:29:12.340
some people think,
ah,

423
00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:16.710
there's a lot of anger about the subprime crisis and there's some anger

424
00:29:16.711 --> 00:29:19.780
expressed against the financial community.
Uh,

425
00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:24.860
I think that we should be very careful not to let that deflect us from the

426
00:29:26.041 --> 00:29:31.041
recognition that this is important technology and that it's not the technology

427
00:29:32.161 --> 00:29:36.090
that's at fault.
We have to get it right and then it will be powerful.

428
00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:38.760
Um,
I've had,
uh,

429
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.570
some experience giving talks in less developed countries.

430
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.650
I'm not a development economist now development you cannot with us.

431
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.640
Santosha is field.
Uh,
uh,
development.

432
00:29:51.641 --> 00:29:56.410
Economics is a very important field in economics,
which is helping,

433
00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.140
uh,
less developed countries emerge.

434
00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:04.070
And I'm very proud to say that Yale has a strong department,
uh,

435
00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.290
at the growth center of on development economics.
Uh,

436
00:30:07.291 --> 00:30:10.240
I'm not a development economist.
Nonetheless,

437
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.940
when I've spoken in less developed countries,

438
00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:17.490
I find that they're really interested in finance.
Uh,

439
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:22.180
I think that's because there's a growing recognition that that's what you need

440
00:30:22.181 --> 00:30:22.960
to know.

441
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.960
And that the countries that are emerging successfully are those that have well

442
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.440
developed or financial institutions that are adopting the technology.

443
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:36.640
They have to adapt it to their own situation,
but in many ways,

444
00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:40.600
they're copying technology.
And there's nothing bad about copying technology.

445
00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.270
That's what everybody does,
right?

446
00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:47.830
When somebody invented the automobile before he know everyone's driving

447
00:30:47.831 --> 00:30:51.140
automobiles and they all look pretty much the same.
Uh,
and we,

448
00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.560
when someone invented the airplane,
before,
you know,
it,

449
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:56.860
every country has airplane.
That's because there's a best practice.

450
00:30:56.860 --> 00:31:01.060
There's a best technology and it's not renege to any one country.

451
00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:02.620
So,
um,

452
00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:07.810
so that's why I view this course as,

453
00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:12.640
as a fundamentally about technology.
Uh,

454
00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:16.660
and uh,
uh,
so it's,
um,

455
00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:22.040
uh,
what did it say?
Something about morality,
uh,

456
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:27.910
and about Ms. Mixed feelings that people have about finance.

457
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:31.440
Uh,
the,
uh,

458
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.780
uh,
I note that undergraduate,
I don't know if how you feel about fine.

459
00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.950
Some people have a reaction.
If you say you're taking a course in finance,

460
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:47.110
they think that maybe you were selling out,
maybe you value money too much,

461
00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.250
uh,
that,
uh,
uh,

462
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:54.330
you should really be in some other field that,
uh,
uh,

463
00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:59.440
this is a long standing,
uh,
conflict in our thinking.

464
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.390
There is,
uh,
some contempt for finance,

465
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:07.030
I believe,
uh,
because it,

466
00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:10.630
because it makes so much money for many people.

467
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:12.850
Many of our students go into finance.

468
00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:17.260
Yale is very strong and providing people to the financial community.

469
00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.700
And I have to say they do very well.
Um,
and so I,

470
00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.720
my first advice is if you want to make money,
which I don't particularly advise,

471
00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:30.850
but if you do,
it's not a bad idea to go into finance.
Just as you know,

472
00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:33.340
you can make a lot of money with organic chemistry.
Two,

473
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.420
I think that what you have to do as a young person is develop your,

474
00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:42.890
your human capital and that means how knowing how to do things.
Uh,

475
00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.620
but,
uh,
there is,
uh,

476
00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.180
there is a hostility toward,
uh,

477
00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.710
finance that I think is,
uh,
uh,

478
00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.200
that is very fundamental to a lot of our thinking.

479
00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:02.390
We wanted to say something about that.
Um,
uh,

480
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:07.190
part of it is that some people in finance gets so rich.

481
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:12.200
Unfortunately,
if you look at the list of the richest people,
uh,
you know,

482
00:33:12.201 --> 00:33:16.820
they're all connected to finance,
right?
I mean,
they understand it.

483
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:19.880
Maybe they're not,
maybe they're in publishing or some other field,

484
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:24.380
but they understand finance and a lot of them are directly in finance.

485
00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.480
So what do we make of that?
Well,
part of it is that we get,
uh,

486
00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:33.390
we get very,
um,
uh,
you know,
we,

487
00:33:33.391 --> 00:33:37.160
we get a sort of jealousy of these people because,
you know,

488
00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:42.020
why should someone have billions of dollars?
Did they really deserve that?
Uh,

489
00:33:42.021 --> 00:33:46.520
and you know,
some people,
uh,
get self important,
um,

490
00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:51.840
in,
uh,
in,
uh,
uh,
who make a lot of money.
And,
uh,

491
00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:56.660
they ended up not making a lot of friends in the,
in the process.
Uh,

492
00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.420
I was,
uh,
uh,

493
00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:03.140
the Yale University press is publishing a new book by Steve Fraser About,

494
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:05.640
uh,
about Wall Street.
Uh,

495
00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:10.010
and he gives examples in this book about hostility toward,

496
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.700
it goes way back.
Uh,
so in Frazer,
his book,

497
00:34:13.701 --> 00:34:18.080
He gives an example of a,
I've never heard of this person before,

498
00:34:18.081 --> 00:34:22.010
but William Door,
uh,
uh,
William Door,

499
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:25.050
who was a finance here,
uh,

500
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:29.420
and colonial America,
uh,

501
00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:32.000
in the 17 hundreds,
um,

502
00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:37.610
made a lot of money and help finance the revolutionary war and the United
States.

503
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:42.590
Uh,
but he ended up being chased down the street by an angry mob.

504
00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.040
People hated him.
Uh,
and why was that?
Well,

505
00:34:46.041 --> 00:34:50.240
it's partly because he got so rich,
uh,
and he,
uh,

506
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:55.440
diary wanting to show off.
He had what they call liveried servants.
Uh,

507
00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:58.910
not just servants,
but servants who were wearing livery,

508
00:34:58.911 --> 00:35:02.750
which means like a military uniform.
And it looked a,

509
00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:07.280
it looked like aristocracy coming back in the form of,
of,
uh,

510
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:12.180
rich,
uh,
finance,
financial successes.
And,
uh,

511
00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:17.300
uh,
we don't like that there's a feeling of hostility toward that.
Uh,

512
00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:18.853
and,
um,

513
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:23.950
there's been a long discussion about what people owe each other and how okay it

514
00:35:26.181 --> 00:35:31.010
is to try to make money.
Uh,
I don't know if you remember,
uh,

515
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:34.270
I have to start erasing here.
Um,

516
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:39.970
one of the most well known Yale professors of the 19th century

517
00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:45.460
<v 1>was
William Graham</v>

518
00:35:47.250 --> 00:35:48.083
Sumner,

519
00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.250
<v 0>uh,
who,
uh,</v>

520
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:57.230
wrote a famous piece called what social classes know each other.

521
00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:58.573
He,
uh,

522
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:03.050
some there graduated Yale 1863.

523
00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:06.560
He was a member of skull and bones.
You've heard of that?
I thought,

524
00:36:06.561 --> 00:36:11.510
I didn't know that group spent his entire career at Yale.
Uh,
and he wrote,

525
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.570
it was,
he was head of our social sciences department.

526
00:36:14.571 --> 00:36:18.860
That's before we had a separate departments of economics and psychology,

527
00:36:18.861 --> 00:36:23.710
et Cetera.
Uh,
and he was a very prominent,
uh,

528
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:28.870
exponent of the idea that people should go out for their own interest.

529
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:33.980
They do.
One social class does not owe anything to another,

530
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:38.060
and we should not feel guilty about,

531
00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:42.950
about pursuing financial interests.
Uh,
but,
uh,

532
00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:47.640
and that led to a whole attitude among,
uh,
among,
uh,

533
00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:53.140
at least a good segment of our society that it's okay to go out and make money

534
00:36:53.271 --> 00:36:57.260
because making money means doing productive things for the economy.

535
00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.940
Uh,
and,
uh,
ultimately,
um,
it's a benefit to society.

536
00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.610
Um,
but we have some discomfort with that.

537
00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.480
Uh,
so,
uh,

538
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:15.260
another book which I haven't put on reserve yet,

539
00:37:15.261 --> 00:37:19.520
but I'm going to put it on reserve,
uh,
is by Peter Unger,

540
00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:23.450
uh,
who is a philosopher.

541
00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:28.540
It's a remarkable book called living high and letting die.

542
00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:29.660
Uh,

543
00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:34.580
and it refers to a more broad philosophical issue that we have.

544
00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:36.690
And that is that,
uh,

545
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:41.480
most of us are really making money for ourselves.

546
00:37:41.481 --> 00:37:45.680
That's what we do with our lives.
Uh,
and,
uh,

547
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:47.543
um,

548
00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:52.850
is that moral that it's not just rich people who do that.

549
00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:57.610
The rest of us do it also.
Uh,
and,
uh,
in,
uh,

550
00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:02.420
Peter Unger,
his book,
uh,
he,
um,
uh,

551
00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:06.760
on the first page he has an address,
uh,

552
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.770
and it's an address for UNICEF,

553
00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:13.160
which is the United Nations Children's Fund.

554
00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:19.060
And he starts out his book with that address where you could send money.

555
00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.013
Right now,

556
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:24.470
I thought it was very impressive that he put that on page one of the book

557
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:29.510
because it puts the reader in a moral dilemma.
Uh,

558
00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:34.730
he points out that it's estimated that for every $3 you sound to,

559
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.390
you can save a life.
Uh,

560
00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:43.890
that's because there are people in this world who are not getting medical care.

561
00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:49.240
There are people who are dying of diseases for which there are known cures

562
00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:54.100
because they don't have the medical,
the,
the,
the,
the best medicines,

563
00:38:54.101 --> 00:38:57.520
which are often not even expensive,
but they're living in such poverty.

564
00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.380
So he says,

565
00:39:00.490 --> 00:39:05.440
why don't you stop right now and send $100 to UNICEF?

566
00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:07.200
Okay.
Um,

567
00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:11.920
and it was very impactful to start a book that way because I doubt that hardly

568
00:39:11.921 --> 00:39:16.270
any readers actually write out a check on the spot,
the UNICEF.

569
00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.860
Uh,
and if you don't,

570
00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:22.420
then you are in some sense responsible for the loss of 30 lives.

571
00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:27.160
Uh,
and so it's quite striking and that helps you to reflect on what makes us,

572
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:32.560
what makes us,
uh,
uh,
behave the way we do.
By the way,

573
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:37.840
when you go back to your computer,
okay,
Google,
UNICEF,

574
00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:42.940
and you can give $100 to UNICEF,
uh,
with it,

575
00:39:42.941 --> 00:39:45.670
you can do it within the hour.
Okay.
Uh,

576
00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:49.360
maybe I could ask for a show of hands how many people did have,
uh,

577
00:39:49.361 --> 00:39:51.100
I expect that not many of you will,

578
00:39:51.330 --> 00:39:53.110
and I don't think that proves that you're bad people.

579
00:39:53.111 --> 00:39:57.580
This is a very interesting philosophical question.
Uh,
but,
uh,

580
00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:01.270
what it means is that,
uh,

581
00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:07.870
whether there is a moral dilemma underlying all of our economic lives,

582
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:08.921
uh,

583
00:40:08.921 --> 00:40:13.630
and I think this moral dilemma is the same as the moral dilemma in finance.

584
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.000
So I'm in the financial,

585
00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:20.680
it's just that people in finance are sometimes very successful and they could

586
00:40:20.681 --> 00:40:25.190
give a lot more than a hundred dollars to UNICEF.
Um,

587
00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.080
so one thing that I wanted to emphasize in this course,

588
00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:34.790
I'll try to emphasize is that a part of finance,

589
00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:39.080
uh,
is actually fun philanthropy.
Uh,

590
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.490
and so the most important,

591
00:40:42.491 --> 00:40:45.940
the most successful people in finance,
I believe,

592
00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:50.290
end up giving the money away.
Okay.
And that means,

593
00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:55.450
uh,
you can't consume $1 billion.
There's no way that you can do that.

594
00:40:56.020 --> 00:41:00.430
What they end up,
uh,
you,
you can only drive one car at a time.
Right?

595
00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:04.960
And if you have five cars,
well,
I mean,
that's kind of a,
all right.

596
00:41:04.961 --> 00:41:07.660
You could have five cars and you can drive a different one every day,

597
00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:11.790
but it's starting to seem a little ridiculous,
right?
Uh,

598
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:13.001
in any way.

599
00:41:13.001 --> 00:41:17.980
We're not using them and they're going to end up used by somebody else.
Uh,
so,
uh,

600
00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.490
I think the outcome should be philanthropy.

601
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:26.380
And so those of you who are successful,
uh,
really ought to give it away.

602
00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:27.873
Uh,

603
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:33.600
so I'm bringing in outside speakers as part of this course and uh,

604
00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:34.970
I'm going to,
uh,

605
00:41:34.971 --> 00:41:39.580
among them bring in people who I think have been a philanthropists,
that,

606
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:42.930
that's the,
that's the mode of thinking that,
um,

607
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:47.850
that is most attractive when you think about financial markets.
Uh,

608
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:48.980
so let me tell you about,

609
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:53.920
I have slots now for four outside speakers have lined up two of them.
Uh,

610
00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:58.200
and let me tell you about the two that I've already lined up.
Uh,

611
00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:03.200
the first one is our own David Swensen.
Uh,
David Swensen,

612
00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:04.280
uh,

613
00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:08.660
came to a Yale University in 1985,

614
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:13.400
uh,
uh,
from Wall Street,
although he's a Yale.

615
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:17.480
He was a Yale graduate.
Uh,
at that time,

616
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:21.950
the Yale Endowment was,
uh,
about,

617
00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:26.360
actually it's slightly under $1 billion.
What does the endowment of year,

618
00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:31.340
the endowment is defined as the financial assets that Yale University owns.

619
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.660
Okay.
Uh,
Yale also has an art collection,

620
00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.300
which is worth many billions.

621
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.590
We don't count that as part of the endowment because they will never sell it.

622
00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:44.810
And so it doesn't provide income for us.

623
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:49.790
And Yale also has a physical plant like this beautiful building that we're in

624
00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:51.830
that's not part of the endowment either.

625
00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:57.070
The financial assets that Yale has a at that time were about a billion dollars.

626
00:42:58.390 --> 00:43:02.270
Um,
so,
um,
since then,
uh,

627
00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:07.300
David Swenson has invested or has managed the investment of this endowment,

628
00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:12.860
uh,
and it has done phenomenally well.

629
00:43:12.861 --> 00:43:17.861
So it's now over $22 billion that Yale has in its endowment.

630
00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:23.060
And so the return that he got,
uh,

631
00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:27.870
from 1996 to 2006,
uh,
was,
um,

632
00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.950
um,
17% a year on,

633
00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:34.730
on investments last year.

634
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:40.030
The return on the Yale portfolio was 28% in one year.

635
00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:42.411
Now,

636
00:43:42.411 --> 00:43:46.550
I don't know how impressed you or the year before that it was 22% in one year.

637
00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:49.700
Uh,
now some of this might be luck.
Uh,

638
00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:53.930
but I don't think it's all luck because he's done this consistently for so many

639
00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:57.680
years.
If you look up around this campus now,

640
00:43:57.681 --> 00:43:59.390
you'll see a lot of construction,

641
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.920
a lot of things are being spruced up and improved.
Well that's,
you know,

642
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:08.320
I think David Swenson has had a big hand in doing that because,
uh,

643
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:13.640
it's having the money that makes it possible.
Uh,
and so,

644
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:18.590
uh,
you know,
the endowment at Yale is something like $2 million per student now,

645
00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:23.330
uh,
that's just sitting there as money that could be spent.
Uh,

646
00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:28.460
and so,
uh,
uh,
how did he do this?
That's one of the amazing things.

647
00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:32.640
It seems to have something to do.
I think with academic,
um,

648
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:37.560
understanding that being part of a university community,
uh,

649
00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:41.530
is a good thing for investing.
Uh,
and,
uh,
you,

650
00:44:41.531 --> 00:44:45.060
you can see some evidence in that in that Harvard University,

651
00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:49.290
Princeton University and other universities have done extremely well on their

652
00:44:49.291 --> 00:44:52.530
endowments.
However,
not quite as well as Yale.

653
00:44:52.531 --> 00:44:56.340
Yale I think is the number one performer.
So it's,
uh,

654
00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:57.880
it's very interesting that we're able,

655
00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:01.310
it's very significant that we're able to get David Swensen.
Uh,

656
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:06.060
he doesn't do a lot of public speaking,
but he is willing for,
for,
uh,

657
00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:10.950
young people like you to do this.
Um,
so,
uh,

658
00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.840
that's one of our outside speak.

659
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:16.920
He also has two books about investing that we'll talk about.
Um,

660
00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:22.010
the second a person I have set up now to come,
although the date,
uh,

661
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:27.230
on the syllabus online is going to be changed is Andrew Red Leaf,

662
00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:31.980
uh,
who is a Yale,
also a Yale graduate,
uh,

663
00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:37.280
and who set up a hedge fund called white box advisers,
uh,

664
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:41.640
and has done phenomenally well in investing.

665
00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:44.570
And uh,
uh,

666
00:45:45.270 --> 00:45:48.990
so I think I have on the syllabus,

667
00:45:48.991 --> 00:45:50.820
I have a New York Times article about him.

668
00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:54.490
He's a very original and creative thinker,
uh,

669
00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:58.160
who looks at things from a unique perspective of,
uh,

670
00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:02.660
and I find it very interesting talking with him because,
uh,

671
00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:04.740
to do well and invest in,

672
00:46:04.741 --> 00:46:07.620
you have to have your own independent view of things and really be thinking

673
00:46:07.621 --> 00:46:11.700
about how things work.
Uh,
and he is someone who does that.
Incidentally,

674
00:46:11.701 --> 00:46:15.540
the New York Times had another article about a red leaf,
uh,

675
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.910
saying that he was really one of the first person,
uh,

676
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:24.320
to clearly delineate the subprime crisis that we're now in a,

677
00:46:24.691 --> 00:46:28.890
he saw it coming,
and I have to say,
profited from it.
If,
you know,

678
00:46:28.891 --> 00:46:33.540
the subprime crisis is coming,
there's always a way to profit from that.
Uh,

679
00:46:33.541 --> 00:46:37.230
and that's what he did.
But he also has a philanthropic side,

680
00:46:37.231 --> 00:46:42.210
so it all comes up,
uh,
very,
uh,
very well.
So,

681
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:44.190
uh,
uh,

682
00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:49.700
I think in the remaining time I will just go through and outline of the,

683
00:46:51.211 --> 00:46:55.830
um,
an outline of the course,

684
00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:01.170
um,
and,
uh,
that means,
uh,

685
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:05.580
go through the topics of the various lectures.
Uh,

686
00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:10.040
and then I'll let you go for today.
So,
um,

687
00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.450
the way this course is divided up is different than the financial theory course.

688
00:47:15.451 --> 00:47:19.350
If you look at John John Accomplice Course on financial theory,
uh,

689
00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:24.351
he's mathematical concepts are central to his outline of the course,

690
00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.160
but this being a financial markets,

691
00:47:28.161 --> 00:47:33.161
of course I'm dividing it up more in terms of markets and institutions,

692
00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:38.830
but still I want to start with some theory.
Uh,
and I thought that,
uh,

693
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:42.450
well I will,
I plan to start by talking about,
uh,

694
00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:47.530
the basic,
the most basic concepts of risk management,

695
00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:51.720
which underlie finance.
Uh,
and so that will be,
uh,

696
00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:53.110
Wednesday's lecture.

697
00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:57.820
They call it the universal principle of risk management pooling and the hedging

698
00:47:57.821 --> 00:47:59.530
of risk.
Uh,

699
00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:04.570
I think it's the most important theoretical concept that underlies finance and

700
00:48:04.571 --> 00:48:08.260
insurance,
uh,
which we'll also talk about a little bit in this course.

701
00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:12.900
And the idea is that if you spread risks,
uh,
they,

702
00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:15.130
they don't disappear.
They're still there,

703
00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.560
but they're spread out over many people.

704
00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:21.010
And the impact on any one person is reduced.

705
00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:25.540
So the basic principle of insurance is,
uh,
if,
uh,

706
00:48:25.930 --> 00:48:30.130
each person's for each family have suffering is the risk,
for example,
that,
uh,

707
00:48:30.131 --> 00:48:32.980
a parent,
a father or mother might die,

708
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:35.590
which is a terrible blow to the family,

709
00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:40.180
but it's not a blow to society as a whole because people die and it has a

710
00:48:40.181 --> 00:48:41.830
certain statistical regularity.

711
00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:47.280
So it makes sense that we pay families who have lost a father or mother so that

712
00:48:48.761 --> 00:48:49.720
they can keep going.

713
00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:54.280
It benefits everyone to have a situation in place for that.

714
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:59.200
I wanted to talk about that with a little bit of reference to probability
theory.

715
00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:03.880
And so,
uh,
that's what,
uh,
I will be covering the next lecture.

716
00:49:03.881 --> 00:49:07.450
We'll be among the more mathematical,
although it's very elementary,

717
00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.970
if you had a course in probability and statistics,

718
00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:14.170
you'll find it easy to follow.
Uh,

719
00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.440
but it's self contained.
Again.
Uh,

720
00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:21.410
I feel like I have to introduce concepts like variance and covariance and a

721
00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:26.450
correlation in order to talk about finances and that.
So that's what we'll do,
uh,

722
00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:28.940
in lecture two.
Uh,

723
00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:33.760
then the next lecture I wanted to come back to some basic themes,
uh,
that,
uh,

724
00:49:33.761 --> 00:49:38.020
the third lecture about,
uh,
technology.
Uh,

725
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:42.520
and this relates to a,
another book that I wrote or not signing it,

726
00:49:42.521 --> 00:49:46.330
but I wrote a book called New Financial Order,

727
00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:51.160
uh,
in 2003,
uh,

728
00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:56.260
about technology and finance.
And a theme of that book was that,

729
00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.170
uh,
I've already said this to you,

730
00:49:59.171 --> 00:50:03.850
but it's very important point that financial technology is evolving and

731
00:50:03.851 --> 00:50:08.851
improving just the way engineering technology or biochemical technology is

732
00:50:08.981 --> 00:50:13.900
improving.
It's getting better year by year and,
uh,
the,
uh,

733
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.840
course of financing over,
uh,

734
00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:20.550
your lifetime will be dramatic.
So,
uh,

735
00:50:20.740 --> 00:50:25.300
the financial institutions that we have 10 years from now will look very

736
00:50:25.301 --> 00:50:30.020
different from the ones we have now.
Uh,
and,
uh,
uh,

737
00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.150
w w one thing too,

738
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:37.070
we have to understand in understanding the progress of financial technology is

739
00:50:37.071 --> 00:50:41.600
its fundamental relation to information technology,
computers,

740
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:42.261
uh,

741
00:50:42.261 --> 00:50:47.261
the Internet communications devices are fundamental to financial progress and

742
00:50:47.841 --> 00:50:51.380
they make things possible that wouldn't have been possible before.

743
00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:55.310
Often inventions,
uh,
that,
uh,

744
00:50:55.370 --> 00:51:00.370
that you seem in the abstract to be good ideas may be impossible because

745
00:51:00.801 --> 00:51:04.370
something that you have to do to make it actually come into practice is too

746
00:51:04.371 --> 00:51:08.900
expensive.
And so it's not economic to produce an invention,
but then,

747
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.560
uh,

748
00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:14.560
developments in other parts in other fields can change the relative prices and

749
00:51:14.961 --> 00:51:16.310
suddenly make an,

750
00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:21.580
an idea that had been hypothetical and unapplied suddenly work well.

751
00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:28.130
So financial inventions,
uh,
also involve experimentation.

752
00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:32.450
Like in any other invention,
nobody knows what will work.
Uh,

753
00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:37.400
abstract theory doesn't guide you.
Uh,
completely,
uh,
and,
uh,

754
00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:41.960
uh,
once an invention is seen to work,

755
00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:45.140
it is rapidly copied around the world.
Uh,

756
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:49.370
and so we can see various breaks in financial history.
When some new idea,

757
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.420
suddenly it was proven workable.
Uh,

758
00:51:54.020 --> 00:51:58.730
traditionally financial interventions were not granted patent rights.
But now,
uh,

759
00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:01.610
in the United States,
in a number of other countries,

760
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:06.630
it's become possible to patent financial,
uh,
inventions.
Uh,

761
00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:12.050
I know I've done that in my,
uh,
in my life.
Uh,
and so I think it's,

762
00:52:12.051 --> 00:52:16.040
um,
uh,
that gives a different perspective on,
on finance.

763
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:21.950
Uh,
then,
uh,
I want to talk about,
uh,
insurance,

764
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:25.280
uh,
and,
uh,
uh,

765
00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:30.460
the institution of insurance is something that really came in with one of the

766
00:52:30.831 --> 00:52:34.230
earliest,
um,
uh,
I,

767
00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.190
I consider it a division of finance came really in,

768
00:52:37.191 --> 00:52:42.050
in the 16 hundreds when probability theory was invented.
Uh,

769
00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:46.160
the mathematical theory of probability was unknown until that time.

770
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:51.030
And you can see that,
uh,
insurance suddenly made an appearance,
uh,

771
00:52:51.031 --> 00:52:54.200
at that time.
Uh,
and so,
uh,

772
00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:58.380
uh,
I,

773
00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:02.510
this will be historical and as well as theoretical discussion of,

774
00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:04.920
of insurance.
Uh,

775
00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:10.000
then I will move to a portfolio diversification,
uh,

776
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:13.160
and supporting financial institutions.
Uh,

777
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.060
and this is again,
a more theoretical lecture.

778
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:22.160
It will be about the capital asset pricing model.
Uh,
it will be about,

779
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:26.820
uh,
the,
um,
uh,
securities market line about the data,

780
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:29.620
about the mutual fund theorem.
Uh,

781
00:53:29.970 --> 00:53:34.080
but it will also be about institutions that we have about,
uh,
uh,

782
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:35.940
investment companies and their management.

783
00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:39.620
So it's really parallel to an insurance discussion.
Uh,

784
00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:42.660
insurance pools risks,
uh,

785
00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:47.840
like life risks or fire risks by writing policies to individual policy holders.

786
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.273
But,
uh,

787
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:55.710
portfolio management pools risks in a different way by assembling a diversified

788
00:53:55.830 --> 00:54:00.830
portfolio or a portfolio that's negatively correlated with a risk that someone

789
00:54:01.141 --> 00:54:04.020
has
a,

790
00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:08.070
then I want to go to the efficient market's theory.
Okay.

791
00:54:08.071 --> 00:54:12.510
So efficient markets is a theory about,
um,

792
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:18.220
uh,
well it came in about the three decades ago,
uh,

793
00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:20.130
maybe it's closer to four decades ago.

794
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:25.790
It's a theory that financial markets work very well and incorporate information

795
00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:28.680
very well.
Uh,

796
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:32.490
the efficient markets hypothesis was encouraged actually,

797
00:54:32.491 --> 00:54:34.590
the idea goes back over 100 years,

798
00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:39.920
but it's encouraged by the observation that financial markets seem to respond

799
00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:44.400
with great speed to new information.
Uh,

800
00:54:44.401 --> 00:54:46.050
and when new information appears,

801
00:54:46.051 --> 00:54:48.810
prices will suddenly adjust in the financial markets.

802
00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:52.560
Certain kinds of financial markets called prediction markets,

803
00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.210
which may for example,

804
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:58.470
predict the outcome of an election have been seen to be very accurate

805
00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:03.150
predictors.
Uh,
often better than pollsters,
uh,
can manage.

806
00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:08.430
Uh,
and so,
uh,
there seems to be some deep wisdom of the market.

807
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:13.050
Uh,
I think that is an important,
efficient markets is an important concept.

808
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:18.410
On the other hand,
uh,
and this is something that I want to,
uh,
uh,

809
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:23.370
uh,
emphasize that you don't want to carry that too far.

810
00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.680
Uh,
and that,
uh,

811
00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:30.710
one of the lessons of behavioral finance is that markets are not really

812
00:55:31.051 --> 00:55:33.600
efficient in a global sense.
Uh,

813
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:36.870
human psychology drives markets a great deal.

814
00:55:37.530 --> 00:55:39.510
If markets were perfectly efficient,

815
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:43.920
David Swensen could not have done what he did.
Uh,

816
00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:48.900
it would be not possible to make a access returns in finance.

817
00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:52.080
Uh,
I believe it's clear that it is,

818
00:55:52.410 --> 00:55:57.300
and that people who do that are people who understand more than the core

819
00:55:57.301 --> 00:56:01.290
efficient markets theory.
They understand something about human nature,

820
00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:06.860
how the human nature interacts with our institutions.
Uh,

821
00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:10.520
the next lecture is about behavioral finance.
Uh,

822
00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:15.150
and so I want to talk in that lecture about research in psychology,

823
00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:18.660
uh,
things that come out of the,
another department here,

824
00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:20.850
the psychology department,
which,
uh,

825
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:25.780
have traditionally been in economics.
And finance,
but are,

826
00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:28.340
are coming back more.
Uh,

827
00:56:28.570 --> 00:56:32.390
I want to talk about Conaman and diversity's prospect theory,
which is a,

828
00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:35.330
uh,
very important.
Um,

829
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:40.180
and this'll be a little technical psychologist can become mathematical and

830
00:56:40.181 --> 00:56:41.080
technical as well.

831
00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.160
It'll be an important part of our understanding of financial markets.

832
00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:50.830
Uh,
no.
I want to talk in the next lecture about regulation.

833
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:53.910
Uh,
and that means,
uh,

834
00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:58.360
government oversight of financial market and not just government oversight.

835
00:56:58.540 --> 00:57:03.540
There are also the so called self regulatory organizations that are created in

836
00:57:04.151 --> 00:57:09.100
the financial industry to self regulate.
So,
uh,
for example,
Finra,

837
00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:13.270
uh,
which used to be called the National Association of securities dealers is an

838
00:57:13.271 --> 00:57:16.840
organization,
a membership organization of uh,

839
00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:21.220
people in the financial community and it imposes rules on its member.

840
00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:25.510
It's not a government organization,
uh,
but it's a regulator.

841
00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:30.300
Uh,
and uh,
the problem is that,
uh,

842
00:57:30.370 --> 00:57:35.200
not everyone is nice and not one.
Everyone is high minded.
Uh,

843
00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:38.110
and so,
uh,
financial markets,

844
00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:44.160
the success of financial markets is in many ways a success of regulation.

845
00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:45.843
Uh,

846
00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:51.120
governments establish regulators who set down rules for participants in

847
00:57:51.610 --> 00:57:53.200
financial markets.
Uh,

848
00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:57.940
and these rules may be perceived as honorous and costly to people in the

849
00:57:57.941 --> 00:58:01.810
financial community,
but ultimately it's their salvation.

850
00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:06.340
It's what makes everything possible.
Uh,
after that,

851
00:58:06.341 --> 00:58:10.900
I want to talk about,
uh,
about,
uh,
debt markets now.

852
00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:15.700
Um,
that is,
uh,
the simplest of financial instruments.

853
00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:19.460
It consists of a promise to pay,
uh,

854
00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:24.570
usually in denominated in currency and there are both long term and short term

855
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:28.600
debt instruments.

856
00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:33.910
The shortest term a debt instrument in the United States is the federal funds

857
00:58:33.911 --> 00:58:38.410
rate,
which is an overnight rate,
one day maturity.

858
00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:40.060
And uh,

859
00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:44.410
the longest issued by the government is a 30 year government bond.

860
00:58:45.070 --> 00:58:48.790
So that will be repaid three decades in the future.

861
00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.410
There have also been hundred year bonds and they've also been perpetuities,
uh,

862
00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:56.290
that,
uh,
uh,
in the UK for example,

863
00:58:56.430 --> 00:59:01.360
the British console's which have no expiration date there infinite maturity.

864
00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.910
Uh,
so,
uh,

865
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:09.480
the debt market is something worthy of study because it really represents a

866
00:59:10.691 --> 00:59:12.880
market for time itself.

867
00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:16.810
What is it that we're talking about when we talk about the rate of interest?

868
00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:21.130
It has units of time.
It represents the price of time.

869
00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:26.860
And it is something that fluctuates through time as well in interesting

870
00:59:27.141 --> 00:59:28.590
patterns.
Uh,

871
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:33.640
and there are very important drivers of our economy and our lives.

872
00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.320
And,
uh,
uh,

873
00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:41.920
the theory of the term structure is the theory of how interest rates differ

874
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:48.360
through according to maturity or term.
Uh,

875
00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:53.000
there are not only a debt instruments that are related to that are payable in

876
00:59:53.001 --> 00:59:53.750
currency.

877
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:58.750
There are also indexed that instruments that are indexed to the price level.

878
00:59:59.270 --> 01:00:03.950
And so they give real,
uh,
they give real interest rates.

879
01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:04.851
Uh,

880
01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:09.851
and we've had episodes in our history when real interest rates have made major

881
01:00:09.951 --> 01:00:14.450
moves.
And these movements are very important for what is happening in our lives.

882
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:18.980
Most recently for a few years,
a few years ago,
we have,

883
01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:22.710
we're living in a regime of negative real interest rates,
uh,

884
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:26.720
when the Fed was pursuing a very aggressive monetary policy.

885
01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:29.600
I suspect that with the subprime crisis,

886
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:33.860
the Fed will be pushing real interest rates down dramatically again,

887
01:00:33.861 --> 01:00:38.440
and we may again be in a period of negative real interest rates.
Um,

888
01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:44.130
after that,
I want to talk about the stock market.
Uh,
and I wanted,
uh,

889
01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:45.260
there's a lot to talk about.

890
01:00:45.290 --> 01:00:50.290
Of course stocks are shares in companies and they're traded on stock exchanges.

891
01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:55.970
Uh,
and,
uh,
they're interesting,
uh,

892
01:00:56.090 --> 01:01:00.590
to analyze,
uh,
because they,
uh,
they,
uh,

893
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:05.360
there's a sort of ambiguity about stocks that is not widely perceived by a lot

894
01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:10.130
of people.
Uh,
and that is that the share repurchase,
uh,

895
01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:14.150
can change the units of measurement in a security,
uh,

896
01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:19.070
and companies have to decide on how leveraged the stock will be.

897
01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:22.430
Uh,
and so that changes the stock price leverage,

898
01:01:22.431 --> 01:01:26.840
meaning how much debt does the company take on?
Uh,
and moreover,

899
01:01:26.841 --> 01:01:30.290
companies have to decide how much dividends to pay on the stock.

900
01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:34.090
That's a decision of the management of the company.
Uh,

901
01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:38.450
and we have to understand how do they make that decision and what does that mean

902
01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:42.770
to people who aren't valuing stocks.
It's a very simple idea,

903
01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:46.250
the idea of dividing a company up into shares and selling them off.

904
01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:50.350
But in practice it involves a lot of complexities.
Uh,

905
01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:52.310
so we'll be talking about the motor,

906
01:01:52.311 --> 01:01:57.311
Yani Miller theorem and related issues in this lecture as well as about

907
01:01:57.681 --> 01:02:02.660
something about the behavior of the stock market and the tendency of it to go

908
01:02:02.661 --> 01:02:07.610
through dramatic movements,
uh,
as for example,
it has done recently.

909
01:02:07.611 --> 01:02:10.040
If you've been following it earlier this year,

910
01:02:11.450 --> 01:02:13.400
the next lecture will be about real estate.

911
01:02:13.610 --> 01:02:17.720
And that brings us in very much into the subprime crisis and it brings,

912
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:22.350
it connects up with interests that are central to,
to my own,
uh,
thinking.

913
01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:27.840
Uh,
the housing market is a huge market right now.

914
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:32.870
The total value of single family homes in the United States is about $2

915
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:37.650
trillion.
Uh,
and,
uh,
uh,
the,

916
01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.450
the market has becoming,

917
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:42.990
has been becoming increasingly speculative.

918
01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:48.390
Home prices have gotten unstable.
So nationally,

919
01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:53.570
home prices in the United States rose 85% between 1997 and 2006.

920
01:02:56.010 --> 01:02:59.400
In real terms,
incorrect inflation corrected term,

921
01:02:59.610 --> 01:03:04.610
we've seen almost a doubling in the price of the average home in the United

922
01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:08.130
States.
Why did that happen?
Now they are falling.

923
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.260
And so in real terms,

924
01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:15.470
home prices have fallen almost 10% since the peak in 2006.

925
01:03:16.590 --> 01:03:18.870
This is not just a US phenomenon.

926
01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:22.730
Many countries of the world,
uh,

927
01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:27.830
are experiencing home priced booms and the beginning of what might be a home

928
01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:33.420
price bust.
Uh,
so I want to consider,
uh,

929
01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:36.870
the market for homes,
uh,
and,
uh,

930
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:39.390
also about the market for mortgages,

931
01:03:39.391 --> 01:03:42.630
which are the instruments that finance homes.

932
01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.250
To what extent was the housing boom that we saw in recent years?

933
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:52.200
The result of revolution in financial technology.
Uh,

934
01:03:52.201 --> 01:03:55.980
there's been a lot of changes in our mortgage institutions and that might be

935
01:03:55.981 --> 01:04:00.420
part of the reason for the boom in home prices.
Uh,
and so,

936
01:04:00.421 --> 01:04:03.120
but there's also a question of,
uh,
psychology.

937
01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:08.520
The next lecture we will be about banking.
Uh,
and about,

938
01:04:08.580 --> 01:04:13.140
uh,
the,
uh,
the supply of money.
Uh,

939
01:04:13.170 --> 01:04:16.710
the money multiplier.
Uh,
it's about,
uh,

940
01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:20.550
how banks operate,
what their function is and our society.

941
01:04:20.551 --> 01:04:25.230
Why are they such important institutions that have gone back for hundreds of

942
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:30.210
years,
uh,
and remain powerful central fee features in our economy.

943
01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:34.770
It's also about bank regulation such things as the Basel accord,

944
01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:36.660
Basel one and Basel two.

945
01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:42.440
I want to also talk about the impact of information and technology and banking.

946
01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:48.450
Uh,
the next lecture is about monetary policy.
Uh,
the,
uh,

947
01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:51.030
what the central banks do in the United States.

948
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:54.990
The central bank is called the Federal Reserve.
Uh,
in the United Kingdom,

949
01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:59.400
it's the Bank of England and Japan has the Bank of Japan and the,
uh,

950
01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:03.230
and in Europe it's the European Central Bank.
Uh,

951
01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:08.430
all of these banks are really in control of short term interest rates.

952
01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:12.820
Uh,
and these interest rates are used to try to,
uh,

953
01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:16.150
to manage and stabilize the economy,
uh,

954
01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:20.650
in response to the subprime crisis that we are now in our central bank.

955
01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:24.610
The Federal Reserve has been cutting interest rates aggressively to try to save

956
01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.770
a economy that appears to be declining.

957
01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:29.710
I want to try to understand in that lecture,

958
01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:35.010
help us understand how this works and how we're getting,
uh,

959
01:05:35.710 --> 01:05:38.560
uh,
how we're getting,
uh,
uh,

960
01:05:39.010 --> 01:05:42.580
solutions or possible solutions to these problems.

961
01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:45.580
Then I want to talk about investment banking.

962
01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:49.320
Now an investment bank is a different kind of bank.
Uh,

963
01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:55.320
I was talking up to this point about commercial banks and investment bank is not

964
01:05:55.690 --> 01:06:00.250
a bank that accepts deposits.
It doesn't deal with the general public.

965
01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:04.000
It deals instead with financial institutions.
Uh,

966
01:06:04.001 --> 01:06:09.001
and it gets involved in a underwriting of securities for financial institutions.

967
01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:14.470
It's a very important industry and it's also one that many of our students,
uh,

968
01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:19.090
have found jobs in.
So I think it's important for us to try to understand,

969
01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:24.580
uh,
the,
the history of investment banks,
the role that they have in our financial,

970
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:29.230
uh,
community,
uh,
and how they're regulated.
Uh,

971
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:33.310
then I want to talk about money managers,
professional money managers,

972
01:06:33.311 --> 01:06:36.220
people like David Swensen.
Uh,
these are our people,

973
01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:40.930
our community of people in a different segment of the,
of the financial industry.

974
01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:45.910
These are people who manage portfolios.
Uh,
and,
uh,

975
01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:47.973
uh,

976
01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:53.470
we want to think about what kinds of forces operate on them,

977
01:06:53.471 --> 01:06:55.270
what kind of,
uh,
um,

978
01:06:55.540 --> 01:07:00.540
I'm interested in viewing them partly as people who are very expert in a certain

979
01:07:00.761 --> 01:07:05.240
kind of technology who live in a very competitive environment.
Uh,

980
01:07:05.890 --> 01:07:09.400
and try to understand why some of them succeed much more than others,

981
01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:13.820
but it also relates to behavioral finance.
Uh,
and that is that,
uh,

982
01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:17.560
ultimately they are human beings like anyone else.

983
01:07:17.830 --> 01:07:22.570
And some of their differences in success or failure may have to do with their

984
01:07:22.571 --> 01:07:26.630
own,
uh,
interconnections and their own,
uh,
uh,
uh,

985
01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:30.910
psychology and inner personal psychology.
Uh,

986
01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:36.980
then I want to talk about brokerages.
Those are institutions that,

987
01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:42.260
that arrange for or manage the buying and selling of financial assets,

988
01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:46.550
such things as the New York Stock Exchange.
Uh,

989
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:48.820
now the brokerage industry,

990
01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:52.960
the New York Stock Exchange goes back into the 18th century.
It's very old.

991
01:07:53.350 --> 01:07:54.220
And in fact,

992
01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:59.500
the idea of exotic exchange goes back to the 14th century.
Uh,

993
01:07:59.501 --> 01:08:04.140
went in Flanders,
the first stock exchange called the Boris,
uh,
was,
uh,

994
01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.720
established.
So it goes back many hundreds of years,

995
01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:12.490
but it's in rapid change now because of information technology.

996
01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.340
And,
uh,
it's one of the most rapidly changing,

997
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:18.900
hard to keep up with areas,
uh,

998
01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:23.570
because someone can set up an electronic exchange over night and suddenly

999
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.360
become,
uh,
uh,

1000
01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.350
a base for a trading of trillions of dollars,
uh,

1001
01:08:30.351 --> 01:08:33.820
of,
uh,
of securities.
Uh,
so that's it.

1002
01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:37.850
It fits in well with the theme of this course about technology because in

1003
01:08:38.690 --> 01:08:42.890
understanding what's happening with brokerages,
uh,
our technology,
uh,

1004
01:08:42.891 --> 01:08:45.560
that the new information technology is central,

1005
01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:51.590
then I want to move to futures markets and forward markets.

1006
01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.420
Uh,
and,
uh,
uh,

1007
01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:59.020
a forward contract is a contract made between two parties for execution in the

1008
01:08:59.841 --> 01:09:03.380
future.
Uh,
they're called generally,

1009
01:09:03.381 --> 01:09:07.250
these are called over the counter contracts because they're not arranged through

1010
01:09:07.251 --> 01:09:08.084
exchanges.

1011
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:13.870
We also have standardized contracts that are traded on exchanges and they're

1012
01:09:14.061 --> 01:09:16.680
called futures contracts.
Uh,

1013
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:22.030
futures contracts were invented in Japan in the 16 hundreds at Osaka.

1014
01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:26.150
Uh,
and they were developed for the rice market in Japan.

1015
01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:30.020
They were uniquely Japanese until pretty much the 19th century,

1016
01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:34.790
and then they were copied all over the world,
uh,
and are now very important.

1017
01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:39.270
Uh,
I'm going to talk about a one futures market that,
um,

1018
01:09:39.350 --> 01:09:41.660
I have been an instrumental in developing.

1019
01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:46.070
I've been working with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to create a futures

1020
01:09:46.071 --> 01:09:47.750
market for a single family homes.

1021
01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:51.690
And that's sort of my connection to the futures industry.
Uh,

1022
01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:55.350
but of course there are many futures markets and we'll talk about,
uh,

1023
01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.260
they're very interesting to me.
Uh,

1024
01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:01.070
and I wonder why the business community isn't more aware of it,

1025
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:05.290
but a futures market has a prediction,
uh,

1026
01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:09.590
going out years into the future of what every financial variable we'll be doing.

1027
01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:13.890
So you can see the future in a sense through the futures prices.
Uh,

1028
01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:16.750
it's not always correct to think of it that way,
but,
uh,

1029
01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:19.100
we have to get into the theory of futures markets.

1030
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:22.430
In many cases that is not the right way to think about futures prices,

1031
01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:27.400
but there are very important futures markets that,
uh,
uh,
there are.
Uh,

1032
01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:31.520
and so in the next lecture I want to talk about,
uh,
the,
uh,

1033
01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.940
number of the various kinds of futures markets that matter.

1034
01:10:35.150 --> 01:10:39.230
We have a stock index futures markets and know that we have an oil futures

1035
01:10:39.231 --> 01:10:42.270
market.
Uh,
the oil futures market,
uh,

1036
01:10:42.830 --> 01:10:47.830
is very significant because it represents the price of energy on dates into the

1037
01:10:50.811 --> 01:10:55.520
future.
We can now see the price of oil going out years into the future.

1038
01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.970
We've just hit $100 a barrel price of oil.
Uh,

1039
01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.250
but what does that mean?

1040
01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:05.390
Does that mean we're going to live in a world with a hundred dollar oil?
Well,

1041
01:11:05.391 --> 01:11:06.920
not if you look at the futures market,

1042
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:11.570
which is in backwardation now and it's predicting major drops in the oil price

1043
01:11:11.571 --> 01:11:16.400
of oil.
Uh,
then I want to talk about options markets.

1044
01:11:16.410 --> 01:11:18.180
This is getting close to the end of the course.

1045
01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:21.570
An option is the right to buy something.

1046
01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:23.970
Typically we think of it as a stock option.

1047
01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:29.540
A and option is a contract that says you can buy so many shares of,

1048
01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:35.000
of a,
of a company.
Uh,
the options have been traded,
uh,

1049
01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.540
now for several decades starting with the Chicago board options exchange,

1050
01:11:39.541 --> 01:11:42.240
but now many options exchanges,
uh,

1051
01:11:43.050 --> 01:11:46.530
and we have prices of options that change minute by minute.

1052
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:50.430
And what did these changes in these prices mean?
Uh,

1053
01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.000
and the options are very useful technology for managing of risks.

1054
01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.350
Uh,
and uh,
uh,

1055
01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:02.550
I think that we'll see a rapid over the next few decades.

1056
01:12:02.551 --> 01:12:07.170
Was he rapid expansion in the scope of options contracts traded on the

1057
01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:11.160
exchanges.
And finally,
the last lecture for this semester,

1058
01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.330
I want to talk about,
uh,

1059
01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:17.280
told us together and talk about one of the themes that,
uh,

1060
01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:21.240
or summarize in terms of a theme of this course,

1061
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:24.780
which is the democratization of finance.
Uh,

1062
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:29.870
finance used to be a very esoteric field that only a few people in London and

1063
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:35.940
terrorists and other worlds centers understood.

1064
01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:41.570
It has an Amsterdam and other places where financial technology emerged,

1065
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:46.920
but it's becoming democratized with each year that goes by,

1066
01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:52.070
the concepts of finance are being applied more broadly and involving more and

1067
01:12:53.071 --> 01:12:56.370
more people with electronic technology.

1068
01:12:56.580 --> 01:13:01.580
It's becoming more economical to offer sophisticated financial services to

1069
01:13:02.161 --> 01:13:06.490
everyone.
And this is a thing that we're seeing,
I think,
uh,

1070
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:10.860
the subprime crisis that is the current financial crisis,
uh,

1071
01:13:10.861 --> 01:13:15.330
highlights this very well.
What does sub prime mean?
Well,

1072
01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.140
I think it stands for the general population.

1073
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:24.590
The subprime mortgage market was bringing people in to the mortgage market,

1074
01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.720
who in prior decades would not have been involved,

1075
01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:32.940
would not have had any mortgage.
The problem,
of course,

1076
01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:37.710
with the democratization of finance is that if you raise the participation in

1077
01:13:37.711 --> 01:13:38.640
financial markets,

1078
01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:42.990
you bring in people who are less and less knowledgeable and less and less

1079
01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:48.020
understanding of concepts of finance and less capable and more vulnerable to

1080
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:52.590
exploitation.
So the democratization of finances,

1081
01:13:52.591 --> 01:13:57.180
I think the ultimate mission of,
uh,
that I find central to this course,

1082
01:13:57.630 --> 01:14:00.090
but it brings with it dangerous and hazards.

1083
01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:02.850
And we have to think very carefully about how we do it.
