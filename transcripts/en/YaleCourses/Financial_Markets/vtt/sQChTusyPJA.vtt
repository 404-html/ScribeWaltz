1
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.450
Today,
I want to talk about options.
Uh,

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.600
and uh,
uh,
wait,
wait,
wait.

3
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.660
I should just say what an option is.
Uh,
I'll write the word.

4
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.483
Uh,

5
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.770
it's a contract that has an owner and the owner of the option contract has

6
00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:34.330
rights defined in the contract,
uh,

7
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.870
either to buy or sell some thing,

8
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.990
let's say a share of stock at a specified price and specified date.

9
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.650
Okay.
So there's two kinds.

10
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.780
There's a put and a call.
Okay.

11
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.600
I'm a put option is the right to sell.

12
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.510
Uh,
it's typically a hundred shares,

13
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:07.511
so we'll say a hundred shares of a company and let's say it's Google.

14
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.200
Okay.
Okay.
So,
uh,
the option would have,
um,

15
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.900
if it was a put option and there was a price,

16
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.620
then you would have the right up and,
well,
uh,

17
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.730
let me see.
There's the exercise price

18
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.820
also known as the strike,

19
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.980
uh,
and was the exercise

20
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.273
<v 1>date.</v>

21
00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.180
<v 0>Okay.
Um,
so,
um,</v>

22
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.240
I should also emphasize that there are two kinds of op of options.

23
00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.870
There are American,

24
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.480
so called,
uh,

25
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.710
and European,
so called,

26
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.160
it has nothing to do with whether they are in America or Europe because in

27
00:02:13.371 --> 00:02:17.150
Europe they trade both American options and European options.

28
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.390
And in America they trade both American Hopkins and European options.

29
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.840
So it's very unfortunate terminology.
Uh,

30
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.240
the American,
what does this mean?

31
00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:34.241
An American option means the right to exercise the option on any date until and

32
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:40.160
including the exercise date.

33
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.880
And with European it's only on exercise date.

34
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.460
So,
uh,
that's what those words mean.

35
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.920
So usually we're talking about American options.
Uh,

36
00:02:57.921 --> 00:03:02.020
and so if have an American option,
um,

37
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.360
American put option on a shares of some stock,

38
00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:08.743
uh,

39
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.770
then you have the right anytime you feel like it until the exercise date to sell

40
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.480
that option,
uh,

41
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.310
at the price specified in the contract called the exercise price.

42
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:26.523
Okay.

43
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.330
If it's European and you have to wait until the exercise date and then,

44
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.380
um,
then you have one day when you can do that.

45
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.580
A call option is the right to buy.
Okay.
Uh,

46
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.390
a share of stock or whatever it is,
whatever is specified in the option.

47
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.300
Uh,
and in a traditional option,
there's two,

48
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.880
there's two parties,
there's the buyer of the option

49
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.400
and usually we present them from the perspective of the buyer of the option.

50
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.350
A,
the buyer of the option pays a price to buy the option,

51
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.840
not to be confused with the exercise price.
Uh,
and then,

52
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.000
uh,
has,
depending on whether it's American or European,

53
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.930
has until the exercise date to,
uh,

54
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.060
to exercise the option.
But the buyer doesn't have to do anything.

55
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.070
You can just do nothing and we buy the option.
And if you do nothing,
uh,

56
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.960
it becomes worthless because the only way the option ever gives you value after

57
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:41.380
you buy it,
if you exercise it,
meaning you say,

58
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:44.710
I will use my right to two by herself,

59
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.790
the other party is the writer

60
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.100
of the option because it's a contract.

61
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.500
It has to be between two parties.

62
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.970
So if somebody is on the other side,

63
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.070
okay.
And you can do either one,
you can either buy or write an option.

64
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.220
Um,
okay.
So,
um,

65
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.650
if you it this clear,
uh,

66
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.190
if you write a call option,

67
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.800
then what you are committing yourself to do as the writer,

68
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.210
you sign the contract from the,
uh,
the writer's contract,

69
00:05:31.211 --> 00:05:36.160
which goes along with the virus,
a contract which provides rights to the buyer.

70
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.980
If you write a call option,

71
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.890
then you and say it's American,

72
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.250
then you are signing a contract and let's say it's on stock to deliver 100

73
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:52.540
shares,
uh,
to the other guy,
the buyer.

74
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:54.810
Uh,
whenever that guy,

75
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.830
it feels like it and that guy will pay you the contracted price.

76
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.150
And so it's not,

77
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.740
it doesn't seem like much fun to be a writer of an option because you have,

78
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.090
you're just sitting there waiting for this other person to make up his or her

79
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:15.290
mind.
Uh,
but,
but there's,
there's a benefit,

80
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.320
namely you get the money that the buyer of the option pays you upfront for

81
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:24.050
providing this right to the buyer.

82
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.180
A and so writers have options,
uh,
right.
Them,

83
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:30.320
uh,

84
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.320
hoping that they expire on exercised and that's when they make money.

85
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.620
If you write an option and the buyer of the option,

86
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.910
Paisley of the money up front,
and then you never hear from the buyer again,

87
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.150
then you're in.
That's,
that's the way you'd like it.

88
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.780
And so you make money by writing options

89
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.710
and hoping that they don't get exercised.
Okay.

90
00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.060
And of course you can write a put option a,

91
00:07:02.061 --> 00:07:06.350
and that means if you write a put option,

92
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.060
you are signing a contract that says that whenever this other guy on the other

93
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:15.710
side,
the buyer decides to that guy,

94
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:17.510
we'll,
uh,

95
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.310
we'll sell you a 100 shares at the specified price.

96
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:26.510
Okay.
So,
um,
again,

97
00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:29.800
you're laying yourself open to whenever this guy wants to,
uh,

98
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:34.430
you've got to receive a hundred chairs,
uh,
and uh,
uh,

99
00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:39.050
and pay the money.
Okay.
Now,
um,

100
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.070
these kinds of contracts are very old.

101
00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.680
Uh,
and in fact,

102
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.630
we had a conference over the weekend at the Yale School of Management,

103
00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.310
uh,
on,
uh,
it was a very interesting comment.

104
00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:01.010
I've never experienced anything quite like it.

105
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.770
Maybe I should put the website up for you to look at it.
Uh,
there's a book,

106
00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:10.700
Oh,
it's called the great

107
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:15.080
mirror of folly

108
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:21.570
written in 1720,
uh,

109
00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.830
about the stock market.
Uh,

110
00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:28.640
and the Vikki rare book library has a copy of it.
Uh,

111
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.410
they're very rare,
uh,
uh,

112
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.000
about the stock market crash of 1720.
Um,

113
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:40.260
did you know that there was a big stock market crash in the year 1720.

114
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:44.910
Um,
what was happening in new haven in 1720?
Well,

115
00:08:44.911 --> 00:08:49.140
I know one thing that was happening in 1720,
you in new haven,

116
00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.260
I'm guessing,
I'm pretty,
pretty sure you've had some pretty angry investors,
uh,

117
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.610
who lost everything in the stock market,

118
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:02.150
but it couldn't have been the US stock market,
which wasn't created yet.
Uh,
this,

119
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:07.730
the crash of 1720 was primarily in Paris and London

120
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.920
also last year.
So Amsterdam,

121
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.840
uh,
those were the financial centers of the world.
So I'm speculating.

122
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.790
There must've been someone here in new haven,
uh,
probably Yale University.

123
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.120
He lost in this crash.
I don't know.
Um,

124
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:32.340
it must have been someone here who lost,

125
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.660
it was a huge and devastating stock market.
And this is the first one,
actually,

126
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.270
the first stock market crash.
Uh,

127
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.170
and so we had a lot of fun at this conference and I'm,
it just relates to option,

128
00:09:44.171 --> 00:09:47.640
I'll tell you why it relates to options because people were writing options

129
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.710
Galore in 1720 on stocks.
Uh,

130
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.370
so the,
the,
the,
the book the great,

131
00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.300
so he does it well if you search on Great Mirror of folly,
uh,

132
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.620
on the web,

133
00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.850
it'll come up with our conference and proceeding.

134
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.220
And since this book,
uh,
you know,

135
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.930
copyrights expire after a,
what's a complicated formula,

136
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:16.890
but in less than a century.
So this is all public domain.
So yeah,

137
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:18.840
it has it up on the web and you can read the whole book.

138
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.030
Unfortunately it's written in Dutch,
but which might deter some of you,

139
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.640
but it has lots of pictures.
And we had great fun.
So at this conference,
um,
the,

140
00:10:29.641 --> 00:10:33.780
uh,
it was the most interdisciplinary conference I've ever seen,

141
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.600
uh,
because we had professors from the art history,

142
00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:44.730
comparative literature,
Finance,
economics,
psychology,

143
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.980
uh,
and we had scholars from all over the world who knew about the year 17,
20,

144
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:55.370
uh,
including a lot of Dutch,
a Dutch men who are here.
Uh,
because,

145
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.030
uh,
but anyway,

146
00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.040
the highlight of it was a highlight for me was it had we saw a picture of an

147
00:11:03.271 --> 00:11:06.690
option from this time,
uh,

148
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:11.770
an option contract to buy stocks,
uh,
from Amsterdam.
Uh,

149
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:17.100
and it showed,
it was a printed form.
They had printed forms back.

150
00:11:17.101 --> 00:11:18.330
Now,
at least in Holland,
they did.

151
00:11:18.331 --> 00:11:21.600
So offender had printed up with blanks to fill in as a place to fill in the

152
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.690
exercise price.
And the exercise date,

153
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:27.930
I don't know whether it was American or European at the time,

154
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:33.090
but I'm sure if it was American,
they didn't call it an American option in 1720.

155
00:11:33.091 --> 00:11:36.450
They didn't even call them options because it's all in Dutch.
So I don't know.
Uh,

156
00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:40.080
it was some other word,
not options.
Uh,

157
00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:43.160
Brian just saying this because the,

158
00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.890
the other interesting thing about 1720 is that,
uh,

159
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.150
they didn't make the same distinction between investing in gambling that we do

160
00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:53.620
now.
So right now,
uh,

161
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.620
anyone on Wall Street is very low as to be,

162
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.180
have any suggestion of a connection with gambling.

163
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.020
Uh,
and so,
but back then they didn't care.

164
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.790
And so lots of socks would have lotteries attached or a,

165
00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.120
there'd be all kinds of,
is something called a Tontine,
uh,

166
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:18.130
where a group of investors would invest in something and then all the money

167
00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:22.760
would go to the last one to die.
Well,
after all of them died,
but one,
ah,

168
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:26.560
that's a sort of gambling.
I don't know what sense it makes,
but they did that.

169
00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.110
<v 2>Uh,
but,
uh,</v>

170
00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.600
<v 0>I remember the old story and,
uh,
I,</v>

171
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.250
I just heard this somewhere from the 1920s to brokers in the New York Stock

172
00:12:38.251 --> 00:12:42.000
Exchange floor.
We're talking to each other and one of them says,

173
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:47.130
I'll bet you $5 that the market's gonna go up.
And then they senior man,

174
00:12:47.131 --> 00:12:51.270
then Scott scolded him and said,
are you betting,

175
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.651
uh,
you know,

176
00:12:52.651 --> 00:12:57.180
you will be thrown off this floor permanently if I hear that word again.
Um,

177
00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.940
so that attitude has persisted.

178
00:12:59.941 --> 00:13:03.120
That investing should be distinguished from gambling.

179
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:07.800
And I suppose there's good reason for that because gambling instincts can take

180
00:13:07.801 --> 00:13:09.510
hold of us.
Uh,

181
00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:14.070
and investing has a good purpose.
Uh,

182
00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.970
unfortunately our emotions can carry us away from the good purpose.

183
00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:23.040
And gambling is not,
uh,
investing,
uh,
back in 1720,

184
00:13:23.041 --> 00:13:26.580
the distinction was not so clear.
Uh,

185
00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:30.800
and this event was so,
uh,

186
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:35.160
it got the reason they call it the book Great Mirror of folly is that the event

187
00:13:35.161 --> 00:13:39.210
got totally crazy.
I mean,
people were squandering their life fortunes.

188
00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:40.873
<v 2>Uh,</v>

189
00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:42.880
<v 0>well I'll tell you one more story.</v>

190
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:47.290
We had a great time at this conference because this book mirror Fala includes

191
00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:52.291
plays that were written in 1720 and performed in Amsterdam about the crash,

192
00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:56.950
about the stock market crash.
So,
um,
uh,

193
00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.780
the organizers of this conference got some students from Saybrook college to

194
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:05.380
perform.
One of the plays from Great Mirror falling.

195
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:09.220
Is anyone here from Saybrook?
Okay.
You weren't in the,

196
00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:13.780
I didn't see you there though.
Um,
and so,
uh,

197
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:19.320
there was a scene in the play where a young woman is being told by her father

198
00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:25.800
that he intends for her to marry a very promising young man who is speculating

199
00:14:26.591 --> 00:14:28.540
and stocks and we'll soon be rich.

200
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.230
And he is very skeptical about being forced to marry.
Uh,

201
00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.010
she has somebody else in mind.
Uh,

202
00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:40.120
and but the father says that other young man is worthless.

203
00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.590
He'll never amount to anything,

204
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:46.660
but she stuck by her guns and insisted that I will never marry a man who is in

205
00:14:46.661 --> 00:14:48.820
love with the stock market.
Um,

206
00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.280
we don't know what happened cause it's all fictional.
But as we know,

207
00:14:52.281 --> 00:14:56.510
the whole stock market crash that she was right and two counts probably

208
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.820
anywhere.
That's all about our options are very old.
Uh,

209
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:03.110
and uh,

210
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:08.200
but they've emerged more recently as very important,
um,

211
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.460
contracts and in particular,
um,
what,

212
00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:13.610
what they didn't have in 17,

213
00:15:13.611 --> 00:15:18.430
23 if they didn't have anywhere until recently,
uh,

214
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:21.290
is uh,
an options exchange.

215
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:24.150
So,
uh,

216
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:29.150
the problem with a traditional option is that it's a contract between two

217
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:34.520
parties.
Okay?
Uh,
and if you write a few,
buy an option,

218
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:36.860
you're at the mercy of this other person.

219
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.170
So if you buy an option that was written by a broker as they were in 1720,

220
00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:47.540
uh,
what if the other guy doesn't,
he just dips town,
he's gone.

221
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.430
You bought this option to either by herself and then when the date comes,

222
00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.580
you can't find this guy.
So what do you do?

223
00:15:56.150 --> 00:16:00.980
You obviously were cheated out of your money.
So,
uh,

224
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.900
we created,
uh,

225
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:06.320
that was a problem until 1973

226
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:13.010
when the first options exchanged open.

227
00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:20.190
But I think there may have been ways of dealing with the problem,
uh,
but not,
uh,

228
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:25.250
before 73.
But,
uh,
this is the first,
uh,
options exchange,

229
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:28.340
Chicago board options exchange,

230
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.280
which was a spinoff of the Chicago Board of trade.
Uh,

231
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:34.363
and,
uh,

232
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:39.790
now what they did is they organized a central marketplace for a standardized

233
00:16:41.661 --> 00:16:46.100
options.
Options used to be written for whatever exercise date anybody wanted,

234
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.200
Eh,
eh,
there was no,

235
00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:51.710
there was no standardization.

236
00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:55.940
It's like an options exchange is like creating a futures market when you only

237
00:16:55.941 --> 00:16:59.050
had a forward market in the past.
So,
um,

238
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:05.410
they started trading options on us stocks in 1973 and they require that the

239
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.183
writer,

240
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:17.080
the writer of a naked call has to put up margin.

241
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:22.400
Okay,
what does a naked call,
if you write a call,

242
00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:27.430
you are standing ready to sell a hundred shares to the buyer whenever that buyer

243
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:34.290
decides if it's American to do that.
But,
uh,

244
00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:39.800
uh,
if you're naked,
if you don't own a hundred shares,

245
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.320
well one way you can do is you can,
uh,

246
00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:45.270
you can show that you own a hundred shares a,

247
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:50.170
so there's no way that you could fail to deliver.
But,
uh,

248
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:51.960
if you're naked,

249
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:57.060
then you are required to put up margin and the margin is a,

250
00:17:57.061 --> 00:18:01.470
an amount that was enough so that if you fail to deliver,

251
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.560
the CVOE could access your margin account and buy the shares on the market to

252
00:18:09.181 --> 00:18:12.300
sell to the,
uh,
the buyer.

253
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.660
And there'd be enough money to do that.
Uh,

254
00:18:15.661 --> 00:18:19.740
and so the margin requirement for the writer,
uh,

255
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.790
holds mix.

256
00:18:21.791 --> 00:18:26.791
The contract is secure so that there is really no counterparty risk with

257
00:18:27.511 --> 00:18:31.980
options,
uh,
purchased on an options exchange.
Now there's many options,

258
00:18:31.981 --> 00:18:36.240
exchanges,
but the CVOE I'm just listing it was,
was the first,

259
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:40.560
uh,
so,
uh,

260
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:45.720
now our futures exchanges,
so options on futures,

261
00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:51.750
uh,
that's the same thing as an option on a stock,

262
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:56.460
but instead of a stock contract,
it's a futures contract.
So,

263
00:18:56.461 --> 00:19:00.960
uh,
and that would be done at,
uh,
at the CME group,

264
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:07.130
which is a futures exchange.
But that's,
uh,
uh,

265
00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:12.480
that's just which,
just talking about where you can do these things.

266
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.410
<v 1>Okay.</v>

267
00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:19.090
<v 0>So I,
did I explain the concept of options?
Well,</v>

268
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:24.070
let me,
maybe I should go through,
uh,
the,

269
00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:31.090
where is my,
okay,

270
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.830
I have here a plot illustrating,
um,
a call option.

271
00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.560
Okay.
Uh,
on,

272
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:41.920
on the vertical and the horizontal axis,

273
00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.680
I have stock price.

274
00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.940
There it is.
Okay.
That's $0 million a share,

275
00:19:51.941 --> 00:19:54.160
$5 a share $10 this year.

276
00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.150
And I'm showing it up to $45 a sheer.
Okay.

277
00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:00.040
Uh,

278
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:05.040
now I'm going to illustrate the intrinsic value of a option with a $20 strike

279
00:20:07.961 --> 00:20:11.380
price.
Now,
the option would be typically for a hundred shares,

280
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:16.090
but I'm going to describe it as if it were an option to buy one share.
Okay?

281
00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:21.100
So that would be one 100th of a,
of a typical option.
Okay.

282
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:26.790
So this broken straight line is what we call the intrinsic value of the option,

283
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.370
which is the money you could get if you exercised it right now.

284
00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:35.740
Okay?
If you,

285
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:40.540
if you decided it will never have intrinsic value negative because you wouldn't

286
00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:44.080
exercise.
Uh,
so let me explain what this means.

287
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:49.180
Suppose you own an option with exercise price of $20.

288
00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:53.260
All right?
And the price of a share is $15.

289
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:57.460
What is the value of that option today?
The intrinsic value?

290
00:20:58.810 --> 00:20:59.111
Well,

291
00:20:59.111 --> 00:21:04.111
it's nothing because the option gives me a right to buy a share at $20,

292
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.200
but hey,
I can buy it in the stock market for 15.

293
00:21:08.201 --> 00:21:12.340
So I would never exercise the option today,
right?
Uh,

294
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:13.810
it would be worthless.
It would be,

295
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:18.811
it would be worth minus $5 if I exercise it today because I would be paying $20

296
00:21:19.421 --> 00:21:21.310
for something I could get for $15,

297
00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:24.490
but I'm not going to call it minus if I'm going to call it zero,
because he just,

298
00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.380
you won't exercise it,
right?

299
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:31.250
So if the stock price is below the exercise part,

300
00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:36.270
I have a value on the vertical axis is the intrinsic value of the call.

301
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:41.830
I have to distinguish it between actual value.
Uh,
uh,

302
00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.870
this isn't the price that the mark that this is coded for the option.

303
00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:51.310
This is what it would be worth if you exercise it today if it were,
uh,

304
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:52.901
but you know,

305
00:21:52.901 --> 00:21:57.520
the option has value beyond its intrinsic value because even though it's

306
00:21:57.521 --> 00:22:01.570
worthless today,
it might be worth something in the future.
And well,

307
00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.160
I'll come back to that,
but this is just,

308
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.100
I'm just talking about intrinsic value right now.

309
00:22:06.101 --> 00:22:10.600
One of the stock prices 30 today.
What is the value of the option?

310
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:16.270
The intrinsic value?
Well,
it's,
it's going to be 10 obviously,
right?

311
00:22:16.271 --> 00:22:18.280
Because you,
if you exercise it today,

312
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:23.670
you're buying this stock for $20 and you can sell it today for $30 on the stock

313
00:22:24.131 --> 00:22:29.110
market.
So the difference is $10.
So this line here,
it doesn't look like a 40.

314
00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:33.130
This is a 45 degree angle here.
It doesn't look like it,
but that's what it is.

315
00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:36.490
And it has a slope of one.
So that's how it's very simple.

316
00:22:36.491 --> 00:22:40.630
The intrinsic value for it call is just a broken straight line.

317
00:22:40.631 --> 00:22:44.950
It breaks at the exercise price.
Okay,
so,
um,

318
00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.430
give me a little bit more jargon.

319
00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.600
In this region we say the option is out of the money.

320
00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:57.830
That means exercise today it would be worthless.
Uh,

321
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.590
and this one right here is called at the money.

322
00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.760
If the stock price is equal to the exercise price,

323
00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.130
then the stock,

324
00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.840
we call the option at the money and for a call.
Uh,

325
00:23:13.841 --> 00:23:18.280
and uh,
here,
if the stock price is above the exercise price,

326
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:23.380
we say it's in the money.
All right,
and this line goes off to infinity.

327
00:23:23.381 --> 00:23:26.230
I just stopped it there.
Uh,

328
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.650
that's straight forward right there.
But anyway,

329
00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:34.280
this does illustrate something about options that,
uh,

330
00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.210
is different from anything we've discussed before.

331
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:41.380
This is a broken straight line,
not a straight line.

332
00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:46.650
All of our talk about fort today has been linear.

333
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.850
When you combine stocks,
you are,
uh,

334
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:55.900
making your portfolio respond linearly to the return of any one of the stocks in

335
00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:56.894
the portfolio.

336
00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:02.090
But this is nonlinear cause we have a break and that's what options do.

337
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:05.750
Uh,
so,
uh,

338
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.720
there it's nonlinear finance.

339
00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:13.730
Some people are confused about what options really are.
Uh,

340
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:17.360
often people say,
well,
if I buy a stock option,

341
00:24:17.361 --> 00:24:21.710
that means I can make up my mind later whether I want to buy and sell.

342
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.480
And so,
uh,
Hey,
uh,

343
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:28.820
I'm just getting the right to be indecisive or did we think of it this way?

344
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:32.300
I haven't made up my mind whether I really want to invest in options or not.

345
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.030
So I'll buy it in stocks or not.

346
00:24:34.031 --> 00:24:38.690
So I'll buy an option and that gives me the right to buy.
Well,
you know,

347
00:24:38.691 --> 00:24:41.360
that you could say that a lot of people think that way.

348
00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:45.920
Like a company will think.
We're trying to decide whether we want to,
uh,

349
00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.350
uh,
build a shopping center.

350
00:24:48.351 --> 00:24:53.090
So we'll buy an option on the land underlying where we would build the shopping

351
00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:53.361
center.

352
00:24:53.361 --> 00:24:56.720
And we'll think more about it and decide whether it's a good idea to build a

353
00:24:56.721 --> 00:25:00.780
shopping center was that you could do that.
But this,

354
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.800
there's something a little bit misleading about that reasoning because whether

355
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:09.110
whether or not you decide to build the shopping center,

356
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:13.670
if you buy an option on the land,
you will always exercise it.

357
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:16.160
If it's in the money on the exercise date,

358
00:25:16.161 --> 00:25:20.510
whether you build a shopping center or not,
right?
Suppose you,
you,

359
00:25:20.511 --> 00:25:23.540
you couldn't decide whether to build a shopping center and you bought an option

360
00:25:23.541 --> 00:25:27.170
on land.
And then someone comes in and says,
well,

361
00:25:27.171 --> 00:25:30.440
we have to make up our mind today.
Uh,
the land,

362
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:34.130
the option is exercising is expiring.
If we don't exercise it today,

363
00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.040
it's worthless.
So what do you discuss at your meeting?

364
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.670
You don't discuss whether we're going to build the shopping center or not.

365
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.960
That's irrelevant.
You discuss what can we sell the land for?

366
00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:49.400
And if we can sell it for more than exercise price,
we will always exercise it,

367
00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:51.800
right?
So there's no,
uh,

368
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.920
it's the assumption in finance is that all options that are in the money on the

369
00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:03.590
exercise date are exercised and there's no choice.

370
00:26:03.591 --> 00:26:06.510
The word option might be misleading because,
uh,

371
00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:10.170
I mean you could choose to be dumb and not exercise it,

372
00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:11.990
but that's not what it's about.

373
00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:14.950
And the other hand options really are central to our,

374
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.170
our thinking about a lot of things.

375
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:23.350
I give you an example of an option that you might not consider an option a and

376
00:26:23.351 --> 00:26:27.440
this is the option to marry somebody.
And so,
um,

377
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.920
sometimes people will complain that their boyfriend or girlfriend,
uh,

378
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:34.580
cannot commit.
Right?

379
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:39.670
We've been going out for three years.
It's time that we get married.
Uh,

380
00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.930
but this person,
the other,

381
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.510
the counterparty cannot seem to decide,

382
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.230
but actually a one view of it,
of that situation.

383
00:26:49.231 --> 00:26:53.760
It could be that this person has just better schooled in finance then the other,

384
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:54.840
um,

385
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:59.840
because one principle of finance is that you should never exercise in American

386
00:27:00.511 --> 00:27:02.680
call early.
All right.

387
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:07.080
I'm not as cynical about relationship and I just telling you a story that comes

388
00:27:07.081 --> 00:27:10.630
to mind.
Uh,
you'd never want to,
I'll come back to that.

389
00:27:10.631 --> 00:27:13.200
You never want to exercise in American call early.

390
00:27:13.201 --> 00:27:16.710
So that's why there isn't that important distinction between European and

391
00:27:16.711 --> 00:27:19.650
American,
but just in the prince,
in the,
in the,

392
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.010
in the case of relationships,
uh,

393
00:27:23.011 --> 00:27:28.011
suppose your a girlfriend or boyfriend really wants to marry you and uh,

394
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:33.110
it's still giving you time.
Then you instinctively know you should wait.

395
00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.960
As I say,
not really,
but I'm saying in terms of theory,

396
00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:42.170
you should wait until the last day when this other person says it's now or never

397
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.690
because there's always exercising.
There's always option value.

398
00:27:45.691 --> 00:27:50.210
There's always a chance.
Um,
maybe that will come clear.
Uh,

399
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.450
I don't know if you'd like my analogy.

400
00:27:51.451 --> 00:27:56.280
I'm not cynical about these things as some people are,
uh,
Peter,

401
00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:11.700
this is a call option up here,
but this is a call.
I'm going to show you a pit,

402
00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.070
but we'll go ahead.
What,
what are retired?

403
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:17.423
<v 2>Wow.</v>

404
00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.220
<v 0>Uh,
see the price.</v>

405
00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:26.610
I want to come back to the price of the option will always be above that line.

406
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.080
Uh,
so there's no Arbor we there are possible,

407
00:28:31.081 --> 00:28:33.390
it depends on if the price is wrong,
they're arbitrage,

408
00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:37.260
then he'd come back to that.
I mean,
uh,
this is a put option.

409
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:42.260
This is intrinsic value for a put option cause it's the opposite of a,
of a car.

410
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:43.110
Uh,

411
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:47.760
if the strike price is 20 and the stock price is selling for 15,

412
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.700
then uh,
you can see that it's in the money.

413
00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:55.560
It's the right cause you can make $5 by exercising.
Uh,
you have,

414
00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.590
uh,
you have the right to sell it for 20,

415
00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:00.870
but you can buy it in the market for 15.

416
00:29:00.871 --> 00:29:03.900
So you buy it from 15 and sell it for 20,
you make $5.

417
00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.160
But on the other hand up here,
if they've stock prices $30,

418
00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.700
you have the right to sell it for 20.
Well,
that's worth nothing,
right?

419
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.840
I can sell it for 30 in the market.
So,
uh,

420
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:21.010
but then what,
um,
uh,
let's see.
Do I have a,

421
00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:25.560
let me,
let me jump to this.
This isn't exactly the order that I wanted to do it,

422
00:29:25.561 --> 00:29:28.710
but,
uh,
the,
uh,

423
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.750
and this has to do with arbitrage as you were saying,
the,
um,

424
00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:37.850
the price in the market should always be greater than the intrinsic value until

425
00:29:39.391 --> 00:29:43.310
the exercise date,
the last day for an American.
Why?

426
00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.570
Even for American or European.
But let's,
let's talk American.

427
00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:48.933
Uh,

428
00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.800
this pink line is my price for the option.

429
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:59.290
And I will talk about how we get that line from theory.
But price,

430
00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.910
if the,
let's say if it's an American option and it's got time to go,

431
00:30:03.911 --> 00:30:08.760
let's say the exercise date is not for another year.
Okay.
Uh,

432
00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.520
and it's out of the money.
The price of a share is only $15,

433
00:30:12.521 --> 00:30:17.410
but the exercise price is $20.
That option is still worth something today,
right?

434
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:22.090
It's not worthless.
It would be worthless if you exercise it today,
but hey,

435
00:30:22.091 --> 00:30:23.680
you're not going to exercise it today.

436
00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:29.040
The reason it has value is that the price might rise above $20 sometime over the

437
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.840
next year.
And so it,
uh,
the,
you have a chance of making money in it.

438
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:39.430
So that means the price of the option is always going to be worth more than the

439
00:30:39.431 --> 00:30:40.264
price

440
00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.250
of the stock or it's always going to be worth more than intrinsic value.

441
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.400
What about Atha money?
And at the money option,

442
00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:51.010
if the price of a share is 20,

443
00:30:51.011 --> 00:30:55.810
and the option a and the exercises 20 exercise it today,
it's worthless,

444
00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.690
but it has to be valuable because 50,

445
00:30:58.691 --> 00:31:02.260
50 chance the stock price is going to go up.
Uh,

446
00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:04.720
and so you have a good chance of making money on it.

447
00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.900
So it's going to be worth,

448
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:10.870
it's going to be worth a lot more than than,
uh,

449
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.020
this one was down here because we're at the money,
you know,

450
00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.710
any little jostle upward is going to put it in the money.

451
00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:22.060
So there's a big chance that this will become in the money.
So it has real value.

452
00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:23.650
Whereas down here,

453
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:28.510
the option doesn't have much value because it would take a big price move to put

454
00:31:28.511 --> 00:31:32.710
it in the money.
And then what about up here,
even when they're in the money,

455
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.630
they're worth more than,
uh,
than intrinsic value.

456
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:41.140
And you kind of wonder,
well why would that be?
Uh,
well,

457
00:31:41.141 --> 00:31:45.370
it's because this thing is better than owning the stock.

458
00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.430
Say let's say at this point when the stock price is 25,

459
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:53.710
I'd rather own the option then their own,
uh,
uh,

460
00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:58.711
share minus $20 because the option can't fail me as much as the share can.

461
00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:05.010
This share minus $20 could be negative and value before the exercise date,

462
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.110
but the worst that can happen to my option as it would be worth nothing.

463
00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:14.040
And so now the arbitrage of Peter that you were referring to is the arbitrage.

464
00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.650
Uh,
what if the price were below this line?

465
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.860
Maybe that's what you were thinking of.
What are the option price,

466
00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:24.970
but if the stock price is 30 and the option is selling at five,

467
00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:30.520
if it's an American option,
I have an immediate arbitrage,
right?
I Buy,

468
00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:35.800
what is it?
Uh,
I,
if it's a call option a,

469
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:37.960
I would buy the option for $5.

470
00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:43.410
I would exercise it and sell for $30 and I'll make money instantly.

471
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.530
And so that can't happen.

472
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.240
We can't have the option price selling for less than intrinsic value.

473
00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:55.790
Uh,
so,
uh,
uh,
the,
you know,

474
00:32:55.791 --> 00:33:00.770
just from arbitraged at that pink line is always above the,
uh,

475
00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:05.780
the solid line.
Moreover,
there's another,
uh,
arbitrage relation,

476
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:08.330
which I didn't really show on the chart,

477
00:33:08.331 --> 00:33:13.331
but if we draw a 45 degree line here from the origin that's plotting the shock

478
00:33:14.271 --> 00:33:16.490
price against the stock price,
all right?

479
00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:21.610
It has a slope of one and it comes out of the origin.
No option can be worth,

480
00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:26.180
can be priced up above that 45 degree line above here.
In other words,

481
00:33:26.181 --> 00:33:30.290
an option can never sell for more than the stock.
Does that sound obvious?

482
00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:36.440
Why would you pay a,
if the share is selling for $25,

483
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:41.240
why would I pay $30 for the right to buy it at $20?
Obviously,

484
00:33:41.241 --> 00:33:43.370
it's ridiculous that the APP,

485
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:47.270
the sock itself is an option to buy the Sherif zero exercise price.

486
00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:51.350
So it has to be worse to have a positive exercise price.

487
00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:54.050
Okay.
So,
um,

488
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:59.220
now I wanted to stress the put call parity relation.
Uh,

489
00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.840
and this is another arbitrage thing that um,

490
00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.910
the put option price arbitrage,

491
00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:12.800
the absence of arbitrage opportunities implies that the put option price minus

492
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:16.700
the call option price equals the present value of the strike price.

493
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:22.070
That's discounting it from this exercise date to the present plus the present

494
00:34:22.071 --> 00:34:27.071
value or any dividends coming between today and the exercise date minus the

495
00:34:28.461 --> 00:34:32.830
price of the stock.
And this has to hold because uh,

496
00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:37.450
if it didn't hold there would be an arbitrage opportunity.
So,
uh,

497
00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.850
the put,
let me,

498
00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:42.500
let me just show you why this diagram was supposed to explain that.

499
00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:45.680
I've got here the uh,

500
00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:50.330
the intrinsic value of the car,
which is the yellow line.

501
00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:53.170
And this is an intrinsic value of a put.

502
00:34:53.171 --> 00:34:56.630
We've got them both at the same exercise price.
All right.

503
00:34:57.650 --> 00:35:02.000
And then I've shown here the stock price when the Blue Line stock price against

504
00:35:02.001 --> 00:35:06.080
stock prices,
just a 45 degree line,
a line with a slope of one.

505
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:12.010
Well you notice that if I were to buy a call and write a put that's the same

506
00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:15.170
thing,
a shorting or put,

507
00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.520
I would have a combined portfolio with just those two.

508
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:22.070
I would have,
uh,

509
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:25.820
the yellow line here and I'd have minus the pink line here,
right?

510
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:30.440
I would have a parallel straight line that looks just like the stock price just

511
00:35:30.441 --> 00:35:31.340
shifted down.

512
00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:36.560
So if I buy a call and short a put or write a put,

513
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:41.910
it's the same thing as owning the stock minus the exercise price.
And so,

514
00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:42.900
uh,
that's,

515
00:35:42.930 --> 00:35:47.690
that's what we have in the put call parity relation so that we're taking account

516
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:52.630
of a dividends.
That diagram didn't show the fact that stocks will pay,

517
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.380
might pay dividends between now and the exercise date.
Uh,

518
00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:00.810
but you can see when I was just saying,
I've got,
I said call mine has put,

519
00:36:00.811 --> 00:36:03.740
well this is put minus call,
uh,

520
00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:08.070
minus the price of stuff.
I have a minus sign in front of everything here,

521
00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:10.860
but it's just that,
what that diagram shows.

522
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:16.070
So what put call parity means is that we only need a theory of either call

523
00:36:16.771 --> 00:36:21.750
prices or put prices,
and then the other one falls right out of put call parity.

524
00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:25.470
Okay.
All I need is a theory of coal prices.

525
00:36:25.471 --> 00:36:30.471
So we will just forget about puts and we'll just talk about calls from from now

526
00:36:30.571 --> 00:36:33.750
on.
And then if I gave you a problem,

527
00:36:33.751 --> 00:36:38.040
they ask you what is the put price,
whereas the price of a put,

528
00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:42.690
you would go in and calculate the price of a call,
uh,
and then,
uh,

529
00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:45.420
calculate,
uh,
we,
we the put option price,

530
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.430
we'll put this on the right hand side of the equation.

531
00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:52.590
The put price would equal the call price plus the present value of the strike

532
00:36:52.591 --> 00:36:57.130
place,
plus the present value of dividends minus the price of a stock.
So that,
so,

533
00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:01.350
so that,
that makes it very easy.
All we have to do is worry about calls.

534
00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:07.230
Um,
and so,
uh,
where am I?

535
00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.050
Okay.
So,
uh,

536
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:15.060
the question for financial theory is what determines this pink line?

537
00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:19.640
We,
you agreed that it should be above intrinsic value as,
as it,

538
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:24.920
the option gets closer to expiration as time moves on and the exercise date is

539
00:37:25.321 --> 00:37:29.610
getting closer and closer in time,
this pink line is going to go down,
down,
down,

540
00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:34.800
and on the last day it hits the intrinsic value.
And so,
uh,

541
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:39.070
but what,
what is it before the exercise date?
So,
um,

542
00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:42.120
I want to start with um,
uh,

543
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:45.720
a theory which illustrates how we calculate these things.

544
00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.990
Uh,
but this is a theory that

545
00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:55.160
applies to us too so that we can understand it easily.
It applies to a,

546
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:58.510
a strip down situation.
Well,

547
00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:02.020
I'm going to derive the price of an option,
uh,

548
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.430
under the assumption that,
uh,
it's very simple.

549
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:09.730
There's only one period between now and exercise.
It's an,

550
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:13.290
it's a European option.
We're going to exercise it in one.

551
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:17.790
We have an exercise date of one period.
Uh,

552
00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:22.740
and also under the restrictive assumption.
And this is for pedagogical purposes,

553
00:38:22.741 --> 00:38:27.741
just to simplify option theory that the stock price s is the stock price today.

554
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:33.930
Okay.
And the stock.
This stock is very special because,

555
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:37.750
uh,
next period it can have only two values.

556
00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:42.190
It's s times you if the stock goes up,

557
00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:47.220
human stands for up and it's s times d if the stock price goes down.

558
00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.230
Uh,
and what I'm saying,

559
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:54.850
what's arbitrary here is I'm saying that there's only two possible prices for

560
00:38:54.851 --> 00:38:59.830
the stock next period.
Su or SD.
Uh,

561
00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.220
that's not real world because as you know,

562
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.510
there's all kinds of infinite number of possible prices next period.
But again,

563
00:39:07.511 --> 00:39:08.344
this is just,

564
00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:13.120
I think that we should be able to figure out what the price of a call option on

565
00:39:13.121 --> 00:39:17.110
this stock should be worth.
A,
it's very simple,

566
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:20.350
but it's,
I say it's very simple,

567
00:39:20.351 --> 00:39:24.950
but the people who invented this won the Nobel prize for this.
So I won't,

568
00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:28.800
I don't want to make it,
this wasn't so simple,
uh,

569
00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:32.200
in the history of financial thinking.
But anyway,

570
00:39:32.201 --> 00:39:34.840
so do you understand what the situation that we're proposing in,

571
00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:39.520
it's just like there's this very funny stock that we know for some reason we

572
00:39:39.521 --> 00:39:44.521
know that s is the price today and next period when the option exercise dated

573
00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:49.690
it's price is either going to be su or it's going to bes s times you or it's

574
00:39:49.691 --> 00:39:53.050
going to be as times d.
Okay.
And then there was an interest rate.

575
00:39:53.051 --> 00:39:56.290
Then we can both borrow and lend at this riskless interest rate.

576
00:39:56.560 --> 00:40:01.480
So what should the option would be worth a,
okay,
so in this case,

577
00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:02.500
uh,
I'm going to call,

578
00:40:02.501 --> 00:40:07.240
see the current price of the call today.

579
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:11.110
This is before now.
This is before,
uh,
the exercise date.

580
00:40:11.111 --> 00:40:15.130
So the price of the call is going to be worth more than the intrinsic value.

581
00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:17.180
Uh,

582
00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:22.180
I am going to call c sub you the value of the call next period if the price is

583
00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:26.980
up and see sub d the value of the call next period.

584
00:40:26.981 --> 00:40:31.000
If the price is down.
Okay.
Uh,

585
00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:36.160
that we,
that's the thing that we read off of those La broken straight lines.

586
00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:40.450
Right?
So see you would be,
you know,
the stock price.

587
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:43.930
If it's the stock minus the exercise price,
if it's in the money,

588
00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:49.650
we know that in advance because we already know what the two possible prices are

589
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:50.703
next period.

590
00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:55.830
So we'd already know what the two possible option values are next period.

591
00:40:55.901 --> 00:41:00.520
This is the intrinsic value up.
If it's up and this is the intrinsic value,

592
00:41:00.521 --> 00:41:02.650
if it's down,
alright,

593
00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:07.090
and we'll call it e the strike price of the African exercise price of the
option.

594
00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:12.460
Is Everything clear here?
It's just such a very simple world.

595
00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:17.530
I'm just saying
there's only two possibilities.
It's a,

596
00:41:17.531 --> 00:41:20.020
it's a very simple world.
Uh,

597
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:24.520
and it's only one period between now and exercise.
So it's very simple.

598
00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.760
Now what I'm going to say,
it's going to,

599
00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:30.850
we're going to develop an arbitrage theory of options and we're going to say

600
00:41:30.851 --> 00:41:33.820
that you want to,
uh,

601
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:39.530
you'll take any profit opportunity that's riskless and it ought to be possible

602
00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:42.650
to get a riskless profit opportunity here,
uh,

603
00:41:42.651 --> 00:41:47.060
by investing both in the stock and the option because there's only two possible

604
00:41:47.061 --> 00:41:50.370
values for the stock.
And you've got both a stock and an option,

605
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:53.090
there must be a riskless portfolio,
right?

606
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.540
Because the price of the option depends only on the price of the stock,

607
00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:59.900
uh,
on the exercise date.

608
00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:05.590
And so when I'm going to do is get an optimal hedge ratio h uh,

609
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:08.420
that,
um,
that makes my portfolio,

610
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:13.400
I'm going to form a portfolio of the stock and the option and I'm going to put

611
00:42:13.401 --> 00:42:17.930
them together so that I have a riskless portfolio.
All right?

612
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:22.310
And that's what I'm going to do out of that is going to fall a value for the

613
00:42:22.311 --> 00:42:27.050
price of the option.
So this is what you want to do.
Okay?
Uh,

614
00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.990
we're looking for a riskless profit opportunity.
Let's consider this.

615
00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:34.580
We're going to write one call and buy h shares.

616
00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.253
Okay?

617
00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:41.440
And I'm going to pick h so that I have no risk at all and it's easy to see how

618
00:42:42.261 --> 00:42:47.261
you do that because we already know before the exercise date,

619
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:52.070
we know that if the price goes up,
it will be worth you.

620
00:42:52.071 --> 00:42:56.930
H S my portfolio,
if I have h shares,

621
00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:00.500
the h shares will be worth Uhs,
right?

622
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:05.720
You is U s is the price h shares would be worth uhs.

623
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:11.390
Uh,
okay.
But I've written one call so,

624
00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:12.050
uh,

625
00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:17.050
this will be worth ewh as minus the price of a call.

626
00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:22.460
Uh,
similarly,
if the price stock,
if the stock price goes down,

627
00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:27.560
then this is the value intrinsic value of the car,
then,
uh,

628
00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:29.510
next period and the exercise date,

629
00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:35.110
the portfolio will be worth DHS minus c sub d.

630
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.790
All right,

631
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:42.790
so let's choose age so that the two are the same and all I have to do is set

632
00:43:44.541 --> 00:43:49.541
this equal to this and solve for h and that gives me the optimal hedge ratio.

633
00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:56.010
And so h is equal to c to view minus v Sub d Oliver,

634
00:43:56.121 --> 00:43:59.600
you minus d times S.
Uh,

635
00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:04.690
and now it's very simple to get to option pricing is that if I can form this

636
00:44:05.691 --> 00:44:10.400
portfolio with a where I have,
um,
uh,

637
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:14.980
one call and h shares in the portfolio,
uh,

638
00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:19.760
it's a riskless portfolio and so it has to earn the riskless rate of interest.

639
00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:23.060
That's what no arbitrage assures.

640
00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:28.120
That can't be possible to get a riskless portfolio that earns either more or

641
00:44:28.341 --> 00:44:32.910
less than the riskless rate.
Because if,
if that did happen,
I would have,

642
00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.140
I would have a riskless opportunity,
uh,
uh,

643
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:40.890
ability to earn more than the riskless rate with no risk.

644
00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:46.110
And that that's contrary to our,
uh,
uh,
arbitrage.
So,

645
00:44:46.111 --> 00:44:48.970
uh,
the return on since you,

646
00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:53.040
you invested hs minus c in the portfolio,

647
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.930
the return on the total value of it has to equal one plus the riskless rate

648
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:01.030
times hs minus C a.

649
00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:04.500
And if you substitute in for Ahs minus C,

650
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:09.540
you find out that it equals this,
uh,

651
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:14.570
and a substitute for h into this and you'll get the price of the call today.

652
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:19.410
It's simple Algebra,
but there it is.

653
00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:24.120
So that's the arbitrage theory call option price.

654
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:29.520
Uh,
that might be less than intuitive to you,

655
00:45:29.521 --> 00:45:32.940
but you see that it was very simple arguing that got us there.

656
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:38.390
We merely said the way to think about options is that options move with the

657
00:45:39.151 --> 00:45:43.190
stock price.
Um,
and,
uh,
they're,

658
00:45:43.191 --> 00:45:47.730
they're perfectly correlated with the stock price over this interval because if

659
00:45:47.731 --> 00:45:50.730
the stock price goes up,
you know,
you've got seats of a,

660
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:52.830
of view as the stock price goes down,
you know,

661
00:45:52.831 --> 00:45:56.490
you've got [inaudible] so you have only one source of uncertainty,

662
00:45:56.491 --> 00:46:00.420
but you have to assets so you can put them together to eliminate risk.

663
00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.100
And if you put them together that way,

664
00:46:02.101 --> 00:46:06.060
they have to earn the riskless rate and you just solve for and you get this

665
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:07.830
value for the call option.

666
00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:12.770
This is the inherent insight that black and shoals,
uh,

667
00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:13.960
came up with in there.

668
00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:19.230
A classic 1973 paper on option pricing,

669
00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:20.670
which I'll come to,
but

670
00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.930
this has to be the price of the call option in this simple world.
Uh,

671
00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.410
otherwise there'd be arbitrage.

672
00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:33.240
The interesting thing about this is that there are no probabilities in this

673
00:46:33.241 --> 00:46:36.300
formula.
What's in this formula?

674
00:46:36.301 --> 00:46:40.170
I've got the riskless rate,
I've got intrinsic value.

675
00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.790
I've got the,
the difference between the price and the two circumstances,

676
00:46:44.791 --> 00:46:49.380
but nothing to do with probabilities.
And this puzzled people,
people thought,

677
00:46:49.381 --> 00:46:49.820
well,

678
00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:54.090
doesn't the price of an option have to depend on the probability that it will

679
00:46:54.091 --> 00:46:56.980
come in the money?
If it's an out of the money option?

680
00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:01.760
Don't I weigh the probability?
But it's not in this formula.
Uh,

681
00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:07.010
you might say it's implicitly in the formula because the relationship of ass to

682
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:11.610
Su and SD involves probabilities,
but it's not in this formula.

683
00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:18.380
So black and shoals in their famous paper use this kind of reasoning to get to

684
00:47:19.621 --> 00:47:24.580
the,
the standard option contract,
which,
uh,

685
00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:29.240
option formula and uh,
I'm not going to derive it because it,

686
00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.270
the mathematics is quite a bit more difficult,

687
00:47:31.271 --> 00:47:36.271
but it's exactly the same logic that I just went through with the binomial

688
00:47:36.281 --> 00:47:38.860
option pricing formula.
Uh,

689
00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:43.840
and so this is one of the most famous,
um,
uh,

690
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:49.200
um,
formulas in all of finance,

691
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:54.130
uh,
what black and shows that is under a certain assumptions

692
00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.780
about the stochastic properties of stock prices.

693
00:47:59.230 --> 00:48:02.950
And under the assumption of no arbitrage opportunity,

694
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:08.280
they came up with a formula that an option price should follow,

695
00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:15.340
uh,
if,
uh,
if there's no arbitrage.
So,

696
00:48:15.341 --> 00:48:15.521
uh,

697
00:48:15.521 --> 00:48:19.060
I'm just going to present their formula and then we'll think more about options.

698
00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:20.463
But,
um,

699
00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:26.290
now the black shoals formula called t,
the time to exercise,

700
00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:31.420
uh,
before I just said it was when we talked binomial,
I just had,
um,

701
00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:33.370
I said it was one period,
hence,

702
00:48:33.610 --> 00:48:37.870
but now we're allowing the exercise date to be any distance in the future.

703
00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.340
Uh,
so t is the time to,
uh,
to the exercise date.

704
00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.800
And this is a for a European option,

705
00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:48.760
although it's often used to apply to American options as well,

706
00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:55.080
and we'll call a sigma squared the variance of the one period price change.

707
00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.390
Okay.
Uh,
and,
and,

708
00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:02.860
and of acts is the cumulative normal distribution function,

709
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:07.870
uh,
which you can find on excel.
It's,
it's called norm dist.

710
00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:13.450
Uh,
but,
uh,
and so,

711
00:49:13.451 --> 00:49:15.980
uh,
I don't want to get into these detailed,

712
00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:20.810
this is the formula that black and fuels,
uh,
uh,

713
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:25.670
won the Nobel Prize for actually black,
uh,
black,
uh,
died at a

714
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:30.960
relatively early age from throat cancer.
Uh,

715
00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:36.860
he was a heavy smoker and people don't do that anymore.
So I was one risk,
uh,

716
00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:40.360
is over.
But,
um,
uh,

717
00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:43.030
shoals won the Nobel prize for this.

718
00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:45.940
They don't award that posthumously for this little formula.

719
00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:52.170
It says the price of a call a is equal to the stock price times and of d one

720
00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:59.430
minus the exercise price times and have d two l where d one is given by this

721
00:50:00.251 --> 00:50:05.100
expression and d two is given by this expression.
So,
um,

722
00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:09.130
uh,
that might not be intuitive to you.

723
00:50:09.131 --> 00:50:12.430
We could spend a couple of lectures making that more intuitive,

724
00:50:12.431 --> 00:50:15.250
but I'm just going to stop with that formula now.

725
00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:20.680
But that's the formula that I used back here to make this pink line.

726
00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:22.810
I just,

727
00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:27.500
I had to plug in a value for sigma squared and t uh,
yeah,

728
00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:30.390
but I did that and I used the black show formula.

729
00:50:31.110 --> 00:50:34.020
So the black Sholes formula does what we sort of think it should be.

730
00:50:34.021 --> 00:50:37.310
The price of an option should be greater than the intrinsic value of it

731
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:40.310
<v 2>everywhere.
Um,
but,
uh,</v>

732
00:50:42.650 --> 00:50:43.483
it's,
uh,

733
00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:48.950
<v 0>but here's the exact equation.</v>

734
00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:51.083
<v 2>MMM.</v>

735
00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:57.170
<v 0>So this is one of the most famous equations and fine,
it might even be on your,</v>

736
00:50:57.171 --> 00:50:58.970
if you have a financial calculator,

737
00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:02.330
you might have a key that you can press a,

738
00:51:02.331 --> 00:51:06.720
it's already on your laptop so you don't even know.
It probably maybe if anyone,

739
00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:10.910
what kind of programs you have.
Uh,
but it's easy to compute an excel.

740
00:51:10.911 --> 00:51:13.820
You just have to use this norm.
Dist uh,

741
00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:19.100
this cumulative normal distribution function is not something you can do by

742
00:51:19.101 --> 00:51:22.730
hand.
You have to use,
uh,
uh,
uh,

743
00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:24.950
cause it wouldn't involve a,

744
00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:29.850
an integral that that doesn't have an analytic solution but a,

745
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:34.070
you can get it on an excel.
Uh,
so,

746
00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:37.940
um,
now,
uh,
the,
the,
the,

747
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:42.140
the critical problem with the black Sholes formula however,

748
00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:46.610
is getting some of these parameters that have to go into it.

749
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:49.640
And the tough one is sigma squared.

750
00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:54.440
Most of the other things we know if you're trying to actually price an option

751
00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:58.370
using black Sholes as we already know,

752
00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:03.500
that that's just the stock price.
He is the exercise price.
We know that that's,

753
00:52:03.501 --> 00:52:05.120
that's written in the option contract.

754
00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.810
T is the time to expiration date.

755
00:52:08.811 --> 00:52:12.770
We know that that's written in the contract are,
is the riskless interest rate.

756
00:52:12.771 --> 00:52:15.200
Well,
that's easy to tell.
That's just quoted in the market.

757
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:20.480
There's only one thing that remains,
that's tough.
And that's sigma squared.

758
00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:23.870
That's the variance of the stock price.

759
00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:26.240
<v 2>Uh Huh.</v>

760
00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:31.450
<v 0>Black Sholes says you have to know how variable the stock price is to price an</v>

761
00:52:31.451 --> 00:52:36.340
option.
Uh,
and intuitively,
uh,
you,
you can see it.

762
00:52:36.341 --> 00:52:40.180
Isn't it obvious that the,
the more variable the stock price,

763
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:45.190
the more valuable the option is,
right?
If the,

764
00:52:45.191 --> 00:52:49.570
if the variance were zero,
then the option would just be the intrinsic value,

765
00:52:49.571 --> 00:52:50.404
right?

766
00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:52.220
<v 2>Uh,</v>

767
00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:55.340
<v 0>because there's no chance for the stock to do anything unexpected.</v>

768
00:52:55.700 --> 00:53:00.680
So if it's out of the money and,
and very into zero,
the option is worthless.

769
00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:04.790
If it's in the money and the variance is zero,
then it's worth something,

770
00:53:04.791 --> 00:53:08.660
but it's only worth the intrinsic value.
If sigma squared is zero,

771
00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:13.050
the price can't move anywhere.
So there's no problem.
Uh,

772
00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:17.960
as sigma squared increases,
the option gets more and more valuable.

773
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.980
If it's out of the money.

774
00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:23.060
It's getting more and more chance to come into the money.
Uh,

775
00:53:23.061 --> 00:53:24.230
and so that's in the formula.

776
00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:28.980
So the key in the black Sholes formula is the variance of,

777
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:30.023
of,
um,

778
00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:36.090
of option of the underlying stock price.
Uh,

779
00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:39.300
and that's the,
that's the kicker.
That's the hard part.

780
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:43.800
People who trade options use the black Sholes formula,

781
00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:45.150
but there's a problem.

782
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:49.470
And the problem is you've got to plug in a number for a sigma squared.

783
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:53.850
So what number should I plug in?
Well,
you might say,

784
00:53:53.851 --> 00:53:56.570
let's take historical numbers.
All right.
Uh,

785
00:53:56.571 --> 00:53:59.760
I know pretty much what the variance of stock price changes is.

786
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.650
Let's use the historical variants.

787
00:54:02.310 --> 00:54:07.020
So I wanted to show you the historical variants of stock price.

788
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:11.400
I haven't since I like history,
I go all the way back to 1871.

789
00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:17.120
So what I did to compute this chart is I took the s and p composite or s and p

790
00:54:18.811 --> 00:54:22.800
500 index back to 1871.
This is my spreadsheet,

791
00:54:22.801 --> 00:54:27.480
which is on the web,
uh,
on under our classroom materials.
Uh,

792
00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:32.500
and I took a six month moving average of six months changes.

793
00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:33.903
Uh,
well,

794
00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:39.260
six months standard deviation of the percentage price change for every month

795
00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:44.400
from 1871 July to April of 2008.

796
00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:47.180
Uh,
and the,

797
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:51.270
the important thing to understand here is that the variance is not constant

798
00:54:51.271 --> 00:54:53.610
through time.
It moves around.

799
00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:58.620
There are high variance periods for stock prices and low variance periods.

800
00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:02.010
I like to look at this picture cause it's interesting.

801
00:55:02.011 --> 00:55:05.940
The first thing that is interesting is that overall the market has been

802
00:55:05.941 --> 00:55:09.420
remarkably consistent for over a hundred years,
right?

803
00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:13.650
The variants back in the 19th century,

804
00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:18.120
it doesn't look any different.
Nothing has changed in 130 years.

805
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.040
The market has always been volatile.

806
00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:24.210
There's only one thing that jumps out at you when you look at this picture.

807
00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:28.620
And that's these numbers in here,
right?
You notice those numbers in the middle.

808
00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:34.260
That was the Great Depression of the 1930s.
Uh,
and uh,

809
00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:38.340
something went really haywire in the financial markets and the depression.

810
00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:42.300
This is 1929.
It wasn't so much 19,
29,

811
00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:46.290
but remember this is a six month.
It's a lagging six months.
So where does it,

812
00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:49.500
maybe the 1929 crash is here or somewhere

813
00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:53.160
and not sure exactly where it is,
but

814
00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:59.310
something went really haywire after 1929 and the market's got extraordinarily

815
00:55:59.311 --> 00:56:03.280
volatile for awhile.
Uh,

816
00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:06.210
that was a crisis period in American history.

817
00:56:06.211 --> 00:56:10.350
That's shows up really well on this picture.
But since then,

818
00:56:10.351 --> 00:56:14.190
nothing much has happened.
Uh,
it's,
it isn't.
Look recently,

819
00:56:14.191 --> 00:56:15.750
this doesn't look very important.

820
00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:20.700
It shows how important our lifetimes are in the broad sweep of history.
But,
uh,

821
00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:25.180
your lifetimes are from uh,
or in this region right here.
Right.

822
00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:26.970
Uh,
but,
uh,

823
00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:31.300
the thing that's interesting is that we have been recently in a very low

824
00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:33.580
volatility period for the stock market.

825
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:36.550
This is around 2003.

826
00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:40.400
We were in a high volatility period in 19 nine.

827
00:56:40.401 --> 00:56:42.250
He's nothing like in the Great Depression,

828
00:56:42.251 --> 00:56:47.251
but tie in the 90s and then volatility just collapsed in the markets where the

829
00:56:47.951 --> 00:56:52.500
dentist and Dallas place to be in the world stock market.
Um,

830
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:58.000
and uh,
partly I think this is because our,
we were,
who knows where this was.

831
00:56:58.090 --> 00:57:00.190
I'm going to throw out wild suggestion.

832
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:05.410
It's because we were distracted by the housing bubble and all talk after the

833
00:57:05.411 --> 00:57:09.820
stock market peak in 2000 lots of people just lost interest in the market and

834
00:57:09.821 --> 00:57:14.560
all of their speculative enthusiasm was focused on housing and the stock market

835
00:57:14.561 --> 00:57:15.670
was kind of forgotten.

836
00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.490
There has to be at least an element of truth to that story.

837
00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:20.740
But something has been happening lately,

838
00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:24.190
like how much volatility is shooting up now?

839
00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:27.340
This is because of the world financial crisis that we're in.

840
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:30.850
But if you look at this picture,
it doesn't look like the world.

841
00:57:30.851 --> 00:57:33.940
Financial crisis is very important,
uh,

842
00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:38.000
in compared to historical events so far,
uh,

843
00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:40.150
that we've seen in the past.

844
00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:46.240
Now I want to define what we call implied volatility.
Uh,
what,

845
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:51.270
what the you can do with the black Sholes formula is it requires that you input

846
00:57:53.291 --> 00:57:58.090
sigma squared to calculate what the price of an option should be.
Well,

847
00:57:58.091 --> 00:58:02.830
why don't we take what the price of the option is and work backwards to figure

848
00:58:02.831 --> 00:58:07.270
out what volatility is implied by the price.
You see what I'm saying?

849
00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.780
You can solve,
you can turn the black schole,
the black Sholes formula.

850
00:58:11.781 --> 00:58:14.860
It gives the price of the option in terms of sigma squared.

851
00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:18.580
Well I can turn it around cause I know what the market price of the option is.

852
00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:21.360
They're traded on the CVOE.
Uh,

853
00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:25.690
so I would take the market price of an option and turn it around and get what

854
00:58:25.691 --> 00:58:30.160
the implied volatility is from black shoals and,
uh,
the,

855
00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:31.050
the CBO,

856
00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:36.060
he does this for you because they trade s and p 500 options and they have it on

857
00:58:37.211 --> 00:58:41.030
their website.
Uh,
and it's called Vic's.
Uh,

858
00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:46.480
I have there,
that's their volatility index.
Uh,

859
00:58:46.481 --> 00:58:50.560
and the CBO [inaudible] was created in 1973.
Uh,

860
00:58:50.561 --> 00:58:52.270
unfortunately their series,
it doesn't,

861
00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:56.720
it goes only back to 1986.
Um,

862
00:58:56.890 --> 00:58:58.450
but it's been going for a long time.

863
00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:03.250
You can't get implied volatility back to 1871,

864
00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:06.130
because although there were options traded back down,

865
00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.860
there was no organized market.

866
00:59:08.861 --> 00:59:13.861
You can't get a consistent series of prices of options going that far back.

867
00:59:14.231 --> 00:59:15.940
So you can't get implied volatility.

868
00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:20.590
Maybe you could do it if you got some records from some broker and find some

869
00:59:20.591 --> 00:59:24.920
options.
But I it would,
I don't know,
it would be hard.
So our,
our,
um,

870
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:29.170
imply volatility only goes back a

871
00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:32.780
little over 20 years.

872
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:37.940
But the interesting thing is I have plotted here both the implied volatility

873
00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:42.740
over that period and the actual volatility and you see that they line up fairly

874
00:59:42.741 --> 00:59:47.180
well.
So this shows the strength of the black Sholes formula.

875
00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:51.820
Black Sholes does seem to be pricing options,
uh,

876
00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:55.430
well enough because the implied volatility,
well,

877
00:59:55.431 --> 00:59:59.900
it's not perfectly exactly equal to the actual volatility.
It's close.

878
00:59:59.930 --> 01:00:04.370
And so,
uh,
we can see that the formula make some,

879
01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:07.850
some sense.
Uh,
I think,
yeah.

880
01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:09.680
So I just wanted to

881
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:16.490
conclude this lecture by,
um,
talking about,

882
01:00:16.491 --> 01:00:18.620
um,
the,
uh,

883
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:23.600
effort we've made to get a single family home price options going,

884
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:29.360
uh,
uh,
at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
So,
uh,

885
01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:31.370
as I told you,
I am,

886
01:00:31.371 --> 01:00:36.371
some of my colleagues have been campaigning with futures exchanges to create

887
01:00:37.431 --> 01:00:41.750
futures markets for home prices and ultimately for commercial real estate prices

888
01:00:41.751 --> 01:00:46.060
and other economic variables.
Uh,
so we went to,
uh,

889
01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:50.120
w w w we,
we started campaigning almost 20 years ago,

890
01:00:50.330 --> 01:00:55.330
but recently we have been talking with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and they

891
01:00:56.781 --> 01:01:01.580
created futures markets for single family homes in,
uh,

892
01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:06.710
may of 2006 using the s and p case Shiller indexes.

893
01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:11.810
Uh,
and,
uh,
so,
uh,
that,
that was their objective.

894
01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:15.020
But when we went there,
the CME said,
well,
why don't we start options as well,

895
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:17.840
options on futures.
Uh,

896
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:22.550
so we have a futures contract and they launched options on home prices.

897
01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:27.140
Uh,
and you can see all these things on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange website.

898
01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:32.270
Uh,
and,
uh,
uh,

899
01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:37.300
what we have now are both puts and calls for 10 US cities.

900
01:01:38.130 --> 01:01:42.940
Uh,
unfortunately they are not doing well and not selling well,
but,
uh,
we're,

901
01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:45.840
we're there.
They're still going.
And,
um,

902
01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:49.310
we're hoping that we can,
uh,

903
01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.820
get them to connect the often markets go slow at first.
Uh,

904
01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:57.020
so I hope that that's the story,
that it's just a slow beginning,

905
01:01:57.470 --> 01:02:01.670
but let me say what we have and maybe it's a good down to earth way to

906
01:02:01.671 --> 01:02:06.170
illustrate the value of options.
I was telling you how to price options,

907
01:02:06.171 --> 01:02:09.950
but I didn't tell you why would you buy one?
Well,

908
01:02:09.951 --> 01:02:11.930
I did tell a story at the beginning.

909
01:02:11.931 --> 01:02:16.250
I talked about an investor wanting to invest money in options,

910
01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:18.770
uh,
and a writer,
uh,

911
01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:23.040
hoping that the option will expire on exercise and hoping to make money.

912
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.370
But I didn't really go behind that and,

913
01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:29.160
and emphasize why you would do that.

914
01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:33.660
So I think the example of a home price options is very,
uh,

915
01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:38.700
easy to see.
Uh,
let's consider a situation that someone,

916
01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:42.690
I don't think any of you are homeowners here,
right this point.

917
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:46.740
Maybe some of you are probably not.
But imagine,

918
01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:51.700
try to imagine that you bought a house a couple of years ago.
Okay.
Uh,

919
01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:55.470
and now the housing market is collapsing.
Uh,
you know,

920
01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:58.320
you bought that house probably on a mortgage,

921
01:02:58.321 --> 01:03:03.000
so you borrowed 80 or 90%,
or maybe even more of the money to buy the house.

922
01:03:03.630 --> 01:03:08.220
And,
uh,
now the home prices falling and you're thinking,
Hey,
wait a minute,

923
01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:13.420
this house is worth less than my debt.
Uh,
and you start to get upset with,

924
01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:16.920
you know,
you're thinking,
well,
you know,
I'd like to move to another city,

925
01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:22.080
but then you realize I can't do it.
I,
if I sell my house,

926
01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:26.640
I won't be able to pay off the mortgage.
I'll be bankrupt,
uh,
before I,

927
01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:31.830
I can't move.
And this is very real.
In fact,
a economy.com,

928
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:35.220
a consulting firm estimates that in the United States today,

929
01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:39.510
10% of all homes are underwater.
In that sense,

930
01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.990
the mortgage debt is greater than the value of the home,

931
01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:47.220
and that number is increasing every day as home prices continue to fall.

932
01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:52.230
So some people are very upset.
Uh,
so what can they do?

933
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:56.340
Well,
one thing they can do,
or they could have done a couple of years ago,

934
01:03:56.341 --> 01:03:59.550
if they,
if,
if they had a thought to do it,

935
01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:05.180
they could buy a put on the home on homes in the city where they have a house,

936
01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:09.630
right?
So I hope I put in,
say around,

937
01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:14.720
let's say I put in $500,000 into a house and um,

938
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.960
I'm worried that it's price might fall.
Well,

939
01:04:18.961 --> 01:04:23.040
if you buy a house and you buy a put on that house together,

940
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:27.450
the two together,
uh,
eliminate your risk.

941
01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:32.010
So if I this,
think of it as just buying a put on a house rather than an index.

942
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:35.760
I buy the house for 500,000.

943
01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:38.980
I put up 400,000 and so I'm,

944
01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:42.420
I put 100,000 and the mortgage puts up 400,000.

945
01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:46.590
I'm underwater if the house drops $100,000.
Right?

946
01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:51.090
I've lost my mortgage.
Debt exceeds my,
I don't want that to happen.

947
01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:54.570
So why don't I just buy a put on the house,

948
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:59.490
which is a right to sell the house at $400,000,

949
01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:02.700
uh,
until some exercise date,

950
01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:08.240
right then I can't possibly be underwater if I ever decide to move.

951
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:12.720
If it's an American option,
I can just actually,

952
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:16.620
if the price of my house is less than 400,000,
I just actually saw my put,

953
01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.990
there's no way for me to get wiped out.
In fact,

954
01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:23.410
I could buy a put at 450,000.
Uh,

955
01:05:23.411 --> 01:05:26.980
and that way I would always be sure that I have $50,000 left.

956
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:32.470
So that's the idea of using option as a hedging mechanism.

957
01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:35.430
And uh,
uh,

958
01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:40.180
well I gave an example in terms of real estate and it's not why they use that

959
01:05:40.181 --> 01:05:41.014
way.

960
01:05:41.050 --> 01:05:46.050
This same idea is used a lot by investors in other domains.

961
01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:51.370
So I think options have a very real risk management of purpose.

962
01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:56.830
Um,
and so,
you know,
in a sense an insurance contract is like a put option.

963
01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:01.990
If I buy fire insurance on my house,
then,
uh,

964
01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:04.090
it's like buying a put option on my house.

965
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:06.880
But it's only exercisable if there's a fire.

966
01:06:07.490 --> 01:06:11.290
So what it says is if my house burns down the put option,

967
01:06:11.291 --> 01:06:16.240
I can sell the whatever remains,
uh,
at a,
at a price,

968
01:06:16.241 --> 01:06:19.690
which is determined by the insurance contract.
It's the same as a put option.

969
01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:25.320
So insurance is not fundamentally different from finance.

970
01:06:25.721 --> 01:06:30.460
And so we'd had a little trouble deciding whether we want home equity insurance

971
01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:34.510
or just puts a home equity put.
So we've created the,
puts a,

972
01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:38.350
at some point we want to also create,
uh,
insurance,
uh,

973
01:06:38.351 --> 01:06:41.490
on homes someday.
I hope that happens.
Uh,

974
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:44.980
there is no home equity insurance,
but um,

975
01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.830
but these are just different incarnations of the same risk management ideas.

976
01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:54.840
The fundamental idea here in finance is that you can create the options are

977
01:06:56.651 --> 01:07:01.050
example of derivatives.
I should add that um,

978
01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:06.450
a derivative is a financial contract that derives from another financial.

979
01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:13.380
So an option is a derivative because the price of the option in the options

980
01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:19.660
market depends on the price of something else in another market,

981
01:07:19.690 --> 01:07:20.530
the stock market.

982
01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:23.960
And so our real estate options are another example of derivative.

983
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:29.230
The price of the put option depends on,
in the option market,

984
01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:33.670
depends on the price of the house in the housing market.
Uh,

985
01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:37.330
so one of the themes in my forthcoming book,
which I'm writing right now,

986
01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:40.870
is that derivatives are like insurance.

987
01:07:40.871 --> 01:07:43.450
They're fundamentally important risk management vehicles,

988
01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:47.830
and they could have helped prevent the subprime crisis that we're now in if they

989
01:07:47.831 --> 01:07:50.170
had just gotten more established and more developed.
