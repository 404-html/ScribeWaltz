1
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.320
Thank the sort of first thing that,
um,
I,

2
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.770
I think most people think about,
or the first question when you're,

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.980
when you're thinking about financial markets,
um,

4
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.240
is whether they are efficient or not,
whether they,
um,
uh,

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.930
incorporate all known,
uh,
information,
um,

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.960
if it's possible to do sort of significantly

7
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.540
better than the market as,
as,
as a whole.
And,
um,

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.170
um,
I'm not,
I'm not sure,

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.640
used to be absolutely received economic wisdom that,

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.880
that financial markets where we're efficient now it's,
um,

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.890
I think it's still the dominant academic,
uh,
uh,
view,
but,

12
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.800
but,
um,
uh,
uh,
there's,
there's,
there's a big debate and,

13
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.100
and they're,
they're partisans on both sides.
It's actually,
to me,

14
00:00:53.101 --> 00:00:57.210
it's actually a fairly simple question.
The,
the efficient,

15
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.470
the notion that markets are efficient,
um,
derives from,

16
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:05.490
from an APP priori theory,
which is,
you know,
the same sort of theory about all,

17
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:09.840
all,
all Americans.
There lots of incentives,
people acting in their own interest.

18
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.910
Um,
uh,
they,
they,
they,
they,
they have to do that.
It's a very,

19
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.010
um,
um,
appealing,
you know,
kind of APP,
Priori theory.

20
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:21.900
But,
um,
uh,

21
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.040
the thing about theories is they're supposed to make predictions and if,

22
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.490
um,
some of the things they predict don't come true.

23
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.630
The theory has to be disregarded in there are,
there are many,
many,

24
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:37.300
many counter examples to um,

25
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.920
financial market efficiencies,
you know,
sort of,
um,

26
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.460
on one level there are things like companies that have two different classes of

27
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:51.650
stock,
um,
that are economically identical.
So,
um,

28
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.590
didn't,
um,
royal shell used to have uh,
uh,

29
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.050
Dutch shares,
uh,
uh,
that,
that,

30
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.260
that shares that,
that um,
um,

31
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.870
traded in Holland and dumb UK shares traded,
traded in London,

32
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.640
um,
economically identical.
Um,
but,

33
00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:18.500
but their prices would fluctuate and,
um,
um,
fairly dramatically in,

34
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.710
uh,
uh,
in 98,

35
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.570
I forget which way,
but,
um,
one of the share classes was at a a 20,

36
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.770
20% discount to the other and that,
and that persisted for several years.

37
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.330
So you have economically identical things trading at different prices.
Um,

38
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.100
you have closed end funds,
which are vehicles that,
um,
on,

39
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.323
um,

40
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.040
a set of other securities trade as a security listed on the stock exchange.

41
00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:50.310
But what they do is own other securities.
Um,

42
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.820
and whether they trade to a discount,
uh,

43
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.510
whether the security and the closed end fund trades at a discount or a premium

44
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.120
to the stuff they own,
um,
fluctuates,
um,
um,

45
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.350
meaningfully andW in a way that's sort of difficult to,
to,

46
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.450
to recognize with the idea that,
that,
uh,
uh,

47
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.870
uh,
the,
it,
the security should be reflecting,
um,

48
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.010
economic value.
Um,
you have,
um,

49
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.150
what are called stubs where one public company owns a significant stake in

50
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:29.520
another public company.
Um,
and,
uh,
uh,

51
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.670
in instances where the one,
um,
uh,

52
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.580
three comm owned palm,
um,

53
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.820
and the value of its palm stake greatly exceeded the total value of the market

54
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:47.860
capitalization of,
of,
of,
of three com.
And that,
and that persisted for,

55
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.490
um,
uh,
a number of years.
Um,

56
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.170
in general,
um,
uh,
uh,

57
00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.120
less volatile stocks have done better over time than more volatile stocks,

58
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.110
which is somewhat inconsistent with,
um,
uh,
uh,
the notion of,

59
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.840
of,
of efficient markets.
Um,
and,
um,
uh,

60
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.970
lastly there are,

61
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.670
there are meaningful number of individuals and institutions,

62
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.380
um,
uh,
who's,
um,
sort of performance.
Uh,

63
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.880
look whose performance in portfolios and that Matt,
you know,
um,

64
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.290
uh,
is really inconsistent with the markets being,

65
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.330
um,
uh,
efficient and can't really be explained away by,

66
00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.980
uh,
some,
some,
some of them can,
but,

67
00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.320
but by luck or by,
uh,

68
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.240
insight information whereby something,
um,
uh,

69
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.360
uh,
so,
uh,
while,

70
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.460
while they're sort of a big academic debate,
um,
and,

71
00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.180
and then lastly,
um,

72
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.520
there are things like the Internet bubble or more recently that the housing

73
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:07.930
bubble or,
um,
uh,
uh,

74
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.010
Matt usually called this,
but,
but the landing bubble where we're,
um,

75
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.990
or the subprime mess,
uh,
or so forth,
lot lots and lots of,
uh,

76
00:05:16.991 --> 00:05:20.020
security loans,
securities that people bought it,

77
00:05:20.021 --> 00:05:22.460
pyre that were worth about,
you know,

78
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.480
somewhere between zero and 15 or 20 cents and,
and,
and,

79
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.230
and now trade there.
So,
um,
uh,
um,

80
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.450
I don't believe that markets are efficient and,
um,
uh,

81
00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:42.100
um,
it doesn't really seem like it should be an open question.
So,
you know,

82
00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:44.770
the people that ha that believe it,
you know,
um,

83
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.630
have to die and then nobody will believe it anymore.
Um,

84
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.540
not very many of them change their mind though they come up with more convoluted

85
00:05:52.541 --> 00:05:55.300
explanations,
a clever,

86
00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.690
clever kind of alluded ex explanations for the,
uh,
um,

87
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:04.980
uh,
uh,
for the counterfactual,
uh,
uh,
for,

88
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.410
for the things that happened in reality that,
that,
that,
that the theory doesn't,

89
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.750
doesn't predict.
Um,
some,
some,

90
00:06:13.751 --> 00:06:18.751
some markets aren't that efficient on and on the other hand,

91
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.620
um,
sort of doing better than the markets,
um,
uh,

92
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.690
is,
um,
is a nontrivial exercise.
Yeah.
And,
um,

93
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.340
uh,
uh,

94
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.370
it's not as easy as as it might appear as,

95
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:40.760
um,
I mean some people think it's impossible.
Other people think it's really easy.

96
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:45.440
Uh,
uh,
it's actually,
you know,
not and passable,
um,

97
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.730
but hired and they are in the,
are there are a number of challenges,
um,

98
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.080
first,
um,
for individuals,

99
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.670
I think the primary challenge is,
um,
uh,
uh,

100
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.790
if an individual sticks to sort of areas where they might have an informational

101
00:07:03.891 --> 00:07:08.480
advantage or at least don't have an informational disadvantage.
Um,
they can't,

102
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:09.440
um,

103
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.440
they can't own a d they won't own a diversified portfolio of securities cause

104
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:19.250
they're informational advantage.
Um,
uh,
uh,
we'll be,

105
00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:24.040
we'll be narrow.
Um,
they also,
um,
have,

106
00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.880
have sort of limited,
uh,
access,
um,

107
00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.380
uh,
to the gamut of products and so forth and,
and,
and,

108
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.420
and restricted assets and restricted access and restricted offerings.

109
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:42.050
So,
so that's,
so that's a challenge for,
for individuals,

110
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:48.710
um,
institutions or,
or,
you know,
sort of,
um,

111
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:53.230
professional,
professional,
uh,
uh,
investors,
you know,
all,

112
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.600
all spend a lot of money on,
on,
on information,
and,
um,

113
00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.220
uh,
uh,
they are,
um,
um,

114
00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.070
which requires infrastructure and resources and so forth.

115
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:11.390
But the very sort of nature of being an institution,

116
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.400
um,
uh,
constraints almost everybody,
whether it's,
um,

117
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:22.010
uh,
um,
uh,
in,
in our case,

118
00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:26.960
um,
all our investors have 30 day liquidity.
They can,
you know,
um,

119
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:32.060
uh,
in mutual funds,
it's daily liquidity,
but their investors tend not to be,

120
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.690
uh,
uh,
as wide awake.
Um,

121
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.370
but that's a constraint on us is that,
um,
uh,

122
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.570
except for the principals,
uh,
maybe their families,

123
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:49.220
maybe not,
um,
all our money can,
can disappear in 30 days.
So,
so,

124
00:08:49.221 --> 00:08:53.900
so we,
so we have to be cognizant of that.
You know,
we had,
um,
uh,

125
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:59.050
uh,
we have clients that have,
you know,
sort of a,
um,
uh,

126
00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:03.050
a set of expectations,
uh,
um,

127
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.180
which you also have to,

128
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:10.880
if not be cat this in about,
you know,
sort of,
um,
uh,

129
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.680
uh,
deal with,
and then,
um,

130
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:20.750
and then there are kind of universal sort of psychological challenges,
um,

131
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:25.140
uh,
uh,
biases,
um,
in,

132
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.180
in people's thinking.
Um,
uh,
and,
uh,

133
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:35.960
um,
uh,
a number,
a number of things that are just sort of difficult,
um,

134
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.810
for,
for,
for human beings to,
to,
um,

135
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:43.940
process and make intelligent decisions.
And I think this,
this is,
um,
um,

136
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.820
that's kind of an,
um,
uh,
an area of mine.
And,

137
00:09:47.821 --> 00:09:52.050
and one of the things that,
that,
that,
uh,
um,
uh,

138
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.640
uh,
drew me to professor Shiller and,
and some of his,

139
00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:00.120
his other colleagues.
And that's really universal,
you know,

140
00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:04.110
to not just financial markets but,
but,
but,

141
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.173
but

142
00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.283
<v 1>okay,</v>

143
00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:17.250
<v 0>but,
but,
but,
but tall decision making.
And I think sort of particularly,</v>

144
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.610
um,
in the kinds of things that,
that,
um,
um,

145
00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:27.060
have a serious mix of randomness and skill,
that sort of the,

146
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.730
the hardest thing for human beings to,

147
00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:34.880
to process is something that's kind of an unknown mix of,
of,

148
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.200
of randomness and scale people that,
you know,
um,
uh,
uh,

149
00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:45.120
we can understand something that that's,
that's fully random and,
and the,
uh,

150
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:50.550
uh,
work out the statistics and,
um,
uh,

151
00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:55.560
be comfortable with that,
you know,
to some degree,
um,
uh,
uh,

152
00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:00.480
things that are,
you know,
sort of completely cut and dry,
fully,
fully,

153
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:04.980
fully determined to the Tif.
Um,
uh,

154
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.690
we like that too,
but,
but,
but stuff that's mixed,
um,

155
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:14.620
is,
is,
is,
is,
is very,
is very,
very hard.
I mean,
you know,
um,

156
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:18.870
quantum mechanics makes sense to no human being,
um,

157
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:24.310
uh,
uh,
in,
in,
in my view.
And,
and,
um,
and,
and,

158
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.710
and,
and,
and in those areas,
you know,
people,
um,
um,

159
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.680
people are inclined to do sort of,
sort of strange things.
I mean one thing,
um,

160
00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:38.680
um,
uh,
I play a fair amount of po well,
um,

161
00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.920
I play a little bit of poker and I'm very interested in the game and it's,

162
00:11:41.921 --> 00:11:43.530
it's sort of,
it's a little,

163
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.200
it's a little like the markets and other things in that,

164
00:11:46.201 --> 00:11:50.550
that there's an element of randomness and,
uh,

165
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:54.250
uh,
an element of,
of skill.
One thing that's

166
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.910
I find interesting,
um,
typically,
you know,
if,

167
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.250
if you play poker in a quiet room or casino,

168
00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.310
I would say nine times out of 10,

169
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:11.680
somebody sitting at the table will tell you that they're not trying.
It's,

170
00:12:11.681 --> 00:12:15.910
it almost always happens.
They'll say,
um,
uh,

171
00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:20.770
and I usually play for more money or,
and it's hard to concentrate or I'm just,

172
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:25.990
um,
uh,
uh,
screwing around,
um,

173
00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.950
very,
you know,
sort of why,
why do they do that?
What's,
what's,
what's,
what's,

174
00:12:29.951 --> 00:12:33.760
what's,
why,
why do they,
you know,
not they could just be screwing around,
but,

175
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:37.990
you know,
why do they tell you?
Um,
and it's,
you know,
it's kind of my,

176
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:43.460
um,
uh,
pet theory that,
you know,

177
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.150
they would rather,
um,
you know,

178
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:49.020
they're setting up in advance to lose,
you know,

179
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:53.650
they would rather lose because they're sort of screwing around then that's,

180
00:12:53.651 --> 00:12:58.330
that's,
that's easier for them to sort of deal with them then to,
um,
um,

181
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.640
they could put out their best game,
um,
and they would do better,
but,
but,

182
00:13:02.641 --> 00:13:07.230
but they might lose anyway.
Give,
given it's,
it's,
it's sort of randomness and,

183
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.640
and it,
it is,
you know,
that's,
that's,
um,

184
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:15.020
that's the thing about really good poker players versus less good poker players.

185
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.570
Really good poker players play close to their best all the time and,
and,

186
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.490
and they're not really bothered,
uh,
uh,
when,
when,
when they lose.

187
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:29.050
And I think that's,
um,
uh,

188
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.040
that's true in markets too,
in all,
in all sorts of decisions.
What,
what,
what,

189
00:13:33.041 --> 00:13:37.810
what people are inclined to do.
Where we're very interested in doing is,

190
00:13:37.811 --> 00:13:40.770
um,
uh,
uh,

191
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:44.620
setting up pastoring for credit and blame,
um,

192
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:48.750
in advance.
And,
you know,
sort of like having,
having,
having a pre,

193
00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:53.490
pre made excuse if things don't go right,
they're,
they're more there.

194
00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.530
I'm interested to some degree at least,
and having in,

195
00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.920
in having an excuse if things don't go right,

196
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:04.560
then in sort of maximizing the chance that things go right because,
um,

197
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:09.370
even maximizing the chance that things go right.
Um,
uh,

198
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:13.760
uh,
you can't get it to be 100%.
There's an element of randomness.
Um,

199
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.700
uh,
bad,
bad,
bad things can,
can,
can happen.
So,

200
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.160
so it's,
it's,
it's,
it's really,

201
00:14:21.161 --> 00:14:26.161
really hard to just focus on getting things right and not winning the argument.

202
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.120
You know,

203
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.170
setting yourself up before the fats that you can win an argument after the fact

204
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:37.020
that,
um,
uh,
you didn't,
you know,
you just,

205
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:41.860
you just got unlucky.
Um,
uh,

206
00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.960
um,
uh,
um,
people are,
you know,

207
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:51.010
people are very inclined to see things as determinative to sort of,

208
00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:54.780
to attribute,
um,
um,
and that not just in markets but,

209
00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:59.210
but the psycho psychology literature,
um,

210
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.700
uh,
to believe if you're wired to believe,
if something happened,
if,

211
00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:08.100
if [inaudible] happened before be,
um,
a Cosby,
um,

212
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.080
um,

213
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.940
B B has to be caused by something and a happened first,

214
00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.310
um,
before it so that,
so that's,
um,
uh,
uh,

215
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.680
uh,
what so,
so they,
so,
so they,
so they assigned causality there also,

216
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.120
um,
uh,
inclined to focus on sort of recency,
you know,
sort of thing.

217
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.380
Things they see.
Um,
um,
even,
um,

218
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.660
um,
uh,
even if,
if,
if,
you know,

219
00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:43.010
they are irrelevant.
You know,
for example,
in the psychology literature,

220
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:47.800
famous famous example is,
um,
famous kind of test question is I'm

221
00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:53.810
a tester.
Um,
we'll give the test,

222
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.000
the person taking the test,
um,

223
00:15:56.030 --> 00:16:00.560
the name of two cities that they've never heard of and the distance that they're

224
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.910
apart,
you know,
so,
uh,
two random cities,

225
00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.320
Xyz and ABC are,
uh,

226
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.240
4,200 miles apart.

227
00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.950
And then they'll give them to other cities that they've never heard of and ask

228
00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:18.290
them how far apart they think they are.

229
00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.730
And people anchor to the information they were given,
even though,
you know,

230
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:26.040
there's kind of no causality or no sort of reason why it,

231
00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.960
why it should make any difference.
So if,
so if the reference that he's,

232
00:16:29.961 --> 00:16:32.330
the first cities are 4,200 miles apart,

233
00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:36.440
the answers for the next two will center around 4,200 miles.

234
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:41.270
And if the reference cities,
uh,
we're 2,500 miles apart,

235
00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:46.340
uh,
they'll,
they'll,
they'll,
they'll,
they'll,
they'll,
they'll center about that.

236
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:51.410
Um,
um,
so,
um,
it is,
um,
uh,

237
00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:57.390
I think it's useful to sort of know all the hard wiring biases and,
and that,

238
00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:02.240
that,
that,
that,
that people have and to,
to,
to try and,
um,
uh,
uh,

239
00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:07.130
uh,
uh,
de bias.
Um,
uh,
you're thinking,
but it's,

240
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:12.060
um,
um,
it's,
it's,
it's not easy.
Um,
and,
and,
and,

241
00:17:12.061 --> 00:17:16.960
and in lots of cases,
it's,
it's not actually people's objectives if,
um,
um,

242
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:19.520
and if you watch mad money on CNBC,

243
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:25.130
Jim Cramer and any Kramer rights,
nobody,

244
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:32.310
um,
well,
he starts,
it starts this start to show,
um,

245
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:37.290
uh,
some people want to make friends,
I just want to make money.
Um,

246
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:41.600
and if you watch the show and you see Kramer,
it's,
um,
um,

247
00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:46.280
it's pretty believable.
I,
you know,
I think,
um,
uh,
I think,
I think it's true.

248
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:49.220
Um,
and,
um,
um,

249
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:54.530
almost everybody in sort of financial markets is capable of saying that,

250
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.460
you know,
I,
uh,
uh,
I don't want to make friends.
I just want to make money.

251
00:17:59.461 --> 00:18:02.490
But for most of them it's,
it's not true.
You know,
they have,

252
00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:07.200
they have all sorts of things that they want to do.
I,
the other than than,
than,

253
00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:11.130
than,
than make money.
They have office politics.
They have,
uh,

254
00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:16.740
um,
uh,
um,
any,
any number of,
of,

255
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:20.990
of,
of,
uh,
of,
of other motivations.
And,
and,
um,

256
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.920
that,
that,
that psychology is,
is,
is,
is,

257
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.790
is really hard and,
and,
um,
uh,

258
00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:33.340
somewhat applicable to not just markets,
but,
but,
uh,

259
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:38.070
other things.
Um,
um,
so,

260
00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:43.890
uh,
uh,
so markets aren't efficient,
but it,
but it's not,

261
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:48.510
it's,
it's not that easy to,
to,
to beat them.
Um,

262
00:18:48.860 --> 00:18:53.490
what are,
what are,
what are,
what are we try to do?
And I kind of would highlight,

263
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.590
um,
um,
would I view was,
um,

264
00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.850
uh,
three,
three sorts of principles.
The,
um,
first,

265
00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.950
um,
the invest the investment world,
um,

266
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:12.650
I believe divides between coupon clippers.
Yeah.
Um,

267
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:18.320
that's the bands historically came with coupons,

268
00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.270
you know,
actual sort of coupons like the thing you bri,

269
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:25.540
Bri by Brit bring to the grocery store and,
um,

270
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:31.590
you know,
get 25 cents off a can of coffee.
So we have this security and,
and,

271
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:32.700
and a,
uh,

272
00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:37.320
a 10 year bond would have 20 coupons attached to each with a,

273
00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.440
with the data on them.
And when the date came,
um,

274
00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.160
he would cut the coupon off and go to the bank and get,

275
00:19:44.161 --> 00:19:49.020
get your interest payment.
Um,
so that was called coupon clipping.
Um,

276
00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:51.150
basically,
um,
uh,

277
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:54.540
something that you re coupons or things that you redeem for,

278
00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:57.780
for a stream of money.
And,
and,
um,
my view,

279
00:19:57.781 --> 00:20:02.520
the world divides between,
between coupon clippers,
you know,

280
00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:06.070
sort of people that are taking that are interested in cashflow and taking in k

281
00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:08.400
cash flow.
Um,
and I,

282
00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:13.120
and what I would call security resellers,
um,
um,

283
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.840
people that own things that they intend,
um,

284
00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.360
uh,
they intend to sell to somebody in the future at,
at,
um,

285
00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.710
a higher price.
And,
um,

286
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:30.090
there are successful coupon clippers and they're successful securities resellers

287
00:20:30.091 --> 00:20:32.880
and they,
they tend to make their money off of,
you know,

288
00:20:32.881 --> 00:20:37.590
sort of the off of the unsuccessful people in,
in the,

289
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:41.700
the other class.
Um,
um,
uh,

290
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.620
we try to be,
you know,

291
00:20:43.621 --> 00:20:48.460
I think sort of invest investing is about clipping coupons,

292
00:20:48.461 --> 00:20:52.930
about getting about getting cash flow and having,
getting and controlling,

293
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:58.030
um,
uh,
uh,
can't cash cash flow.
But,
um,

294
00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.900
there are,
there are,
there are good resellers and I think,
you know,
I think,

295
00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:06.250
I think reselling is an element of things like venture capital,
the best,

296
00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:11.140
the best venture capital capitalists don't just,
you know,
have,

297
00:21:11.141 --> 00:21:16.120
have great ideas or,
or,
or whatever.
But,
um,
uh,
they take an idea,

298
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:20.570
they advance it a little bit,
um,
and then they,
they,

299
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:25.630
they sex it up and promote it and have a good sense for what the public will

300
00:21:25.931 --> 00:21:30.550
buy.
Um,
and,
and they get a nice valuation from,
from,
from,

301
00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.930
from the public.
And I think that that's,
uh,

302
00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.530
uh,
that's at least as much as distinguishing feature between,
um,

303
00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:44.110
good vent venture capitalists among each other then then,
then,
then,

304
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:48.900
then the quality of their ideas.
Um,
there are sort of,
um,
um,

305
00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:49.781
Kramer,
again,

306
00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:54.781
Kramer Kramer was a good resell security reseller.

307
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:59.280
Um,
uh,
hat had sort of a really good spend,

308
00:21:59.290 --> 00:22:00.730
a lot of time and effort and you know,

309
00:22:00.731 --> 00:22:05.050
kind of figuring out what is it that people will want to buy next week.

310
00:22:05.051 --> 00:22:09.130
And that's,
and that's what,
that's what I'll buy today.
I'm not,

311
00:22:09.131 --> 00:22:12.910
because I'll derive income off of it.
Um,

312
00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.790
but because,
um,
uh,

313
00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.810
it's what people are going to want next week,
uh,

314
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.530
and I'll be able to sell it higher.
And that's,
you know,
that,
that's,
you know,

315
00:22:23.531 --> 00:22:27.790
some art,
some science,
and there are people that that are,
are,
are very,

316
00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:32.590
very good at it.
Um,
uh,
uh,
but,
um,

317
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.970
I,
you know,
we tried,
we tried,
we tried to clip coupons,
um,

318
00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:42.520
uh,
uh,
asked us some,
um,
that's,
that's,
um,

319
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.650
it's a Warren buffet,
Islam,
he says all invest all investing is,

320
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:52.330
is about,
um,
um,
coupon clipping and,
um,

321
00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:56.760
uh,
the difference between equities and bonds are that,
um,

322
00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.420
bonds come with a coupon that,

323
00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:02.800
that's known and equities have earnings in the future that,

324
00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.640
that you don't know.
Um,

325
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.900
you also don't know that they'll give them to the equity owners and that to

326
00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:12.850
management or not to,
they won't squander them in,
in,
in,
in,
in,
in,

327
00:23:12.851 --> 00:23:17.620
in,
in,
in the future.
But,
but,
but,
but to buffet it is sort of the same thing.
It's,

328
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:19.380
it's,
it's clipping coupons and,

329
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:24.550
and he describes his job is figuring out what the coupon is in an equity.
Um,

330
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.890
uh,
and uh,
um,
if it's high enough,
he,
he,
he likes it.
So,
so,

331
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.640
so,
so the first sort of principle to me is,
is,
is clipping coupons.
Uh,
the,
um,

332
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:41.020
uh,
the second,
um,
is that,
um,
uh,

333
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.830
um,

334
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:46.830
risk is primarily about what is the worst thing that can happen.

335
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.640
Um,
yeah.
And,
um,
you know,
typical sort of secure,
you know,

336
00:23:52.641 --> 00:23:57.020
Wall Street risk management,
um,
uh,

337
00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.210
a lot of focus is on,
um,

338
00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:04.770
what is the range of moderately profitable,
um,

339
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:09.450
outcomes.
So,
um,
um,
people talk about via,
um,

340
00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.560
value at risk and,
um,
lots,

341
00:24:12.561 --> 00:24:16.310
lots of people trying to build viasystems.
Uh,

342
00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:21.340
and what they are trying to determine is how wide is the band of outcomes,

343
00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.910
how wide is the band of,

344
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:28.990
of stuff that has a 95% probability or 98% probability,

345
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.420
usually 95 or 98.
But I'm not,
you know,

346
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.840
99.9.
And,
and if,
and if you know,

347
00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.410
um,
uh,

348
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:47.300
I have a 98% chance of not losing a dollar,

349
00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:52.120
um,
that works in the virus screen and,
and,

350
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.100
and the vibe,
and it won't tell you,
well,

351
00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:00.280
won't distinguish between whether the 2% chance is of losing $10 or losing $100.

352
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.820
And,
um,
to me,
um,

353
00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.220
um,
uh,
uh,
that's,
that's,

354
00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:15.250
that's a fundamentally wrong approach and it's actually done because,

355
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:21.380
um,
uh,
it's the sort of thing that,
um,
um,

356
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:25.340
statisticians are good at.
And,
and,
and,
um,
to some degree it's,

357
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:30.350
it's harder to imagine the worst thing then to statistically sort of figure out,

358
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:35.340
um,
uh,
uh,
the,
the middle band and there's,
um,

359
00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:38.720
there's,
there's a famous saying,
if you're good with a hammer,

360
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:43.280
everything looks like a nail.
Um,
and that's,
that's sort of what,

361
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:48.410
uh,
uh,
that,
that's,
that's like,
but,
but,

362
00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:52.070
but the really important thing is,
um,
what's,

363
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:56.590
what's the worst thing that that can happen?
Um,
um,

364
00:25:57.050 --> 00:26:00.630
and the last sort of principle,

365
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:06.920
which is actually,
you know,
most,
um,

366
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.810
most at odds with sort of the academic community and,
and,
and even,

367
00:26:11.811 --> 00:26:16.590
you know,
sort of the,
the,
the general perception and that is,

368
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:21.560
um,
that,
um,
you don't get paid for taking risk.

369
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.230
You get paid for eliminating risk.

370
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.640
Now I actually believe in,
um,
uh,

371
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.400
in the history of the planet,
there are very,

372
00:26:31.401 --> 00:26:35.760
very few instances of people getting paid for taking risk.
They get paid for,

373
00:26:35.761 --> 00:26:40.220
for eliminating it.
Um,
uh,
as,
as,

374
00:26:40.221 --> 00:26:44.180
as an example,
um,
if you think,
you know,
um,

375
00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:49.440
a,
a tight rope walk,
a tight rope Walker in,

376
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.800
uh,
in the circus,
um,

377
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:58.170
or there's a conception that he gets paid because it's a risky,
drab,

378
00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:03.240
he might fall.
He,
you know,
he might fall down,
kill himself.
Um,

379
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:08.430
I think that conception is completely wrong.
Now the lifetime earnings of a,
of a,

380
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:13.620
a tight wire Walker who falls down and kills himself aren't very good.

381
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.900
And,
um,
in fact,

382
00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:20.730
what he's getting paid for is that he practiced a whole lot when he was a little

383
00:27:20.731 --> 00:27:22.750
kid.
And,
uh,

384
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:27.720
a wire that if he fell off of he wasn't going to get hurt.
Um,
uh,

385
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:32.750
and that he's really getting paid for eliminating the risk of falling off via

386
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.770
practice as opposed to taking it.
Um,

387
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.910
you think about drug development,
pharmaceutical companies and,
um,
um,

388
00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.720
people will say,
well,
you know,
um,
uh,

389
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:51.500
discovering compounds that are effective drugs is an uncertain or risky risky

390
00:27:53.791 --> 00:27:58.710
business.
And that's so,
so pharmaceutical companies are able to make,

391
00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:03.210
you know,
it sort of get paid for taking that risk.
Um,
and,

392
00:28:03.211 --> 00:28:07.190
and I don't think so.
I think they get paid,
um,

393
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:12.090
for applying intelligence and nat testing every,

394
00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:14.130
you know,
not for the compounds they test,

395
00:28:14.131 --> 00:28:19.131
but for the ones that they've eliminated testing for because they know,

396
00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:23.730
you know,
because they understand that the,
um,

397
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:29.180
the chemistry or a disease process and have and have some idea what sort of comp

398
00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:34.400
compounds,
um,
our,
um,
um,

399
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:39.290
or are,
are,
are more likely,
uh,
uh,
to,
to,

400
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:43.710
to work then than others.
When I,
uh,
I don't know if he remembers this,
but when I,

401
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:47.670
when I last sorted,
you know,
sort of explain this to professor Shiller,
he said,

402
00:28:47.671 --> 00:28:52.080
well,
what about insurance companies?
And I,
and I said,
proves my point.
You know,

403
00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:56.460
the,
the sort of exact exact case,
um,

404
00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:00.440
uh,
and insurance,
um,
uh,
um,

405
00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:05.160
and an individual,
you know,
has,
has risk of,
of,

406
00:29:05.161 --> 00:29:09.600
of certain bad,
you know,
bad things,
um,
uh,
happening.

407
00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:14.040
If I'm,
um,
if the insurance company has risk,

408
00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:16.460
it's because they've made a mistake,
you know,

409
00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:19.840
if they're sort of doing their job right,
they're,
they're,
you know,

410
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:22.560
they're actually,
um,
uh,
diversify,

411
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:27.660
diversifying away all the risk and,
and,

412
00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:32.070
and relying on the law of large numbers,
you know,
so,

413
00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:34.320
um,
a casino,
you know,

414
00:29:34.321 --> 00:29:39.321
does not have a risk that the law of large numbers will be repealed and a

415
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.450
roulette table will be a longterm losing proposition or a craps table will be a

416
00:29:46.451 --> 00:29:51.310
longterm losing proposition.
Uh,
uh,
uh,

417
00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.980
they,
you know,
they have risk that,
you know,

418
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:56.610
their overhead won't cover it or that they won't have their risks,

419
00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.640
that a steady stream of people won't come and,
and be,

420
00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:05.380
be making a steady stream of bats at which each of them has a slightly negative

421
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:09.100
expectation.
Um,
so,

422
00:30:09.101 --> 00:30:13.930
so we really want to think whenever we look at,
at,
at anything,

423
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:17.050
um,
uh,
uh,

424
00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.890
what kind of coupons can we extract,
um,

425
00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:26.670
what's the worst possible thing that can happen and how can we eliminate that,

426
00:30:28.150 --> 00:30:33.100
you know,
and,
and,
and we do that.
Um,
sometimes,
um,
uh,

427
00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:37.570
uh,
it's,
it's by diversification having a lot of sort of,

428
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:43.010
um,
of,
of,
of uh,
uh,
independent sort of,

429
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.140
sort of that's more times.
Um,

430
00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.730
it's having an offsetting kind of position where,
um,

431
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:56.890
we're long one security that,
uh,
uh,

432
00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:01.300
issued by a company and try something else that,
that,
um,

433
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:06.490
uh,
uh,
uh,
we think we think,
um,

434
00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:11.380
uh,
eliminates our risk.
So a common kind of position,
um,

435
00:31:11.530 --> 00:31:13.520
will be long,
a high yielding bond

436
00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:19.870
bond that yield sort of 15 or 16,
um,
present.

437
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:25.120
Uh,
and,
uh,
um,
I mean,
hypothetically,

438
00:31:25.121 --> 00:31:28.530
a bond trading at 60 cents on the dollar,
uh,

439
00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:32.650
with an 8% coupon,
uh,
uh,

440
00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:37.630
five year bond that's yielding about 18%.

441
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:42.760
Um,
maybe the company has a $15 equity price.

442
00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:47.730
Um,
and,
uh,
we'll be short 15 cents of,
of,

443
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.790
of,
of the equity m and a,

444
00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:56.140
which we'll try and keep all,
all the way down if,
if,
if,

445
00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.790
if the stock's $20 and we could stay short 20 cents worth of stock,

446
00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.650
all the,
all the way down if the company went bankrupt,
company goes to zero.

447
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:09.190
Um,
uh,
on our short position,

448
00:32:09.191 --> 00:32:11.350
we'll have taken in about $60,

449
00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:16.010
which is what we owned at the bind for what we paid for the bond.
Um,

450
00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:21.070
we have a superior claim in bankruptcy,
will,
we'll,
we'll recover something.
Um,

451
00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:25.660
and,
um,
uh,
uh,
in the meantime,
we,

452
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:30.600
we get this 8% coupon that,
that we get to,
to,
to,

453
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:34.990
to clip.
Um,
so that's,
that's coupon clipping and,

454
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.420
and risk mitigation.
Now,
now there's,

455
00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:42.020
there's the other side of the stock going up and we have to think about,
um,
uh,

456
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:43.400
uh,

457
00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:48.410
how much that can cost us and whether our coupons are enough and whether the

458
00:32:48.411 --> 00:32:53.411
difference between 60 cents that we paid and the hundred that the bond matures

459
00:32:53.541 --> 00:32:58.430
enough is,
is,
is app to cover that.
But that's,
that's,

460
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:02.060
that's,
that's the sort of thing.
Um,
we do and it's,

461
00:33:02.061 --> 00:33:05.420
it's coupon clipping and it's,
um,

462
00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:10.730
a risk mitigation or,
or risk elimination.

463
00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:16.670
Fair fit,
fairly short.
Um,
the last thing,
um,

464
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.860
I thought I'd,
um,
uh,
uh,

465
00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.580
talk a little bit about,
is,
um,
um,
what's,
um,

466
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:29.210
what's happening in the,
in the world today and the,

467
00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:34.170
the financial system today,
which,
um,
uh,

468
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:38.300
uh,
to us,
um,
it's,
it's,

469
00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:44.110
um,
if,
um,
uh,
if you're trading at an,

470
00:33:44.111 --> 00:33:45.350
an investing,
you know,

471
00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:49.880
kind of all sort of strange things happening in your world,

472
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:55.100
um,
uh,
and,
um,
uh,
uh,

473
00:33:55.230 --> 00:34:00.000
they're,
they're just unbelievable.
Um,
and,
uh,
um,

474
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:04.400
you go outside and,
um,
uh,
you,
you,

475
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:09.680
you talked to people that have jobs and,
and you know,
and lives or,

476
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:14.340
or,
or go to school.
Um,
and they're completely unaware that,
you know,

477
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:17.230
they're,
they're,
they're absolutely,
you know,

478
00:34:17.231 --> 00:34:20.960
they have absolutely no idea that this really amazing,

479
00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:25.760
unbelievable thing,
you know,
just happened.
You know,
so like,
um,

480
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:30.500
uh,
there's,
um,
uh,
uh,

481
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:33.840
there's a shortage in,
um,
uh,
um,

482
00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:38.200
hard red winter wheat and the,
the,
um,
uh,
um,

483
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:43.160
uh,
uh,
so,
um,
uh,
Minneapolis,

484
00:34:43.161 --> 00:34:48.161
so Minneapolis wheat has gone from kind of 10 to 24 now back to now,

485
00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.030
now to about 18 or 20.

486
00:34:53.570 --> 00:34:58.460
But in one day it went from a 20 to 24 and a half,

487
00:34:58.461 --> 00:35:02.360
a 22% move,
um,
in,
in,
in,

488
00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.990
in Minneapolis,
wheat,
you know,
and,
uh,
um,

489
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:10.370
most of the people in the world,
you know,
had no idea that,
that,
that,

490
00:35:10.371 --> 00:35:14.840
that had occurred and it makes absolutely no difference to them.

491
00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:20.070
Well,
one of the things that sort of happening,
uh,
in,
in,
in,

492
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:24.260
in,
in the world that's,
you know,
sort of central to the people that,

493
00:35:24.261 --> 00:35:28.070
that look at it all the,
all the time.
Um,

494
00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:33.910
but of,
of maybe less direct relevance to,
um,

495
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:36.740
uh,
uh,
to,

496
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:41.880
to people that that bad head had everyday jobs.
Um,
is that,

497
00:35:41.881 --> 00:35:44.580
um,
um,
the banking,
you know,

498
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:48.060
more so then,
um,
I mean,

499
00:35:48.061 --> 00:35:51.420
I've been at this for 30 years.
Um,

500
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:56.310
and in those sort of 30 years,
there've been lots of,
you know,

501
00:35:56.311 --> 00:36:01.190
sort of mini crises and,
um,
uh,
uh,

502
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:05.990
um,
violent violent moves up or down,
um,

503
00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:10.670
dramatic squeezes or,
or,
or,
or liquidations.

504
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:15.680
But I'm more so then than any time in,
in the past,

505
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:20.180
um,
uh,
30 years,
um,
uh,
the banking,

506
00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:25.130
the banking system is really closed.
Um,
um,
the,
um,

507
00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:30.100
the,
the big American banks are not functioning.
They're,
they're,
they're,

508
00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:31.580
um,
you know,

509
00:36:31.581 --> 00:36:35.870
their doors are open and people come and go ev ev every day.

510
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:40.580
Um,
uh,
but,
um,
they're there,

511
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:45.470
they're there.
They're not really open for business.
Um,
uh,

512
00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:46.720
you know,
they're,
uh,

513
00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:51.680
they're neither making loans nor selling the loans.

514
00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:56.470
Um,
uh,
uh,
uh,
they have,
um,

515
00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:01.270
and it's,
um,
um,
uh,
um,

516
00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:06.870
uh,
it is,
it is starting,
you know,
it's,
it's,
um,

517
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:11.870
it's affecting,
you know,
sort of the fringes of corporate America,
uh,

518
00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:16.920
now not in that yet.
Um,
uh,
uh,

519
00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.880
uh,
uh,
all of it.
Um,

520
00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:26.130
and it's,
um,
um,
it's what happened in Japan.

521
00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.330
Uh,
I know from 90 to,

522
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:35.490
is it over in Japan,
you know,
maybe,
or maybe not,
you know,

523
00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:40.560
uh,
they usually talk about it as,
as,
as,
as the lost decade.

524
00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:44.580
Um,
um,
Jap,
um,
were,
were,
were,

525
00:37:44.610 --> 00:37:48.990
were Japanese banks were not liquidated,
but they were not,

526
00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.610
um,
uh,
uh,
real,
real,
really in business.

527
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:58.560
Um,
and,
uh,
uh,
that's,

528
00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:03.300
that's happened now.
No,
primarily as,
as,
uh,
as the result of,

529
00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.460
of,
of losses in,
um,
um,
uh,

530
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:12.860
now all mortgages.
Um,
but,
um,
uh,

531
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:16.280
mortgage just and,
um,
and,
and,
and,

532
00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:20.420
and leverage loans and the,
um,
um,

533
00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.680
and in my view,
um,
uh,
um,

534
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:30.600
uh,
uh,
the fad,
um,
had,

535
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:35.440
um,
uh,
the fat has dramatically cut interest rates.

536
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.090
Um,
uh,
you know,
we started,
um,
from,
from 5%,

537
00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:45.130
uh,
to three,
but three quarters of it,

538
00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.280
a quarter at a time.
Every fed meeting,

539
00:38:48.281 --> 00:38:51.580
which are fed meetings are generally about six weeks apart,

540
00:38:51.581 --> 00:38:56.581
but then one and a quarter of it within a two week period from four and a

541
00:38:57.911 --> 00:39:02.350
quarter to three.
And,
and they're,
and they're talking about,
um,

542
00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:07.150
uh,
looks like,
uh,
they'll go from three to two and a half,

543
00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:12.610
uh,
whenever the next,
what's the next fed meeting,
um,

544
00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:16.090
in,
in,
um,
within,
uh,
within a couple of weeks.

545
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:19.690
And the markets are saying they're going to go all the way back to one,

546
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:24.730
which was,
which was the low for,
for,
for short term rates.
Um,

547
00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:29.020
uh,
proport it,
you know,
um,
uh,

548
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:33.910
to some degree they say,
um,
um,

549
00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:38.190
uh,
their,
their,
their,
their,
their,
their objective is,

550
00:39:38.191 --> 00:39:43.000
is to fold,
um,
to spur economic growth,

551
00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:47.200
um,
uh,
as,
um,
uh,
as,

552
00:39:47.201 --> 00:39:51.730
as the credit crunch sort of slows,
um,
economic activity.

553
00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:54.100
Um,
and also,
you know,

554
00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:57.970
I mean kind of independently or compliment or really as,

555
00:39:57.971 --> 00:40:02.290
as a corollary to that,
um,
uh,
to,

556
00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:06.520
to free up the financial system,
um,
and to,

557
00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.420
to help financial institutions.
Um,
it's,

558
00:40:10.421 --> 00:40:14.830
it's kind of my contention around that.

559
00:40:14.831 --> 00:40:19.030
It's that it's actually hurting financial institutions.

560
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:24.010
It's actually having the effect of not,
um,
um,

561
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:28.780
of not letting the,
the,
the market's clear.
Um,

562
00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.740
and it's,
it's,

563
00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:33.330
<v 2>um,
uh,
uh,</v>

564
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:38.270
<v 0>it's nature of financial.
Um,
um,
uh,
well,</v>

565
00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:43.100
I mean that,
um,
when I was explaining that to professor Shiller,
he's,
he said he,

566
00:40:43.101 --> 00:40:46.550
you know,
he didn't quite follow it,
so I probably shouldn't try it.

567
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:52.580
And he knows more than I do.
So,
um,
um,
but it,
but,
but,

568
00:40:52.581 --> 00:40:57.560
but,
but,
but,
but,
but it's,
but it's a very interesting time in that,

569
00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:01.180
um,
uh,
we're,
um,
we're having a bit,

570
00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:04.560
<v 2>uh,
uh,</v>

571
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:09.280
<v 0>we have consumers under pressure because of,
um,</v>

572
00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:13.540
uh,
uh,
they are over extension of credit and,

573
00:41:13.541 --> 00:41:17.560
and they're having a overpaid for houses,
um,
over,

574
00:41:17.561 --> 00:41:21.750
over the last,
um,
a handful of,

575
00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:22.780
of years.
You know,

576
00:41:22.781 --> 00:41:27.250
we have kind of a slowing economy I had there because of that or because you

577
00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:31.900
know,
the economy kind of slows,
um,
uh,
uh,

578
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:33.980
f,
F,
F,
F,
F,
F,

579
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.880
every once in a while we have financial institutions under,

580
00:41:37.881 --> 00:41:42.860
under stress,
um,
uh,
or,
or duress.

581
00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:47.720
Um,
and unlike sort of the,
the previous time,
um,

582
00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:49.900
we,
we,
um,
um,

583
00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:54.800
we have headline inflation of 4.3%.

584
00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.060
Uh,
I think it's high or,
you know,

585
00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:01.760
I think lots of economists think it's lower,
but,

586
00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:06.710
but it's quite headline inflation is,
is higher than,

587
00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:11.660
um,
uh,
not nominal interest.
Um,
uh,

588
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:16.690
then,
um,
uh,
nominal interest rates,
uh,
uh,

589
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:21.670
we have a very weak currency.
The,
um,
um,
uh,

590
00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:26.110
the dollar has gone from,
uh,
uh,
uh,

591
00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:30.740
um,
from buying a little over one year old to,

592
00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:35.900
to buying two thirds of a year old.
Um,
and,

593
00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.150
uh,
uh,
uh,

594
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:43.970
a couple of years and 130 yen to a hundred yen,

595
00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.690
um,
one and a half Australian dollars to a little,
uh,

596
00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:52.580
a little over one.
Um,
and the,
um,
uh,

597
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:57.320
uh,
um,
uh,
um,
uh,

598
00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.060
uh,
and,
and,
and Ann,
Ann,
Ann,
Ann,
an Ann Ann.

599
00:43:01.061 --> 00:43:05.600
In that scenario,
um,
there,

600
00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:10.370
there are more problems than policy tools.
So,

601
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:15.670
um,
anything,
um,
uh,
uh,
any,
any,
any,

602
00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:19.550
any,
any,
any policy action,
um,
uh,

603
00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:22.280
has downside,
you know,
which,
um,

604
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.040
which makes it an interesting time,

605
00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:31.130
not half the time.
So it's a questions.

606
00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:39.370
<v 3>There's
the,</v>

607
00:43:55.810 --> 00:44:00.640
<v 0>um,
I think that the question is,</v>

608
00:44:00.670 --> 00:44:02.500
you know,
sort of,
um,
um,

609
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:07.950
whether markets are more apt to overprice toe overpriced versus underprice,

610
00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:14.850
whether they're more inefficient when things are going up or when things are

611
00:44:15.311 --> 00:44:19.390
going down.
Um,
uh,

612
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:25.990
um,
I don't,
I don't think I have a systemic sort of view.
I mean,

613
00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:30.890
you know,
lately they've been more inefficient,
you know,
um,
uh,
uh,

614
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:33.780
uh,
um,
uh,
in my view because,

615
00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:37.950
because the feds creating too much money.
But,
um,

616
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.210
uh,

617
00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:44.280
in recent years there've been more examples of things that are priced too high

618
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:49.320
than things that are priced too low.
Um,
but,
but,

619
00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:52.260
but,
but,
but,
but there are both and,
and,
uh,

620
00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.950
<v 2>um,
uh,
uh,</v>

621
00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.730
<v 0>it makes mistakes in both directions.</v>

622
00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:03.493
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

623
00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:14.340
<v 3>How do you think are the best ways an individual,</v>

624
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:19.010
<v 0>um,</v>

625
00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:27.360
again,
this,
this,
this is something that,
that,
um,

626
00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:31.770
uh,
I think Ben Stein agrees with,
but,

627
00:45:31.771 --> 00:45:36.700
but just about,
um,
uh,
nobody else.
I think,

628
00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:40.200
I think for individuals,
um,
um,

629
00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:44.810
instead of thinking of,
um,
uh,
I want,

630
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.150
uh,

631
00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:50.800
I want to have report actually to have a portfolio and I should be invested all

632
00:45:50.801 --> 00:45:55.030
the time and,
uh,
uh,
I,

633
00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:59.480
I should divide it up.
Um,
uh,
you know,

634
00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:03.820
Kay ash stack and bonds depending that pan.
Um,
how,

635
00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.680
how old I am.
Um,
I think,
you know,

636
00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:10.850
people's default position should be cached.

637
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:15.070
Individuals default position should be cash and,

638
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:19.660
um,
uh,
they should only make,
um,

639
00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:24.810
uh,
in,
um,
investments.
Um,
if,
if there's really,

640
00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:29.220
if they can see a really compelling case,
um,

641
00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:34.240
and you know,
over over the course of time,
um,
um,

642
00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:37.810
uh,
fairly compelling,
um,

643
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:42.700
fairly compelling cases do come up and they're not,
you know,

644
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:47.350
um,
and individuals are,
are in as good a position as,
as professionals,

645
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:48.593
um,

646
00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:52.640
<v 2>uh,
uh,
uh,
uh,</v>

647
00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:56.040
<v 0>to,
to,
to,
to,
to,
to see that.</v>

648
00:46:56.041 --> 00:47:00.610
So sometime in,
in your lifetime.
Um,

649
00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:05.040
uh,
um,
stacks,
um,
uh,

650
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:10.310
um,
equities as a group.
Um,
um,

651
00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:15.000
we'll,
we'll,
um,
we'll be,
we'll be,
we'll be cheap by sort of,

652
00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:20.100
you know,
most of the standards that,
that have have worked in,
in,
in,

653
00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:24.630
in,
in the past.
So,
um,
um,
uh,

654
00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:29.410
professor Shiller in his books,
he's,
he's got,
um,
uh,

655
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:34.410
current multiple of trailing 10 earnings,
um,

656
00:47:35.110 --> 00:47:38.900
um,
uh,
uh,
good measure.

657
00:47:38.901 --> 00:47:43.510
So that takes the cyclicality,
uh,
uh,
out,
out,
out,
out,

658
00:47:43.511 --> 00:47:44.710
out of earnings.
And,
and,

659
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:49.330
and you can see over history how that multiple has varied.

660
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:54.400
Um,
and you've done very well,
you know,
over,
you know,
you've done poorly.

661
00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:58.030
Uh,
if for the most part,
if,
if,
um,

662
00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:02.180
snacks is done much better if,
if you've bought them at a,
at,

663
00:48:02.190 --> 00:48:06.850
at a point that looks cheap and that graft and one that that looks expensive

664
00:48:06.851 --> 00:48:08.200
and,
uh,
um,

665
00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:13.060
sometime in your lifetime you'll get an opportunity,
uh,

666
00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:16.930
for,
um,
stacks and look cheap and they measure,

667
00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:21.760
they'll probably at the same time look cheap,
um,
on a,
uh,

668
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.940
on a price to book basis on a dividend yield basis that they,
they,

669
00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:31.090
they,
they tend to,
to,
to move together and you can sort of look at them and say,

670
00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:34.690
no equities as,
as,
as a class are cheap.

671
00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:38.620
I have a compelling reason to sort of take money out of cash and,

672
00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:43.570
and put it into equities.
Now,
I mean,
I think,
um,

673
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:49.120
um,
uh,
a few years ago as,
um,

674
00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:54.100
uh,
um,
as,
as the housing bubble,
um,

675
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:59.310
was taking off and going full bore and as it was easier and easier for more and

676
00:48:59.681 --> 00:49:04.660
more people,
uh,
who normally couldn't have bought house houses to,
um,

677
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:09.760
uh,
uh,
to,
to eight,
you know,
to,
to go from renting,

678
00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:14.370
um,
uh,
uh,
to owning homes.
Um,

679
00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:19.320
apartments,
residential reads,
apartment house reads.
Um,
we're again,

680
00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:23.740
you know,
you know,
sort of an obvious historical measures.
Um,

681
00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:27.520
uh,
interesting.
Maybe even even compelling,
you know,
so,
so,

682
00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:31.450
so you could buy apartment buildings for way less than it costs to,
to,

683
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:35.600
to replace them.
You could,
um,
uh,

684
00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:39.790
with public apartment reeds you could get,
you know,
between,

685
00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:44.560
um,
a,
you know,
five and 9%,

686
00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.840
uh,
uh,
current income component when interest rates were,
you know,
down at,

687
00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.080
at,
at,
at,
at two or three,

688
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.860
that was pretty compelling.
Didn't re,
you know,
as,

689
00:49:56.861 --> 00:50:01.690
as sort of an asset class and,
uh,
um,
uh,
uh,

690
00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:06.880
uh,
worked,
worked,
worked really,
really well.
Um,
um,

691
00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:10.590
municipal bonds right now,
um,

692
00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:16.630
municipal bonds yield more than the equivalent yield more than the equivalent

693
00:50:16.631 --> 00:50:21.130
treasuries.
Um,
proximately,
um,
1.1,

694
00:50:21.131 --> 00:50:25.540
1.2,
um,
uh,
uh,
times.

695
00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:29.540
That's,
um,
uh,
that's,
that's,

696
00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:34.130
that's pretty compelling.
The,
um,
the only other time that happened was one,
um,

697
00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:37.430
there was sort of talk of,
of their losing their tax exemptions and,

698
00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:42.350
and tax rates were going down.
Tax rates are going up.
Uh,
there's no talk about,

699
00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:47.570
about losing in their,
their exemption.
That's,
that's pretty compelling.

700
00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:01.770
<v 3>I just want to point out that contradicts one of our</v>

701
00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:07.710
docs
should be equities,

702
00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:09.910
might misunderstand you or

703
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:14.210
<v 0>I disagree with them.
Um,
uh,
you know,
I,</v>

704
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:18.870
and,
and,
and Ben Stein,
I think is the only person who,

705
00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:23.500
who sort of agrees with then he,
he wrote a book,
yes,
you can time the market.

706
00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:28.430
Uh,
I think,
and he,
and he sort of basically says,
you know,

707
00:51:29.860 --> 00:51:33.640
only buy things when you have a good reason,
you know,
sort of a really,

708
00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:37.000
<v 2>uh,
uh,
um,
uh,</v>

709
00:51:37.110 --> 00:51:41.670
<v 0>compelling reason,
um,
uh,
to,
to,
to,</v>

710
00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:46.260
to own them.
Um,
I think,
you know,
I don't,
I don't,
um,
um,

711
00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:50.780
I don't know what he,
what,
what he says about this,
but,
but I,
um,

712
00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:56.010
um,
I think most of this sort of equity,
um,
uh,

713
00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.790
to me that the

714
00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:06.240
historic kind of case for equities is survivor by it.

715
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:10.680
You know,
it is us centric and it's,
it's survivor bias bias.

716
00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:15.390
Um,
obviously,
you know,
the,
um,
the u s went from,
uh,
you know,

717
00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:18.630
kind of average agrarian,
uh,

718
00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:23.100
contrary to the industrial classes of the,
the world.

719
00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:24.120
Um,

720
00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:29.120
and so obviously act or as a corollary to that equities did really,

721
00:52:31.321 --> 00:52:35.910
really well.
Um,
uh,
it's not,
you know,
I mean,
it's not,

722
00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:40.840
<v 2>um,
uh,
um,
uh,</v>

723
00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:44.900
<v 0>yeah,
it's not a hundred percent clear that,
you know,</v>

724
00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:49.550
sort of over the next year,
a hundred years that,
um,
uh,

725
00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:53.720
Asian might not China,
India,
um,

726
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:58.850
the tiger is collectively might not surpass us or,

727
00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.760
you know,
or the world might not do that well for the next hundred,

728
00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:05.790
<v 2>you know,
um,
uh,
uh,
uh,</v>

729
00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.460
<v 0>hundred years and the,</v>

730
00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:12.520
the last hundred years in the u s don't really have that much predictive power.

731
00:53:21.550 --> 00:53:24.140
<v 3>Can you talk a little bit about</v>

732
00:53:26.550 --> 00:53:27.383
why

733
00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:32.460
securities and look what the manager,

734
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:39.160
<v 0>um,
uh,
you know,</v>

735
00:53:39.310 --> 00:53:43.830
I've,
I've,
I've convinced some people though,
um,
uh,

736
00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:47.280
David Swensen really disagrees with me and if,

737
00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:51.810
if you read his pioneering portfolio management and,
and,
and,

738
00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:57.280
and the syllabus,
um,
he has,
um,
uh,

739
00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:01.570
uh,
um,
uh,

740
00:54:02.110 --> 00:54:05.170
he really has,
it has,
has a preference for equities.

741
00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:07.120
What I liked about fixed income,

742
00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:11.410
I think fixed income is inherently more analyzable.

743
00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:16.060
Um,
uh,
um,
with,
um,

744
00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:21.090
because you have sort of specified coupons in and matured a specified coupon and

745
00:54:21.221 --> 00:54:25.930
a specified maturity.
Um,
and,
uh,
uh,

746
00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:31.310
uh,
uh,
you have,
uh,
you have a fixed income,

747
00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:33.580
you know,
either either they pay you

748
00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:38.170
or they have to reorganize and,
and,
you know,

749
00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:41.620
they either pay you interest or they have to reorganize or they,

750
00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:46.660
and they pay you principal,
um,
or they have to reorganize.
And it's,
um,

751
00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:50.340
um,
uh,
um,
uh,
in,

752
00:54:50.350 --> 00:54:53.980
in inherently more analyzable.

753
00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:58.020
Stacks really have to be,
um,
um,

754
00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:02.620
really have to be cheap because,
um,
you know,

755
00:55:02.621 --> 00:55:04.900
in general they don't pay out their earnings.

756
00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:08.560
And sometime in the future they're pretty apt to do something stupid.

757
00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:12.880
And they are,
you know,
um,
uh,
uh,

758
00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:18.020
and um,
um,
uh,
and um,
uh,
um,

759
00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:23.650
um,
you can't,
you can't tell.
On the one hand,
I do think,
you know,
sort of,

760
00:55:23.651 --> 00:55:26.780
um,
um,
if,
if,

761
00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:31.330
if there's a stack that,
um,
uh,
um,

762
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:36.170
is selling for four,
you know,
four or five,
six times earnings.
Um,

763
00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:40.600
and you have good reason to believe that the earnings are going up.

764
00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:45.910
Um,
somethings,
uh,
um,
when,
when,
uh,
uh,

765
00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:48.750
one stack sells for,
for you know,
uh,

766
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:52.030
mid single digit earnings multiple,
uh,

767
00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:55.900
the market is telling you that the market is saying that that earnings are

768
00:55:55.901 --> 00:55:59.260
coming down.
Um,
if,

769
00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:04.270
if you have good reason to believe that earnings are going up,

770
00:56:04.500 --> 00:56:09.490
um,
if in fact you're right,
um,
in that case,
when you buy the stock,

771
00:56:09.491 --> 00:56:13.810
you are making a bet on the earnings going up and if the earnings go up,

772
00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:18.100
you'll get paid twice because,
um,
the multiple,

773
00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:22.810
the multiple we'll go up to.
That's sort of sort of the way,
way things,

774
00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:27.330
things trade.
Um,
when you sort of just,
if you buy something at,

775
00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:31.880
at,
you know,
um,
um,
uh,
a,
uh,
um,

776
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:35.680
Aramco,
uh,
um,
uh,

777
00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:41.290
uh,
the maker of,
of blackberry sounds for came to 50,
60,

778
00:56:41.291 --> 00:56:44.800
70 times earnings.
When,
when,
when,
when,
when,

779
00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:49.450
when you buy that stock,
um,
uh,
um,

780
00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.360
earnings can go up around it and you know,
you could think,

781
00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:54.700
and I'm buying the stock cause I think earnings,

782
00:56:54.940 --> 00:56:58.840
you have to think earnings are going to go up.
Um,
you know,

783
00:56:58.870 --> 00:57:03.090
12 fault to get it down to sort of work times earnings which you know,

784
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:08.110
will take a long,
long time.
They are,
um,
if you know earnings are going to double,

785
00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:11.290
you really don't know very much about what will happen to the stock price

786
00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:15.940
because,
um,
uh,
you know,
if they're going to double over the next two years,

787
00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:18.730
hypo hypothetically if you're,
if,
if you're right on the head,

788
00:57:18.731 --> 00:57:23.530
it doesn't matter cause,
cause I'm the multiple could very,
very easily,
um,

789
00:57:23.890 --> 00:57:28.450
uh,
go from,
from 50 to 25.
So,

790
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:33.630
um,
it's,
it's um,
uh,
and,
and in the end they'll,
they'll,

791
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:37.510
they'll never pay you any dividends.
You know,
so,
so,
so how,

792
00:57:37.660 --> 00:57:42.490
so how do you collect,
you know,
um,
um,
how do you ever collect a coupon?

793
00:57:42.491 --> 00:57:47.290
How do you ever get a hold of,
of,
of,

794
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:51.660
of cashflow?
So,
um,
I,
yeah,
I just,

795
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:56.400
I just hate on him and snacks.
I love and I love and I,

796
00:57:56.401 --> 00:57:58.990
and I love people sending me checks,
which is,
what about,

797
00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:48.240
um,
um,
uh,

798
00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:53.450
um,
I think,
um,
uh,
uh,
um,

799
00:58:53.650 --> 00:58:57.550
a couple of points.
First,
um,
uh,

800
00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:02.700
I do think it helps the world to have security prices that are closer to there.

801
00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:07.770
There they are accurate value,
um,

802
00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:12.730
Dan then further away and um,
um,
uh,
and,

803
00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:17.680
and more tending towards their fair value over time.
Um,

804
00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:21.210
then,
um,
gyrating,
um,

805
00:59:21.860 --> 00:59:25.880
complete so completely randomly.
So,
um,
uh,

806
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:29.060
if hedge funds could absolute themselves of hedge funds,

807
00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:33.950
could make markets completely efficient,
um,

808
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:38.720
it would benefit the world a lot.
Um,
uh,
uh,

809
00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:42.980
is one.
And so to the,
and to the extent that they help make markets efficient,

810
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:48.110
you know,
I do think,
uh,
uh,
they,
they,

811
00:59:48.170 --> 00:59:51.810
they help the world.
I do,
you know,
sort of agree.
Um,

812
00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:58.010
um,
I think,
you know,
sort of,
um,
um,
involved investors,

813
00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:03.140
um,
also,
um,
improve the performance of,

814
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:06.200
uh,
um,
uh,
the,

815
01:00:06.530 --> 01:00:10.190
the country's fixed assets.
Um,

816
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:15.470
and,
um,
uh,
um,
uh,

817
01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:19.820
that,
that,
that helps the world too.
And they had to turn,
people aren't,

818
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:21.760
um,
uh,
and,
and I,

819
01:00:21.761 --> 01:00:26.150
and I think more and more that'll be a part of,
of,

820
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:30.470
of what hedge funds do.
I mean,
for,
um,
uh,

821
01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:35.290
we gave it up,
but,
um,
uh,
uh,
we owned an air.

822
01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:40.370
Um,
we are,
um,
we own some country,
uh,
along with,
uh,
um,

823
01:00:40.490 --> 01:00:42.320
the patterns group,
um,

824
01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:47.630
which is a Minneapolis based point to point airline,
um,
uh,

825
01:00:47.690 --> 01:00:51.840
competes with northwest.
And,
and we,
you know,
um,
uh,

826
01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:56.870
it was kind of an,
an experiment I'm somewhat in,
in,

827
01:00:56.871 --> 01:00:59.780
in behavioral economics and we,
we hit,

828
01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:04.610
we had distinct ideas about what their business strategy should be.
Um,

829
01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:09.230
uh,
uh,
we couldn't,
um,

830
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:14.360
and Petterson and white box actually did not disagree.
Um,

831
01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:17.600
but,
um,
um,
the,
um,
white,
white,

832
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:21.960
white box got completely disillusioned with,
with management and wasn't,
you know,

833
01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:27.080
so we sold our stake to patters.
Um,
but,
um,

834
01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:31.990
if,
um,
um,
uh,
if,
if,
if,
if,

835
01:01:32.050 --> 01:01:36.410
if,
if,
if our,
is,
if,
if our ideas were good,
you know,

836
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:40.880
it really would have benefited consumers in,
in the,

837
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.750
the twin cities.
Um,
and,

838
01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:47.620
and I do sort of think that,
um,
um,

839
01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:52.610
people have sort of real money at stake.
Um,
our APP to,

840
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:57.530
um,
uh,
over time and on the average,
you know,
their,

841
01:01:57.710 --> 01:02:01.850
their ideas will be better than,
um,
uh,

842
01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:06.520
uh,
uh,
um,
peep,
peep,
peep,
peep,
people who,

843
01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:10.350
who don't have anything at stake.
Um,

844
01:02:10.610 --> 01:02:15.080
I mean act activist investors,
which,
which are mostly sort of hedge funds.

845
01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:20.400
Um,
uh,
um,
uh,

846
01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:25.200
I think often,
you know,
often,
you know,

847
01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:30.410
either either make management better via via competition or on balance,

848
01:02:31.171 --> 01:02:35.730
their ideas are right.
Um,
and they certainly challenge,
you know,

849
01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:40.680
for forest management to,
to at least consider,

850
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:44.970
um,
uh,
uh,
uh,
alternatives.

851
01:02:46.530 --> 01:02:47.020
<v 4>Okay.</v>

852
01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:51.190
<v 0>Yeah.
I think if,
if,
um,
um,
I,
I wrote in my,</v>

853
01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:55.120
my last letter,
I just,
I just read Paul Krugman,
Paul Krugman,

854
01:02:55.121 --> 01:02:59.730
his book that the kind of the New York Times editorial is the contract fee,

855
01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:04.570
the conscience of a liberal.
And,
um,
um,
like a lot of hedge fund,

856
01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:09.070
I'm pretty free market right wing,
um,
uh,
uh,

857
01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:12.550
conservative.
But,
um,
uh,
uh,

858
01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:17.790
I think unlike hedge fund compensation is really a market result,

859
01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:22.580
um,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
um,

860
01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:25.330
it's the result of,
of,

861
01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:30.610
of negotiations between informed parties of,

862
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:35.590
of roughly equal economic clout and sophistication.

863
01:03:36.010 --> 01:03:40.240
Um,
executive compensation is not the result of,

864
01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:45.040
of arm's length negotiations.
And,
um,
uh,

865
01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:50.470
um,
uh,
there's a new,
it's actually,
I think a Yale study.
Um,
um,

866
01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:55.540
um,
an executive compensation,
something like 96% of,
um,
uh,

867
01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.080
fortune 500 CEOS,
um,

868
01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:02.700
get their full severance severance package if,
you know,
even,
even,

869
01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:07.630
even if,
even if,
um,
uh,
if they're dismissed for,

870
01:04:07.631 --> 01:04:12.160
you know,
like anything other than,
um,
a major felony,
they,
you know,

871
01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:13.960
they can perform badly.
They can,

872
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:19.090
they can be found to have breached their fiduciary duty.
Um,
but,
but,
but,
but,

873
01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:23.760
but they still get a lot.
So I wouldn't,
I,
I,

874
01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:29.440
I'm,
I'm on the hedge fund side and against the sort of company management side.

875
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:31.743
<v 4>Okay.</v>

876
01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:41.720
<v 0>Backdating options.
Um,</v>

877
01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:47.790
um,
and,
um,
um,
uh,

878
01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:52.480
sure.
Um,
we,
um,
um,
uh,
um,
somewhat,

879
01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:57.450
um,
sort of the,
um,
uh,
the,

880
01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.840
the history,
um,
when,
when,
um,

881
01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:06.370
um,
um,
bonds are governed by what's called an indenture,

882
01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:11.640
which is the sort of legal agreement between the company and bond holders.

883
01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:15.870
Um,
yeah,
in a typical,
um,

884
01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.520
bond indenture,
uh,

885
01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:23.710
if a company fails to file financial statements on time,

886
01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:28.900
um,
that's an event of default under their band agreement.
And,

887
01:05:29.230 --> 01:05:31.970
um,
and usually,
um,
the rat,

888
01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:35.620
the remedy for an event of default is,
um,
you can demand,

889
01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:40.120
you can demand immediate payment acceleration and,
and,
uh,

890
01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:44.520
uh,
immediate payment.
Um,
we,
um,
you know,
in,
um,

891
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:48.170
in general,
you know,
like people don't read every,
you know,

892
01:05:48.230 --> 01:05:52.840
PR people own bonds without reading the indenture.
We,
you know,
we,
um,

893
01:05:53.170 --> 01:05:57.240
uh,
uh,
they're long,
they're not written in English.
Um,

894
01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:01.660
in most set of circumstances they are,
they are irrelevant.
So,
um,

895
01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:06.400
we actually didn't really know this until,
um,
uh,

896
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:10.540
we own,
we own defined in the company that did,
you know,
that,
um,

897
01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:11.440
couldn't file the fight,

898
01:06:11.441 --> 01:06:16.441
their financial statements on time and somebody else owned them and discovered

899
01:06:16.841 --> 01:06:21.620
them and,
and,
um,
demanded that they get paid and,

900
01:06:21.970 --> 01:06:26.920
and ended up negotiating with the company and he,
and,
um,
um,
uh,

901
01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:29.710
uh,
we got,
uh,
we got a kicker.
So that was,

902
01:06:29.711 --> 01:06:34.120
that was kind of our first experience for thing that made us aware that not

903
01:06:34.121 --> 01:06:38.890
filing financial statements was an event of default.
And therefore,
um,

904
01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:43.810
um,
uh,
uh,
um,

905
01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:48.670
uh,
uh,
something that would entitle you to,

906
01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:53.400
to,
to payment immediately.
So,
um,
for a comp,

907
01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:57.010
so for companies that could pay you back,

908
01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:02.170
but their bonds are trading below par,
probably because they have a low coupon,

909
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:07.330
um,
you know,
so if bond was issued when interest rates were lower,
um,
uh,

910
01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:12.360
they might have a 4% coupon when the prevailing rate is,

911
01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:17.320
is,
um,
six.
So,
um,
uh,

912
01:07:17.321 --> 01:07:21.870
if it's a four year bond,
it would trade at about 90.

913
01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:26.590
So it would be yielding six.
But if they default,
you can,
you know,
if,

914
01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:30.550
if you can buy them at 90,
and if they can't file your financial statements,

915
01:07:30.551 --> 01:07:33.220
you're entitled to Pyre.
Um,
uh,

916
01:07:33.221 --> 01:07:37.540
so we were interested in finding bonds,
uh,
uh,

917
01:07:37.930 --> 01:07:41.770
um,
bonds trading below par.
We are,

918
01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:46.420
we thought there was a chance,
um,
that,
um,
uh,

919
01:07:46.450 --> 01:07:51.370
companies would not file their financial statements on time and it turned out at

920
01:07:51.371 --> 01:07:52.780
the time,
you know,
um,

921
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:58.050
one of the big causes of companies not filing financial statements on time was,

922
01:07:59.201 --> 01:08:04.120
um,
if they had backdated these stock options,
they do,

923
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:08.840
they know what backdating is.
Um,
uh,
um,

924
01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:12.780
if,
if they had backdated their stock options,
um,

925
01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.170
they'd have to restate their financials.
It's,
you know,

926
01:08:15.171 --> 01:08:18.500
they'd have to investigate,
takes time and,
and so forth.

927
01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:22.790
They delay filing their,
their,
their financial statements.

928
01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:26.680
Um,
so we tried to identify,
um,

929
01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:31.610
companies that we thought it backdated there,
their stock options.
Um,

930
01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:35.130
uh,
uh,
we bought,
um,

931
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:40.970
we bought a database.
Um,
we can,
we,
we,
we cleaned it up.

932
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:45.650
Um,
and,
um,
um,
you know,

933
01:08:45.651 --> 01:08:49.460
we basically looked at at,
um,
their pattern of,

934
01:08:49.461 --> 01:08:53.750
of stock app shouldn't issuance and tried to figure it out.

935
01:08:54.230 --> 01:08:57.410
Um,
uh,
uh,

936
01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:02.240
the probability of and having been caused by chance.
Um,
and,

937
01:09:02.241 --> 01:09:03.560
uh,
um,

938
01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:08.100
for companies that we thought had backdated stock options that,
you know,

939
01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:13.040
we could,
um,
um,
uh,
we could buy their bonds at,

940
01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:16.580
um,
what they would trade for it without,
um,

941
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:21.530
without this potential,
um,
event of default.
Um,

942
01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:26.480
uh,
that was kind of a,
a,
a riskless trade because if they filed on time,

943
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:30.010
um,
uh,
we,

944
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:34.940
we hadn't paid anything if they were late.
We had the prospect of,

945
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.880
of,
of getting par,
um,
uh,
uh,

946
01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:43.980
uh,
uh,
quickly,
um,
uh,

947
01:09:45.410 --> 01:09:49.910
later,
you know,
um,
um,
in,
um,
um,

948
01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:55.250
in the very beginning,
um,
uh,
the sort of,
um,

949
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:58.370
uh,
so the kind of history,
you know,

950
01:09:58.371 --> 01:10:02.290
there was the first trade where somebody else discovered that not,
you know,
um,

951
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:06.020
company couldn't find their financial statements because they had sort of bad

952
01:10:06.021 --> 01:10:10.640
record keeping or,
or whatever that that one was not.
Um,
uh,

953
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:15.500
uh,
I option related.
Um,
uh,

954
01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:19.640
uh,
so,
um,
that,
that,

955
01:10:19.730 --> 01:10:24.350
that first one was kind of happenstance,
you know,
kind of the next,
the next time,

956
01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:25.513
um,

957
01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:30.460
mixed couple of times companies announced that,
um,

958
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:34.720
uh,
uh,
they were apt to delay it,

959
01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:39.730
their financial statements and the first few times you,

960
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:41.070
um,
you could,
you could,

961
01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:45.470
you could buy their bonds at the same price it has before they had announced

962
01:10:45.471 --> 01:10:50.240
that [inaudible] and potentially,
um,
oh,
do you pyre.
But,

963
01:10:50.510 --> 01:10:55.250
um,
that,
that did not,
you know,
um,
and here,
um,
you know,

964
01:10:55.251 --> 01:10:59.950
in terms of,
um,
uh,
uh,
sort of,
um,

965
01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:04.670
market efficiency,
um,
it didn't last forever.
And,
and you know,

966
01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:08.930
after,
after three or four times,
um,
by,
you know,

967
01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:11.900
companies would announce that they might,
that they were going to delay their,

968
01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:14.220
their filings and lo and behold,

969
01:11:14.221 --> 01:11:18.930
their bonds would go up because people had discovered,
uh,

970
01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:23.280
that,
that,
that,
that,
that you might be,
um,
uh,

971
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:28.610
entitled to Pyre.
So,
so someone had stopped working,
you know,
like waiting,
we,

972
01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:32.070
we tried to anticipate what companies might not,

973
01:11:32.071 --> 01:11:36.750
not be able to file them and,
and,
and,
and buy their bonds.
Um,

974
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:41.700
uh,
in,
in,
in,
in advance.
Um,
we gave the SDC,

975
01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.980
um,
uh,
uh,
are,

976
01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.980
are studying and algorithm.
Um,
they wouldn't tell us,

977
01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:54.300
uh,
what they are out,
um,
uh,
uh,

978
01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:58.770
exactly who they were targeting and,
and,
and how,

979
01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:01.980
um,
though I got the sense that

980
01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:08.150
their approach was,
was similar to ours and they sort of seemed,
um,

981
01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.920
even though they didn't say anything when we were talking to them,
they,

982
01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:15.360
they seem sort of pleased that,
that,
um,
um,

983
01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:20.430
uh,
when we did something you could see that when they were sort of pleased,

984
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:24.330
when we took that to me and that was what they were doing.
And,
and,
and they were,

985
01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:26.080
you know,
sort of,
uh,

986
01:12:26.970 --> 01:12:30.850
happier or thinking that,
that,
that,

987
01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:34.950
that back got it right as,
as it happens.
Um,

988
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:39.720
um,
uh,
um,

989
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:44.580
for so far the,
that we've been involved in,
four companies have argued,

990
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.310
um,
uh,
uh,

991
01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:52.340
in court that failure to file financial statements is not an event of default.

992
01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:59.670
Um,
and,
um,
uh,
um,
we won the first case,

993
01:12:59.671 --> 01:13:03.650
which we really thought sat all that.
Um,
uh,

994
01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:08.430
we've subsequently lost too.
And,
um,
uh,

995
01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:12.300
one one is pending.
The wording is slightly different in,
in,

996
01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:15.340
in all the dentures,
but in general,
um,

997
01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:20.190
we've settled eight or nine cases,
companies sort of agreed and,

998
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:25.050
and,
and,
and,
and,
and we negotiated a settlement.

999
01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:29.160
Um,
and,
um,
in terms of,
um,

1000
01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:35.220
uh,
you know,
whether,
um,
uh,
whether,

1001
01:13:35.221 --> 01:13:36.054
um,

1002
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:40.360
whether hedge funds are an instrument of,

1003
01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:44.820
of social good,
um,
uh,

1004
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:49.950
uh,
or an act,
um,
um,
the,

1005
01:13:49.951 --> 01:13:54.440
um,
in the litigation companies argue that,
uh,
you know,
we're,

1006
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:57.450
we're opportunists and,
um,
uh,
you know,

1007
01:13:57.451 --> 01:14:01.770
we went in and bought more bonds after they filed late and,
uh,

1008
01:14:02.090 --> 01:14:06.900
um,
uh,
we haven't been injured.
Uh,
um,

1009
01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:11.920
and it's,
um,
you know,
basically unfair that,
that,
that,
that they,

1010
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.800
that they should,
should have to pay as pyre.
Um,
I,
you know,
I,

1011
01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:17.690
um,

1012
01:14:17.690 --> 01:14:20.780
<v 2>um,
uh,
uh,</v>

1013
01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:25.630
<v 0>I did consider this,
you know,
sort of noble work,
you know,
cause,
you know,
I think,</v>

1014
01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:29.170
I think,
I think companies should honor their agreements.
Um,

1015
01:14:29.260 --> 01:14:31.510
it's also the case that,
um,

1016
01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.670
<v 2>um,
uh,</v>

1017
01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:38.650
<v 0>if we,
if,
if a company paid off their bonds or,
or settled them,</v>

1018
01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:43.820
they sat on it for all bond holders.
Um,
uh,
and,

1019
01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:46.190
and not just us.
If anything,
you know,

1020
01:14:46.191 --> 01:14:49.490
sort of other bond holders get to free ride on us.

1021
01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.910
<v 2>Um,
uh,
but,
um,</v>

1022
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:56.640
<v 0>I think,
you know,
I think,
I think hedge funds,
you know,
sort of,</v>

1023
01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:01.620
<v 2>um,
uh,
um,
and now,
um,</v>

1024
01:15:02.150 --> 01:15:04.020
uh,
um,

1025
01:15:04.350 --> 01:15:08.260
<v 0>no,
again,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,
it's sort of a good thing.
Um,</v>

1026
01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:13.030
if documents in and agreement have,
have,
have meaning,
um,

1027
01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:17.350
uh,
and that,
that requires active,

1028
01:15:17.351 --> 01:15:19.030
engaged paradise days.

1029
01:15:19.031 --> 01:15:24.031
Otherwise the party that's active and engaged will take advantage of the other.
