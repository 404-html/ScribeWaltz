WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.480
Uh,
I thought I would just remember a couple of highlights from the,

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.130
from the first two lectures to consolidate what we said then.

3
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.700
Um,
and the first lecture I talked about a lot of things,

4
00:00:14.701 --> 00:00:19.701
but one theme that comes to my mind is the theme of the moral purpose and a

5
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.760
mission of,
uh,
the finance community.
Uh,

6
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.510
and uh,
we talked about the sense that,
uh,
uh,

7
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.310
I think young people have a sort of prejudice against the field and they think

8
00:00:35.311 --> 00:00:40.311
that finance is a field that you go into if you really value money rather than

9
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:44.610
people.
Uh,
and uh,

10
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.190
I wanted to reiterate again that that's not the way I view the field at all.

11
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.530
Uh,
I was just,
yesterday I gave a talk in Montreal at the,

12
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:59.490
uh,
I can say this rate case did depose a plus a month,

13
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.330
which is the,
uh,
big,
uh,
uh,

14
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.210
a wealth management fund for the province of Quebec.

15
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.370
And that a lot of people there,

16
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.230
and I never once got the idea that anyone there was evil or graspy.

17
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.600
Uh,
I think they have a moral purpose,

18
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.810
which is to preserve the livelihoods of the people of the province of Quebec.

19
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.110
Uh,
and so,
uh,
you get a very different view of things.
Uh,

20
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.960
when you meet the people.
Uh,
I think,
uh,

21
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.320
our entertainment industry likes to make movies about people in finance,

22
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.920
but they are inevitably portrayed as evil.

23
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.430
And I don't know why that is.
Uh,
I don't think there has ever been,
uh,
uh,

24
00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.780
a major motion picture about a,
uh,
financial,
uh,

25
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.350
person who ended up at philanthropist.
Why is that?

26
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.100
Uh,
and some people don't like people would rather hate,

27
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:57.780
I don't know why something

28
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.900
wouldn't be a good movie theme would it?
Uh,
anyway,
uh,

29
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.550
so you have to overcome these.

30
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.110
So you have to think that if you go into the field,
you would,
uh,
probably,

31
00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:13.440
and if you're a success,
you would probably end up as a philanthropist,

32
00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.770
but no movie will be made about your life.
Okay.

33
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.370
And you may encounter hostility the whole way.

34
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.920
It's especially true right now with the subprime crisis.

35
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.080
There few people are blaming the financial community for our troubles now.

36
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.030
And it is true that we're seeing some people thrown out of their houses,

37
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.230
um,

38
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.230
and in some cases because of some rather questionable financial practices who

39
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:43.290
got people in the mortgages that they shouldn't have gotten.
Uh,

40
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.090
but overall I think that the people in this field are good people.

41
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.823
Uh,

42
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.350
in the last lecture I talked about the second lecture I talked about,
uh,

43
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.350
the pooling of risks.
And the basic theme of that lecture,
uh,

44
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.000
was that we now have a mathematical theory,
probability theory.

45
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.240
And when you look at this theory,
it,
you realize that it,

46
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.940
it suggests a very important technology for improving human welfare.

47
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.910
And that is by spreading risks.
Uh,
the,

48
00:03:16.911 --> 00:03:21.911
the economy and technology and the weather and all sorts of factors create

49
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:24.920
risks.
Uh,
but the,

50
00:03:24.921 --> 00:03:29.580
the real technology is to the technology that works to eliminate risks,

51
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.090
uh,
is too

52
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.930
<v 1>read them out to pull them,
share them among many different people.</v>

53
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.580
<v 0>Uh,
and so,
uh,</v>

54
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.170
<v 1>the idea,
the ideal that theory suggests that maybe unreachable the ball,</v>

55
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.170
<v 0>but the perfect financial system would have all of our risks pooled completely.</v>

56
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.680
That is nobody suffers alone.

57
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.190
If anything happens to me in my livelihood,

58
00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.310
it's spread out over everybody and everybody that means the whole world.

59
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.363
Okay.

60
00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.610
And whatever happens to me when it's spread out over 6 billion plus people,

61
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.300
it ends up divided by y w 6 billion.

62
00:04:14.301 --> 00:04:17.270
And it becomes an observable.

63
00:04:17.271 --> 00:04:21.950
It becomes so small that it's meaningless.
Uh,
and so that's the ideal.

64
00:04:21.951 --> 00:04:24.860
That's what [inaudible] in principle we can do.

65
00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:28.280
And now I think is the most important concept in finance.

66
00:04:28.281 --> 00:04:30.640
This concept of risk pooling.
Uh,

67
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.830
we live in a world where people suffer all kinds of misfortunes.

68
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.410
And of course we can try to get rid of these misfortunes.

69
00:04:36.411 --> 00:04:41.411
We can do research on disease prevention and whether a modification,

70
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.330
global warming,
we can do research on all these things.
But,
um,

71
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.780
uh,
there's another technology which is extremely important,

72
00:04:50.781 --> 00:04:55.160
which is even leaving the risks as they are just sharing them better.

73
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.750
Uh,
and so I'll be talking more about this.

74
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.640
The problem is that while the principal of risk sharing is very simple and

75
00:05:04.641 --> 00:05:08.630
obvious,
the practice requires technology.

76
00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.360
So it's just like you could say,
uh,
you know,

77
00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:15.730
some of the principles of mechanics are very obvious,
but to make an engine,
uh,

78
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.580
that operates in terms of those principles is not obvious.

79
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:24.550
Okay.
So,
uh,
what I want to talk today is about,
uh,

80
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.780
what I call technology in finance.
And I'll present my view of the,

81
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.690
of the situation,
but maybe it's,
it's,
um,

82
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.120
rather idiosyncratic view that I have,
but I think it's,
uh,

83
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.030
uh,
it's not so much an idiosyncratic,
it's a different emphasis that I put forth.

84
00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.090
So what I want to talk,
I have,
there's really three themes to today's lecture.
Uh,

85
00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:53.420
a risk theme of framing theme and an invention theme.

86
00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.910
So I want to go over the,
uh,
kind of the history of risk management,
uh,

87
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.560
and through these three themes.
The first one is,
uh,

88
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.970
or it might say longterm risk theme.
Uh,

89
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.070
so let me go over these three themes.

90
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.910
<v 2>Uh,
and,
uh,
so,
uh,</v>

91
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.840
okay.
So

92
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.860
long term risks are dominant in our lives.

93
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.270
<v 0>By that I mean that everyone's life is a sequence of shocks that accumulate over</v>

94
00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:35.530
your life.
Uh,
in,

95
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.580
I'm talking about economic shocks when you start out young Whir Whir whir

96
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.910
unequal as at birth,
of course,
because of our parents and the advantages we have,

97
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.450
but relatively equal,
uh,
at a young age,

98
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.190
as each year goes by,
you accumulate economic shocks,

99
00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.960
shocks to your human capital,
shocks to what you own.
As you get older,

100
00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.100
you start accumulate,

101
00:06:59.101 --> 00:07:02.970
you start tracking your human capital is your ability to do things and your

102
00:07:02.971 --> 00:07:07.680
knowledge,
which is what rep,
which is what you have to sell in the marketplace.

103
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:09.210
As you get older,

104
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.710
your human capital evolves and it has its ups and downs as you,

105
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.460
as you age,
uh,
and,
uh,

106
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.970
you start switching from human capital to other forms of capital.
In other words,

107
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.150
you start saving and you your own stocks and bonds and real estate and other

108
00:07:27.151 --> 00:07:28.770
things.
Each of these,

109
00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.270
it suffers a sequence of shocks that cumulate over your lifetime.

110
00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.380
So any quality gets worse and worse as people age.

111
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.330
And it is at its worst after retirement.
Uh,

112
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.640
when you are no longer,

113
00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.270
you've exhausted your human capital and you're living off of all of the

114
00:07:48.271 --> 00:07:52.440
accumulated physical capital.
That's the lifecycle story.

115
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.910
There was great inequality among the elderly.
Uh,

116
00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:01.680
and uh,
that's a problem.
Some of them are living very badly,

117
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.360
others are living with a great comfort.

118
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:11.490
Um,
so,
uh,
that's what finance is about.
It's really about people.

119
00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:14.190
We don't care at all about corporations.

120
00:08:14.191 --> 00:08:19.170
We should make that clear except as they contribute to individual welfare.

121
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:24.590
So I don't care what happens to Citi group or IBM except for the fact that there

122
00:08:25.321 --> 00:08:29.760
were all those stock holders out there.
Uh,
and uh,
they're,

123
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.500
they're of all different situations.

124
00:08:31.501 --> 00:08:35.460
Some of them are absolutely dependent on their holding of these stocks.

125
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:39.180
And that's what we have to think about.
And it's a longterm problem.

126
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:45.470
So the problem with long term risks also is that anything that we do to mitigate

127
00:08:48.991 --> 00:08:52.800
these risks creates moral hazard.

128
00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.670
And that's another fundamental theme of what is moral hazard.

129
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:01.850
That's a term that first entered the English language sometime in the mid 19th

130
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:05.430
century.
But of course the concept goes up earlier.

131
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:10.790
Moral hazard occurs when a risk management institution incentivizes you to do

132
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.940
bad behavior,
to show bad behavior.

133
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.230
And the classic example of moral hazard is fire insurance.

134
00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:23.850
I get fire insurance on my house and so I behaved badly.

135
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.930
I deliberately burn the house down to collect on my insurance.

136
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.730
That's moral hazard,
but it's not unique to that.
It's all over the place.

137
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.550
When you manage risks,
you create moral hazard.

138
00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.360
And that's why we need invention and theory in finance to minimize that.

139
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:42.893
Okay.

140
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.210
The second theme for this lecture is about framing.

141
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:54.000
Uh,
and by that I mean psychological framing,

142
00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.630
uh,
and as many psychologists who talk about this,

143
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:03.330
but notably Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky,
uh,

144
00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.633
framing,

145
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:10.470
psychological framing means the tendency for people to view things

146
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:17.190
in a distorted way.
The,
depending on how they're presented,

147
00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:21.360
if I present things in one frame,
you would react one way.

148
00:10:21.361 --> 00:10:26.361
I present the same thing in another context or background or a environment and

149
00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:31.260
you react very differently.
So it's band on this in a minute.

150
00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.140
Um,
and uh,

151
00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.280
the third theme is the invention theme of this lecture.

152
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.960
Uh,
and that is that I mentioned this before,

153
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:50.820
but I want to expand that in this,
in this lecture that,
uh,
finance,

154
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.710
the history of finances,

155
00:10:52.711 --> 00:10:57.711
the history of invention just as much as it is in other fields,

156
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.240
notably engineering.
Uh,

157
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:05.870
the idea that I want to develop is that the history of finance is a history of

158
00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:10.500
discreet inventions,
uh,
that,
uh,

159
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:15.530
nonobvious ideas that were conceived of to solve these problems of longterm

160
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:19.920
risks and to get around the psychological barriers,

161
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.240
uh,
imposed by framing a of biases,

162
00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:28.410
that psychological biases to allow people to actually manage the risk and to get

163
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:30.640
around moral hazard.
Uh,

164
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:34.680
it's a difficult thing to do these things and that's why we need invention.

165
00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:40.020
And another thing is that when once an invention has made,

166
00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.410
it tends to be copied all over the world.

167
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:47.280
So the history of finance is largely a history of copying.

168
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.410
And that's what you have to do.

169
00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.950
You may have to adapt it to a particular environment,

170
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:56.140
but basically it is copying other ideas.

171
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.190
Some people in less developed countries feel uncomfortable that they are just a

172
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.330
slavishly copying other,
more advanced countries.
Uh,

173
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.050
but they have to recognize that that is the,

174
00:12:08.051 --> 00:12:10.390
what everybody has been doing all along.

175
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:15.070
We copied the good ideas and in the process we adjust them and make them a

176
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:18.460
little bit better and new ideas can come anywhere.

177
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:23.140
The basic thing though is every country has to take the insights that have been

178
00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:26.290
developed,
uh,
around,
around the world.

179
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.010
Okay.
Uh,
so,
uh,
let me,
uh,

180
00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:37.300
come back.
Now I want to go through these three themes.
Let me start with,
uh,
the,

181
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:41.110
uh,
longterm risk theme.
Uh,

182
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:43.420
and the,
uh,

183
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:48.490
I want to start with an article which mentioned an article by uh,

184
00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:50.533
um,

185
00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:56.130
Bacchus kid land and he actually back as key Ho and Fiddlin,

186
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.290
which are three economists.

187
00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:05.190
One of these,
uh,

188
00:13:05.191 --> 00:13:09.920
the last of the three is been Kim won the Nobel prize a few years ago.

189
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.433
Uh,

190
00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:16.720
but in this article they talk about the correlation of consumption around the

191
00:13:17.541 --> 00:13:18.374
world.

192
00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:22.960
What is consumption?

193
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.430
These are people spend and consumption goods,

194
00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:32.350
things that you buy for your current use,
like food,
shelter,

195
00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.970
clothing,
uh,
et cetera.
Uh,
every country,

196
00:13:36.971 --> 00:13:41.971
every country computes an estimate of how much is spent each year and it

197
00:13:44.351 --> 00:13:46.360
consumption of the people who live in the country,

198
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.630
what a or a key her back is key her in kid land there,

199
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.010
there's looked at how much the consumption correlates,

200
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.910
the movements from year to year correlate across countries.

201
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:00.310
And if there were perfect correlation,

202
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:05.520
it would be a correlation of one that is when one is consumption increases from

203
00:14:05.591 --> 00:14:06.550
one year to the next.

204
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.810
Every other countries' consumption increases from one year to the next.

205
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:16.920
What they argued in this paper is that if we had perfect risk management,

206
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:22.710
there would be perfect correlation of consumption across countries because if,

207
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.360
if we get rid of the idiosyncratic risks,

208
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:29.350
all that's left is planet wide risk.
Okay.

209
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:33.060
If we had perfect financial markets,
then this is intuitive and maybe,

210
00:14:33.061 --> 00:14:35.690
I don't know how obvious this is obvious to me.
Uh,

211
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.980
but it's an intuitive point of great importance.

212
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.480
Nobody would suffer alone.
Okay?

213
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.680
Anytime there's a risk that hits one person or one country,

214
00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:52.220
the financial markets would spread it out over everybody and it gets the very

215
00:14:52.221 --> 00:14:54.050
small,
what's left?

216
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:58.970
The only risks that are left are risks that everyone shares.
Okay.

217
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:04.310
And so you would see planet wide risks expressing themselves in consumption,

218
00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.970
but nothing else.
Do you see that point?
So we'd have perfect correlation.

219
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:13.270
Suppose the planet were hit by a comment,
okay,
this happened.
Uh,

220
00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:18.470
something like this happened 65 million years ago.
So it could happen again.
Um,

221
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.860
maybe it won't.
Now we have better plans to prevent things like that,

222
00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:24.880
but suppose it did happen.
All right.
Uh,

223
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:29.120
we would see huge damage on the impact site.

224
00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.300
This neglect the fact that some people would be killed by the impact.
Okay.

225
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.690
I suppose it was just economic damage.
Uh,

226
00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:38.990
and so it would be a terrible does it,
but it would be,

227
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.000
it would be a problem all over the world,
right?

228
00:15:41.001 --> 00:15:43.520
Because the damage would extend around the world,

229
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.000
but you'd be much better off if he were on the other side of the world,

230
00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:51.560
not where it hit.
Uh,
if we didn't have financial arrangements,

231
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:56.950
then the people near the impact would be in terrible economic situation and the

232
00:15:57.801 --> 00:16:00.500
people on the other side would be much better off.

233
00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:04.130
But if we had the proper risk management institutions in place,

234
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:08.240
people would have anticipated this risk and have made swaps or other

235
00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:12.680
arrangements to protect themselves against it.
And so what would happen,

236
00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:17.930
uh,
the people near the impact would not be harmed any more than anyone else.

237
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:22.730
The whole world would suffer because the damage is substantial and it reduces

238
00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:25.040
our ability to produce.
So the whole world,

239
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:29.180
everyone's consumption around the world would go down.
You can't prevent that.

240
00:16:29.181 --> 00:16:31.880
Anything that hits the whole planet would,
would be affected.

241
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:37.610
So back his kid than in Quito thought that that's the situation we should be in

242
00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:41.150
today.
And there are things hitting the whole world,
like global warming,

243
00:16:41.151 --> 00:16:45.790
for example.
Uh,
and there are many of them.
Uh,

244
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.940
but how well are we doing?
We're not doing well at all.

245
00:16:49.941 --> 00:16:54.590
They concluded the correlation across countries in consumption changes is low.

246
00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:58.970
In fact,
it's lower than the correlation of income changes,

247
00:16:58.971 --> 00:17:03.600
which is surprising.
So it means like we really haven't done anything.
Uh,

248
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.360
and that's an exaggeration.
We've done very little,
uh,
to manage,
uh,

249
00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:10.100
manage,
uh,

250
00:17:10.101 --> 00:17:14.240
risks that individual countries face for that matter or even individuals face.

251
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.680
So,
uh,
the,
we've,
we've done a lot,
I shouldn't say we haven't done anything,

252
00:17:18.681 --> 00:17:23.360
but we can do a lot more.
Uh,
the idea of risk,

253
00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:27.570
uh,
that risks,
economic risks can be pooled,

254
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:31.700
is an intuitive one that has occurred to people throughout history.

255
00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:35.290
It's very simple and obvious.
If we are living in,
uh,

256
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:40.330
imagine we're living in some remote area and we were pioneers out there with our

257
00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:44.420
cabins and,
uh,
there's no government,
there's no one to protect us.

258
00:17:44.421 --> 00:17:48.650
What do we instinctively do?
We kind of meet together and we say,
you know,

259
00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:52.950
if anyone's Kevin Burns down,
we'll all come over and help.
All right.
It's,

260
00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.340
you know,
it kind of feels like a generosity or something,

261
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.560
but it's also a self interest that people perceive.
You know,

262
00:17:58.561 --> 00:18:02.790
it could be me that my cabin could burn down and I would freeze to death in the

263
00:18:02.791 --> 00:18:03.624
winter.

264
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:08.630
And so people naturally and spontaneously make arrangements to share risks.

265
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.310
Uh,
but these kind of natural and spontaneous arrangements are not global.

266
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.950
They're not big enough and important enough.
Um,

267
00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.720
so I just want one point of this lecture is to try to emphasize the real breadth

268
00:18:25.141 --> 00:18:27.720
of the concepts of finance and how important they are,

269
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:32.430
how they reach out into other things that you might not think as associated with

270
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.720
finance.
Uh,
so I wanted to mention,
um,

271
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.270
uh,
socialism,

272
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:44.970
this term really goes back to

273
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:51.500
Robert Owen who is a British,
uh,
thinker,
uh,

274
00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:55.710
1771 to 1858,

275
00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:58.690
um,
who,
uh,

276
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
wanted to pull all the economic activity in society.

277
00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.010
And what were the motivations for doing this?
Well,

278
00:19:08.011 --> 00:19:10.810
I think he would say to inequality,
uh,
uh,

279
00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.670
hardship will be reduced.
But what was he really saying?

280
00:19:14.671 --> 00:19:17.100
And it sounds like you might say it's risk management.

281
00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.750
He wanted the society to pool risks,
uh,

282
00:19:21.751 --> 00:19:26.100
and put things,
uh,
uh,
put us together.

283
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:31.870
So in his ideal society,
Socialist Society,
uh,

284
00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:36.030
everyone would,
all the consumption would move up and down together.

285
00:19:36.031 --> 00:19:40.980
Just as in the idea that backyard backers keyhole into Midland expressed,
right.

286
00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.160
Uh,
so Robert Owen,
uh,

287
00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:51.480
uh,
wanted to do act one to create this community and he created,

288
00:19:51.481 --> 00:19:56.040
finally he emigrated to the United States and he set up a city called new

289
00:19:56.041 --> 00:20:00.090
harmony.
New Harmony was supposed to be an inspiration.

290
00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.500
Unfortunately,

291
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:06.980
it didn't work very well because people started bickering in his town.

292
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:12.300
Uh,
and the new harmony became kind of a,
uh,
uh,
a joke.

293
00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:15.710
It was not a harmonious community.
So,
uh,

294
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:18.930
he started to discover a moral hazard.

295
00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:21.443
Okay.

296
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:26.490
You put everyone together and you say,
okay,

297
00:20:26.491 --> 00:20:29.760
all of your economic fortunes are the same.

298
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:32.850
And what does someone start to conclude?
Well,

299
00:20:32.851 --> 00:20:36.300
they start to get lazy or they start to get irresponsible.

300
00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:41.000
They think it doesn't matter what,
uh,
what,
uh,

301
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.180
what I do,
I'm going to get the same consumption as everybody else.

302
00:20:45.181 --> 00:20:47.530
So I'll just get lazy.
Very fundamental problem,

303
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:52.630
which you probably are already aware of.
Uh,
and,
uh,

304
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.320
uh,
the,
uh,

305
00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.000
socialist idea,

306
00:20:59.001 --> 00:21:03.910
I started to lead to a number of experiments in various countries around the

307
00:21:03.911 --> 00:21:08.290
world,
uh,
that,
uh,
were,
uh,
pooling risks.

308
00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.800
And they've met,
not have put it this way.
Uh,

309
00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.560
one is the kibbutz seam

310
00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:20.060
in Israel and these were communities that shared everything.
Um,

311
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:25.350
originally they were very rigid about this that they enforced complete sharing

312
00:21:25.371 --> 00:21:30.310
of if you belong to a kibbutz scene,
you were,
uh,
completely,
uh,

313
00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.020
stuck with,
uh,
common consumption.
Uh,

314
00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:37.450
but it wasn't just in Israel,
in Japan,

315
00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.830
the Itar n and,
uh,
yeah,

316
00:21:41.831 --> 00:21:45.590
my Gucci Chi,

317
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.250
uh,
in the United States because the Hutterites

318
00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:58.570
and there's many other examples.
Uh,
joining one of these communities,
uh,

319
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:03.280
has met,
um,
a real change in your life.

320
00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:08.410
Uh,
it's complete sharing.
Uh,
the problem is again,
uh,

321
00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.220
the,
the,
the,
the idea they're trying to work toward,

322
00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.200
I think m an idea that we see in finance,

323
00:22:14.201 --> 00:22:18.130
namely the perfect correlation of consumption and the elimination of risk.

324
00:22:18.131 --> 00:22:22.810
We all help each other,
but the problem they hit is moral hazard.
Uh,

325
00:22:22.811 --> 00:22:26.610
and,
uh,
I,
I've heard stories about,
uh,

326
00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.980
a lot of bickering at the kibbutz team.
Uh,

327
00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.980
when someone gets a gift and,
and the other people that they could,

328
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.980
would seem to say,
well,
you can't have that by herself.
We share everything.
Uh,

329
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:39.551
some people say,

330
00:22:39.551 --> 00:22:43.750
I'd like to have my own television set and I don't want to go to the common room

331
00:22:43.751 --> 00:22:45.460
and watched the same set with everyone else.
You know,

332
00:22:45.461 --> 00:22:47.440
I just kind of want to be at home by myself.

333
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.500
So nowadays kibbutz seems have listened to the rule.

334
00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.350
I don't know these things personally,
but,
uh,

335
00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:58.890
it's my understanding that the whole structure is suffering some moral hazard

336
00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:04.020
problems and uh,
that,
uh,
uh,

337
00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:08.860
they are evolving and trying to improve the institutions.
But,
uh,
uh,

338
00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:15.450
there's also a problem with risk sharing at that level and that is that if you

339
00:23:15.701 --> 00:23:18.970
are one of these commune communities,

340
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.190
you're just a small number of people,

341
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:26.680
the best you can do sharing among yourselves is sharing your own wrist,

342
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:28.150
the wrist of your own community,

343
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.670
but your own community goes up and down and you're not sharing widely enough.

344
00:23:33.910 --> 00:23:36.280
The problem is that if you want to do risk sharing,

345
00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:41.260
you're not ideally sharing with someone who's just like you living in Israel,

346
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.250
uh,

347
00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:47.250
working in I certain agricultural industry because there's a lot of risks that

348
00:23:48.651 --> 00:23:49.730
you've already share.

349
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:54.020
You should be sharing your list with someone who's completely different,

350
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.590
probably living on the other side of the world and it completely different

351
00:23:57.591 --> 00:23:58.424
industry,

352
00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:03.200
whether you know the weather and the institutions and the political situation is

353
00:24:03.201 --> 00:24:04.130
completely different,

354
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:09.530
but it doesn't work so easily to share with those people along the lines that

355
00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:13.570
these communities,
yeah,
I think these communes tended to emphasize a,

356
00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:17.750
a social compact if feeling for each other,
caring for each other,

357
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.270
which is a lovely thought,

358
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:25.520
but it doesn't achieve risk management on a big scale.
Uh,
and so,

359
00:24:25.521 --> 00:24:30.050
uh,
so I think that what's happening is these ideas are,

360
00:24:30.051 --> 00:24:31.160
everything is evolving.

361
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:36.190
So I'm actually presenting here are a modern finance as the outgrowth of

362
00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:41.720
socialism,
but that's not the usual way.
Ah,
the usual a way to present it.
Well,

363
00:24:41.721 --> 00:24:42.980
but I could guess it is,

364
00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:46.320
it's that we care about each other and we don't want people to suffer alone.

365
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.450
We want to share things,

366
00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:50.780
but we want to get more scientific about how we share things.

367
00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.150
And that means we will and we want to be effective.

368
00:24:53.151 --> 00:24:58.151
So that means we have to devise ways of sharing with people that we never met.

369
00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.820
We don't care about,
I mean,
maybe we care about everybody,

370
00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:05.060
but we don't have any particular emotional ties to them.

371
00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:09.950
They're very different people.
Uh,
but because of the logic of risk management,

372
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:14.120
we have to make a deal with them.
So it becomes more formal and impersonal,

373
00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:18.770
and that is what a financial markets do.
Um,

374
00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.740
so what's happening is we're seeing an evolution of risk management,

375
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:27.710
and you hear about it in various terms that sound abstract.

376
00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.030
So we have private equity,
we have venture capital,
uh,
and,

377
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:36.560
and we have employees getting incentive options.
These are efforts to,

378
00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:41.660
uh,
solve the moral hazard problem and to manage risks.
Uh,

379
00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.620
and,
uh,

380
00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:47.330
I believe that we are gradually learning in our society.

381
00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:51.890
This is maybe not widely appreciated,
but every decade that goes by,

382
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.920
we do a better job of incentivizing people and preventing them from being

383
00:25:57.531 --> 00:26:01.730
discouraged by,
uh,
by,
uh,
risks.

384
00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.090
So,
uh,
uh,

385
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:08.343
uh,

386
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:12.560
it's a very complicated situation because the kind of economic risks that we

387
00:26:12.561 --> 00:26:14.360
face are,
uh,

388
00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:19.520
are difficult for most people to understand.
Uh,
but,

389
00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:21.160
uh,
but they have to try it.

390
00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:26.170
We have to try to let people manage their own risks for themselves.

391
00:26:26.271 --> 00:26:27.021
To some extent,

392
00:26:27.021 --> 00:26:30.260
that means we have to expect people to understand these things somewhat.

393
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:35.810
I think we have an important role for economic edge financial education because

394
00:26:35.811 --> 00:26:39.080
of that.
Uh,
each person is in a different situation.

395
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:43.510
It's a very complicated world and we have,
uh,
uh,

396
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.180
many different risks.
So,
um,
uh,

397
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:53.970
okay.
No,
continuing on the risk thing,
I've mentioned one,

398
00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:57.140
a philosopher,
Robert Owen.
Uh,

399
00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.240
I could've also mentioned Karl Marx run.
I mention him here,

400
00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:04.770
a very important thinker,
uh,

401
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:09.850
who had very low regard for the financial community.
I think,
unfortunately,

402
00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:14.910
uh,
he wanted to kill them,
I think,
or at least some of them.
Uh,
uh,

403
00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:18.000
nonetheless,
he shared certain things in common with them,

404
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.810
namely that he was concerned about inequality,

405
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:26.730
about some people doing badly.
And he proposed a,
uh,
uh,

406
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:31.800
a,
uh,
an economic alternative that,
uh,
that would,

407
00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:35.970
uh,
that would poor risks.

408
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:41.030
And in fact,
um,
he actually,
uh,
uh,

409
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.120
uh,
uh,

410
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.210
emphasize a concept that was,
um,

411
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:51.720
first stated by a French philosopher,

412
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:54.570
Louie [inaudible] in the mid 19th century.

413
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:59.940
And they said,
uh,
the ideal society is,

414
00:27:59.941 --> 00:28:02.160
and now I quote every,

415
00:28:02.161 --> 00:28:05.010
the ideal society is based on the principle of,

416
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:10.250
and now I quote from each according to his abilities to each according to his

417
00:28:11.341 --> 00:28:12.174
needs.

418
00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:17.430
We heard that quote before Carl Marx quoted blog,

419
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:22.650
but he didn't,
uh,
credit block.
He didn't mention the name cause I,
I saw him,

420
00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:26.420
he thought everyone knows this was blocked.
But um,

421
00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:32.490
Mark's was falsely attributed to have he made that statement and it's come

422
00:28:32.491 --> 00:28:37.470
around to us that that was a lot of people say that was the core of his

423
00:28:37.471 --> 00:28:42.090
communist philosophy.
That is complete risk sharing,

424
00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:45.270
right?
Some of us have high abilities and we succeed,

425
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:50.490
some of us have low abilities and we fail,
but we all get the same good.

426
00:28:50.491 --> 00:28:55.050
We all have our needs.
That is five.
Uh,
and so that I think is,

427
00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:00.320
I think the communist system is effectively a theory of risk management.

428
00:29:00.571 --> 00:29:03.480
And that's not something that you might think of usually.

429
00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.060
What was the big problem with communism as it was espoused by Karl Marx?

430
00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:14.340
The problem was that it had a moral hazard problem.

431
00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:16.740
And I just,
I've already been through it.

432
00:29:16.741 --> 00:29:21.070
It's the same moral hazard problem that you see at the cubic team and,
uh,

433
00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:26.120
Yamaguchi Kai and other places that people don't work effectively when their

434
00:29:26.851 --> 00:29:31.200
economic interests are completely pooled.
And so,
uh,

435
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:32.800
uh,
uh,

436
00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:38.060
well I suppose we've learned from the Marxian experience,
but,
uh,

437
00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:41.440
uh,
we're,
I think,
uh,

438
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:46.140
just about every country of the world now recognizes that,
uh,

439
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:50.890
it's a complicated thing to get risk management working well and we have to,
uh,

440
00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:53.560
design things a more careful.

441
00:29:53.561 --> 00:29:56.470
We can't just smash things and start all over.

442
00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:58.730
We have to design a system of risk management.

443
00:29:58.731 --> 00:30:00.640
And that's what I think finance is about.

444
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:05.580
I wanted to mention a couple of other philosophers,

445
00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:09.070
uh,
who talk about risk management.

446
00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:11.853
Uh,

447
00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.650
one of them is the economist John [inaudible],

448
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:25.480
who won the Nobel Prize in economics,
uh,
some years ago.

449
00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:30.400
Uh,
and another one is the philosopher,
John Rawls,

450
00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:34.980
who wrote the book theory of Justice,
uh,

451
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.850
which has become a classic.

452
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:44.230
And I think in both of these as,
um,
as incorporating,
I would,

453
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.400
especially with her sunny,

454
00:30:45.401 --> 00:30:50.401
but also with roles as incorporating some idea of risk management into our basic

455
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.570
philosophy.
Uh,
so we have a,
a,

456
00:30:54.571 --> 00:30:59.230
a philosophy that,
uh,
most of us that,
uh,
uh,

457
00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:04.110
some kind of,
uh,
economic inequality is a bad thing,
uh,

458
00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.900
and that it's unjust for someone,
uh,
who is,
uh,

459
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:12.730
for no fault of his or her own is suffering economic hardship.

460
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:17.110
Uh,
but,
uh,
how to formalize this idea.

461
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:20.380
John Harrison,
who was the first to write about this,

462
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.800
he said that we should think of when we think about distributional justice,

463
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:31.120
we can think of it as a risk management problem.
And that,
uh,
he said,

464
00:31:31.121 --> 00:31:33.090
imagine that,
uh,

465
00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.360
we could get people to have a big town meeting for the whole world.

466
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.620
Um,
and he said before they were born,
okay.

467
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:46.120
So there's some space up in heaven where all the unborn babies are,

468
00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:48.840
that we're living in the future.
And,
uh,

469
00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.430
unfortunately they're not able to have a town meeting,

470
00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:54.550
but let's suppose they could.
All right.
Uh,

471
00:31:54.551 --> 00:31:59.230
and so we're up there in heaven thinking about our lives in the future as
people.

472
00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:03.640
Uh,
and uh,
what would we do?
Uh,

473
00:32:03.730 --> 00:32:08.290
suppose we don't know what economic circumstances we'd be born into and what

474
00:32:08.291 --> 00:32:11.620
kinds of contingencies we'd have in life.
What would we decide?

475
00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:16.720
Suppose we were trying to decide on a constitution for the world,
uh,
in that,
uh,

476
00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:17.770
in that state,

477
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:22.350
John Rawls expanded on this and he called it the original position.
Uh,

478
00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:24.490
so what would they do?
Well,

479
00:32:24.491 --> 00:32:28.120
they would probably agree that we'll do some risk sharing,
right?

480
00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:31.870
Every everyone is thinking,
I don't know whether I'll be rich or poor,

481
00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:36.040
and so I would like to have a world in which,
uh,
risks are shared.

482
00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:40.520
Um,
on the other hand,
what would you decide,

483
00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:42.890
if you can imagine yourself in that situation,

484
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:44.960
what would you decide about inequality?

485
00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:50.060
Would you decide to have a world with absolute equality?
Uh,
well,

486
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:52.360
you know,
somebody would probably supposed to,

487
00:32:52.361 --> 00:32:55.970
someone propose that up in heaven now,
and someone else might say,
well,

488
00:32:55.971 --> 00:32:59.060
that's not going to work so well,
that's like a kibbutzim kibbutz,

489
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.420
like one of the kibbutz team.
Uh,
it's not going to work.

490
00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.350
We're not going to enjoy it.

491
00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:08.750
Something's wrong with that because it's going to create a moral hazard problem

492
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:13.880
and we're not going to be as productive.
Uh,
some I might also say,
you know,

493
00:33:13.881 --> 00:33:14.900
a little inequality,

494
00:33:14.901 --> 00:33:19.640
even a substantial inequality is not so bad as long as nobody is really

495
00:33:19.641 --> 00:33:20.151
suffering.

496
00:33:20.151 --> 00:33:24.830
As long as everyone has the basics needs and there we can all be happy.
But,

497
00:33:24.831 --> 00:33:25.340
you know,

498
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:29.840
let's let some people make a big fortunes because that provides spice in life

499
00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:33.680
and some adventure that something to look forward to that you might get this.

500
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.760
And so you could see he's saying,
we don't want to eliminate inequality.

501
00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:42.620
Uh,
so,
uh,
uh,

502
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:46.140
what her and roles both,
uh,

503
00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:51.730
gave us is a system of justice that in my mind conveys a sense of financial risk

504
00:33:54.021 --> 00:33:56.250
management.
Uh,

505
00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:03.080
I,
I'm not going to talk a lot about,
uh,
uh,

506
00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.470
well I'm going to move off sort of framing here,
but,
uh,
let me,
uh,
let me,

507
00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:12.620
at this point,
you mentioned something about public finance.

508
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:15.020
This is not a course in public finance.

509
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:18.530
It doesn't say the title of this course is financial markets.

510
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:21.600
I guess when you put market's down,
it doesn't sound like public finance,

511
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.660
but even so it could.

512
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:29.500
Public Finance is the financial issues relating to governments.

513
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:34.820
Okay.
And finance usually means the private sector,

514
00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:38.030
but the issues are much the same in both cases.

515
00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:43.370
So let me say something about public finance here.
Uh,
and,
and so,

516
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:46.350
uh,
public finance,
uh,

517
00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:51.490
relates to the tax and welfare system that we have,

518
00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:59.090
the government taxes people,
uh,
and it,

519
00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:04.550
uh,
take some of the money,
uh,
and redistributes it to people in need.

520
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.770
Uh,
and this is essentially a risk management system.

521
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:15.490
It's something that I suppose Robert Owen and Karl Marx would have said sounds

522
00:35:16.221 --> 00:35:17.001
like a good thing,

523
00:35:17.001 --> 00:35:20.990
but of course they want him to do much more and be more comprehensive.
But it's,

524
00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.860
it's maybe something that has evolved as something that actually works.

525
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:30.110
You have a progressive tax system that takes more money from the wealthier

526
00:35:30.111 --> 00:35:34.930
people,
and you have a welfare system that looks at individual hardship and,

527
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:39.720
and pays out a it create moral hazard problems.
Uh,

528
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:40.860
that's a problem with it.

529
00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.420
But that's something that we're learning about that's part of public finances is

530
00:35:45.421 --> 00:35:48.680
learning how to modify,
uh,
the,
um,

531
00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:53.110
the tax system so that it works pretty well.
Uh,

532
00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:58.310
but I wanted to start out by mentioning taxes and welfare because I think that

533
00:35:58.471 --> 00:36:03.471
it's really the most important risk management system already in place because

534
00:36:04.411 --> 00:36:07.500
of the financial risk management system that we have is imperfect.

535
00:36:08.130 --> 00:36:10.220
We aren't there yet.
Uh,

536
00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:14.340
the thing that's really doing the heavy hitting and our youth manager is really

537
00:36:14.341 --> 00:36:19.341
the tax and welfare system because that's because the most important risks that

538
00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:24.720
individuals face is the risk of major losses of income.

539
00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:30.240
So if something really hits you hard and you would be starving,
uh,

540
00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:32.280
that's,
that's really bad.

541
00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:37.410
And so nobody starves in advanced countries of the world today,

542
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:40.620
and that's because of this system.
Moreover,

543
00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:45.650
you might get hit by an illness and then you could be in desperate trouble that

544
00:36:46.801 --> 00:36:51.480
you will die unless,
uh,
unless you get some kind of emergency care,

545
00:36:51.481 --> 00:36:52.860
which might be very expensive.

546
00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.320
So every advanced country in the world has a system that provides for this,

547
00:36:58.321 --> 00:37:00.330
including the United States,
and sit down and leave.

548
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:05.760
We don't have a national healthcare system.
Uh,
people say we don't.

549
00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:07.230
Well,
we,
we don't,

550
00:37:07.231 --> 00:37:12.231
but we do have an emergency care system so that anybody who is suddenly stricken

551
00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:18.930
will be taken to a hospital and taking care of,
uh,
it's not perfect,

552
00:37:18.931 --> 00:37:22.860
but it is there.
And so what we do have,
we should be thankful for.
Uh,

553
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.270
it's very important.

554
00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:28.860
So I thought this would be a good lead into the second theme of this lecture,

555
00:37:28.861 --> 00:37:32.850
which is framing.
Uh,
and,
uh,

556
00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:37.980
we have a good system in the taxes,
but it's,
it's,
uh,

557
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:39.970
imperfect,
uh,

558
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:44.940
because it hasn't been thought out thoroughly in terms of risk management.

559
00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:49.110
Uh,
so let's talk about framing and taxes.

560
00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:57.450
If you go to look at congressional discussion of tax rates,

561
00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:02.220
you won't see risk management mentioned very often.
Uh,
they,

562
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.390
uh,
uh,
they,
they seem to talk about it in their own terms,

563
00:38:06.391 --> 00:38:11.220
which sound to,
uh,
public finance expert as,
uh,

564
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:16.010
I dunno,
very populist or unprofessional.
Uh,

565
00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:21.020
I guess their elected officials and their voters are not finance theorists and

566
00:38:21.031 --> 00:38:25.890
don't think of these in these terms.
Uh,
but,
uh,
the,
um,

567
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.410
there's a,
uh,
Edward Mccaffrey,
he did a history of taxes.

568
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:35.710
He's a law professor,
uh,

569
00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:44.070
uh,
in the United States and asked about,
um,
I'm sorry,
mic,
carefree,

570
00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:48.640
ca capital,
ca,
uh,

571
00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:54.150
two cs,
m,
c,
c,
a,
F,
F,
e,
r,
y,
um,

572
00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.120
uh,
based on,
uh,
issues of,
uh,

573
00:38:58.121 --> 00:39:02.280
framing and psychology.
So we have a system,

574
00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:05.250
which you say it,
it really,
the tax,

575
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.830
the progressive tax system is very important,
uh,

576
00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:13.170
but yet it's not conceptualized.
Right.

577
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:14.070
Uh,

578
00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:19.070
so what McCaffrey points out is that the only time the government in the United

579
00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:24.500
States has ever been able to impose high taxes on wealthy people is during wars.

580
00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.950
And,
uh,
if you look at the history of u s taxes,

581
00:39:29.951 --> 00:39:33.300
the very simple history is world war one and World War II.

582
00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:35.190
During World War One,

583
00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:40.580
our men were out dying in Europe and people would vote for someone who said,

584
00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:45.830
let's raise the taxes on the rich.
Someone's profiting from this war.
Now,
uh,

585
00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.630
it doesn't sound right when other men are out there dying.

586
00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.420
So they raised taxes during World War One.

587
00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.560
They did it again even more decisively in World War II.

588
00:39:55.830 --> 00:40:00.720
And that's how we got progressive taxes.
Uh,
I'm over simplifying a little bit.

589
00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:04.380
Uh,
but,
uh,
uh,
between wars,

590
00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:09.360
that rate tends to come down,
uh,
because people think,
well,
the war is over.

591
00:40:09.361 --> 00:40:11.670
They don't understand the risk management function of it.

592
00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:16.200
And politicians are reluctant to cut taxes,
but they do it gradually.

593
00:40:16.201 --> 00:40:20.320
So that's a simple history of,
of taxes.
Uh,

594
00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:21.803
but,
uh,

595
00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:29.600
<v 2>uh,
so,
um,</v>

596
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.100
<v 0>actually the,
in the United States,</v>

597
00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:40.130
the income tax came in during the American civil war,

598
00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:45.430
uh,
and,
um,
uh,
there,
uh,

599
00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:51.450
it was,
uh,
the income tax came in at nine 1861.

600
00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:53.043
<v 2>Yes.</v>

601
00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:01.580
<v 0>Again,
during a war.
And,
uh,
uh,</v>

602
00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.510
there was a progressive tax.

603
00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:08.880
The tax in as of 1862 was 3% on incomes,

604
00:41:08.881 --> 00:41:12.450
over $600 a year.
That sounds kind of low.

605
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:14.100
That was 1862.

606
00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.900
And then they raised it to a 5% on incomes over $10,000.

607
00:41:18.901 --> 00:41:21.980
It was the beginning.
Uh,
but it didn't,
uh,

608
00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:25.570
it didn't take because they had technical problems.
Uh,

609
00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:30.460
but,
uh,
so,
uh,

610
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:36.670
I,
I mentioned tax example because I want to just stress that,
uh,

611
00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:41.540
framing,
uh,
and psychological barriers are important problems,

612
00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:46.580
uh,
for,
uh,
creating financial markets.

613
00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:49.370
Um,
so,
um,

614
00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:52.793
uh,

615
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:57.970
the idea is that people don't see this basic risk management problem and they

616
00:41:59.811 --> 00:42:02.630
see things in entirely different terms.

617
00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.313
<v 2>Uh,</v>

618
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:13.630
<v 0>uh,
so [inaudible] talked about how people view,</v>

619
00:42:14.070 --> 00:42:14.903
uh,

620
00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:17.733
<v 2>okay.</v>

621
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:20.070
<v 0>Financial gains and losses,</v>

622
00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:25.940
and they talked about how people's actions are very malleable depending on how

623
00:42:28.681 --> 00:42:33.030
things are presented.
One of their most famous examples,

624
00:42:33.031 --> 00:42:35.430
they ask people the following question.

625
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.740
Suppose you had bought expensive tickets to a concert.
Okay,

626
00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:42.270
very expensive.

627
00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:46.890
You've had $200 for each ticket and you have two tickets for $100 worth.

628
00:42:47.490 --> 00:42:52.380
Okay.
And on the way to the concert,
you lose the tickets.

629
00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:53.453
Okay.

630
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:57.420
And so now you've arrived at the concert hall and you're looking through your

631
00:42:57.421 --> 00:43:00.480
pocket and you don't,
you realize they're gone.
You've lost them.

632
00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:03.120
The question they ask people is,

633
00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:08.480
would you go to the window and buy another pair of tickets for $400?

634
00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:14.550
Okay.
Having lost it and people were answering,
most people said,
no,

635
00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:19.380
I'd be so annoyed and angry with myself.
I just leave.
But then they said,

636
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:20.010
nanny,

637
00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:23.880
they posed a different version of the same question and the different version

638
00:43:23.881 --> 00:43:24.570
was,

639
00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:29.370
suppose you had ordered tickets to pick them up and pay for them at the window,

640
00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:34.770
uh,
at the concert hall and you brought $400 in cash in your pocket.

641
00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:36.083
Okay.

642
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:41.250
And now you arrive and you realize you've lost your $400.
Okay.

643
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:45.840
But now the choice is you could,
what,
what are you going to do?

644
00:43:45.841 --> 00:43:49.340
Would you go to the ticket window and uh,

645
00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.110
use your credit card to pick up the tickets?

646
00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:56.370
Or would you just walk away in anger and annoyance?
Well,

647
00:43:56.430 --> 00:44:00.780
most people say,
oh,
I would just go to the window and buy the tickets.

648
00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:05.760
Uh,
right.
Does that sound plausible?
That you can see the difference?

649
00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:08.160
But in economic terms,

650
00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:12.300
there's no difference between losing the tickets and losing $400.

651
00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:17.370
So why do you behave differently?
Well,
that's framing because in your mind,

652
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.270
you're putting tickets and cash in different mental accounts.

653
00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.790
And so the mental account tickets generates an emotional feeling.

654
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:32.000
Uh,
and it changes my action that I lost in that account.
Um,

655
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:37.060
and so unfortunately that's the,

656
00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:41.310
that's the,
unfortunately,
people's decisions are biased by that kind of thing.

657
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:45.570
So we have to frame things as,
uh,

658
00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:49.770
uh,
as it puts things into mental categories,

659
00:44:49.771 --> 00:44:52.500
a presentation matters,
uh,

660
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:56.500
so that people can manage their risks.
Right.
Uh,

661
00:44:57.060 --> 00:45:01.380
Kahneman and Tversky also,
and others have also talked about insurance.

662
00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:03.090
They've asked people

663
00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:09.270
a question and it phrase that in two different ways.
One of them was,

664
00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:14.010
would you buy insurance against such and such a risk?
Okay.

665
00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:15.213
Uh,

666
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:19.920
and the same question was rephrased in another way without mentioning the word

667
00:45:19.921 --> 00:45:22.890
insurance.
They just described it.
He said,

668
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:26.880
would you sign a contract that if you made,
had this loss,

669
00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:30.470
the contract would pay you a certain amount of money?
Uh,

670
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:35.520
and the percent of people who say yes to that is lower because they didn't put

671
00:45:35.521 --> 00:45:37.170
it in an insurance frame.

672
00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:40.980
And so we are accustomed to thinking of insurance as a good thing.

673
00:45:40.981 --> 00:45:43.230
And if I talk about it in general terms,

674
00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:48.420
they might not put it in that frame and they might not act.
Uh,

675
00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:54.020
really an important example of framing a is how we deal with money and,

676
00:45:56.220 --> 00:46:00.060
and uh,
indexation.
So,
uh,

677
00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:02.920
we have money for me

678
00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.680
thinking and they real frame

679
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.550
the value of money changes through time.

680
00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:17.910
That's because of inflation or deflation.
Uh,

681
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:22.500
and yet most of our debts are written in money terms.
That is,

682
00:46:22.501 --> 00:46:24.630
they're not indexed for inflation.

683
00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:28.470
So if you wanted to have a real frame,

684
00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:34.350
you would index to this consumer price index or some other inflation index.

685
00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.630
Okay.
Uh,

686
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:42.420
but most of us are accustomed to a money frame.
So most of us,

687
00:46:42.421 --> 00:46:46.440
when we lend money to each other,
we do it in money terms.

688
00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:51.510
You merely say,
for example,
if,
if your friend asks to borrow $100 from you,

689
00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:52.800
uh,

690
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:57.390
you would probably not say you might actually put interest on this persons.

691
00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:01.690
You could say,
all right,
I'll do it at 5% interest paid me back in a year.
Uh,

692
00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:07.130
you would probably not even think to say pay me 3% interest plus the rate of

693
00:47:07.771 --> 00:47:10.740
inflation for the next year.
Uh,

694
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:13.860
that would be putting it in a real frame.
Uh,

695
00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:18.890
and wouldn't that be more sensible because you would be specifying the contract

696
00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:23.280
in real terms rather than money terms.
Uh,

697
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:27.420
and yet most people just don't do that.

698
00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.570
So most of our fixed incomes as they're called,
which are,
um,

699
00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.870
assets that are denominated in currency.

700
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:39.910
Most of our debts are written in money terms and people can't get over this

701
00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:44.740
framing in terms of money.
It's a powerful psychological,

702
00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:46.360
you might say an illusion.

703
00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:51.550
People think they want money when in fact they should want real goods and

704
00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:55.960
services.
So that's an example example of a framing issue.

705
00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:59.350
Um,
okay.

706
00:47:59.351 --> 00:48:03.250
Now I want to move to the third theme of this lecture,

707
00:48:03.251 --> 00:48:07.150
which is a invention.
Uh,

708
00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:11.290
and uh,
so,
uh,

709
00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:16.000
as I said,
uh,

710
00:48:17.530 --> 00:48:22.180
progress in finance requires an inventive process,
uh,

711
00:48:22.181 --> 00:48:26.650
and invention,
uh,
is,

712
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:31.600
uh,
occurs in a million of other invention.

713
00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:34.660
No notably our information technology.

714
00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.000
I said this in an earlier lecture,

715
00:48:41.001 --> 00:48:45.500
but a financial device is that is a complicated device.

716
00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:50.180
Uh,
like any engine or uh,
uh,

717
00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:53.310
or,
um,
uh,
uh,

718
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:58.480
any other thing that they are they patent and developed by,
uh,

719
00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:04.360
uh,
to solve some physical problem.
Um,
so for example,

720
00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:08.980
uh,
let's talk about an insurance policy.
Okay.

721
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:16.000
Uh,
as an invention and insurance policy,
the,

722
00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:20.550
the concept is very simple.
We could talk about fire insurance or life insurance.

723
00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:25.230
Uh,
uh,
life insurance is designed to protect.

724
00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:28.890
Ideally it protects parents with young children.

725
00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:34.020
That's the most important application.
So if one of the parents dies,
uh,
it'd be,

726
00:49:34.021 --> 00:49:38.850
creates hardship for the family because the remaining parent has the burden of

727
00:49:38.851 --> 00:49:42.720
caring for children and earning a livelihood to support all of them.

728
00:49:42.721 --> 00:49:47.370
And it is very difficult.
Uh,
so we have a policy that pays them.

729
00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:51.350
If uh,
uh,
if one of them dies,
but,
uh,

730
00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:56.220
it's not so easy to devise this in the concept is very simple.

731
00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:00.960
So in order to devise an insurance contract that does this job,

732
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:01.830
uh,

733
00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:06.830
we have to have a contract between an insurance company and the insured.

734
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:12.880
The contract has to specify what are the causes of,
uh,

735
00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:16.680
let's say a death or a situation in which one is covered.

736
00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:20.790
We have to then realize that there's a moral hazard problem.

737
00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:25.740
We have to exclude certain causes like suicide.
In the case of life insurance,

738
00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:29.780
uh,
in other kinds of insurance,
it gets very complicated.
Uh,

739
00:50:29.810 --> 00:50:34.580
you have to exclude those causes that generate moral hazard problems for the

740
00:50:34.581 --> 00:50:37.130
insurance to work.
Otherwise the whole system will fail.

741
00:50:37.610 --> 00:50:40.880
When they invented fire insurance in the 16 hundreds,

742
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:43.490
there was a lot of skepticism because hey,

743
00:50:43.491 --> 00:50:46.010
anyone can burn down their house and they said,

744
00:50:46.011 --> 00:50:50.750
it's not going to work because you have to decide how much the house is insured

745
00:50:50.751 --> 00:50:51.584
for.

746
00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:55.040
And then anybody that if you ever make a mistake and you insure it for too much,

747
00:50:55.370 --> 00:50:59.750
then the people who,
who realize they've got one on the insurance company,

748
00:50:59.751 --> 00:51:01.610
they've ensured the house for more than it's worth,

749
00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:04.640
they'll burn down their house and collect the money.

750
00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:08.960
And how can the insurance company ever evaluate every house properly to avoid

751
00:51:08.961 --> 00:51:11.630
that?
So they had to work on that.
They had to a device,

752
00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:13.700
they had to get an appraisal industry,

753
00:51:13.701 --> 00:51:16.580
they could appraise houses and get some idea of what they're really worth.

754
00:51:16.581 --> 00:51:18.420
And they had to get that all worked out.

755
00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:22.550
It had to be done accurately and they had to decide to keep a certain amount of

756
00:51:22.551 --> 00:51:24.200
coinsurance.
In other words,

757
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:29.530
lower the amount insured below the actual value of the house to prevent moral

758
00:51:29.631 --> 00:51:33.050
hazard.
Um,
and,
uh,

759
00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:37.220
they had to develop statistics of law.
They had to know what the losses were.

760
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:40.760
So in case of life insurance,
they developed actuarial tables.

761
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:44.630
And then that requires the collecting of statistics.
Uh,

762
00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:48.680
and then of course there's the other problem that the insurance company,
uh,

763
00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:53.740
how does the insurance company reasonably specify that it can come through on

764
00:51:54.771 --> 00:51:56.500
this policy?
Um,

765
00:51:56.570 --> 00:52:01.570
so you have to have the insurance company set up with a structure itself that

766
00:52:02.571 --> 00:52:06.950
guarantees that they have enough reserves to meet the losses that they might

767
00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:08.660
incur.
Uh,

768
00:52:08.661 --> 00:52:12.080
and so that requires a theory of the capital and you have to,

769
00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:16.550
they're going to have to invest the reserves in financial assets and then you

770
00:52:16.551 --> 00:52:21.260
have to ask,
well,
how were the financial assets going to behave over time?

771
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:26.030
And then it becomes a theory of all of finance we comes in as well.

772
00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:28.160
And then moreover,
that beyond that,

773
00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:32.330
how does one know in taking out an insurance policy that the insurance company

774
00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.210
is going to be sound?
Uh,

775
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:39.170
so the insurance company has to have some way of demonstrating its soundness to

776
00:52:39.171 --> 00:52:40.880
the public.
Moreover,

777
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:45.560
we have regulators who have to regulate insurance companies and,

778
00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:50.230
and uh,
make sure that they have adequate capital.
Uh,
so it,

779
00:52:50.231 --> 00:52:51.980
it's a very complicated industry.

780
00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:57.080
And although I said insurance was effectively discovered or invented in the 16

781
00:52:57.081 --> 00:52:57.914
hundreds,

782
00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:02.950
it has been slow to grow because they didn't have the welding all of the

783
00:53:03.471 --> 00:53:08.180
inventions yet.
Um,
so,
uh,

784
00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:14.070
uh,
uh,
I wanted to just give some,

785
00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:19.790
uh,
often the interventions that occur in finance,
they seem in a way obvious,

786
00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.670
uh,
some of the things I said,
you'd probably say,
well,

787
00:53:22.671 --> 00:53:26.070
I should have known that an insurance company would have to do that.
Uh,

788
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:28.210
but it isn't,
you know,

789
00:53:28.530 --> 00:53:32.700
what's obvious after the fact is not what's obvious before the fact.

790
00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:38.170
And one thing I like to stress is that the history of technology is sometimes a

791
00:53:38.641 --> 00:53:40.920
history of very glamorous,

792
00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:45.480
an obvious ideas like nuclear power.
That's amazing,
right?

793
00:53:45.481 --> 00:53:50.340
You can get Adam's to smash atoms and create a chain reaction and create power.

794
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:53.010
That's pretty amazing invention.

795
00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:57.930
But a lot of the inventions that matter to us are extremely simple.

796
00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:01.620
They're kind of staring in your face.
Obvious.
Uh,

797
00:54:01.621 --> 00:54:04.520
so let me just give some example of that.

798
00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:09.240
Sometimes people are very slow to see the obvious where it seems so in history.

799
00:54:09.690 --> 00:54:12.270
So I like to talk about the invention of the wheel.

800
00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:16.200
That's the most famous invention,
right?
It's a cliche.
People say,

801
00:54:16.201 --> 00:54:20.650
let's not reinvent the wheel here.
Uh,
so let's go back to that.
Uh,

802
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:24.630
inventing the wheel.
It seems,
uh,
what could be more obvious than a wheel?

803
00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:26.460
Uh,
well,

804
00:54:26.461 --> 00:54:31.040
it apparently is not so obvious because in,
uh,

805
00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:34.970
the Americas before the,
uh,

806
00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:38.490
Columbus Columbus came pre Colombian America.

807
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:41.970
There were no wheeled vehicles anywhere.

808
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:46.050
We had civilizations as techs,
Myers,
inkers,
etc.

809
00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:48.930
No wheeled vehicles.
Uh,

810
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:52.230
now the amazing thing is if you go to Mexico,

811
00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:57.240
you can go to a museums that have children's toys from Pre-colombian next Sico

812
00:54:58.950 --> 00:55:02.580
with wheels.
They were little toys that they would,

813
00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:05.610
they would be shaped like animals or something and you could roll them along the

814
00:55:05.611 --> 00:55:08.730
floor.
So why didn't somebody think of that?

815
00:55:08.731 --> 00:55:11.820
You're sitting there with your child playing with a wheeled toy,

816
00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:16.830
and then you're going out to carry some heavy stuff and you're dragging it along

817
00:55:16.831 --> 00:55:21.600
the ground.
Why didn't you think of putting wheels under it?
Uh,

818
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:26.490
well,
it's apparently not so obvious.
So some very obvious ideas,

819
00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:30.180
uh,
are not so obvious.
There's some people today think,

820
00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:32.910
I just can't imagine this history can't be right.

821
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:37.780
I don't believe that they hadn't invented wheels in America before,
uh,

822
00:55:38.340 --> 00:55:40.950
Columbus to argue with them.

823
00:55:40.951 --> 00:55:44.790
I point out an example which is more familiar.
Unfortunately,

824
00:55:44.791 --> 00:55:48.700
you people are too young to have experienced this,
but,
um,

825
00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:52.650
I've experienced this and you can talk to your parents.
Uh,

826
00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:57.890
it used to be before 1972 that suitcases never had wheels,

827
00:56:00.210 --> 00:56:04.140
never,
never had wheels.
Okay.
Uh,

828
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:09.060
you've probably own a wheeled suitcase,
right?
Some lost.
Have you do,
uh,

829
00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:14.670
the idea of putting wheels on suitcases goes back only two,

830
00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:19.260
1972.
Uh,
and it was a Barnard say,

831
00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:24.310
Dow who invented this is amazing,
right?
The wheeled suitcase.

832
00:56:24.311 --> 00:56:26.400
And he got a patent on it.
Uh,

833
00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:30.370
and he had a suitcase that I know exactly what if something like this had had

834
00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:33.740
you had a strap that you'd pull it along and it had four little wheels on the

835
00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:38.260
bottom and it worked.
So,
uh,
he's,
uh,

836
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:42.980
uh,
I had my student research assistant,
see,

837
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:46.930
can you find that guy?
Let's call him up and ask him about it.
It's so recent.

838
00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:49.000
So we,
my student called Bernard,

839
00:56:49.001 --> 00:56:53.650
say Dow up and asked him about his invention and he said,
yeah,
I was thinking,

840
00:56:53.651 --> 00:56:57.130
you know,
why don't we have wheels on suitcases?
So I just did it,
you know,
and,

841
00:56:57.230 --> 00:57:00.520
and then he said,
well,
I had a lot of trouble.
I took it to department stores.

842
00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:05.200
And I said,
uh,
let's,
why don't you sell this?
I'm making it,

843
00:57:05.410 --> 00:57:10.230
add it to your luggage.
And he said,
he met a lot of resistance,
um,

844
00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:15.220
department stores.
He said,
no,
and uh,
so we have a,
why would they say no?
I mean,

845
00:57:15.221 --> 00:57:20.080
it's such an obviously good idea.
And he said,
well,
they said people won't buy it.

846
00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:22.630
Uh,
and anywhere they said,
look,

847
00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:27.250
you go to any train station and there are these red caps or porters and they'll

848
00:57:27.251 --> 00:57:31.960
carry your suitcase for you.
You don't need wheels.
Uh,
that's what they told him.

849
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:34.870
But it seemed like there was kind of a way of thinking.

850
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:38.920
I think maybe people would be embarrassed if you were the only guy with wheel

851
00:57:39.200 --> 00:57:43.750
your suitcase.
People would think you look a little odd.
Uh,
and so,

852
00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:47.760
uh,
but anyway,
it's interesting.
Uh,

853
00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:52.720
the wheeled suitcase came in,
uh,
in 19,
uh,
uh,

854
00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:57.940
1972.
The problem with,
um,
say Dallas suitcase,

855
00:57:58.270 --> 00:58:01.540
I actually had one and you might have one in your attic and you can go up and

856
00:58:01.541 --> 00:58:06.400
look at it because your parents probably bought y and it's still up there.

857
00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:10.870
Uh,
you can take it out and try wheeling it along with that strap and it kind of

858
00:58:10.871 --> 00:58:15.790
works,
but it wobbles,
especially if you're hurrying to catch your airplane.

859
00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:19.540
That thing starts fish tailing and wobbling.
He just got a strap.

860
00:58:19.541 --> 00:58:22.820
You're pulling it on.
Uh,
so,
uh,

861
00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:25.000
obviously there was a design defect.

862
00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:30.720
Finally it was a Robert Plath who was an airline pilot who invented a new

863
00:58:31.271 --> 00:58:35.230
wheeled suitcase,
which he hadn't did in 1991.
Okay.

864
00:58:35.740 --> 00:58:40.240
And this suitcase had,
uh,
instead of having four little wheels on the bottom,

865
00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:44.620
it had two wheels on the back and you,
you didn't pull the suitcase lengthwise,

866
00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:48.280
you pulled it width wise,
so it gave you a stable base.
Moreover,

867
00:58:48.281 --> 00:58:51.160
instead of having a strap,
he had this thing that you've,

868
00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:54.340
or rigid thing that you pull out from this,
you know what I'm talking about.

869
00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.940
And he invented,
he call it the roller board.
Uh,

870
00:58:57.941 --> 00:59:01.540
he also had the idea that he would make it narrow enough so that when you're

871
00:59:01.541 --> 00:59:06.100
boarding an airplane,
you can still roll it down the aisle of the airplane.

872
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:10.930
It just fit perfectly.
So that was the role of board.
That was 1991.

873
00:59:10.931 --> 00:59:14.680
That's getting in the recent memory,
right?
It's so obvious.

874
00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.140
Why didn't they have them before?
Well,

875
00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:20.020
things that seem obvious or not obvious,

876
00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:23.560
and it has something to do it with something like framing or more,

877
00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:27.620
we tend to think of doing things in a certain way.
Everyone else is doing it.

878
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:32.390
We assume that that's the smart way to do things.
Uh,
and uh,

879
00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:36.960
and so,
uh,
that,
that limits us.
And so,
uh,

880
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:41.090
it's very hard to get new ideas started,
but they do get started.

881
00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:45.500
And so I think we'll get some really obvious,
um,
advances.

882
00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:50.330
One thing about inventions is that we have something called the patents.

883
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:55.460
The Patent Office grants patent rights to,
um,

884
00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.080
uh,
uh,
inventions,

885
01:00:00.610 --> 01:00:05.240
but traditionally in everywhere in the world,
really,

886
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:10.160
uh,
financial inventions were not considered worthy of patenting.

887
01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:14.120
Um,
because I guess patent law,
uh,

888
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:18.000
came in in response to things like the steam engine and the,
the,

889
01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:21.130
the power loom.
And there were physical inventions.

890
01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:26.300
They didn't think of financial inventions as worthy of patents.
Uh,
but,
uh,

891
01:00:26.570 --> 01:00:27.403
now,
uh,

892
01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:32.150
we're starting to see patent offices accepting financial devices.

893
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:37.390
So it happened in the late 1990s in the United States that a patent offices

894
01:00:37.581 --> 01:00:41.780
started to accept financial patents.
Uh,
and,
um,

895
01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:46.550
uh,
now there are several countries that,
uh,
I think it's Japan,
Korea,

896
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:49.910
uh,
uh,
and,
uh,

897
01:00:49.911 --> 01:00:53.870
elsewhere they're starting to see financial invention as a serious,

898
01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:58.740
uh,
as a,
as serious invention.
Uh,

899
01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.750
now that,
the last thing is,
um,

900
01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:06.100
<v 2>uh,
uh,</v>

901
01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:11.440
<v 0>information technology has as a driver of finance.</v>

902
01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.253
<v 2>Uh,</v>

903
01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:19.940
<v 0>yeah,</v>

904
01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:24.940
I'd like to stress information technology because we are living in a time of

905
01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.020
rapid advance.
And as you know,
I don't have to tell you this.

906
01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.110
Computers are becoming more and more a part of our lives.

907
01:01:32.530 --> 01:01:36.170
And this is something that is transforming the world.
Uh,

908
01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.290
what is it that makes us uniquely human?

909
01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:42.160
You might say a good part of it is their ability to process information.

910
01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:45.940
We differ from a lower animals and our brains,

911
01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:51.070
which are much more capable of,
uh,
of storing and processing information.

912
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:55.180
But we're living in a time of revolution when machines are challenging,

913
01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:58.510
are competing with our brains,
uh,
and uh,

914
01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:03.130
this may create the economic dislocations that we will see,

915
01:02:03.430 --> 01:02:07.150
uh,
throughout our lives,
but also it creates opportunities.

916
01:02:07.151 --> 01:02:09.550
I wanted to stress on the opportunities.

917
01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:15.310
A lot of financial innovation has co evolve with information technology.

918
01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:21.810
A lot of simple ideas of risk are ideas that require well designed information

919
01:02:23.491 --> 01:02:24.324
technology.

920
01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:30.400
And we've seen a lot of advances in the last couple of centuries that,

921
01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:34.710
uh,
uh,
that,
uh,
make,
uh,

922
01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:36.570
financial innovation possible.

923
01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.050
So I thought I would give you an example from the 19th century,
uh,

924
01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:44.250
which is very important.
And again,
it's public finance.

925
01:02:44.251 --> 01:02:48.840
I'm not going to stress public finance so much in this course,
but,
uh,
it seems,

926
01:02:48.841 --> 01:02:53.190
uh,
I'm going to give the example of 19th century information technology.

927
01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:58.030
And the 19th century invention of social security.
So,
um,

928
01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.130
let's go back to the 19th century is,
that's the 18 hundreds.

929
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:09.230
That was a wonderful century for information technology.

930
01:03:10.020 --> 01:03:12.540
You probably don't think of it that way because you say,
wait a minute.

931
01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:15.390
They computer wasn't invented until the 1940s.

932
01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:17.730
Actually you would be wrong.

933
01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:22.440
The computer was invented in the 19th century by Babbage,

934
01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:26.430
although he didn't actually make one.
But he wrote down a design,

935
01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:30.150
which was similar to,
uh,
what we do now.

936
01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:33.100
But there were a lot of other things that happened,
uh,

937
01:03:33.450 --> 01:03:38.450
in the 19th century that advanced information technology and made finance really

938
01:03:38.791 --> 01:03:41.850
powerful.
One was paper.

939
01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:46.620
This sounds very simple.
At the beginning of the 19th century,

940
01:03:46.621 --> 01:03:51.621
in 1800 paper was hand made out of cloth.

941
01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:56.520
That's the way they made it.
Paper therefore,
was very expensive.

942
01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.350
And so if you bought a newspaper,
uh,
uh,

943
01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:03.640
it would be only two sheets because it was so expensive,

944
01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:06.240
not all the thick paper that we have today.

945
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:10.800
And it would cost something like 10 or $20,
uh,
in today's prices.

946
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:15.660
So it would only be wealthy people who would buy that every day.
Uh,
and,

947
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:16.583
uh,

948
01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:21.180
they invented the paper machine so they could mass produce paper didn't have to

949
01:04:21.181 --> 01:04:24.330
be handmade anymore,
and they invented wood pulp paper,

950
01:04:24.331 --> 01:04:27.470
so it didn't have to be made out of cloth anymore.
Uh,

951
01:04:27.471 --> 01:04:32.190
and the price of paper felt,
so that created opportunity for record keeping,

952
01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:36.930
which was very important,
uh,
because that's what finance has built.

953
01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.990
You need financial records,
you can't have just one copy,

954
01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:45.030
you have to have multiple copies.
They also invented,
um,
uh,

955
01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:49.530
carbon paper
leaving.
Don't even know what this is.

956
01:04:49.531 --> 01:04:53.610
You all know what carbon paper,
I guess you do know what this is,
right?

957
01:04:54.450 --> 01:04:59.370
It's obsolete.
Do you have any carbon paper?
Anyone here in your room?
You do?

958
01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.330
Okay,
so it's not absolutely,
but anyway,

959
01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:07.740
it's just a paper with some black material on it.

960
01:05:07.741 --> 01:05:11.730
So you put it between two pieces of paper and you write on the top one and it

961
01:05:11.731 --> 01:05:15.050
creates a copy and the bottom one.
And you can make multiple,

962
01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.310
you can put three or four coffee gets worse and worse each time.

963
01:05:18.311 --> 01:05:22.600
But you've got multiple copies.
That's information technology,
uh,

964
01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:26.650
and so that you really need that because if you have only one copy of something,

965
01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:30.970
you don't have a backup.
So you could store the one copy separately.

966
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:35.080
Also in the 19th century,
the typewriter was invented.

967
01:05:37.210 --> 01:05:41.380
Okay.
Of course,
that's,
you know,
that may be the core idea of a computer.

968
01:05:41.381 --> 01:05:45.160
Your computer,
it looks like a type writer,
but a typewriter just speeds,

969
01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.800
uh,
recording of information.
You know,

970
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:53.260
tests showed in the 19th century that people could type four or five times as

971
01:05:53.261 --> 01:05:55.260
fast as they can handwrite and,

972
01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:59.500
and there's no ambiguity because it's very clear which key was struck.

973
01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:04.150
Whereas handwritten fast handwriting,
it becomes impossible to read or difficult.

974
01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:08.140
Um,
another thing that happened,
they started developing this,

975
01:06:08.141 --> 01:06:12.790
not invented in the 19th century,
but they started doing standardized forms.

976
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:16.291
That is,

977
01:06:16.291 --> 01:06:21.291
it'd be a printed form on paper with spaces to fill in the numbers or other

978
01:06:21.701 --> 01:06:26.701
things that put us as sort of organization and the data entry that was unknown.

979
01:06:26.890 --> 01:06:30.100
So you have a standardized form and you've got carbon paper between them and you

980
01:06:30.101 --> 01:06:31.360
tied it all.

981
01:06:31.361 --> 01:06:36.110
These really created much more accurate and uh,
uh,

982
01:06:36.790 --> 01:06:40.360
techniques.
We also got better bureaucracy.

983
01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:45.460
Uh,
that means,
uh,

984
01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:50.490
we started to learn management science in the government and so that government

985
01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:54.070
and also in corporations so that they could manage effectively.

986
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:57.430
So in the United States we developed the civil service.

987
01:06:59.010 --> 01:07:01.560
It used to be that government officials were all picked,
Croak,

988
01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:05.950
political patronage,
and they are very often we're incompetent.
So we set up,

989
01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:10.030
this is not a new idea,
this goes back to China thousands of years ago,

990
01:07:10.031 --> 01:07:13.210
but it started to be widely done.

991
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:16.810
So he had a civil service exam that established your competence.

992
01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:20.380
So you had competent people with their typewriters and carbon favors.

993
01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:25.120
Also the filing cabinet.
That sounds like a minor thing.

994
01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:30.430
It was invented in the 1890s.
Okay.
Before that,

995
01:07:30.431 --> 01:07:32.590
people used to put papers in piles,

996
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:36.130
tighten up and ribbons and put them on bookshelves or in drawers.

997
01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:40.060
The filing cabinet was much more orderly and effective.

998
01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.770
Uh,
and so all those things developed in the 19th century.

999
01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:48.970
And it just created a new world,
uh,
for,
uh,

1000
01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:54.430
for,
uh,
for financial opportunity.

1001
01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:56.253
Uh,

1002
01:07:57.130 --> 01:08:01.210
so things started to happen in response to this and risk management got better.

1003
01:08:01.330 --> 01:08:06.310
So I wanted to talk about social security as a risk management technique that

1004
01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:11.290
developed in the 19th century,
uh,
and it developed in Germany.

1005
01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:13.183
Uh,

1006
01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:19.520
and it very interesting to me because it's a discreet invention that happened in

1007
01:08:19.881 --> 01:08:24.350
a point of time,
uh,
in response to information technology.

1008
01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:29.720
This is 1889 under the government of Otto von Bismarck.

1009
01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:34.340
Uh,
although he has nothing to do with this.
I think it was other people,

1010
01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:38.870
economists in,
uh,
in Germany that,
um,
uh,

1011
01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:44.520
that invented this idea.
So,
uh,
what did they do?
Uh,

1012
01:08:44.610 --> 01:08:48.830
I should have also mentioned another really important information technology

1013
01:08:48.831 --> 01:08:53.270
that developed in the 19th century is the postal service.

1014
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:56.150
Although we had mail before then,

1015
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:59.390
but in the 19th century,

1016
01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:02.480
they decided that it just got really good at delivering mail.

1017
01:09:02.900 --> 01:09:07.790
In 1799.
It would cost so much to mail a letter.

1018
01:09:07.791 --> 01:09:11.930
I don't have no exit.
It sounded like 10 or $20 to mail a letter.
At today's rate,

1019
01:09:11.970 --> 01:09:16.070
it would take a long time to get there.
So for most people it was prohibitively,

1020
01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:18.350
I'm talking in today's prices,
roughly speaking,

1021
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:22.880
most people wouldn't ever mail a letter or get a letter too expensive,

1022
01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:25.610
not to count.
Only the paper and everything was expensive.

1023
01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.410
But in the 19th century,

1024
01:09:27.411 --> 01:09:31.280
they developed postal services and interacted with the railroad.

1025
01:09:31.281 --> 01:09:33.830
They started having mail,
car is on trains,

1026
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:38.270
and they started having postal sorting on the train that they were speeding the

1027
01:09:38.271 --> 01:09:39.710
mail.
Uh,

1028
01:09:39.711 --> 01:09:44.210
so that this didn't have to wait two to sort it before it went on the train.

1029
01:09:44.211 --> 01:09:46.370
It was sorted.
Wow.
That was moving on a train.

1030
01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:50.000
Germany was very effective in these,
uh,
they were,
they were,

1031
01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:54.200
had an advanced bureaucracy,
a good postal service.
Uh,

1032
01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:57.380
and then they had a network of post offices all over the country.

1033
01:09:57.381 --> 01:09:59.000
Every little town had a post office.

1034
01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:03.650
So this was the internet of the 19th century and it really changed everything.

1035
01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:05.840
So in 1889,

1036
01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:11.000
German government decided to use the postal service as an information network to

1037
01:10:11.001 --> 01:10:12.320
create social security.

1038
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:17.830
And they created a new law which said that every person who works in Germany has

1039
01:10:17.871 --> 01:10:22.871
to pay the government a certain percent of their income into the social security

1040
01:10:24.111 --> 01:10:26.810
system.
Uh,
and uh,
in addition,

1041
01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:31.840
the employer has to match this so that both the employer and the employee has to

1042
01:10:32.511 --> 01:10:33.720
do it.
Now,
how,

1043
01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.850
how in the world can somebody actually make that work for a whole country?

1044
01:10:37.851 --> 01:10:40.730
They were 11 million workers in Germany at the time,

1045
01:10:41.150 --> 01:10:44.870
and other countries looked on this as this is ridiculous.

1046
01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:48.590
No government can actually manage,
manage the system like this.

1047
01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:52.250
But they did it through the postal system.
You had to make your,

1048
01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:54.200
or your employer can do it for you.

1049
01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:58.850
They take it the money to the post office and the post office would give you

1050
01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.713
stamps.

1051
01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:03.080
It was already the same technology they use for the mail and you kept your

1052
01:11:03.081 --> 01:11:07.220
social security card and you pasted stamps on it that proves that you paid it

1053
01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:12.470
and they kept a copy of that and they filed it away and the government had a

1054
01:11:12.471 --> 01:11:15.540
complete of your payments into the system.

1055
01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:19.290
Then the design was that when you reached the retirement age,
uh,

1056
01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:24.530
you would then get funds from the government for the rest of your life,

1057
01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:29.160
your,
your retirement funds.
Uh,
and,
uh,

1058
01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:32.610
how do they decide how much was based on what you contributed?

1059
01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.800
They w they would pull out your entire life history of contributions.

1060
01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:40.500
They had it because you had filed it all at the post office and everything was

1061
01:11:40.501 --> 01:11:41.760
bureaucratic and efficient,

1062
01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.300
and they calculated according to a formula what you would get.

1063
01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:49.010
So it was it real insurance system,
and then they would pay you,
uh,

1064
01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:50.310
in your retirement.

1065
01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:55.680
So the London Times in 1889 said,
this is going to be a fiasco.

1066
01:11:55.770 --> 01:12:00.360
There's going to be so many mistakes and it's going to be so much,
uh,
uh,

1067
01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:04.560
complaints that this whole system is going to crumble and fall.
But it didn't,

1068
01:12:04.650 --> 01:12:09.270
it actually worked.
And so before long,
the UK copied it,

1069
01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:14.170
the u s was practically the last country to copy the system,
uh,

1070
01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:16.700
because in the 1930s,
uh,

1071
01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:21.480
because it didn't sound American and were kind of reluctant to take on ideas

1072
01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:26.070
from Germany of all places.
Uh,
but we finally did.

1073
01:12:26.071 --> 01:12:28.300
And we did that during the Great Depression,
uh,

1074
01:12:28.350 --> 01:12:31.500
when it suddenly seemed like we really needed to do something.

1075
01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:33.330
So that's an example.

1076
01:12:33.331 --> 01:12:37.800
You see how information technology created a social security system.

1077
01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:42.570
Now the,
the,
the really fascinating thing is we have the same system today,

1078
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:46.800
except we don't use the postal service as the conduit anymore.

1079
01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:50.040
Now it's all electronic and it's done via the Internet,

1080
01:12:50.041 --> 01:12:54.210
but it's the same thing you will see deducted from your paycheck.

1081
01:12:54.570 --> 01:12:58.220
And you already have seen this.
It says Fica and then there's a certain amount,

1082
01:12:58.221 --> 01:13:02.400
it's a certain percentage of your paycheck and the employer matches just like in

1083
01:13:02.401 --> 01:13:03.840
Germany in 1889.

1084
01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:08.400
And when you retire that you can actually get it now electronically,

1085
01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:12.420
your entire employment history,
all your contributions.

1086
01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:14.640
And when you retire,
there's a formula.

1087
01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:17.220
You can find it on the social security system website,

1088
01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:20.670
which resembles the formula that they did in 1889.

1089
01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:25.230
So we're still doing the same thing.
Now,

1090
01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:30.020
this invention of social security is well over a hundred years old.
Uh,

1091
01:13:30.210 --> 01:13:34.050
but I think that because of the rapid advance of information technology,

1092
01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:37.740
we're going to see a lot more progress over your lifetime.

1093
01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:39.900
There's going to be a lot more inventions like this.

1094
01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:44.850
And so that's why I think finance will be an interesting field.
And it's,
uh,

1095
01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.050
it's,
uh,
for you,
for those of you who choose to go into.
Now finally,

1096
01:13:49.051 --> 01:13:54.051
I just want to say next lecture is January 28 a and we're going to talk about

1097
01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.400
portfolio diversification,

1098
01:13:56.610 --> 01:14:01.610
which is one very important application of the fundamental principle of risk

1099
01:14:01.861 --> 01:14:06.030
management,
uh,
but as applied to securities.
And it's,

1100
01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:09.600
it's more narrow than my very broad discussion.
It's not public finance,

1101
01:14:09.601 --> 01:14:11.440
it's not insurance,
but it's,

1102
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:16.150
it's one of the most important fundamental theories that underlies finance.

1103
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:19.620
And then you have a problem set,
which is do a,

1104
01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.670
on that day is what your first problem set.

1105
01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.860
And the problem set is up on the website.

1106
01:14:23.861 --> 01:14:27.550
So if you go up to classes Vitu and you click on problem sets,

1107
01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:31.570
it's problems that number one,
uh,
we're also going to,
uh,

1108
01:14:31.810 --> 01:14:34.330
I'm going to email you about review sections.

1109
01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:38.770
And so our first review section will be in the week of January with your

1110
01:14:38.771 --> 01:14:39.161
teaching.

1111
01:14:39.161 --> 01:14:43.600
Fellows will be in the week of January 28th and we're going to have to ask you

1112
01:14:43.601 --> 01:14:48.020
to sign up with one of the teaching fellows,
uh,
and,
uh,

1113
01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:52.180
we'll give you times and dates when the,
uh,
sections occur.

1114
01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.190
I'll see you on January 28.
