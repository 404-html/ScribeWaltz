1
00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.130
This is,
as I said,
my last lecture for this course,

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.070
and I'm entitling this lecture,
uh,

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.370
the democratization of finance.
Uh,

4
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.430
I wanted to save this to the end because it's really about looking at the broad

5
00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:22.160
purpose of,
of our financial markets and our financial institutions.

6
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.080
Um,
and ultimately the,
there's only one purpose,
uh,

7
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.520
to all of us.
And that's human welfare.
Uh,
it's people,

8
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.860
and this should be obvious,
but,
uh,
let's not forget that,

9
00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:37.743
uh,

10
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.970
corporations exist only for the benefit of people.

11
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.930
Normally we say for their owners,
but we could also add other stakeholders,

12
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.490
but it's people,

13
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:54.491
individual people that matter and only lets you want to add animals.

14
00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.500
But we have nonprofits that are aimed at animal welfare as well,

15
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.800
so including them.
Um,
so,
uh,
uh,

16
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.500
I've made it a theme of my recent books that finance is a powerful tool for

17
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:17.060
improving human welfare.
Um,
and,
uh,
in my,

18
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.490
uh,
latest two books,

19
00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:24.200
I emphasize what I call the democratization of finance.

20
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.230
Maybe I should write this down because it's a term that I like to use.

21
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.920
Um,
democratization

22
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.940
of finance.
Uh,

23
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.850
or you can say for short financial democracy,
but I mean,

24
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:46.640
something a little different.
Uh,
in the 1930s,

25
00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:50.220
people talked about financial democracy as,
um,

26
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.190
the shareholders,

27
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.060
shareholders voting for the direction of a corporation.

28
00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.600
I don't mean by that,
by democratization of finance.

29
00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:04.320
I mean bringing it to the people.
Uh,
so that,

30
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.150
uh,
Deimos,
uh,

31
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.410
there's been a long trend towards a democratization of finance that goes back

32
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.400
centuries.
And that is,
uh,

33
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.510
it originally financial techniques where we're of a value only to the very rich

34
00:02:28.341 --> 00:02:32.240
are the very sophisticated.
Um,
in

35
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.330
1780,

36
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.850
the president of Harvard College had his paycheck.

37
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.900
I think it was president of Lamont indexed to inflation.

38
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.050
Uh,
I've been trying to figure out if anyone else in the world had ever had a CPI

39
00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:54.880
index labor contract.
Uh,
and I,

40
00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.320
I've not been able to discover any other example that was 1780.

41
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.780
So there was one person in the world who had an inflation index,
uh,

42
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.420
uh,
uh,
employment contract and funny,
who was it?
It was the president of Harford.

43
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.010
And so not the random person.
Um,

44
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.700
but as time goes by,
we have more and more spread of these concepts.

45
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.810
And,
uh,
so I make it as a mission and,
uh,

46
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.650
in two of my books,
new financial earner,

47
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.360
which is on reserve and my new book,
which I'm right here,

48
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.990
sub prime solution,
uh,

49
00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.500
which is not unreasonable because I haven't finished it yet,
but it will be out.

50
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.510
Uh,
and it will be sometime this summer.
It will be available in bookstores.

51
00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.180
And apparently,
uh,
well,
uh,
so the theme is that

52
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.280
in both of these books is that a lot of our problems can be solved by,

53
00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:59.243
um,

54
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.410
by ex extent continuing this trend towards,
uh,

55
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.510
democratization of finance.
So,
uh,

56
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.890
we have problems with inequality.

57
00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.070
Economic inequality

58
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.040
is,

59
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.040
I think probably the most important issue facing advanced countries today.

60
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.120
And that is that,
uh,

61
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.930
we are not sharing income equally.

62
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.400
There are a remarkable number of poor people,

63
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.340
uh,
and a small,

64
00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:42.660
very elite group who are making hundreds of millions of dollars.

65
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.740
And in most countries of the world,

66
00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.500
inequality is getting worse.

67
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.370
This applies both to the advanced countries like the United States and to the

68
00:04:55.561 --> 00:04:58.020
emerging countries.
Like China and India

69
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.750
is not altogether bad because part of the reason inequality is getting worse is

70
00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:09.420
that there are suddenly getting rich people.
And,
uh,
if,
uh,

71
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.750
if everyone's getting better off,
you could say what's the problem?

72
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.590
In many ways that is the,
uh,
the right answer.

73
00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:24.240
But I think that we can't tolerate excessive inequality.

74
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.340
The beauty of it is that the very same capitalism that has been generating

75
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.060
inequality has solutions for it.
Uh,

76
00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.090
and many of our venerable economic institutions that we already have are working

77
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.630
against any quality.
So,
uh,

78
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.010
I mentioned just for example,
life insurance

79
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.920
that helps alleviate any quality by eliminating one important cause of

80
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.613
inequality.

81
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.180
A lot of poor people traditionally are people who've lost a families that have

82
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:05.990
lost one of the two parents,
uh,
either the mother or the father.

83
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.440
And of course that puts the family in stress because they have just lost half of

84
00:06:12.351 --> 00:06:14.540
their,
uh,
adults.
Uh,

85
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:18.910
if you have life insurance that solves that,
um,

86
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.830
another source of inequality is solved by health insurance.

87
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.430
An important cause of inequality is somebody gets sick.

88
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.420
Uh,
and,
um,
so they,

89
00:06:34.421 --> 00:06:39.020
they are unable to earn an income and they end up in disastrous economic

90
00:06:39.021 --> 00:06:43.820
situation.
Another one is disability insurance.

91
00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.153
<v 1>Okay.</v>

92
00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.060
<v 0>Disability insurance protects you against something like,
uh,</v>

93
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:58.610
an accident that causes you to become unable to hold a job.

94
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.370
And,
uh,
that tends to be a lifetime thing.

95
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.790
Disability insurance is a lifetime insurance contract.

96
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.750
You pay for it while you're healthy.
If you become disabled,

97
00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.160
you get,
uh,
support for the rest of your life.

98
00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:20.520
So these are just some examples of how inequality is already being dealt with

99
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.650
through risk management institutions and why?
Uh,
uh,

100
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.730
finance,
I always lump insurance.
These are all insurance,

101
00:07:29.731 --> 00:07:32.810
but I lump that in with finance says risk management and why they're so

102
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:33.644
important.

103
00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.750
<v 2>Um,
but,
uh,</v>

104
00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.060
<v 0>we still see any quality getting worse.</v>

105
00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:45.210
And so I think that is a challenge toward improving our risk management

106
00:07:46.581 --> 00:07:47.414
institutions.

107
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:53.050
The subprime crisis that we're in now is really substantially due to failures of

108
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:59.490
our risk management institutions.
Uh,
notably,
well,

109
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.600
we have had a failure to provide institutions to help people to diversify their

110
00:08:04.701 --> 00:08:09.640
own household portfolios.
So people who,
um,
uh,

111
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:14.330
bought a house would have been in a highly leveraged position,
uh,

112
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.213
and,
uh,

113
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.640
vulnerable to risks of changes in home prices and the other risks.

114
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.190
<v 2>So,
um,
uh,</v>

115
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:30.150
<v 0>so we need to go a lot further.
Now,</v>

116
00:08:30.151 --> 00:08:34.800
part of this theme of democratization of finance is that right?

117
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.400
Um,
we have to pay respect to behavioral finance.

118
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:47.530
Uh,
and that's because people don't,
uh,

119
00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.020
especially the less educated or less capable people.
Don't always,
yeah.

120
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:56.730
Make optimal use of financial instruments,
uh,
like,

121
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.280
uh,
for example,
insurance.
Uh,

122
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.030
<v 2>so,
um,</v>

123
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.170
<v 0>if people don't make use of,
of risk management contracts,
then,</v>

124
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:10.640
uh,
we have a problem.

125
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.120
So what we have to do going forward in the future is designed our risk

126
00:09:16.311 --> 00:09:20.690
management contracts to work better for real people.
All right?

127
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.720
And so that requires a,
what they call in the engineering department,

128
00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:29.950
human factors
engineering.

129
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.820
But I'll add financial,

130
00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.930
financial engineering as a term,

131
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:45.100
sometimes used in a disparaging term for people who invent things that are just

132
00:09:45.101 --> 00:09:46.270
a bit too complicated.

133
00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:51.660
But usually the word financial engineering is used approvingly to refer to

134
00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:57.370
people's efforts to make finance work.
Uh,
even better than before,

135
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.620
uh,
to make progress in our financial institution.
So one of the themes of my,

136
00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.530
of the,
of this book and this book is that,

137
00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.470
<v 2>uh,
uh,</v>

138
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:11.990
<v 0>we have a lot of progress to be made and,</v>

139
00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:17.140
but I think it has to be taking account of our better or a better financial

140
00:10:19.371 --> 00:10:23.810
institutions,
uh,
knowledge of financial theory and behavior.

141
00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.260
So what I wanted to talk about actually w this lecture,

142
00:10:27.261 --> 00:10:30.590
I have several parts that I wanted to talk first about,
um,

143
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:36.500
about social insurance,
which is not normally covered in a finance course,

144
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.620
but it seems to be so relevant that I want to talk about it.

145
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.170
Social insurance refers to government programs,
uh,

146
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.200
that insure people against risk.
Uh,

147
00:10:48.201 --> 00:10:52.400
and so I wanted to talk about the extremely important risk management programs

148
00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:56.750
that the government has instituted a talk,

149
00:10:56.751 --> 00:11:01.751
especially about bankruptcy and bailouts because they're relevant right now,

150
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.960
particularly relevant right now with the subprime crisis.
Um,

151
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.110
and then I wanted to conclude this lecture with,
uh,

152
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.043
uh,

153
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:18.280
some thoughts about financial careers and about morality.

154
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.380
Um,
I wanted to,
I talked about that in the first lecture.

155
00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.940
Maybe I should have talked more consistently about it,
but,
um,

156
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:31.510
young people are thinking about careers and I think that ultimately I give you

157
00:11:33.561 --> 00:11:37.970
credit for wondering about the moral purpose of different careers.

158
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:43.160
I think finance has a somewhat tarnished reputation,
uh,

159
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.270
but I think that's really miss,
uh,
undeserved,

160
00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.650
<v 2>uh,
um,</v>

161
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.580
<v 0>I guess people finance get into controversial</v>

162
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:55.960
<v 1>positions,
uh,</v>

163
00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.860
more so than people who are in other occupations that don't put them in these

164
00:11:59.861 --> 00:12:04.480
moral dilemmas.
And sometimes they can behave badly.
Uh,

165
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.400
but,
uh,
I don't actually claim to have answers.

166
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.680
You should take a philosophy course,
however,

167
00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.280
won't give you answers to all these ethical questions.

168
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:19.600
But what I want to do is at least a raise them and

169
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:23.560
think a little bit about,
uh,

170
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:27.750
<v 0>how they relate to this course.</v>

171
00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:30.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

172
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:34.640
<v 0>So the first principle of,
uh,
of,
um,</v>

173
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:38.490
I want to come back now to what I said I would talk about namely the role of the

174
00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:43.140
government and risk management.
Uh,
uh,

175
00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:50.320
and I think it would be a mistake to ignore this because,
uh,

176
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.240
David Moss who is actually,
uh,

177
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.760
got his phd in history from Yale and I talked to him when he was still here.

178
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:05.220
You want a book,
uh,
when all else fails.

179
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.943
<v 1>Yes.</v>

180
00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:14.100
<v 0>And it was a history of risk management in the u s uh,</v>

181
00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:18.240
this is about 10 years ago.
This book came,
or eight years,
I forget exactly,

182
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.000
sometime in the last decade.
Um,

183
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.620
and he makes the argument that really every government,
he,
he's,

184
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.000
he focuses on the u s but every government has a risk management role and much

185
00:13:30.001 --> 00:13:33.190
of what governments do is to,
uh,

186
00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:38.730
is to do risk management,
uh,
especially modern governments.

187
00:13:38.731 --> 00:13:43.170
That wasn't maybe true so much,
uh,
before,
uh,

188
00:13:43.171 --> 00:13:45.360
before the end of the 19th century.

189
00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:50.460
But governments have gotten an increasingly and,
uh,
into risk management.

190
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.510
The first,
um,
uh,

191
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:58.230
example I would give is the progressive income tax

192
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:09.670
or graduated a graduated income tax as it was called by Adam Smith

193
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:16.820
in 1776.
And his book,
the wealth of nations.

194
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.420
He said that maybe we should have a tax on income and the tax on income should

195
00:14:23.001 --> 00:14:26.510
be graduated so that people with higher incomes pay a higher fraction of their

196
00:14:26.511 --> 00:14:31.280
income and that would help reduce inequality.
Um,
but Smith,

197
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:35.480
although he raised it in that famous book in 1776,

198
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:40.190
he then quickly dismissed it as unworkable because he said if we had an income

199
00:14:40.191 --> 00:14:44.240
tax,
it would be quote,
a tax on conscience,

200
00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:50.240
meaning that only the honest people would pay it because it was impossible to

201
00:14:50.241 --> 00:14:52.760
verify any income.
Uh,

202
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:58.020
income is too complicated to measure.
Uh,
uh,

203
00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:02.990
so,
uh,
maybe he was right.
The first income tax,
uh,
it was either

204
00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.680
the UK or Holland,
um,

205
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.410
around,
uh,
at the end of the 18th century,

206
00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:19.160
uh,
they had small income taxes and they were,
they were progressive.

207
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.830
Uh,
but they were beginning,

208
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:26.810
the u s experimented with an income tax in the 1860s,

209
00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:32.060
uh,
and abandoned it.
The original experiments where all,

210
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.090
I'm only marginally successful,

211
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.960
but the u s finally got an income tax in 1913,

212
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.950
uh,
and at a very low level,
but,
uh,

213
00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:50.990
this is the u s uh,
it ultimately became very important.

214
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:55.250
It,
uh,
after a World War II,

215
00:15:55.251 --> 00:15:59.150
the top marginal tax bracket right rose above 90%.

216
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.380
So it became a very significant redistributor of income.

217
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:08.360
And ultimately it's gone way back down.
Now we've reversed it.
Uh,

218
00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:13.160
but ultimately it,
it's a risk management device.
What it means is that,

219
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:16.520
uh,
if,
uh,
if you do very poorly,

220
00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:20.450
you don't pay any taxes and you get benefits,
uh,
and,
um,

221
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.750
uh,
we also,
I might add to it,

222
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:27.440
we have a progressive income tax that finances

223
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.160
education for everyone,

224
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:37.330
universal education and other social services and public goods.

225
00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.820
Okay.
So,
uh,

226
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:47.480
so that is a risk management device and it works despite limitations of human

227
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:52.700
behavior because
it's automatic.

228
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:56.060
It's imposed on you so nobody can forget about it.

229
00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.960
It becomes a universal risk management device.
In some sense.

230
00:16:59.961 --> 00:17:04.310
It's the most important risk management device of all because it deals at the

231
00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:09.070
very low level.
Uh,
starting in around that,
uh,

232
00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:10.783
uh,

233
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.880
well I guess you could go back to Milton Friedman who was a conservative

234
00:17:16.431 --> 00:17:21.431
economist who started advocating a negative income tax in the 1940s,

235
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.860
but he actually,
um,
in his 1963 bucks

236
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.980
a capitalism and freedom,

237
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.800
the advocated at more strong,

238
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:38.830
that's the usual source that we should have a negative tax on low income people

239
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:46.100
to bring their income up to a,
uh,
a good substantial level.

240
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:50.830
So,
uh,
that was the negative income tax.
Uh,

241
00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:56.880
and it sounded like a very,
uh,
negative tax on low income.

242
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.140
It sounded like a very,
uh,
controversial,
uh,

243
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.880
crazy idea when he launched it.

244
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:07.410
But crazy ideas have a way of eventually becoming standard.

245
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.280
Uh,
and the United States,
uh,

246
00:18:11.281 --> 00:18:14.910
adopted and it is now fairly significant,

247
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.820
something called the earned income tax credit,

248
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.760
which is a negative income tax for low income families.

249
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:29.430
So,
uh,
emerged from thinking.
So

250
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.920
e I t c earned income tax credit.

251
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:39.930
If you are a family with children,
uh,
with income very low,

252
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:45.150
um,
like under 10,000,
you'll get a substantial negative tax.

253
00:18:45.151 --> 00:18:49.200
It's several thousand dollars.
Um,
and that is risk management.

254
00:18:49.201 --> 00:18:53.970
It means that anybody who's income falls below a very low is a,

255
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.790
it's kind of like an income insurance scheme run by the government.

256
00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:03.870
Um,
the concern about all of these schemes,
however,
its moral hazard,

257
00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.830
uh,
and,

258
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:14.040
uh,
if you have an earned income tax credit,
uh,
it,

259
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.840
it's kind of designed around moral hazard.
Uh,
instead of having welfare,

260
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.640
welfare is a,
uh,
is a less,

261
00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.500
that's just a gift to someone who doesn't have any job at all,
who has no income.

262
00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.580
Then that moral welfare,
uh,

263
00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:37.350
tends to lead to a moral hazard problem.
If the government says,

264
00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:41.670
if you don't have a job,
we'll support you.
That encourages people to say,
okay,

265
00:19:41.671 --> 00:19:43.740
I don't have a job.
Uh,

266
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:49.310
but the earned income tax credit is different because it's a negative tax rate

267
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:54.660
on your income.
So you have to have income in order to get anything.

268
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.250
So you have to get a job to get the EITC,
and the more you earn,

269
00:19:59.251 --> 00:20:02.880
the more he ITC up to a limit for low levels of income,

270
00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:08.250
the more negative tax you get.
So,
uh,

271
00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.840
it's the thing that we're doing.

272
00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:14.790
What we're doing as time goes by as we're getting a clearer picture of how to,

273
00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:18.480
uh,
design risk management contacts,

274
00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.070
contracts for the general public.
Uh,
so,
uh,

275
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.160
the ITC was invented in the 70s.

276
00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:31.380
It was in the U S it was sponsored by Senator Russell Long and it is now being

277
00:20:31.381 --> 00:20:34.800
copied around the world,
although I guess there were earlier antecedents,

278
00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:38.610
but at the urs was the first country to do a AITC.

279
00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:40.703
Uh,

280
00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:45.990
the other I wanted just to remind you of the different kinds of risk management

281
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:50.680
that the government,
um,
and one important,

282
00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:52.093
uh,

283
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:56.710
ask one important part of it is social security.

284
00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:58.653
Uh,

285
00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:04.300
I want to go back to the original social security system.

286
00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:05.410
Uh,

287
00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:10.410
and it was in Germany that under Otto von Bismarck that the first social

288
00:21:12.101 --> 00:21:15.700
security systems were developed,
uh,

289
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:21.100
and it was considered a highly radical idea in the 1880s.

290
00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:26.110
When I put this down in German in case some of you,
um,

291
00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:31.420
can,
can understand this.
Uh,
18,
83,

292
00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:39.730
fracking,
physical wrong,
that's one word,
but I've run out of room.

293
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:46.210
Health insurance was founded nationally in Germany.

294
00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:50.320
It was a government mandatory program.

295
00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:55.390
Everybody in Germany had to contribute to health insurance.

296
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.520
Uh,
I'll write this over.
German words are very long.

297
00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:04.380
They run them together and I ran out of room to write Cronk and visit her wrong.

298
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.770
Um,
in,
uh,
um,

299
00:22:09.490 --> 00:22:10.930
he teen 84

300
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:18.660
one fall fairs echo wrong one means accident like a fall

301
00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:25.490
for Zika.
Wrong means insurance.

302
00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:31.060
The government created an accident referring to workplace accident insurance.

303
00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:35.420
Uh,
and it was the German government had it.
Uh,

304
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:41.200
it was an arrangement that made it mandatory for employers to buy insurance

305
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:48.050
against injuries to people who work there.
Uh,

306
00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.630
and then three,
um,
uh,

307
00:22:55.310 --> 00:23:00.310
they had an 1889 tears for a zipper on it.

308
00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:06.470
This isn't supposed to be a German lesson and I can get it right,
right.

309
00:23:06.471 --> 00:23:08.240
It right.
I,

310
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:12.770
but I like to put it this way because it suggested its origin.

311
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.790
This was old age insurance.
Altera means old.

312
00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.790
Uh,
and so,
um,

313
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.900
old age insurance was generated for the whole country of Germany.

314
00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:25.760
And at this point in 1889,

315
00:23:25.761 --> 00:23:29.180
Germany was the only country to have a social insurance program.

316
00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.990
So around shortly after the turn of the century,
Lloyd George,

317
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:37.970
who was prime minister of the UK,
traveled to Germany and,

318
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:43.580
uh,
was looked at their system and it was very much impressed and thought.

319
00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:45.740
He said one thing I noticed,
Germany,

320
00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:49.460
there are no beggars normally in London.

321
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.820
You couldn't walk down the street without seeing somebody who was sitting there

322
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:57.190
holding out a Tin Cup who had no legs or,
or,
uh,

323
00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:02.330
our mothers with children who are orphans.
And,
uh,
uh,
and he said,

324
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:07.310
it's gone in Germany.
So he was,
became convinced that UK should follow the lead.

325
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:12.050
This was copied over the whole world,
and it's virtually everywhere now.

326
00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.440
I mean,
some less developed countries haven't gotten there yet,

327
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:20.210
but this is where they're going.
Uh,
and,
uh,

328
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.550
I wanted to quote Gustaf smaller,

329
00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:27.230
who is a German economist in the 1880s,

330
00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:32.270
uh,
smaller,
uh,

331
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:37.190
in the early 20th century.
He wrote some memoirs,
uh,

332
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.450
and uh,
about his life and the life of other economists in Germany.

333
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:46.970
And he said the triumph of insurance in every imaginable area era,
I,
sorry,

334
00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:51.320
area was one of the centuries,
meaning the 19th centuries,

335
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.780
great advances in social progress.

336
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.080
It was an entirely logical development that insurance spread from the upper

337
00:24:59.271 --> 00:25:04.010
classes to the lower classes that had had to attempt as far as possible to

338
00:25:04.011 --> 00:25:05.180
eliminate poverty.

339
00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:09.860
And that the older charitable relief funds for the workers were more and more

340
00:25:09.861 --> 00:25:12.800
constructed on the sound principle of insurance.

341
00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:17.300
The problem with charity is that it tends to be whimsical and capricious.

342
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:22.720
If you're relying on charity to resolve problems of poverty,

343
00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:28.670
it's going to be applied very unevenly.
Uh,
and uh,
it,

344
00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.120
it would be salient examples of poverty.

345
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:37.190
Like if a child is suddenly stricken with some unusual illness and it gets

346
00:25:37.191 --> 00:25:38.540
written up in the newspapers,

347
00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:42.650
then generous contributions would come pouring in to that child.

348
00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:47.930
But other children who are not so blessed,
uh,
get nothing,

349
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:52.580
uh,
in the United States,
uh,

350
00:25:52.581 --> 00:25:57.581
we were about the last country to jump onto the bandwagon began in Germany.

351
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:03.290
Uh,
it's partly,
I guess because the U s is more free enterprise,
uh,

352
00:26:03.291 --> 00:26:08.060
and its orientation.
Maybe it doesn't like to adopt ideas from Europe.
Uh,

353
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:12.290
it wasn't until the Great Depression that the u s adopted,

354
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.030
uh,
Alterra is physic around.
Uh,

355
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:21.360
and we still haven't adopted Karkin for his or her.

356
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.690
We still don't have a national health insurance.
We have Medicare and Medicaid,

357
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:28.700
but they don't apply to everyone.

358
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:33.730
So we have about 40 million uninsured Americans with no health insurance.

359
00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:38.170
So we're still not there yet.
Maybe we'll get there.
Um,

360
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:42.320
but I wanted to talk about some of the,
uh,
important,
uh,

361
00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.250
is that,
um,
uh,

362
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.140
so the social security system

363
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:57.060
in the u s is our copy of the German system.
Uh,
and,

364
00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:01.710
uh,
social security started in 1935,

365
00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:07.090
so that was about 50 years after the Germans invented.
Uh,

366
00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:11.100
and it's remarkable how similar the idea that we've done it and it,

367
00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:12.203
and it stays.

368
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:16.590
We really have something like the 1889 German system in place today.

369
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:21.300
What it,
what it did is it created a system of contributions,
uh,

370
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:25.590
to this right now.
Uh,
when you get a job,

371
00:27:25.591 --> 00:27:30.210
you have to pay 6.2%.
Uh,
uh,

372
00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.340
that's on your pay stub.

373
00:27:32.341 --> 00:27:36.450
6.2% is taken out as your contribution to social security.

374
00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:41.370
Uh,
and then your employer pays another 6.2.

375
00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:46.590
So 12.4% of your income goes to social security.

376
00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:51.390
And those are thought of as contributions to an insurance scheme for your,

377
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:56.430
it has three components.
It's called o as the actually

378
00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:03.360
oh a stands for old age.
A,

379
00:28:03.390 --> 00:28:06.120
uh,
s stands for our survivors

380
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.280
and Dai sends for disability insurance,

381
00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:17.990
but they're all insurance.
So you are ma,

382
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:21.450
it's mandatory.
You are paying a lot into this system.

383
00:28:21.451 --> 00:28:26.100
You're paying the fact that your employer pays half of it is perhaps misleading.

384
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:31.050
So it's really like 12% of your income is forced to go into an insurance gift.

385
00:28:31.051 --> 00:28:35.010
That's big.
Now that there's a cutoff though,
after you reached,

386
00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:40.170
I think it's around 95,000,
uh,
you don't have to pay any more.

387
00:28:40.171 --> 00:28:44.250
But for most people it's 12% of their income is going to social security.

388
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.930
And what do they get for it?

389
00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.580
They get a pension when they're old and it's guaranteed for the rest of your

390
00:28:50.581 --> 00:28:51.414
life.

391
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.350
And these other things a lot of people don't even know about you don't even know

392
00:28:55.351 --> 00:28:59.160
that you've got the survivor's insurance is a life insurance program.

393
00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:04.490
This was actually added in 1939 two with amendments.

394
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:07.260
I guess maybe disability was added at that time too.

395
00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:12.600
What it means is if you are a under a certain age,
I think it's 18,

396
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:17.860
if your parents die,
the government will give,
will a or one of your parents dies,

397
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:22.110
a government will pay money to the family to support you.

398
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:25.140
It's life insurance offered by the government.

399
00:29:25.141 --> 00:29:27.600
And why did the government get into this?
Well,

400
00:29:27.601 --> 00:29:30.970
the problem was it's behavioral finance again,
that uh,

401
00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:35.100
while wealthy people tended to get life insurance,

402
00:29:35.101 --> 00:29:38.630
the general mass of people were not,
uh,

403
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:41.040
because of some behavioral problem.
They just didn't,

404
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:45.730
the value of it didn't understand it.
Disability insurance means that if you're,

405
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:50.230
if you work and you have an accident and then you can no longer work,

406
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.270
you start collecting social security.

407
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:57.370
Normally you don't get the old age until the age of 62 or 65.

408
00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:58.600
Um,

409
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:03.190
but a disability you can get at any age if you become disabled.

410
00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:07.540
You know,
it's funny that I think a lot of people don't even know they have this.

411
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:12.130
These institutions operate so quietly.
Partly the government,

412
00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:14.410
they call this survivor's insurance.

413
00:30:14.411 --> 00:30:17.020
When they created it in 1939 I was wondering,

414
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:19.570
why don't they call it life insurance?
That's what it is.

415
00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:24.310
Life insurance is something that pays the survivors of a family member who dies.

416
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:28.830
I think they didn't want to call it life insurance because they didn't want to

417
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.870
threaten the industry.
There's a whole life insurance industry.

418
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:36.700
The government was going in a big way to create a product which is mandatory.

419
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:40.060
They didn't want to upset the life.
And so they called it something different.

420
00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.570
And you can get a life insurance salesman who will sell you life insurance and

421
00:30:43.571 --> 00:30:47.860
not even mention that you've got a policy already,
whether you want it or not.

422
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:51.460
Uh,
they would just be offering something to add to the,

423
00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:55.990
uh,
what,
what uh,

424
00:30:55.991 --> 00:31:00.910
also they did starting in the 1930s,
um,
it was,
um,

425
00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:05.060
uh,
was originally called,
uh,

426
00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:10.120
aid to dependent children or they change it to aid to families

427
00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:17.320
with dependent children.
That was a separate program beyond,

428
00:31:17.321 --> 00:31:21.610
these parents didn't have to be,
uh,

429
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:26.260
didn't have to be disabled and uh,
or old or anything like that to get this.
Um,

430
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.410
uh,
and so that started in 1935.

431
00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:35.500
That's our welfare system.
It was a for parents that couldn't earn enough money.

432
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:39.440
You know,
if you have a mother,
a single mother with no husband,
uh,

433
00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:43.720
and the husband or the husband just can't make any money,
uh,

434
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:49.520
she would get aid for herself and the children,
um,

435
00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:54.280
that however,
was abolished in 1996,

436
00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:58.450
uh,
because of moral hazard,
the,
uh,

437
00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:03.510
the aid to families with dependent children was created in 1935 with little,

438
00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:05.740
uh,

439
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:10.690
attention to the amount of moral hazard it might eventually create.

440
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.050
Uh,
and so,
uh,

441
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:19.060
we there grew a increasing problem of welfare dependency.

442
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:23.510
Uh,
you would have families that had lived on,
uh,

443
00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:27.540
AFTC their whole lives and their grandfather parent's lives and their

444
00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:31.060
grandparents lives.
Uh,
and so,
uh,

445
00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.100
public opinion turned against that.

446
00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:38.580
And so it was in 1996 a and we had a,

447
00:32:39.471 --> 00:32:44.120
a welfare reform act,
uh,
that abolished AFDC.

448
00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.840
Um,
it was a republican bill,
uh,

449
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:53.600
but it was signed by the Democratic president,
Carter Clinton.

450
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:56.443
So

451
00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:00.900
that eliminated a federal,

452
00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:05.920
whether essentially they ended the welfare program started in the depression.

453
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:11.750
Um,
there they are,
there still is some welfare,

454
00:33:11.751 --> 00:33:13.850
but there's a lifetime,
five year limit

455
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:22.520
on an actual welfare.
So after you've been collecting it for five years,

456
00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:23.900
you are disqualified.

457
00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:30.140
And it denied welfare to immigrants who are not citizens.
Uh,
and it,

458
00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:34.310
uh,
limited,
uh,
food stamps to unemployed childless adults.

459
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.850
Uh,
so it,
uh,

460
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.970
I think there's a there as we move ahead.
Uh,

461
00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:48.360
we're becoming increasingly aware of how to design a institutions around human

462
00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:54.350
glitches.
And so the welfare reform act,
I don't know if it was the right policy,

463
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.900
but it was trying to eliminate a moral hazard problem.
Um,

464
00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:01.130
so we have,
instead of,

465
00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:06.160
we've replaced the aid to families with dependent children with a more generous

466
00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:11.450
AITC and you see that it has very different moral hazard implications to get

467
00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.460
earned income tax credit.

468
00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.930
You've got to have a job and it can't just be a token job because you don't,

469
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.830
it's,
it has the negative tactics as a function of your income.

470
00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:26.990
I take this as signs of past progress that that will,
um,

471
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.300
that will continue in the future.
Um,

472
00:34:31.910 --> 00:34:36.910
so I wanted to talk about bankruptcy briefly here because that is something

473
00:34:37.281 --> 00:34:37.941
that's,
uh,

474
00:34:37.941 --> 00:34:42.941
I mentioned is a very important risk management device,

475
00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:44.253
uh,

476
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:49.040
and its relevance right now in time of financial crises.

477
00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:50.630
So,
uh,

478
00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:56.770
the United States did not have a bankruptcy law at the federal level,

479
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.060
uh,
generally until 1,898.

480
00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.000
But during the 19th century,

481
00:35:05.001 --> 00:35:09.000
there were repeated financial crises that,
uh,

482
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.150
led to temporary bankruptcy laws.

483
00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.090
What happened was like what we're seeing right now,

484
00:35:14.091 --> 00:35:18.830
there was some financial crisis and it caused people to lose their jobs,
uh,

485
00:35:18.831 --> 00:35:21.870
for no fault of their own and they couldn't pay their debts.
Uh,

486
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.850
and laws back then were often very harsh and it would send people to debtor's

487
00:35:25.851 --> 00:35:30.110
prison.
But,
uh,
I think the enlightened view gradually developed,

488
00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:35.090
this is crazy.
You know,
some person is,
is trying hard,

489
00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:39.360
there's a big financial crisis,
makes bad investments,
uh,

490
00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:44.430
then it can't pay debts and we put this guy in jail.
Uh,
that's crazy.

491
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:48.900
In fact,
there should be some other,
um,
other method that,
uh,

492
00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.520
that deals better with bankruptcy.
So,
um,

493
00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:58.110
uh,
it was,
uh,
uh,

494
00:35:58.120 --> 00:36:01.140
there were numerous bankruptcy laws,
but,
uh,

495
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:05.730
normal was the 1841 law,
which for a temporary period gave,

496
00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.180
this is after a financial crisis,
gave a fresh start.

497
00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:15.050
They said someone declaring bankruptcy can wipe out all debts and not go to

498
00:36:16.411 --> 00:36:18.310
jail.
And uh,

499
00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.420
as long as they draw their wealth down to zero,

500
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.350
they could have a fresh start and go back to life.
Normally.

501
00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:29.730
That kind of idea has gradually been,
uh,
and it's now,

502
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.720
now it's a part of her general assumption about bankruptcies.

503
00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:38.223
Um,

504
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:43.000
I mentioned that 1898 was the landmark bankruptcy law.

505
00:36:43.001 --> 00:36:48.001
And this is the first time that we had bankruptcy in shrine as an institution

506
00:36:48.361 --> 00:36:51.750
that lasts all the time.
It's not just during financial crisis.

507
00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:56.580
You can at anytime declared bankruptcy as a way to protect yourself.

508
00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.920
Uh,
and uh,
there was another landmark.

509
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:05.220
This is a landmark bankruptcy law.
Uh,

510
00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:11.100
and there was another one in 1978,
uh,

511
00:37:11.101 --> 00:37:15.990
another landmark bankruptcy bill,
which made it even easier,

512
00:37:15.991 --> 00:37:20.940
much easier for people to declare bankruptcy.
Uh,
and as a result,

513
00:37:20.941 --> 00:37:22.830
especially after 1978,

514
00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:28.070
bankruptcies became very commonly used ways to manage extreme outcomes in one's

515
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:34.590
a finances.
And in fact,
recently since in 1978,

516
00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:38.280
uh,
there's,
uh,
typically over a million bankruptcies,

517
00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:40.290
personal bankruptcies a year.

518
00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.820
It's a little known fact that there are more bankruptcies than divorces.

519
00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:50.100
And you may wonder,
well,
how can that be?
I don't hear about bankruptcies.

520
00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:53.460
You hear about divorces all the time.
Uh,

521
00:37:53.461 --> 00:37:56.910
I think the reason that you don't hear about bankruptcies is that nobody needs

522
00:37:56.911 --> 00:38:00.620
to tell you.
You know,
you don't come across saying,
Hey,
you know what?

523
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:05.640
He asked someone what's new?
Oh,
I just declared bankruptcy.
They don't do that.

524
00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.400
They don't do that about divorces either.

525
00:38:08.401 --> 00:38:10.950
But the problem with divorces as they can't cover it up,

526
00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:15.420
everybody knows you've gotten a divorce.
So we hear a lot more about them.

527
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:18.210
But bankruptcies are,
are very important.

528
00:38:19.530 --> 00:38:21.440
The other bill that,
uh,

529
00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.570
is very important as 2005

530
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:30.720
and that reverses some of the 1978 a bill.

531
00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:36.670
So,
uh,
we've been pulling back maybe in 1978 was too generous,

532
00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.870
but I just wanted to give you some clue about,
uh,

533
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:45.970
about what bankruptcy is there.
If you,

534
00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:51.540
there's three important kinds of bankruptcy and they refer to chapters of the

535
00:38:51.701 --> 00:38:55.540
United States code.
There's chapter seven bankruptcy.

536
00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:01.670
You should know this because half of you are going to declare bankruptcy
someday.

537
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.860
No,
maybe not.

538
00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:07.600
We hope that you get an education in finance and few of you will declare

539
00:39:07.601 --> 00:39:11.950
bankruptcy,
but some of you are going to be going through this,

540
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.420
uh,

541
00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:18.420
chapter 11 and chapter 13.

542
00:39:21.220 --> 00:39:25.570
So just so you are now,
uh,
in advance before you actually do those.

543
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.823
Um,

544
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:32.190
chapter seven is a liquidation form.

545
00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:38.410
And this is where you say this is that this is a fresh start.
And Story.

546
00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:42.910
You give up everything you have to your creditors,

547
00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:48.100
the bankruptcy court will divide it up among,
um,
among the creditors.

548
00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:51.190
And then you have a fresh start,
a,

549
00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:55.750
it used to be in 1978.
You could do this every six years,

550
00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:00.730
but as I remember it,
2005 thought 1978 was too lenient,

551
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:04.800
so they moved it to every eight years.
Uh,

552
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.900
so that's what you can do.
Uh,
if you are in big trouble,

553
00:40:10.901 --> 00:40:13.240
you've gotten in more depth than you can handle.

554
00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:17.440
What you have to do is go to a lawyer and file for bankruptcy.

555
00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:22.890
And a chapter seven is often the favorite thing because it gives you a fresh

556
00:40:22.901 --> 00:40:25.210
start.
Uh,
however,

557
00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:31.080
the 2005 law said that you can't do as an individual,

558
00:40:31.661 --> 00:40:36.661
you can't do chapter seven unless your income is below the median for your

559
00:40:36.881 --> 00:40:40.900
state.
So,
uh,
I guess you have to forget chapter seven,

560
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.370
I'm assuming that most of you will be making more than the median income for the

561
00:40:45.371 --> 00:40:48.400
state you live in.
So Cross chapter seven,

562
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.470
unless you were really in bad situation,

563
00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:55.960
a cross chapter seven or chapter seven is for chapter 11.

564
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:56.850
Uh,

565
00:40:56.850 --> 00:41:01.600
but companies can also do chapter seven chapter 11 is for companies,

566
00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:07.960
uh,
and it,
it's a reorganization rather than liquid.
It's a liquid liquidation.

567
00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.970
Uh,
and for companies that it's,

568
00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:16.230
it's a system to help them get back on their feet.
When you,

569
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:20.860
when a company files for chapter 11 bankruptcy,
what they're saying is,

570
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:22.780
hey,
we can't pay,

571
00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:26.740
we're out of money and we have all these people coming to us that we owe money

572
00:41:26.741 --> 00:41:30.640
to and we don't know who to pay first.
You know,
we just don't have enough money.

573
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.670
It becomes a disorderly process.
Uh,

574
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.770
and so they go to the court for protection.

575
00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:41.300
W when a company runs out of money and it can't pay its bills,

576
00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:46.070
then that can destroy the company immediately because people who were delivering

577
00:41:46.071 --> 00:41:49.720
things to the company that they need,
we'll stop delivering them.
They say,

578
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:51.860
I hear you're bankrupt.
You're not going to pay us.

579
00:41:51.861 --> 00:41:56.000
So we're going to stop delivering and that can destroy the company.

580
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:59.540
So the idea of chapter 11 is to keep the company going.

581
00:41:59.541 --> 00:42:04.400
So the court would impose some order and allow the company to continue in

582
00:42:04.401 --> 00:42:07.400
business and to hold off the creditors for now.

583
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:11.060
And it is ultimately in the creditor's interest if they,

584
00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:15.800
if the court does this because they're better off in getting their debts paid if

585
00:42:15.801 --> 00:42:17.270
the company is still making money.

586
00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:22.910
Chapter 13 is something like chapter 11,
as for individuals

587
00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:28.910
and chapter 13,
that's the one you're,
you're going to be filing,
put it that way.

588
00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:34.460
Some of you will be filing for chapter 13 bankruptcy.
Uh,
and what it is,

589
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:38.990
is that the court,
the bankruptcy court will,
uh,
adjust,

590
00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:43.050
make adjustments and a plan for you to pay off the debts.
Uh,

591
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:48.130
and this is what we hope to see happen in increasing number of cases during the

592
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:53.120
current crisis.
So somebody has taken out a big mortgage,
uh,

593
00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:58.180
they've taken out car loans and they were kind of profit yet and now there's a

594
00:42:58.581 --> 00:43:00.470
problem and they can't pay on all these.

595
00:43:00.471 --> 00:43:05.270
So they declare chapter 13 to get a lawyer to represent them and the court can

596
00:43:05.271 --> 00:43:09.440
adjust.
Um,
can adjust their debts.
Uh,

597
00:43:09.441 --> 00:43:10.790
but not to eliminate them.

598
00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:15.020
It says right now in federal bankruptcy law that they cannot adjust the mortgage

599
00:43:15.021 --> 00:43:17.060
on your house,
but they can adjust other debts.

600
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:19.370
This is something that we're talking about.

601
00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:23.510
The congress is talking about changing because the mortgage on the house is a

602
00:43:23.511 --> 00:43:28.370
big debt that,
uh,
that bankruptcy ought to be able to adjust.

603
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:32.900
It hasn't happened yet.
I wanted to mention something else,

604
00:43:32.901 --> 00:43:35.060
just so you understand what bankruptcy is.

605
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:38.270
There's something called informal bankruptcy.

606
00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:43.490
And what's the difference with bankruptcy?

607
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:49.800
A bankruptcy is for people who have enough foresight to hire a lawyer and go out

608
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:55.400
a year.
If,
you know,
if,
if you are having trouble paying your bills,

609
00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:59.840
you know enough to go and hire a lawyer and the lawyer might demand a little

610
00:43:59.841 --> 00:44:02.710
money up front,
you know,
there has to be paid.
So it,

611
00:44:02.711 --> 00:44:06.980
you should stop paying your bills and accumulate at least a thousand dollars.

612
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:11.360
So you can go to a lawyer and start chapter 13 bankruptcy proceedings.

613
00:44:12.090 --> 00:44:16.790
Uh,
but most,
a lot of people don't have the ability to save $1,000,

614
00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:20.750
uh,
or the,
you know,
the figure this out and they won't call a lawyer.

615
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:25.610
So what is it common thing somebody is running up too much in credit card bills,

616
00:44:25.611 --> 00:44:29.930
loses a job,
creditors start calling.
What do you think happens?

617
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:33.630
They don't get a lawyer.
That's what they do.

618
00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:38.430
They stop answering the phone.
All right,
very simple.

619
00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.290
I've run off all these debts.

620
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:43.980
The phone keeps ringing in these nasty people keep annoying me.

621
00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:47.840
So I just stopped using the,
in fact,
I let my whole phone bill lapsed.

622
00:44:47.841 --> 00:44:50.730
I don't pay my phone bill.
I don't even have a phone anymore,

623
00:44:50.910 --> 00:44:55.530
so no one can come and get the knock on my door and I don't answer the door.
Uh,

624
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:59.400
so what did the courts do?
What creditors do in the various states?

625
00:44:59.401 --> 00:45:02.220
They can go to a state court and uh,

626
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:07.230
appeal to the court to Garnish your salary and you don't have to do anything.

627
00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:11.800
You don't have to show up.
They go to,
they find out who your employer is,
they,

628
00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:12.450
they,

629
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:15.720
and then the state gives an order for the employer to take money out of your

630
00:45:15.721 --> 00:45:18.630
paycheck to help pay your debts.

631
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.180
You never even figured out what happened.
In fact,

632
00:45:21.181 --> 00:45:24.540
you might not even know it because you don't read your pay stub.

633
00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:29.170
And now some of your money is going to garnishment of your salary.
Uh,

634
00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:33.780
that's not,
uh,
that happens.
Uh,
but see,
this is the reality of,
um,

635
00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:39.830
of,
uh,
of bankruptcy.
Um,
so we are talking about,
uh,

636
00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.640
another revision of the bankruptcy bill,
uh,

637
00:45:42.690 --> 00:45:47.520
because we're in a serious crisis and maybe 2005 pulled back to much,

638
00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:51.420
we keep waffling about how tight we want these.
But ultimately,

639
00:45:51.421 --> 00:45:56.421
bankruptcy law is very important in risk management because this is big time

640
00:45:56.761 --> 00:46:00.500
risk management.
Uh,
and,
uh,

641
00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:03.060
it has to be adjusted to deal with moral hazard.

642
00:46:03.061 --> 00:46:05.970
And other thing I just wanted to mention right now,

643
00:46:05.971 --> 00:46:10.170
there's a bill being proposed by our own senator,
Chris Dodd,

644
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:15.230
uh,
here from Connecticut and Barney Frank,
uh,

645
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:19.560
which is not a bankruptcy bill.
It's a bill,
a bailout.

646
00:46:19.590 --> 00:46:21.870
They don't call it a bailout bill.
They say it's not a bail out,

647
00:46:21.871 --> 00:46:24.040
but I call it a bailout bill,
uh,

648
00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.990
to help people who can't pay their mortgages and they don't have to declare

649
00:46:27.991 --> 00:46:29.770
bankruptcy.
Uh,

650
00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:34.820
what they're wanting to do is to empower the federal housing administration to

651
00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:40.080
guarantee loans,
to work out loans and guaranteed him,

652
00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.660
uh,
so it's workout.

653
00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:47.640
And then an Fha guarantee loans.

654
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.470
So you don't have to declare a bank,
you just have to go,
uh,

655
00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.760
to your mortgage lender and say,
I can't pay,

656
00:46:56.761 --> 00:46:58.770
I'd like one of these FHA workouts.

657
00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:03.060
And then if this hasn't happened yet,
this is a bill.

658
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:08.110
But if this bill passes,
then they would be the,
they said,

659
00:47:08.111 --> 00:47:11.550
and maybe several hundred billion dollars of mortgages would be guaranteed.

660
00:47:11.551 --> 00:47:16.551
So here's the typical story might be you owe $300,000 on your house,

661
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:19.530
or maybe that's too big.
You are 100,000 on your house.

662
00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:22.890
They might lower that to 90,000,
uh,

663
00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:27.540
and give a different payment schedule.
And then,
uh,
the,
uh,

664
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:28.740
Fha,

665
00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:33.040
well tell the bank that if you do this well to the bank,

666
00:47:33.041 --> 00:47:37.300
if you make these adjustments,
we will guarantee the mortgage.
So this is another,

667
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:38.783
um,
that,

668
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:43.030
that is that the federal government will pay back the mortgage if the individual

669
00:47:43.031 --> 00:47:45.820
doesn't,
the government is getting into risk management,

670
00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:50.080
they're managing the risks to the mortgage lenders.
Uh,

671
00:47:51.370 --> 00:47:54.940
so,
uh,
in my,
uh,
are just mentioned,

672
00:47:54.941 --> 00:47:59.890
one of the ideas that my book sub prime solution,
uh,
I'm thinking that this,

673
00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.880
these things have happened in history.
So many times we've had bankruptcy bills,

674
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:06.850
we've had bailouts of one sort or another.
Uh,

675
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:09.430
they're very controversial because people say,

676
00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:13.090
luckily there's a moral hazard problem if we're bailing out homeowners who

677
00:48:13.091 --> 00:48:17.100
didn't pay their mortgage.
Isn't that a bad thing?
We're,
uh,
and,
and,

678
00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.510
and also we're doing it after the fact.
Uh,

679
00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.700
nobody explained this to the borrowers that they'd be getting this bailout.

680
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:26.380
So isn't that unfair to,
uh,

681
00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:31.060
maybe other people who didn't buy a house who are more,
you know,
more sensible?

682
00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:34.080
Uh,
so what,

683
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:38.560
what I am proposing and sub prime solution is that,
uh,

684
00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:43.720
we just have these bailouts are important and we have to make them work better.

685
00:48:44.410 --> 00:48:49.300
Uh,
and so I have something which I call a continuous workout mortgage,

686
00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:54.340
which we should move to.
Uh,
and,
uh,
this is,

687
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:59.500
uh,
my idea.
So I just mentioned one of the ideas in my book,

688
00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:03.690
the way Dodd Frank is proposing it,

689
00:49:03.691 --> 00:49:08.320
is that people who are in difficulty would have a single workout.

690
00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:09.630
It's just like a banquet.

691
00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:13.420
Bankruptcy is a single event occurs only once every eight years.

692
00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.280
So people who are in big trouble yet,
uh,
get help from the government,

693
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:23.650
but then it's a onetime only big event and it only every eight years.
So,

694
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:26.980
um,
why don't we do it continuously?
Uh,

695
00:49:26.981 --> 00:49:28.900
and so what we want to do is have a mortgage.

696
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:33.970
So the balance or the payments adjust automatically,

697
00:49:35.830 --> 00:49:39.430
uh,
for changes in home prices

698
00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.820
or incomes.
Uh,
and,

699
00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:50.920
and so,
um,
that would,
uh,
uh,

700
00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:55.630
uh,
that would make it a,
you get a workout every month.

701
00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.960
Uh,
now that sounds kind of radical and strange,

702
00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:01.270
but I don't see why we shouldn't do that.

703
00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:06.690
Especially if we can get markets for home prices and incomes so that the,

704
00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.550
uh,
the lenders can hedge the risk.

705
00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:14.860
I'm talking about private institutions offering mortgages that build in the kind

706
00:50:14.861 --> 00:50:19.120
of workouts that we're doing on an emergency basis from time to time.

707
00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.850
Once he recognized that workouts are needed,

708
00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:25.600
why don't we make it part of the structure and institution.
Anyway,

709
00:50:25.601 --> 00:50:29.390
that's just a little story.
What I'm doing in my book,

710
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:35.180
I said I would conclude this lecture with some thoughts and I have like 15

711
00:50:35.181 --> 00:50:38.870
minutes for thoughts about,
uh,
how about finance.
Um,

712
00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:44.540
and I wanted particularly to a aim at,
at,

713
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:48.530
uh,
people at your stage in the lifecycle,
young,

714
00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:53.510
younger people.
Um,
because,

715
00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.970
um,
as I said at the beginning,

716
00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.910
there's a,

717
00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:04.070
I think people at your age are rightly concerned about purpose in life.

718
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:09.100
You are launching out onto a whole lifetime career.

719
00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:12.850
And,
uh,
I don't know how you feel.
Uh,

720
00:51:12.851 --> 00:51:17.851
I'm just guessing that a lot of the things that you might be doing it seem

721
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:22.760
possibly meaningless or,
or at least not having enough meaning or purpose.

722
00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:26.960
Um,
and I think that's a good thing to worry about.

723
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:28.780
Most of the time you're taking a job,

724
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:32.870
you're taking a job to do some task that somebody wants done,

725
00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:38.030
and it may be hard to see how it figures into some global picture,
but,
um,

726
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:43.490
but people want to do some something.
That's good.
I wanted to come back,

727
00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.680
first of all to a theme that I mentioned in the,

728
00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:50.810
in the first lecture.
Uh,
and that was,

729
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:56.120
uh,
I think it's a remarkable book.
I,
I'll,
I'll put it on reserve.
Right.
I don't,

730
00:51:56.130 --> 00:52:00.080
I don't think I actually got it on reserve.
Yeah.
But,
um,

731
00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:06.350
uh,
Peter Unger is a philosopher and his mark is called living high.

732
00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:09.143
<v 1>Okay.</v>

733
00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:10.790
<v 0>And letting dye,</v>

734
00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:19.610
uh,
that was 1996.
Uh,
and what,

735
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:23.600
this is a book about what we do and our lives,
namely,

736
00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:28.390
that we tend to be wrapped up in ourselves,
right.
Um,

737
00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:30.760
does,
uh,

738
00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:34.610
in advanced countries like the U S we're living pretty well,

739
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:40.090
but in other places that people are starving or how are in desperate situations.

740
00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:46.140
One of the moral dilemmas that we seem to face is that,
um,

741
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:51.710
you could save lives anytime you want by just giving to one of the appropriate

742
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:55.400
charity.
So I'll write this down again,
this is on the first,
I'm repeating it.

743
00:52:55.401 --> 00:52:57.530
I said this in the first lecture,
but it's worth repeating.

744
00:52:57.980 --> 00:53:00.380
And the first page of his book,
uh,

745
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:04.670
he has done a address to mail,
but you wouldn't mail anymore.

746
00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:06.380
I'll put it down again.

747
00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:11.440
H t t p a slash slash w w w.

748
00:53:12.111 --> 00:53:12.944
Dot.

749
00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:18.010
UNICEF that com a.org.

750
00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.350
Sorry.
Or that's,
uh,

751
00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:25.160
the United Nations Children's Fund support

752
00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:31.590
a slash index dot.

753
00:53:31.591 --> 00:53:35.760
H T m e l,
a,
that's their website.

754
00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:38.640
And he is saying,
why don't you put this book down now,

755
00:53:38.641 --> 00:53:43.020
right now and send a check for $100 to UNICEF.

756
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:48.590
And he estimates that that will save 33 lives of children in the world.

757
00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:53.610
I actually got on the NSF website this morning to check this out.

758
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.730
They claim that they have 9.7 million,

759
00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:01.560
9.7 million children die every year for preventable causes,

760
00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:06.010
uh,
for things that are preventable through vaccinations and,
uh,

761
00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:10.380
improve water supply and the things that they do,

762
00:54:10.381 --> 00:54:14.970
but they don't have enough money to do.
The reason I write this down,
actually,

763
00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:17.910
I don't know what you would do it.
I was reading the book,
I was wondering,

764
00:54:17.911 --> 00:54:19.410
you know,
it's,
it's kind of a shock.

765
00:54:19.411 --> 00:54:24.411
They put this down and think I could save live by just a check for $100.

766
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:28.720
Uh,
and I didn't do it.
And so I thought,
you know,

767
00:54:28.721 --> 00:54:32.460
that really made an impression on me because I just continued to read the book

768
00:54:32.461 --> 00:54:34.230
and I never,
so finally when I rewrote it,

769
00:54:34.231 --> 00:54:37.800
the third time I got on the website and I contributed $100.

770
00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:42.120
So I,
but then I,
then I had this moral dilemma,

771
00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:47.240
why did I stop at a $100 because I can go way beyond $100 and have all these

772
00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:52.680
people are dying.
Why am I not doing that?
Uh,
and,
uh,

773
00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:58.890
and so you start to think of justifications and excuses that come to your mind.

774
00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:00.900
Uh,
and so,
uh,

775
00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:04.380
and maybe don't want to read this book because he shoots them all down,

776
00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:08.130
all these justifications.
Uh,
one of the,
um,

777
00:55:08.670 --> 00:55:13.500
one of the justifications is futility.
You say,

778
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:16.440
well,
these poor people in these less developed countries,

779
00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:19.950
you really can't help them anyway because,
uh,
uh,

780
00:55:20.490 --> 00:55:25.490
it'll all get lost or the population will increase and there'll be more dying

781
00:55:26.041 --> 00:55:30.410
people.
So anyway,
he dismisses that you have to read it.
Uh,

782
00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:31.920
it's,

783
00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:36.920
it's a rationalization that we don't spend too much money or too much time on.

784
00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:41.650
We don't dwell on,
but we assume that it's futile.
And so we ignore it.
Uh,

785
00:55:41.690 --> 00:55:44.710
another one is that it's very difficult,
uh,

786
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:49.830
to be a truly moral person.
I would have to give,
you know,
if,

787
00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:53.190
you know,
if I really thought about what was the terrible things were happening,

788
00:55:53.191 --> 00:55:57.980
I would,
I would have to give like 90% of my income,
uh,
and that,

789
00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:02.160
that's so,
uh,
definitely not going to do that.
So maybe I just won't do anything.

790
00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:05.730
And,
uh,
so,
uh,
people make,

791
00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:10.800
where he illustrates in this book is there's a lot of casual thinking that we

792
00:56:10.801 --> 00:56:14.670
use to justify,
uh,
to create an illusion of,

793
00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:19.530
he calls it an illusion of innocence that we feel that were innocent

794
00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:26.030
of any wrong doing for not supporting the poor.
Anyway,
this isn't a,

795
00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:27.490
this is an appeal for charity.

796
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:30.610
So maybe you will donate or you probably some of you have already done that,

797
00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:35.210
but I wanted you to because I think you're launching her.

798
00:56:35.211 --> 00:56:39.590
I'm careers and um,
there's something,
uh,

799
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:43.120
they seem to be moral dilemmas abound.

800
00:56:43.370 --> 00:56:46.570
[inaudible] I was impressed just looking at the New York Times this morning,

801
00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:51.970
the stories that suggested moral dilemmas for young people who are launching out

802
00:56:51.971 --> 00:56:55.180
on careers.
Uh,
one of them,

803
00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:58.480
I'm just there reporting on the Pennsylvania primary,

804
00:56:58.481 --> 00:57:03.130
which incidentally you heard Hillary Clinton won a 55 to 45.

805
00:57:03.550 --> 00:57:06.070
Um,
but that's not what I was referring to.

806
00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:11.380
It was that they said the voters thought the most important issue is the
economy,

807
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:14.210
the U s economy.
And I was thinking,
well,

808
00:57:14.211 --> 00:57:18.490
what about Iraq and what about all the people that we are responsible,

809
00:57:18.491 --> 00:57:23.470
we created the current situations there and people are dying everyday there.

810
00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:28.540
Uh,
and we're concerned about the ECON.
It seemed to be something.

811
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:34.050
Next thing and the news this morning,
Rupert Murdoch,
we'll be buying Newsday,

812
00:57:34.060 --> 00:57:39.060
the six largest regional paper in the United States for 580 million.

813
00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:42.970
Somehow,
you know,
there's something bothersome about that store.

814
00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:47.380
This guy is super rich.
Uh,
he's buying all the newspapers,

815
00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:52.660
uh,
getting this is,
I mean,
he's a finance person,
right?

816
00:57:52.661 --> 00:57:54.220
And he's gaining control over.

817
00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:59.710
People read these newspapers as part of their recreation and relaxation.

818
00:57:59.711 --> 00:58:01.720
And Newsday,
it's kind of a fun paper,

819
00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:07.220
but it's under control of this finance billionaire.
Uh,

820
00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.930
I don't know if that's a moral issue with next thing in today's paper,

821
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:16.150
US has 5% of the world's population and 25% of its prison inmates.

822
00:58:17.350 --> 00:58:20.300
So something is maybe wrong.

823
00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:23.150
And another thing that was in today's paper,
uh,

824
00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:28.680
South African dock workers refused to unload a Chinese ship with weapons bound

825
00:58:29.921 --> 00:58:34.030
for Robert Mugabe's re regime in Zimbabwe.
Uh,

826
00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:38.620
and that the Chinese ship may return to China and without delivering,

827
00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:43.780
uh,
this name,
well,
who are the dock workers?
This,
this is not funny.

828
00:58:43.870 --> 00:58:45.340
This is not Rupert Murdoch.

829
00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:50.370
This is humble people loading the docs and they have a union and they said,

830
00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:53.730
we're not going to do this.
Uh,
we're not gonna support.

831
00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:58.300
And Mugabi is a brutal efforts to suppress a,
a free election in his,

832
00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:03.310
so you start to wonder,
are finance people moral or are they,
uh,

833
00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:09.060
uh,
so,
um,
I,

834
00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:12.550
I just give some,
I think that,
uh,
I don't know how you think,

835
00:59:12.551 --> 00:59:13.660
but when I was your age,

836
00:59:13.661 --> 00:59:18.430
I somehow wanted it perfect career that was morally right and,
uh,

837
00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:22.850
important.
Uh,
so who has a perfect career?

838
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:26.000
I don't know.
I,
if I don't have an answer to that,

839
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:27.170
they're not going to propose an answer,

840
00:59:27.171 --> 00:59:32.060
but let me just consider some names that come to mind.
Bill Gates.
Okay.

841
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:37.840
Now he is a business person who runs a tight financial ship and you may be aware

842
00:59:38.271 --> 00:59:42.440
of how tight it is when you try to pirate one of his program or something.

843
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:47.300
And so he has a reputation for being a tough guy.

844
00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:49.760
On the other hand,

845
00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:54.240
he and Warren Buffet have set up the biggest,
uh,

846
00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:59.740
transparently operated charitable foundation in the world and it has 38 point $7

847
01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:04.790
billion.
So,
um,
how should we view,

848
01:00:04.820 --> 01:00:09.650
I wonder how Peter Unger would view Bill Gates?
Uh,
he does have a,

849
01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:12.740
uh,
what he's done on his house,
35 million on his house.

850
01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:16.820
He does live a high style,
but you know,

851
01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:20.840
should he have started out giving away 90% of his income when he was your age?

852
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:25.820
He wouldn't be making any money if he did that.
Right.
So I'm just thinking about,

853
01:00:25.950 --> 01:00:28.190
uh,
I'm not saying what's right or wrong,

854
01:00:28.191 --> 01:00:32.000
but I wanted to give one other example that comes to mind.

855
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:36.310
Have you heard of this guy?
Uh,
I'm trying to spell this right,

856
01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:41.150
Mohammad Yunus.

857
01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:46.790
Um,
he,
um,
was,
uh,

858
01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:52.720
he went to Vanderbilt University and got a phd in economics in 1969.

859
01:00:56.770 --> 01:00:57.050
Uh,

860
01:00:57.050 --> 01:01:02.050
and then he became assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State

861
01:01:03.081 --> 01:01:08.000
University.
Um,
it sounds like a very ordinary career so far,
and it's actually,

862
01:01:08.001 --> 01:01:11.420
it's good getting a phd,
but ordinary in a way.

863
01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:16.220
But then he did something very important.
Uh,
in 1976,

864
01:01:16.221 --> 01:01:19.970
he went back to his home country,
which was Bangladesh,

865
01:01:19.971 --> 01:01:21.770
one of the poorest countries of the world.

866
01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:26.870
And he founded a bank called the Grameen Bank.

867
01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.250
Uh,
does anyone speak Bengali here?

868
01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:34.370
But what does grand mean mean

869
01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.700
there's no Bengali here?
Well,
I'm told that means,
uh,
of the village.

870
01:01:41.330 --> 01:01:46.250
Uh,
and uh,
what he did is create a bank that made loans to poor people,

871
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:51.070
uh,
called micro finance.
Uh,
and,
um,

872
01:01:53.780 --> 01:01:58.640
so the typical loan was made to a young woman who,
uh,

873
01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:03.760
was on a desperate poverty and alone would be enough to buy some small item that

874
01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:06.200
would start a business.
For example,

875
01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:11.620
a pushcart that could serve hot food so she could then go and stand on a street

876
01:02:11.871 --> 01:02:16.060
corner and sell some kind of food.
Uh,
and,
uh,

877
01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:20.920
that can be a huge difference.
Having the money to buy a food cart,
uh,

878
01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:24.920
and make her able to support her family.
Uh,

879
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:29.610
but no banks would,
no banks before,
uh,
the Grameen Bank would,

880
01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:33.750
would,
uh,
would do that sort of thing.

881
01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:36.510
And they claimed that they couldn't make money doing it,

882
01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:38.850
but he apparently succeeded.

883
01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:44.540
And so he wanted to know bell actually the Nobel peace prize went both to units

884
01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.580
and the Grameen Bank,
uh,
and a couple of years ago.

885
01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:53.450
So those are examples of people who had kind of a finance see careers.

886
01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:59.280
If you looked at,
uh,
Muhammad Yunus,
uh,
in earlier years,

887
01:02:59.281 --> 01:03:04.281
it might not look like a very morally Peter owner type moral career.

888
01:03:04.860 --> 01:03:08.970
But I don't know what Peter Unger would say about Muhammad Yunus now.
He never,

889
01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:13.710
we don't ever have any sense that he gave away 90% of his income to poor people,

890
01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:18.150
but we'll look what he did.
So,
uh,
I don't know the answer to.

891
01:03:18.310 --> 01:03:22.410
I guess what I'm getting at is that I don't know the answer to these moral

892
01:03:22.411 --> 01:03:25.560
questions,
but I think that it's kind of a mistake to,
um,

893
01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:31.360
to think that a career in finance is necessarily immoral and a,

894
01:03:32.771 --> 01:03:33.990
if you read Peter Unger,

895
01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:38.850
you get the impression that just about everyone is evading the moral issues.

896
01:03:39.850 --> 01:03:44.490
Um,
maybe we're incapable of really behaving the way logic,

897
01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:48.750
logical consideration of ethics would impel us to do.

898
01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:53.880
Uh,
so hardly anyone is giving away 90% of their income.

899
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:57.720
Uh,
so,
uh,

900
01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:04.320
uh,
so I don't know where that leaves us exactly,
but,
um,

901
01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:05.880
I guess,
uh,

902
01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:10.880
what I wanted to do is leave open the possibility that a career in something

903
01:04:11.431 --> 01:04:15.570
related to risk management can be a very meaningful,

904
01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:19.060
uh,
career path for life.
Uh,

905
01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:23.910
and I guess it comes back to the feeling that,

906
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:25.543
uh,

907
01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.920
we live in a very risky world whose benefits are at this point shared very

908
01:04:31.681 --> 01:04:36.200
unequally.
And,
uh,
I think that,
uh,

909
01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:40.230
it's not the simple idea that you should be writing checks to.

910
01:04:40.231 --> 01:04:45.231
UNICEF is not necessarily the final answer about what you should be doing with

911
01:04:46.951 --> 01:04:51.560
your life.
And,
um,
uh,
somehow,
uh,

912
01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:56.190
what we see in these examples,
I've gave both of Bill Gates,
Muhammad Yunus,

913
01:04:56.600 --> 01:05:00.970
uh,
and,
and not setting them up as necessarily examples,
but,
uh,
uh,

914
01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:07.050
but it's that a career that develops some idea,
uh,

915
01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:12.070
that's well motivated,
uh,
can be,
uh,
uh,

916
01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:16.320
a source of great meaning and purpose in life.
Um,

917
01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:20.880
but what these people do is it seems to me as a,
um,
they,

918
01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:25.270
they'd develop a career with some ultimate objective and somewhere along the

919
01:05:25.271 --> 01:05:30.271
career it may seem that they're doing something unimportant or selfish.

920
01:05:31.590 --> 01:05:35.620
Um,
but you have to judge it in the big context.

921
01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:39.780
So at times I felt annoyed with Bill Gates when I had to pay for,

922
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:45.340
when I bought my second laptop and I had to buy a windows again.

923
01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:48.780
<v 2>Uh,
but,
uh,
uh,</v>

924
01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.340
<v 0>I think that,
uh,</v>

925
01:05:52.090 --> 01:05:56.250
<v 2>uh,
uh,</v>

926
01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:02.680
<v 0>what,
what,
what were you really have to do is try to think of how,
how,
um,</v>

927
01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:08.290
I guess one's moral imperative might be one view is it might be that you should

928
01:06:08.291 --> 01:06:13.291
develop some kind of human capital and some kind of long run plan for how you

929
01:06:13.641 --> 01:06:17.410
are going to apply your human capital.
Uh,

930
01:06:17.411 --> 01:06:21.370
and it doesn't necessarily mean being,
um,

931
01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:26.920
uh,
satisfying this demands of UNICEF along the way.

932
01:06:26.921 --> 01:06:29.440
We are people and we have a certain psychology,

933
01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:33.580
I think we can get above her psychology to some extent.
Uh,

934
01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:38.780
and you get above the drives of our psychology in moments of inspiration.

935
01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:44.750
And I think developing a career,
uh,
can,

936
01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:49.490
can be part of that anywhere.
I,
I've,
uh,

937
01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:54.700
that was my inspiration inclusion now to this.
Uh,

938
01:06:54.701 --> 01:06:59.680
and so I dunno what careers you will go into,
but,
um,
uh,
in the meantime,

939
01:06:59.681 --> 01:07:03.650
we do have,
uh,
two more lectures.
Uh,

940
01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:07.540
and I doubt that Larry Summers we'll be giving you advice about your careers,

941
01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:09.070
but,
uh,
uh,

942
01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:14.700
so I hope to see you again on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week.

943
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:18.710
<v 1>[inaudible].</v>
